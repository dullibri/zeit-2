HEADLINE: Equity Firm in Spotlight Is Said to Win a Confidence Vote

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
The private investment firm co-founded by Steven Rattner, the Treasury official leading the White House's efforts to revamp the auto industry, has won a vote of confidence among its investors, according to a person briefed on the matter, relieving some of the pressure on the firm. 
 Investors in the firm, the Quadrangle Group, could have tried to cancel their future payments to it and block it from making new bets. The vote, which ended Friday, was set off by Mr. Rattner's departure in February, when he took the Treasury post. 
 It is a tense time for Quadrangle, a division of which manages the fortune of New York's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg. It is one of the most well-known firms now embroiled in an investigation by the New York attorney general into investments made by the New York State pension fund.
 Mr. Rattner was personally involved in discussions with officials at several pension funds that had invested in Quadrangle. State and federal authorities contend that he hired a firm that had been run by Hank Morris, a now-indicted associate of New York's former comptroller, to help gain business in New York.
 While the New York pension fund accounted for just 5 percent of the money in one of Quadrangle's funds, the state's prestige helped Mr. Rattner attract other big investors. Hiring placement advisers like Mr. Morris can be legal but can also raise ethical questions. 
 In addition, a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint related to the matter says that a company owned by one of Quadrangle's funds agreed to a movie distribution deal that benefited a state official, David Loglisci, who has also been indicted.
 Neither Mr. Rattner nor Quadrangle has been charged with wrongdoing, but both remain under investigation.
 At stake in the vote over Quadrangle's future was the firm's ability to use about $200 million for new investments. Private equity investors typically commit to finance investments in the future, but when an executive like Mr. Rattner departs, there are often clauses that allow them to try to back out.
 Had Quadrangle lost the vote, its fees could have been reduced sharply. A losing vote also would have signaled an erosion of investor confidence, which could have made it hard for the firm to raise more money. 
 New York City's comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., said in a statement on Friday that three pension funds in the city would vote to cut off Quadrangle. But individual investors were not allowed to pull their money on their own. A majority of the fund's investors, weighted by the size of their investment, had to vote against Quadrangle for any change to be made.
 Other pension investors in Quadrangle include Calpers, the big California pension fund; Calstrs, the state's retirement fund for teachers; and New Jersey's pension fund. It is not known how they voted.
 Quadrangle's funds have suffered during the economic downturn but not as much as some other private equity funds. Mr. Rattner is still a substantial investor in the funds, though he is no longer involved in its operations. Mr. Rattner worked as a reporter for The New York Times before he went into investment banking in the 1980s.

HEADLINE: Detroit Would Prefer Any Auto Bankruptcy To Be Handled Locally

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER and MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Detroit, which could lose an automaker to bankruptcy, hopes to console itself with a big piece of the legal action.
 The bankruptcy court in the Motor City is making itself as attractive as possible should General Motors or Chrysler file for Chapter 11 protection, and it appears to be in the running. 
 At stake may be crucial decisions on how employees and others will fare in a restructuring. And the depressed Michigan economy could also benefit from all the hotel and restaurant revenue brought in by out-of-town lawyers, researchers, journalists and their support teams. 
 The established forums for big corporate cases are in Delaware, where many businesses are incorporated, and New York. The two locations have been home to six of the 10 biggest bankruptcy filings, including Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, WorldCom and Enron, according to BankruptcyData.com.
 By contrast, Detroit's biggest bankruptcy case was by a 1994 filing by F&M Distributors, a retailer with $328 million in assets, a few zeroes shy of the assets held by General Motors. 
 Big companies in Detroit have mostly opted to part with their hometown. When the Delphi Corporation, an auto parts supplier once part of G.M., filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005, it went to New York. The Kmart Corporation took its bankruptcy hearing to Chicago in 2002.
 With the Treasury Department directing Chrysler to prepare to file for bankruptcy protection as early as this week as part of a deal to sell assets to Fiat, and with G.M. operating under a June 1 deadline to come up with a viable plan or file bankruptcy itself, location choices could be made quickly.
 Detroit's six bankruptcy judges have adopted a rule that could appeal to both the automakers' management and the Obama administration. They will allow the chief bankruptcy judge to pick who will oversee a giant corporate filing, rather than leaving the selection to chance.
 Last week, Michigan's attorney general sent G.M. a letter urging it not to go out of state.
 ''I am gravely concerned about the impact of any bankruptcy filing in a jurisdiction outside Michigan,'' Mike Cox, the attorney general, wrote in a letter to G.M.'s chief executive. Because the company's headquarters, many of its plants and hundreds of thousands of current and former employees are in Michigan, Mr. Cox continued, ''any potential bankruptcy filing outside the state of Michigan seems bizarre.'' 
 The choice of courthouse can have serious implications for interested parties, said David A. Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
 The law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and judges in some places may be more or less sympathetic to the bankrupt company, its creditors, its employees and other affected groups. By deciding in December that the chief judge could pick who would hear a G.M. case -- or a Chrysler case, for that matter, or any other ''very large, complex case of national significance'' -- Detroit's six judges created the opportunity for the selection of a specific judge with particular views. Previously, cases were assigned at random. 
 Given the likely controversy over any G.M. reorganization plan, bondholders and other creditors may be worried about the prospect of facing a judge chosen because he is friendly to the company and the administration instead of their interests.
 Professor Skeel said that the Third Circuit, which includes Delaware, had an established court opinion that makes it harder to redo a collective bargaining agreement, a likely sticking point in a G.M. case. 
 ''That makes Delaware a little less attractive'' to the company, Professor Skeel said. 
 On the other hand, he said, the Detroit court is a bit of a ''wild card,'' having given few signals in substantial cases there of how it would resolve complex issues.
 Judges in any jurisdiction would want a crack at overseeing a G.M. reorganization, said Douglas G. Baird, a law professor at the University of Chicago. ''It's like climbing Mount Everest,'' he said, of the sense of accomplishment that could come from all the hard work.
 G.M. is not tipping its hand. Greg Martin, a company spokesman, responded to the letter from the Michigan attorney general by saying that the company remained focused on restructuring outside of bankruptcy. 
 ''However, if GM is not able to complete the actions required, it will have no other alternative than to pursue an in-court restructuring, and we would be prepared to do so,'' Mr. Martin said in an e-mail message. ''The filing location would be just one of many factors we would need to take into account.'' 
 Still, courthouse clerks in Detroit are buzzing, and security guards are bracing themselves.
 In a meeting this month, clerks throughout the Detroit federal court system were told there was no indication whether or when G.M. might file its case in Detroit, according to a clerk who attended but declined to give her name. They were also told that the court would probably get several days' notice that a filing was imminent. 
 Even if they cancel later, companies make an appointment to drop off boxes of legal documents in a major bankruptcy case. 
 There would be practical challenges to a filing in Detroit. For one thing, there is not a lot of space. The federal bankruptcy court is housed in a 27-story office building at 211 West Fort Street, across from the federal courthouse that also is home to a branch of the federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 The bankruptcy court rooms, on its upper floors, have floor to ceiling windows with sweeping views of downtown Detroit, the Detroit River and Windsor, Ontario, beyond. The courtrooms have adjacent work rooms for use by lawyers -- but probably not enough to handle the hordes that would want them for the nation's largest bankruptcy filing.

HEADLINE: 100 DAYS: An Indiana Town Appreciates Obama, And That Stimulus Cash, Too

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Kitty Bennett contributed research, and Ben Werschkul contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ANDERSON, Ind. 

 BODY:
At the city parks office, Pam Clendenen thumbed through a three-inch-thick printout of President Obama's economic stimulus plan to see if the money could be used to replace dilapidated playground equipment.
 In his office at a cramped medical center across town, Anthony Malone called his accountant with a question: Has the government pledge of $198,420 arrived in the clinic's bank account yet?
At an office park near the Interstate, where engineers are designing a van to get 100 miles per gallon, Charles Staley has grown frustrated in his quest to find which division of what federal agency handles the stimulus money that could help create environment-friendly jobs, just as Mr. Obama has proposed.
 As Mr. Obama's presidency approaches 100 days, an arbitrary but inescapable milestone for first assessments, he is touching Americans' lives in concrete ways. In the process, he is producing what polls suggest is an improving, if still wary, sense of national optimism despite persistent economic and national security challenges. 
 The flood of federal money Mr. Obama has sent coursing through the economy offers a chance to begin addressing deeply rooted problems in cities like this one, a once-proud automaking center that is a study in deindustrialization. At the same time, the president and his party have the opportunity to build a political consensus around a more activist, effective government.
 But those opportunities, and the high hopes raised by Mr. Obama's fast start, carry the risks of promises unkept. Should his ambitious agenda for the economy, health care, education and energy fail to improve people's lives -- and leave behind crippling budget deficits rather than new jobs -- he and his party could face substantial repercussions. 
 The possibilities and the pitfalls early in the Obama era are playing out in this city of 57,000 an hour's drive northeast of Indianapolis, a place that has lived for decades with an undercurrent of anxiety about the decline of the automobile industry. 
 A year ago on Sunday, Mr. Obama came to Anderson locked in a battle for the Democratic nomination. He faced questions about race, patriotism and whether he had sufficient experience to be president. His subsequent primary loss here to Hillary Rodham Clinton by 12 percentage points -- and in Indiana by 2 percentage points -- prompted the city's newspaper to editorialize that he could lose in the fall. 
 A general election, an economic crisis and other challenges later, those concerns from the primary seem distant to residents here, who say they have grown comfortable seeing him in office. Viewed through the eyes of most of more than three dozen residents interviewed this month, Mr. Obama is off to a strong start. 
 He ultimately carried Indiana last fall -- the first Democratic presidential candidate to do so in 44 years -- in part because of his showing in Anderson and other cities with deteriorated economic fortunes. And Anderson, while still dotted with foreclosure signs and quiet factories, is registering progress, if in small increments.
 Thanks to the stimulus plan, a part-time dentist and three other health workers will soon arrive at the health center that sits along Ohio Avenue in the shadows of closed plants. The building, where patients squeeze into in a few examination rooms, will expand to house nearly triple the work force of 35 if a federal grant of $450,000 arrives.
 ''As far as I'm concerned, I'm saying, Thank God,'' said Mr. Malone, president of the Madison County Community Health Center, which like other offices here is troubled by budget shortfalls. ''Yes, stimulus money makes a difference. It's created a new sense of hope in this community.''
 The sentiment is echoed in the offices of the Parks and Recreation Department, where an ''Asbestos'' sign warns visitors to avoid part of the building. For weeks, officials have been preparing a grant application through the stimulus plan to convert the closed North Anderson Elementary School to a community center. The mayor authorized the spending of $6,000 to help prepare the application, despite layoffs by the city and budget cuts that threaten the annual veterans concert before July 4.
 ''Some people probably think Anderson won't ever see any of that money, but I know different,'' said Ms. Clendenen, the administrator overseeing the parks department. She already plans to put a plaque on the building thanking Mr. Obama for making it possible. ''We felt like he was talking about Anderson.''
 Democrats exuded excitement at the accomplishments of the first three months of Mr. Obama's presidency, even though some supporters said they were bothered by how he had filled his cabinet, specifically by the trouble with nominees and their taxes. 
 This region still has a strong conservative streak. It is represented in Congress by Representative Mike Pence, a Republican and outspoken advocate of smaller government and lower taxes, positions that put him at the opposite end of the spectrum from Mr. Obama. Several Republicans here said the furious pace of spending would complicate Mr. Obama's re-election efforts.
 ''If he continues on this course, he'll have no chance to win Indiana,'' said David Abernathy, 58, who works at a credit union in Muncie. 
 Last year, Mr. Obama visited Indiana nearly 50 times before Election Day. Even many Democrats believe that his victory could be attributed more to a superior organization than full-fledged support of his agenda.
 Elizabeth Daugherty, a 43-year-old Republican, did not vote for Mr. Obama. But after he won the election, Ms. Daugherty was ready to support him. Then she turned against him again, even before he took office.
 ''I was completely on board, and he was my president,'' said Ms. Daugherty, a homemaker from nearby Pendleton. ''His cabinet choice was sort of Tammany Hall-Chicago style. He had spoken about transparency and change and hope, but then he's filling his cabinet with his old cronies.''
 Voters in both parties said they liked Mr. Obama's calm handling of almost everything, including the economy and the confrontation with pirates off the coast of Somalia.
 ''I've been very impressed with President Obama, more so than any other president, outside of Roosevelt, of course,'' said Martha Carmichael, 86, a Democrat. ''He's concerned about the average citizen, and he's very sincere. If I find out that he isn't, I'll be very disappointed.'' 
 Mrs. Carmichael did not always have such positive feelings, considering she was an ardent supporter of Mrs. Clinton. Her evolution, which took place over a few weeks, is similar to how many voters said they had overcome suspicions and concerns about Mr. Obama in this city, which has a history of racial tensions.
 ''Quite frankly, I didn't think I was going to like him,'' Mrs. Carmichael said in an interview after lunch at the Shriner's Club. ''I thought he had a weird name. You could hardly pronounce it, how could you vote for him? Now, I'm more impressed every day I see him.''
 A drive through Anderson brings to life some of the complex challenges that Mr. Obama inherited, notably the final shift to a service-based economy. A casino with a flashing neon advertisement, ''Easy Come, Easy Dough,'' sits near a Starbucks and a string of other chain stores, while less than a mile away is a desolate patch once so busy with General Motors workers that plants staggered schedules to keep traffic moving. 
 These problems are far bigger thanone president, particularly because Anderson has been in economic decline since Mr. Obama was a teenager. Its history can be glimpsed in symbols of the past that remain open, like the Lemon Drop Drive In and Gene's Root Beer.
 Mr. Staley, the chief executive of the Flagship Enterprise Center, where the hybrid vans are being designed, said he had been discouraged by the bureaucracy around applying for stimulus money. He said the environment-friendly vehicle ''is certainly what we hear the president saying.'' 
 ''Finding the area within the federal government where that best fits can be frustrating,'' Mr. Staley said last week when the vehicle made its debut on Capitol Hill. 
 During Mr. Obama's visit to Anderson last year, he asked voters to take a chance on his candidacy and believe that a new leader could shake the country from its stagnancy. Ultimately they did, with Mr. Obama winning by 7 percentage points over Senator John McCain in a county George W. Bush won by 20 points in 2004.
 Tiffany Dzerve, 25, was selected to introduce Mr. Obama to more than 1,000 people who turned out to see him on that Saturday afternoon. Ms. Dzerve had recently lost her job at Delphi, which made auto parts, and was volunteering for his campaign. Her story provided a narrative for his candidacy, a pitch to retrain workers, create jobs and overhaul the nation's health care system.
 A year later, she is a student at Ivy Technical College, working on an associate's degree to become a teacher. Her husband, who lost his job at the same plant, still looks for work. Both collect unemployment and were grateful to Mr. Obama when their weekly checks suddenly contained an extra $25 each.
 ''I don't know how much he had to do with it, but it helps us,'' Ms. Dzerve said, sitting in her backyard as her husband, Chad, played nearby with their two young children. ''I know it's only $50, but that's a lot today, for an unemployed family.'' 
 Last year, she knocked on doors and made telephone calls for Mr. Obama. As a surprise for her husband, she secured inauguration tickets from a local Democratic officeholder. They rented a car, drove to Washington and watched from a few hundred feet away as Mr. Obama took his oath of office.
 These days, Ms. Dzerve follows the president only briefly on television. She said she had grown tired of the hype about his family's getting a dog, but she liked how he played with children at the annual Easter egg roll outside the White House. She said she worried that the problems facing the country were too big for him to solve.
 ''It's going to be a rough road ahead; he's doing what he can,'' she said, tempering her enthusiasm even as she wore a blue shirt with the president's image on the front. ''I don't think he's going to come in and make miracles happen, that's for sure.''

LOS ANGELES -- After months of discussion and rumors, two of the entertainment industry's largest talent agencies, William Morris and Endeavor, agreed on Monday to merge as William Morris Endeavor Entertainment.
Hollywood is scrambling to shore up traditional movie, television and music businesses that are struggling with a digital revolution, while reaching for a grip on forms of entertainment that are still taking shape.
The merger ends a period of relative stability among the major agencies, raising the possibility of new combinations and a stronger thrust by talent representatives into fresh lines of business involving finance, digital distribution or corporate alliances. 
But the more immediate question may be whether the new company is really poised to become a powerhouse, or if this is the just the start of another Hollywood power struggle.
The combination was announced in a brief statement after votes by each company's board on Monday. State and federal regulatory approvals are required before the merger can become final.
WME Entertainment -- the shortened name is inevitable -- will rank in size and scope with the Creative Artists Agency, recognized for decades as a leader in the rough-and-tumble world of show business representation. It will have more than 300 agents, representing clients in film, television, music, books, commercials and corporate branding.
In the near term, the new agency must deal with the layoff of hundreds of agents and supporting staff, a restructured management and the attention of competitors hungry to pick off prime agents and clients.
James A. Wiatt, who was chief executive of Morris, is to be chairman of the new company. Ariel Z. Emanuel, who was the dominant partner at Endeavor, but held no title, will have substantial authority in the new company. He was named a co-chief executive, along with Patrick Whitesell, from Endeavor, and David Wirtschafter, from William Morris.
For years, virtually every significant Hollywood agency has explored possible mergers with competitors as companies looked for growth and new horizons at a time when core movie and television businesses have been constrained by digital inroads and cost cutbacks.
Past merger proposals foundered as principals clashed over ego, control and internal economics. But Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Wiatt persisted in talks that began last year -- each driven by a sense that his own company could overcome some obvious limitations when matched with the other.
''I would expect to see more of it,'' Thomas P. Pollock, a partner in the Montecito Picture Company, said of the merger and other signs of entertainment industry consolidation.
''The business is shrinking a little bit. That's not to say it's not profitable, but it's evolving and changing,'' said Mr. Pollock, a former chairman of Universal Pictures.
William Morris, formed in 1898, has been particularly strong in music, has a deeply entrenched book business and represents clients in the commercials business. Its star clients include the performer and music entrepreneur Kanye West, the filmmaker and television producer J. J. Abrams and the toymaker Hasbro, which has a stake in films based on the Transformers and other toy lines.
Endeavor, just 14 years old, has been much stronger in film and scripted television, but had little hope of challenging Creative Artists without added financing and resources. Its roster of stars includes Adam Sandler, Matt Damon, Tyra Banks and Ben Stiller.
The merger could prove a boon to competitors like the United Talent Agency, International Creative Management, Paradigm and the Gersh Agency, all of which have pockets of strength, and have spent the last few months sizing up the agents and clients who might fall away from a combined William Morris and Endeavor.
''I think it changes our world in a great way,'' said Jeremy Zimmer, a partner at United Talent. ''It makes us the clear alternative in a much smaller agency environment.''
Through the weekend, many agents at both William Morris and Endeavor were fretting about who might make the cut or where they might fit into the new venture. Mr. Emanuel, whose brother Rahm is the White House chief of staff, told agents who flocked to his office that the weak economy was a major impetus to consolidation.
The atmosphere was also tense at William Morris, where more than a dozen members of the agency's large board found they would not have a place on a new nine-member board -- which will include four from Endeavor and five from William Morris.
The politicking is not likely to end with the vote. Agents must now establish an informal pecking order within a new organization that will have neither the cohesiveness of Endeavor, which took pride in its somewhat communal culture, nor the long traditions of William Morris.
One of the first to say he would not be joining the new operation was Tom Strickler, a founding partner at Endeavor who was known internally as a keeper of the corporate culture. Mr. Strickler fostered a familial sense at the agency by overseeing rituals that accompanied promotions, and spreading elaborate gifts among the staff at his own expense.
Before Monday's vote, Mr. Strickler informed co-workers by e-mail that he would not be coming along for the ride. ''I've wanted to get on to the next chapter of my life for while,'' Mr. Strickler said, speaking by phone on Monday. He said he did not have a next job lined up.
At William Morris, another prominent agent, David Lonner, said he was told by Mr. Wiatt and Mr. Emanuel that he would not be part of WME Entertainment, according to a report on the Variety Web site.
Mr. Lonner did not respond to a call seeking comment. He has shared representation of Mr. Abrams -- whose film ''Star Trek'' is set for release May 7 -- with John Fogelman, who is in charge of the William Morris feature film department, and will have a place on the new board.
Spokesmen for Morris and Endeavor declined to discuss the departures.

HEADLINE: Fund Government With Dirty Money

BYLINE: By CHARLES A. INTRIAGO and ROBERT A. BUTTERWORTH. 
Charles A. Intriago, a former federal prosecutor, publishes a Web site for law enforcement officials about asset forfeiture. Robert A. Butterworth, a former attorney general of Florida, is a lawyer.

 BODY:
FEDERAL prosecutors last week persuaded a judge to stop a group of Bernard L. Madoff's victims from using an involuntary bankruptcy filing to claim more than $100 million of his personal assets. The prosecutors' argument was simple: preserving Mr. Madoff's assets for eventual forfeiture to the government is the best way to ensure as much money as possible is returned to the victims of his Ponzi scheme in an equitable manner.
Most people would assume that this is business as usual, that the government routinely seizes the assets of criminals and returns them to victims. After all, criminals should not have ill-gotten houses, cars and yachts waiting for them when they finish their sentences. But the reality is that the government's focus on seizing Mr. Madoff's assets for restitution is unusual. Lawbreakers are rarely forced to give up the proceeds of their crimes. 
To take just one example: Between stints in prison over the past decade, John A. Gotti, the former Gambino crime family boss, was able to return to his luxurious house in Oyster Bay Cove, on Long Island, where the median house value in 2007 was more than $2 million. Does anyone believe the money that Mr. Gotti bought it with was legitimately earned?
Every year in the United States, criminals amass hundreds of billions of dollars in cash and goods from illegal activities -- mortgage fraud, extortion, embezzlement, illegal gambling, bank fraud, public corruption, human trafficking, identity theft, securities violations, insurance fraud, intellectual property piracy and bankruptcy fraud -- though it's impossible to gauge the total take precisely. Drug trafficking alone brings in an estimated $18 billion to $64 billion a year, while estimates of Medicare fraud earnings are $35 billion to more than $70 billion a year. The part of that loot that is seized by federal, state and local governments amounts to a few billion dollars at most. Here again, it is difficult to assess the exact value because so many different government entities are involved in collecting it, and no one agency adds it all up.
Even when criminals are behind bars, their profits gather interest in bank and securities accounts, or are held in real estate, cars, aircraft, yachts, art, jewelry, racehorses and countless other assets. If they were routinely seized, it would bring in tens of billions to compensate victims or finance law enforcement, break the backs of criminal organizations and deter future crimes.
The problem is not that the government lacks the authority to confiscate criminal assets. The very first Congress, in 1789, authorized the federal government to seize criminal assets -- as a way of taking illegal goods away from smugglers. Today, some 200 federal criminal and drug control laws include provisions for asset forfeiture. And the 50 states and the District of Columbia all have forfeiture provisions of their own.
The problem is that governments -- national, state and local -- fail to exercise this power fully. Eric Holder, the attorney general, has already expressed his support for doing so. Back in 1999, when he was the deputy attorney general, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee, ''From telemarketing to terrorism to counterfeiting to violation of the food and drug laws, the remedy of asset forfeiture should be applied.''
Now Mr. Holder is in a position to order that all federal law enforcement agents and prosecutors be trained to pursue the financial aspects of every case from the start, with an eye toward forfeiture of the criminal's assets. Modern asset forfeiture laws rest on the notion that it is not enough to incarcerate people involved in criminal activity. Equal attention must be given to attacking and dismantling the economic base of the criminal organization.
For this to happen, the Department of Justice has to overcome a culture in which prosecutors focus on the arrest and conviction of individuals to the exclusion of the broader targets, entire criminal organizations.
Congress must also close a gaping hole in the victim restitution laws, which provide no authority for the pretrial restraint of assets of those accused of orchestrating frauds. Too often, dirty money simply disappears into shell companies and impenetrable offshore havens before the trial even begins.
But upon a showing that fraud was probably committed, a prosecutor should be authorized to restrain all of the suspect's assets; the question of who gets them would be resolved after the criminal justice system has finished its work. The British already do not differentiate between asset forfeiture and restitution. They merge the two concepts and call it asset recovery. We should borrow a page from them.
The Justice Department must also make sure that its state and local counterparts in law enforcement get the training and resources to manage asset forfeitures of their own.
For too long government has been unwilling to take back the wealth that criminals have stolen from taxpayers. We can no longer afford to ignore the opportunities offered by our under-enforced asset forfeiture laws.

HEADLINE: Preservation Group Lists Most Endangered Places

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When composing a list of the country's buildings that are most worth saving, the hangar for the Enola Gay at Wendover Airfield in Utah might not come immediately to mind.
But when the National Trust for Historic Preservation assembles its annual roster of America's most endangered historic places, it looks for more than aesthetic distinction. Each year the trust selects what it considers important examples of the nation's architectural, cultural and natural heritage that are at risk of being destroyed or irreparably damaged.
So when the trust unveils its 2009 sites on Tuesday, the hangar will be among them. It housed the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped the world's first atomic bomb used in war, on Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945, and is in critical disrepair. Other similarly less-than-glamorous locations on the list are Memorial Bridge, which for more than 85 years has connected the coastal towns of Portsmouth, N.H., and Kittery, Maine, and is now in danger of removal, and the Human Services Center in Yankton, S.D. Founded in 1879 as the South Dakota Hospital for the Insane, the institution's collection of neo-Classical, Art Deco and Italianate buildings have long stood vacant, and the state plans to tear down 11 of them. 
''Buildings like that can be adaptively reused for new community purposes,'' said Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. ''It's a mistake to allow structures to fall into disrepair or to be demolished.''
The current economic downturn is a mixed blessing for endangered buildings, Mr. Moe said. Although more buildings are being neglected, fewer are threatened with demolition because development has slowed. In 22 years the trust has selected 211 sites worth saving and lost just 6 of them.
''It focuses not only local attention but national,'' Mr. Moe said of the list, ''and helps to mobilize both human and financial resources.''
The 2009 roster of buildings, 11 in all, includes Frank Lloyd Wright's Unity Temple in Oak Park, Ill., a Cubist structure made of poured concrete that has been plagued by structural problems and a lack of money for restoration. Mount Taylor in New Mexico, another trust selection, is a sacred site for American Indian tribes whose cultural and archaeological resources are threatened by uranium mining.
This year the trust made a point of highlighting the threat to Modernist buildings. Thus the inclusion of the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles, where the actress Diane Keaton, a trustee of the organization, is scheduled to announce the list on Tuesday. The Century, built in the mid-'60s and designed by Minoru Yamasaki -- the architect of the World Trade Center -- was also chosen to focus attention on sustainability and the need to recycle existing infrastructure. Development plans call for the hotel to be razed and replaced by two 600-foot-tall towers, one residential and one business.
Miami Marine Stadium in Virginia Key, Fla., which was completed in 1963, is another Modernist structure worthy of rescue, the trust asserts. With a cantilevered folded-plate roof, the cast-concrete stadium closed in 1992 after being damaged by Hurricane Andrew, and has since suffered from years of deterioration, vandalism and neglect.
''It's a wonderful Modernist structure -- one of a kind -- that could be a catalyst for revitalizing that whole part of Miami if it were redone,'' Mr. Moe said. ''None of these things stand in isolation by themselves. They affect their context, they affect their surroundings.''
Rounding out the list are Ames Shovel Shops, an intact 19th-century industrial village in Easton, Mass.; the cast-iron architecture of Galveston, Tex., late-19th-century Greek Revival and Italianate buildings with ornate cast-iron storefronts; Dorchester Academy in Midway, Ga., founded in 1868 as a school for freed slaves; and Lanai City, Hawaii, built by the pineapple baron James Dole in the 1920s, which features plantation-style homes.

HEADLINE: The Era Of Adapting Quickly

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE AGE OF THE UNTHINKABLE
Why the New World Disorder Constantly Surprises Us and What We Can Do About It
By Joshua Cooper Ramo
280 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $25.99.
The philosopher Isaiah Berlin famously divided thinkers into two categories: hedgehogs (like Plato, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche, Ibsen and Proust), who know one big thing and tend to view the world through the lens of a single organizing principle, and foxes (like Herodotus, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Goethe, Balzac and Joyce), who know many things and who pursue various unrelated, even contradictory ends.
According to Joshua Cooper Ramo's provocative new book, ''The Age of the Unthinkable,'' one study -- in which hundreds of experts in subjects like economics, foreign policy and politics were asked to make predictions about the short-term future and whose predictions were evaluated five years later -- showed that foxes, with their wide-ranging curiosity and willingness to embrace change, tended to be far more accurate in their forecasts than hedgehogs, eager for closure and keen on applying a few big ideas to an array of situations. 
It's a finding enthusiastically embraced by Mr. Ramo, who argues in these pages that today's complex, interconnected, globalized world requires policy makers willing to toss out old assumptions (about cause and effect, deterrence and defense, nation states and balances of power) and embrace creative new approaches. Today's world, he suggests, requires resilient pragmatists who, like the most talented Silicon Valley venture capitalists on the one hand or the survival-minded leadership of Hezbollah on the other, possess both an intuitive ability to see problems in a larger context and a willingness to rejigger their organizations continually to grapple with ever-shifting challenges and circumstances.
With this volume, Mr. Ramo, managing director at the geostrategic advisory firm Kissinger Associates and a former editor at Time magazine, seems to have set out to write a Malcolm Gladwellesque book: a book that popularizes complicated scientific theories while illustrating its arguments with colorful case studies and friendly how-to exhortations.
In drawing upon chaos science (explored in detail in James Gleick's 1987 book, ''Chaos''), complexity theory and the theory of disruptive innovation (pioneered by the Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen), Mr. Ramo does a nimble job of showing how such theories shed light on the current political and economic climate while avoiding the worst pitfalls (like an overreliance on suggestion and innuendo and the use of unrepresentative examples) of Mr. Gladwell's clumsy last book, ''Outliers.''
But if Mr. Ramo is adept at assessing the precarious state of today's post-cold-war world -- in which nation states face asymmetric threats from the likes of terrorists, drug cartels and computer hackers -- he proves much less convincing in articulating practical means of grappling with such daunting problems.
The central image that Mr. Ramo uses to evoke what he calls this ''age of surprise'' is Per Bak's sand pile -- that is, a sand pile described some two decades ago by the Danish-American physicist Per Bak, who argued that if grains of sand were dropped on a pile one at a time, the pile, at some point, would enter a critical state in which another grain of sand could cause a large avalanche -- or nothing at all. It's a hypothesis that shows that a small event can have momentous consequences and that seemingly stable systems can behave in highly unpredictable ways.
It's also a hypothesis that Mr. Ramo employs in this book as a metaphor for a complex world in which changes -- in politics, ecosystems or financial markets -- take place not in smooth, linear progressions but as sequences of fast, sometimes catastrophic events.
Real-life sand-pile avalanches, like the collapse of the Soviet Union or the 1929 crash of the stock market, Mr. Ramo declares, demand ''a complete remapping of the world'': policymakers must junk a lot of their old thinking to cope with this unpredictable new order.
For instance, many of the assumptions of the realist school of foreign-policy making -- which focused on nation states, ''assumed countries were rational, and made the bet that pure power was the solution to any problem'' -- have been undercut by the irrationalities and contingencies that have recently multiplied on the world stage.
As Mr. Ramo observes, ''Theories that involve only armies and diplomats don't have much use'' when ''confronted with the peculiar nature of a financially interconnected world, where danger, risk and profit are linked in ways that can be impossible to spot and manage.''
To make matters even more complicated, Mr. Ramo continues, complex systems ''tend to become more complex as time goes on'':
''The systems never get simpler. There was no moment at which they would evaporate or condense into a single, easy-to-spot target such as the U.S.S.R. The 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, for example, was a single very knotty event that, in turn, gave birth to hundreds of jihadist groups, each of which developed different methods of terror, particular techniques of attack and destruction, which themselves were always changing and evolving.''
In this sand-pile world, a small group of terrorists armed with box cutters can inflict a terrible blow on a superpower -- as Al Qaeda did on 9/11, just as bands of insurgents in Iraq managed to keep the mighty United States military at bay for three long years.
Iraq, Mr. Ramo astutely notes, is a war that showcased all of America's most ''maladaptive'' tendencies. It was inaugurated on the premise of flawed idees fixes: that it would have ''a clean, fast end'' and would lead to a democratic regime that would transform the Middle East in a positive fashion. And the certainty of Bush administration officials not only led to incorrect assumptions (like the bet that ''the 'ecosystem' of Iraq would settle into something stable that could be left to run itself'') but also resulted in an ill-planned and rigid occupation that was ''incapable of the speedy refiguring that life in a war zone'' inevitably requires.
So how should leaders cope with the sand-pile world? How can they learn to ''ride the earthquake'' and protect their countries from the worst fallout of such tremors? Mr. Ramo suggests that they must learn to build resilient societies with strong immune systems: instead of undertaking the impossible task of trying to prepare for every possible contingency, they ought to focus on things like ''national health care, construction of a better transport infrastructure and investment in education.''
He suggests that leaders should develop ways of looking at problems that focus more on context than on reductive answers. And he talks about people learning to become gardeners instead of architects, of embracing Eastern ideas of indirection instead of Western patterns of confrontation, of seeing ''threats as systems, not objects.''
Though Mr. Ramo sounds annoyingly fuzzy and vaguely New Agey when he tries to outline tactics for dealing with ''the age of the unthinkable,'' he's at least managed, in this stimulating volume, to make the reader seriously contemplate the alarming nature of a rapidly changing world -- a world in which uncertainty and indeterminacy are givens, and avalanches, negative cascades and tectonic shifts are ever-present dangers.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans Attack and Defense in Web Warfare

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, JOHN MARKOFF and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
This article was reported by David E. Sanger, John Markoff and Thom Shanker and written by Mr. Sanger.
When American forces in Iraq wanted to lure members of Al Qaeda into a trap, they hacked into one of the group's computers and altered information that drove them into American gun sights.
When President George W. Bush ordered new ways to slow Iran's progress toward a nuclear bomb last year, he approved a plan for an experimental covert program -- its results still unclear -- to bore into their computers and undermine the project.
And the Pentagon has commissioned military contractors to develop a highly classified replica of the Internet of the future. The goal is to simulate what it would take for adversaries to shut down the country's power stations, telecommunications and aviation systems, or freeze the financial markets -- in an effort to build better defenses against such attacks, as well as a new generation of online weapons. 
Just as the invention of the atomic bomb changed warfare and deterrence 64 years ago, a new international race has begun to develop cyberweapons and systems to protect against them.
Thousands of daily attacks on federal and private computer systems in the United States -- many from China and Russia, some malicious and some testing chinks in the patchwork of American firewalls -- have prompted the Obama administration to review American strategy.
President Obama is expected to propose a far larger defensive effort in coming days, including an expansion of the $17 billion, five-year program that Congress approved last year, the appointment of a White House official to coordinate the effort, and an end to a running bureaucratic battle over who is responsible for defending against cyberattacks.
But Mr. Obama is expected to say little or nothing about the nation's offensive capabilities, on which the military and the nation's intelligence agencies have been spending billions. In interviews over the past several months, a range of military and intelligence officials, as well as outside experts, have described a huge increase in the sophistication of American cyberwarfare capabilities.
Because so many aspects of the American effort to develop cyberweapons and define their proper use remain classified, many of those officials declined to speak on the record. The White House declined several requests for interviews or to say whether Mr. Obama as a matter of policy supports or opposes the use of American cyberweapons.
The most exotic innovations under consideration would enable a Pentagon programmer to surreptitiously enter a computer server in Russia or China, for example, and destroy a ''botnet'' -- a potentially destructive program that commandeers infected machines into a vast network that can be clandestinely controlled -- before it could be unleashed in the United States.
Or American intelligence agencies could activate malicious code that is secretly embedded on computer chips when they are manufactured, enabling the United States to take command of an enemy's computers by remote control over the Internet. That, of course, is exactly the kind of attack officials fear could be launched on American targets, often through Chinese-made chips or computer servers.
So far, however, there are no broad authorizations for American forces to engage in cyberwar. The invasion of the Qaeda computer in Iraq several years ago and the covert activity in Iran were each individually authorized by Mr. Bush. When he issued a set of classified presidential orders in January 2008 to organize and improve America's online defenses, the administration could not agree on how to write the authorization.
A principal architect of that order said the issue had been passed on to the next president, in part because of the complexities of cyberwar operations that, by necessity, would most likely be conducted on both domestic and foreign Internet sites. After the controversy surrounding domestic spying, Mr. Bush's aides concluded, the Bush White House did not have the credibility or the political capital to deal with the subject.
Electronic Vulnerabilities
Cyberwar would not be as lethal as atomic war, of course, nor as visibly dramatic. But when Mike McConnell, the former director of national intelligence, briefed Mr. Bush on the threat in May 2007, he argued that if a single large American bank were successfully attacked ''it would have an order-of-magnitude greater impact on the global economy'' than the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Mr. McConnell, who left office three months ago, warned last year that ''the ability to threaten the U.S. money supply is the equivalent of today's nuclear weapon.''
The scenarios developed last year for the incoming president by Mr. McConnell and his coordinator for cybersecurity, Melissa Hathaway, went further. They described vulnerabilities including an attack on Wall Street and one intended to bring down the nation's electric power grid. Most were extrapolations of attacks already tried.
Today, Ms. Hathaway is the primary author of White House cyberstrategy and has been traveling the country talking in vague terms about recent, increasingly bold attacks on the computer networks that keep the country running. Government officials will not discuss the details of a recent attack on the air transportation network, other than to say the attack never directly affected air traffic control systems.
Still, the specter of an attack that could blind air traffic controllers and, perhaps, the military's aerospace defense networks haunts military and intelligence officials. (The saving grace of the air traffic control system, officials say, is that it is so old that it is not directly connected to the Internet.)
Studies, with code names like Dark Angel, have focused on whether cellphone towers, emergency-service communications and hospital systems could be brought down, to sow chaos.
But the theoretical has, at times, become real.
''We have seen Chinese network operations inside certain of our electricity grids,'' said Joel F. Brenner, who oversees counterintelligence operations for Dennis Blair, Mr. McConnell's successor as national intelligence director, speaking at the University of Texas at Austin this month. ''Do I worry about those grids, and about air traffic control systems, water supply systems, and so on? You bet I do.''
But the broader question -- one the administration so far declines to discuss -- is whether the best defense against cyberattack is the development of a robust capability to wage cyberwar.
As Mr. Obama's team quickly discovered, the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies both concluded in Mr. Bush's last years in office that it would not be enough to simply build higher firewalls and better virus detectors or to restrict access to the federal government's own computers.
''The fortress model simply will not work for cyber,'' said one senior military officer who has been deeply engaged in the debate for several years. ''Someone will always get in.''
That thinking has led to a debate over whether lessons learned in the nuclear age -- from the days of ''mutually assured destruction'' -- apply to cyberwar.
But in cyberwar, it is hard to know where to strike back, or even who the attacker might be. Others have argued for borrowing a page from Mr. Bush's pre-emption doctrine by going into foreign computers to destroy malicious software before it is unleashed into the world's digital bloodstream. But that could amount to an act of war, and many argue it is a losing game, because the United States is more dependent on a constantly running Internet system than many of its potential adversaries, and therefore could suffer more damage in a counterattack.
In a report scheduled to be released Wednesday, the National Research Council will argue that although an offensive cybercapability is an important asset for the United States, the nation is lacking a clear strategy, and secrecy surrounding preparations has hindered national debate, according to several people familiar with the report.
The advent of Internet attacks -- especially those suspected of being directed by nations, not hackers -- has given rise to a new term inside the Pentagon and the National Security Agency: ''hybrid warfare.''
It describes a conflict in which attacks through the Internet can be launched as a warning shot -- or to pave the way for a traditional attack.
Early hints of this new kind of warfare emerged in the confrontation between Russia and Estonia in April 2007. Clandestine groups -- it was never determined if they had links to the Russian government -- commandeered computers around the globe and directed a fire hose of data at Estonia's banking system and its government Web sites.
The computer screens of Estonians trying to do business with the government online were frozen, if they got anything at all. It was annoying, but by the standards of cyberwar, it was child's play.
In August 2008, when Russia invaded Georgia, the cyberattacks grew more widespread. Georgians were denied online access to news, cash and air tickets. The Georgian government had to move its Internet activity to servers in Ukraine when its own servers locked up, but the attacks did no permanent damage.
Every few months, it seems, some agency, research group or military contractor runs a war game to assess the United States' vulnerability. Senior intelligence officials were shocked to discover how easy it was to permanently disable a large power generator. That prompted further studies to determine if attackers could take down a series of generators, bringing whole parts of the country to a halt.
Another war game that the Department of Homeland Security sponsored in March 2008, called Cyber Storm II, envisioned a far larger, coordinated attack against the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It studied a disruption of chemical plants, rail lines, oil and gas pipelines and private computer networks. That study and others like it concluded that when attacks go global, the potential economic repercussions increase exponentially.
To prove the point, Mr. McConnell, then the director of national intelligence, spent much of last summer urging senior government officials to examine the Treasury Department's scramble to contain the effects of the collapse of Bear Stearns. Markets froze, he said, because ''what backs up that money is confidence -- an accounting system that is reconcilable.'' He began studies of what would happen if the system that clears market trades froze.
''We were halfway through the study,'' one senior intelligence official said last month, ''and the markets froze of their own accord. And we looked at each other and said, 'Our market collapse has just given every cyberwarrior out there a playbook.' ''
Just before Mr. Obama was elected, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a policy research group in Washington, warned in a report that ''America's failure to protect cyberspace is one of the most urgent national security problems facing the new administration.''
What alarmed the panel was not the capabilities of individual hackers but of nations -- China and Russia among them -- that experts believe are putting huge resources into the development of cyberweapons. A research company called Team Cymru recently examined ''scans'' that came across the Internet seeking ways to get inside industrial control systems, and discovered more than 90 percent of them came from computers in China.
Scanning alone does no damage, but it could be the prelude to an attack that scrambles databases or seeks to control computers. But Team Cymru ran into a brick wall as soon as it tried to trace who, exactly, was probing these industrial systems. It could not determine whether military organizations, intelligence agencies, terrorist groups, criminals or inventive teenagers were behind the efforts.
The good news, some government officials argue, is that the Chinese are deterred from doing real damage: Because they hold more than a trillion dollars in United States government debt, they have little interest in freezing up a system they depend on for their own investments.
Then again, some of the scans seemed to originate from 14 other countries, including Taiwan, Russia and, of course, the United States.
Bikini Atoll for an Online Age
Because ''cyberwar'' contains the word ''war,'' the Pentagon has argued that it should be the locus of American defensive and offensive strategy -- and it is creating the kind of infrastructure that was built around nuclear weapons in the 1940s and '50s.
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates is considering proposals to create a Cyber Command -- initially as a new headquarters within the Strategic Command, which controls the American nuclear arsenal and assets in space. Right now, the responsibility for computer network security is part of Strategic Command, and military officials there estimate that over the past six months, the government has spent $100 million responding to probes and attacks on military systems. Air Force officials confirm that a large network of computers at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama was temporarily taken off-line within the past eight months when it was put at risk of widespread infection from computer viruses.
But Mr. Gates has concluded that the military's cyberwarfare effort requires a sharper focus -- and thus a specific command. It would build the defenses for military computers and communications systems and -- the part the Pentagon is reluctant to discuss -- develop and deploy cyberweapons.
In fact, that effort is already under way -- it is part of what the National Cyber Range is all about. The range is a replica of the Internet of the future, and it is being built to be attacked. Competing teams of contractors -- including BAE Systems, the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University and Sparta Inc. -- are vying to build the Pentagon a system it can use to simulate attacks. The National Security Agency already has a smaller version of a similar system, in Millersville, Md.
In short, the Cyber Range is to the digital age what the Bikini Atoll -- the islands the Army vaporized in the 1950s to measure the power of the hydrogen bomb -- was to the nuclear age. But once the tests at Bikini Atoll demonstrated to the world the awesome destructive power of the bomb, it became evident to the United States and the Soviet Union -- and other nuclear powers -- that the risks of a nuclear exchange were simply too high. In the case of cyberattacks, where the results can vary from the annoying to the devastating, there are no such rules.
The Deterrence Conundrum
During the cold war, if a strategic missile had been fired at the United States, screens deep in a mountain in Colorado would have lighted up and American commanders would have some time to decide whether to launch a counterattack. Today, when Pentagon computers are subjected to a barrage, the origin is often a mystery. Absent certainty about the source, it is almost impossible to mount a counterattack.
In the rare case where the preparations for an attack are detected in a foreign computer system, there is continuing debate about whether to embrace the concept of pre-emption, with all of its Bush-era connotations. The questions range from whether an online attack should be mounted on that system to, in an extreme case, blowing those computers up.
Some officials argue that if the United States engaged in such pre-emption -- and demonstrated that it was watching the development of hostile cyberweapons -- it could begin to deter some attacks. Others believe it will only justify pre-emptive attacks on the United States. ''Russia and China have lots of nationalistic hackers,'' one senior military officer said. ''They seem very, very willing to take action on their own.''
Senior Pentagon and military officials also express deep concern that the laws and understanding of armed conflict have not kept current with the challenges of offensive cyberwarfare.
Over the decades, a number of limits on action have been accepted -- if not always practiced. One is the prohibition against assassinating government leaders. Another is avoiding attacks aimed at civilians. Yet in the cyberworld, where the most vulnerable targets are civilian, there are no such rules or understandings. If a military base is attacked, would it be a proportional, legitimate response to bring down the attacker's power grid if that would also shut down its hospital systems, its air traffic control system or its banking system?
''We don't have that for cyber yet,'' one senior Defense Department official said, ''and that's a little bit dangerous.''

HEADLINE: You Touchin' My Stuff? De Niro Files Available

BYLINE: Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
No matter how bad this recession gets, you'll probably never again see Robert De Niro behind the wheel of a taxi. But if you'd like to see the actual hack license that Mr. De Niro wielded while he was preparing for his role in ''Taxi Driver,'' along with artifacts and papers from 68 of his other films, they're now easy enough to find. On Monday the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin announced that it had made available to researchers and the public the more than 1,300 boxes of papers, film, movie props and costumes donated by Mr. De Niro, above. The collection covers his career from the 1968 Brian De Palma feature ''Greetings'' through the 2005 film ''Hide and Seek.'' It includes the leopard-print boxing robe Mr. De Niro wore in ''Raging Bull'' and the coats he wore as the Creature in ''Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.''

HEADLINE: Fall in Newspaper Sales Accelerates to Pass 7%

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
The rate of decline in print circulation at the nation's newspapers has accelerated since last fall, as industry figures released Monday show a more than 7 percent drop compared with the previous year, while another recent analysis showed that newspaper Web site audiences had increased 10.5 percent in the first quarter.
 Of the top 25 newspapers in the United States, all posted declines in circulation except for The Wall Street Journal, which eked out a 0.6 percent gain, according to figures released by the Audit Bureau of Circulations. For the others, the declines ranged from 20.6 percent for The New York Post, to a slight 0.4 percent drop for The Chicago Sun-Times. 
 Both The Post and The Journal are owned by the News Corporation, the media conglomerate controlled by Rupert Murdoch. 
 The new circulation numbers are ''not very good, and probably a little worse than expected,'' said Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit organization that owns The St. Petersburg Times in Florida. Mr. Edmonds said he had expected an overall drop of roughly 5.5 percent.
 The figures, which are based on reports filed by the individual papers, illustrated the continued migration of readers to the Internet and, in some cases, the effort by papers to shed unprofitable circulation. 
 ''One shouldn't be in denial that this represents people quitting newspapers to get news from the Web,'' Mr. Edmonds said. ''But there are many other factors.''
 Among those factors, he said, are newspapers making reductions in what is known in the industry as ''junk circulation'' -- things like free newspapers distributed at trade shows or in schools. At the same time, he said, some papers have increased prices in an effort to wring more revenue from their core readers while doing away with cheap introductory offers to attract new readers.
 ''To that extent, it's voluntary,'' Mr. Edmonds said.
 That was one explanation offered by Alan Fisco, the vice president of circulation and marketing for The Seattle Times, in a memorandum on Monday to his staff about a decline of roughly 8 percent in circulation. 
 ''Most of these losses are due to budget decisions we made throughout 2008 and earlier this year in response to the economic recession,'' he wrote. ''We made these decisions as strategically as possible, with the goal of minimizing the impact to our readership and audience while preserving our core home delivery and single copy strength.''
 At 395 daily newspapers, weekday circulation declined 7.1 percent for the six months that ended March 31, compared with the previous year. Sunday circulation for 557 daily newspapers was down 5.37 percent.
 The New York Times reported a smaller decline than the industry average, as weekday circulation fell 3.6 percent to 1,039,031, compared with the previous year. The Times, which last week reported a quarterly loss of $74 million, said that circulation revenue was up slightly, reflecting increased prices.
 While newspaper circulation has long been in decline, the latest figures show the drop is accelerating. In the two previous six-month periods, weekday circulation fell 4.6 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.
 USA Today, which has long bucked industry circulation trends, reported a 7.5 percent drop, partly because some hotels cut back on free newspapers delivered to rooms. USA Today is still the nation's largest newspaper by circulation, at slightly more than two million. The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times are the next largest papers.
 Both of New York City's major tabloids, which in recent years have fought circulation battles, reported steep drops in weekday circulation. Circulation fell more than 20 percent at The New York Post, and 14.3 percent at The Daily News.
 A press release from The Post attributed the decline to an increase in the price of the tabloid to 50 cents, from 25 cents.
 Robert Leonard, a spokesman for The Daily News, said 90 percent of its drop in circulation resulted from ending bulk distribution in places like schools.
 Meanwhile, the audience for newspaper Web sites continues to grow. In the first quarter of 2009, newspaper Web sites attracted more than 73 million unique visitors each month, on average, according to an analysis by Nielsen Online for the Newspaper Association of America. That is a 10.5 percent increase from the first quarter of 2008.

HEADLINE: An Anonymous Senator of Power and Influence

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
One of the most important public figures in New York, a man with the power to make life better or worse for city residents, is all but unknown to them. This would be Malcolm A. Smith, the first Democrat to lead the State Senate majority since the Beatles were the hottest thing going.
 In Mr. Smith's hands lies the immediate future of mass transit in this city and its suburbs, specifically how painful the inevitable fare increases and service reductions may be. For the moment, anyway, he is the center of attention -- not the governor, not the Assembly speaker, not the mayor. 
 We're only guessing, but it would seem hard to qualify as a dynamic leader when ordinary people who look to you for sound judgment haven't a clue who you are.
 Out of curiosity, we approached New Yorkers at random while they waited at bus stops and on subway platforms -- men and women with a direct interest in mass transit -- to ask if they recognized the name Malcolm Smith. (By the way, on-the-street ambushing used to be a lot easier. Just you try finding people now who are standing around and not yakking on cellphones, communing with iPods or thumb-pounding BlackBerrys.)
 We chose the Upper West Side for this experiment, in part because it is familiar territory to us but, more important, because people there are, as a group, a politically savvy breed. Everyone we approached exuded intelligence.
 We talked with 29 people before deciding that further exploration would not change the pattern. Only one person among the 29, a man in an ''Obama'' baseball cap, could identify Mr. Smith. Two or three people said the name sounded vaguely familiar. They felt bad after being told who Mr. Smith was, kind of like ''Jeopardy!'' players annoyed with themselves for not coming up with a response they knew they should have had.
 So unknown was Mr. Smith that it would be tempting to refer to him as Malcolm X were that name not already taken. 
 The fact that he is not on people's radar is a symptom of the leadership gap that has come almost to define Albany for some New Yorkers.
 Gap? At times it seems more like a chasm.
 Mass transit, in case you hadn't noticed, is snared in its most severe financial crisis in decades. The troubles worsened on Monday with new figures showing that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is in an even deeper hole than previously believed. If ever there was a time for New York's political forces to set aside petty interests and come together for the common weal, this is it. Instead, they have pretty much gone separate ways.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has largely been AWOL in this crisis, even though he could do some serious arm-twisting among Albany Republicans, having underwritten their political campaigns. Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, supplied a rescue plan of his own, but then sat back and watched from the sidelines while the Senate struggled to overcome internal dissension.
 Gov. David A. Paterson could be, and perhaps should be, the enforcer. But it's not easy to be an effective head banger when your approval ratings are not much larger than some people's shoe size. 
 The governor has spoken a good deal lately about exercising leadership. Two weeks ago, he promised with great fanfare that he would be in the vanguard of efforts to legalize same-sex marriage in New York. The major obstacle in his way is the State Senate, where skittishness on this issue reigns. But within days, Mr. Paterson made it clear that his idea of leadership was to let Mr. Smith figure things out. ''I'll stick with his judgment,'' the governor said.
 For now, it is Mr. Smith's judgment that also matters for saving the transit system. But he has had enormous difficulty getting his slender Democratic majority to fashion a rescue package that makes fiscal sense. Even if he succeeds in the chamber that he nominally controls, it is far from clear that he can sell his plan to all the other players in Albany (not to mention to commuters in and around New York City).
 The sound you hear in the meantime? That's the clock ticking loudly before substantial fare increases and service cuts begin taking effect.
 It is a serious challenge to stave off disaster without real leadership. It is just as challenging to exercise leadership -- and to rally the public behind you -- when you're the opposite of the ''Cheers'' theme song and nobody knows your name.

HEADLINE: Where False Rings True

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Chen Yang contributed research.

DATELINE: SHENZHEN, China 

 BODY:
The phone's sleek lines and touch-screen keyboard are unmistakably familiar. So is the logo on the back. But a sales clerk at a sprawling electronic goods market in this Chinese coastal city admits what is clear upon closer inspection: this is not the AppleiPhone; this is the Hi-Phone.
 ''But it's just as good,'' the clerk says.
 Nearby, dozens of other vendors are selling counterfeit Nokia, Motorola and Samsung phones -- as well as cheap look-alikes that make no bones about being knockoffs. 
 ''Five years ago, there were no counterfeit phones,'' says Xiong Ting, a sales manager at Triquint Semiconductor, a maker of mobile phone parts, while visiting Shenzhen. ''You needed a design house. You needed software guys. You needed hardware design. But now, a company with five guys can do it. Within 100 miles of here, you can find all your suppliers.''
 Technological advances have allowed hundreds of small Chinese companies, some with as few as 10 employees, to churn out what are known here as shanzhai, or black market, cellphones, often for as little as $20 apiece.
 And just as Chinese companies are trying to move up the value chain of manufacturing, from producing toys and garments to making computers and electric cars, so too are counterfeiters. After years of making fake luxury bags and cheap DVDs, they are capturing market share from the world's biggest mobile phone makers. 
 Although shanzhai phones have only been around a few years, they already account for more than 20 percent of sales in China, which is the world's biggest mobile phone market, according to the research firm Gartner.
 They are also being illegally exported to Russia, India, the Middle East, Europe, even the United States. ''The shanzhai phone market is expanding crazily,'' says Wang Jiping, a senior analyst at IDC, which tracks technology trends. ''They copy Apple, Nokia, whatever they like, and they respond to the market swiftly.'' 
 Alarmed by the rapid growth of counterfeits and no-name knockoffs, global brands are pressing the Chinese government to crack down on their proliferation, and are warning consumers about potential health hazards, like cheap batteries that can explode.
 Nokia, the world's biggest cellphone maker, says it is working with Beijing to fight counterfeiting. Motorola says much the same. Apple Inc. declined to comment.
 Even Chinese mobile phone producers are losing market share to underground companies, which have a built-in cost advantage because they evade taxes, regulatory fees and safety checks.
 ''We're being severely hurt by shanzhai phones,'' says Chen Zhao, a sales director at Konka, a Chinese cellphone maker. ''Legal cellphone makers should pay 17 percent of their revenue as value-added tax, but shanzhai makers, of course, won't pay it.''
 So far, however, China has done little to stop the proliferation of fake mobile phones, which are even advertised on late-night television infomercials with pitches like ''one-fifth the price, but the same function and look,'' or patriotic appeals like ''Buy shanzhai to show your love of our country.''
 Last month, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did warn consumers about the hazards of shanzhai phones, saying ''their radiation usually exceeds the limit.'' China's consumer protection agency says faulty mobile phones were the No. 1 consumer complaint last year.
 A few weeks ago, a 45-year-old man in south China was severely burned after his cellphone exploded in his shirt pocket, according to state-run news media.
 But that hasn't seemed to affect sales of black market phones, which typically sell at retail for $100 to $150. In the spirit of what is called ''shanzhai'' -- which suggests rebels or bandits and which applies to counterfeit products of all kinds -- many consumers are willing to take a risk on a cheap item that looks stylish.
 ''I saw iPhone pictures on the Web; it's so cool. But it costs over $500 -- too expensive,'' says Yang Guibin, 30, an office worker from Chongqing. ''So I decided to buy a shanzhai iPhone. I bought it in a digital market here; it looked exactly like the iPhone.''
 Some experts say they believe the shanzhai phenomena is about being creative, Chinese style.
 ''Chinese grass-roots companies are actually very innovative,'' says Yu Zhou, a professor at Vassar College. ''It's not so much technology as how they form supply chains and how rapidly they react to new trends.''
 While the phones may look like famous brands, companies actually add special features like bigger screens, dual-mode SIM cards (which allow two phone numbers) and even a telescopic lens attachment for the phone's camera. 
 Since it is the SIM card that makes a phone run in China, as in most places other than the United States, all you have to do is insert a valid SIM card into a shanzhai phone and it works.
 All this innovation comes from an industry that only took off in 2005, after Mediatek, a semiconductor design company from Taiwan, helped significantly reduce the cost and complexity of producing a mobile phone.
 Using what experts call a turnkey solution, Mediatek developed a circuit board that could inexpensively integrate the functions of multiple chips, offering start-ups a platform to produce a low-cost mobile phone.
 The industry got another boost in 2007, when regulators said companies no longer needed a license to manufacture a cellphone.
 That set off a scramble by entrepreneurs in this electronics manufacturing center. Counterfeiting and off-brand knockoffs flourished. Tiny companies would buy a Mediatek chip loaded with software, source other components and ask a factory to assemble them. 
 Marketing strategies were simple: steal. Designs and brand names were copied identically or simply mimicked. (Sumsung for Samsung or Nckia for Nokia.)
 Tapping into the supply chains of big brands is easy, producers say. ''It's really common for factories to do a night shift for other companies,'' says Zhang Haizhen, who recently ran a shanzhai company here. ''No one will refuse an order if it is over 5,000 mobile phones.''
 The people who make fake iPhones admit it's a shady business.
 ''We are a kind of illegal producer,'' says Zhang Feiyang, whose company, Yuanyang, makes an iPhone clone. ''In Shenzhen there are many small mills, hidden. Basically, we can make any type of cellphone.''
 The competition is already forcing global brands to lower prices, analysts say. And new Chinese brands are emerging, like Meizu, a would-be Apple that has opened stylish stores here.
 ''Our phone is even better than the iPhone,'' says Liu Zeyu, a Meizu salesman in Shenzhen. ''Our goal is to create a phone that makes Chinese proud.''

HEADLINE: Workers Walk The Plank

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I'm sure everyone is thrilled to know that the high rollers on Wall Street are bouncing back. With profits on the rebound, the big shots at the biggest institutions are on track, as The Times reported Sunday, to make as much money this year as they were hauling in before the mega-recession began.
 The growing legions of the unemployed can be forgiven for not shouting hallelujah. It's a little like watching the drunken driver who plowed into your family car and caused untold havoc and heartache, suddenly pulling up one morning, no worse for the wear, in a sparkling new vehicle. 
 The folks who led the nation to this financial abyss are the ones being made whole on the taxpayers' dime. We can look after them, all right. But we can't seem to get credit flowing in any normal way again; we can't stanch the terrible flow of home foreclosures; and we're not doing nearly enough to address the most critical need of all: putting people back to work.
 While Wall Street is breaking out the Champagne yet again, the rest of the economy is beyond terrible, and will be for the foreseeable future.
 Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, offered a rundown of the unemployment crisis in remarks she prepared for a House subcommittee last week. Ms. Shierholz began by noting that next month the current economic downturn will become the longest since the Great Depression. 
 ''The 10 postwar recessions prior to this one have averaged 10.4 months in length, with the longest being 16 months,'' said Ms. Shierholz. ''The current recession is now in its 16th month and the labor market is still shedding over 600,000 jobs a month.''
 Wall Street can swallow all the Champagne it wants, and the market fanatics can obsess until their brains lock over the daily gyrations of the Dow. The simple fact is that working men and women are being squeezed in the ever-tightening jaws of a catastrophe.
 The American auto industry is fading before our eyes. Chrysler is looking to Fiat -- Fiat! -- as a savior. The once-impregnable General Motors is now a giant junkyard sinking in quicksand. It disclosed Monday that it will cut another 21,000 factory jobs in the United States over the next year. If G.M. were to go under it would take an enormous chain of satellite industries down with it.
 More than 13 million people are officially counted as unemployed, with some 5.6 million jobs lost since the recession started. Ms. Shierholz tells us that since the first of the year about 23,000 men and women were being added to the jobless rolls every day.
 Job losses on such a scale are knockout blows to ordinary American families. 
 The importance of employment to the everyday life and long-term health of the nation is too often given short shrift. A recent report, ''The 2009 MetLife Study of the American Dream,'' found, not surprisingly, that ''work is the linchpin holding the dream together'' for most Americans.
 In fact, the mythic American dream is becoming more and more elusive. The big concern facing millions of families at the moment is economic survival. More than half of all Americans -- 56 percent -- are concerned that they might lose their jobs in the next year. Few are prepared for such a setback.
 As the authors of the MetLife study reported:
 ''With the erosion of social and corporate safety nets, tightening credit and declining home equity, most Americans have little financial cushioning to survive a job loss. Without a steady paycheck, 50 percent of Americans say they could not meet their financial obligations for more than a month -- and, of that, a disturbing 28 percent couldn't support themselves for more than two weeks of unemployment.''
 That's the case in an environment in which more than three million Americans already have been out of work for more than six months.
 The employment issue is not being addressed with the level of urgency that is warranted. For all the talk of green jobs, there is no large-scale creative effort to turn this employment debacle around. There is no crash program on anything like the scale needed, for example, to rebuild the rotting infrastructure -- a big-time potential source of jobs. 
 The financial industry is seen as essential, but millions of American workers are not. They're expendable.
 If as much attention, energy and resources were given to the effort to put Americans back to work as has been given to putting the banking industry back on its feet, you'd have fewer Champagne toasts on Wall Street but a lot more high-fiving in family homes across the country.

HEADLINE: Stress Tests? No Big Deal After All

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
 When the government first announced its plan to ''stress test'' the nation's top 19 banks, it described the financial exam as an important part of instilling confidence in the market.
 The message was clear: The government -- and Timothy F. Geithner, the secretary of the Treasury -- were on the case.
 But now, less than a week before it makes the results of its all-important test public, the government appears to be backing away from how seriously investors and the public should take them. In the Federal Reserve's 21-page white paper released on Friday, it described the tests as simply ''what if'' exercises. 
 The goal, it went on, was to help regulators ''gauge the extent of additional capital needs across a wide range of potential economic outcomes.'' Then it cautioned that if the test results mean a particular bank has to raise capital, that should not be considered ''a measure of the current solvency or viability of the firm.''
 So after all that buildup, the results are meaningless?
 Bank stocks may have been on a tear lately, but the government is still concerned about the fragility of banks. And the new worry is that this latest effort to instill confidence may undermine it instead.
 When the stress test was first conceived, it was never clear whether the results would be made public. But within days of the government's announcing the test, lawyers inside the banks started to point out that, ahem, this may be material information, which means by law they have to disclose it to shareholders. (The drama over whether the Treasury Department had prevented Bank of America from disclosing the problems at Merrill Lynch was an added nudge.) 
 Now the results are going to be disclosed next Monday, though how much information will be made public is still hazy.
 Some senior Wall Street bankers say they are beginning to worry that the results could cause a run on the weakest banks, no matter how forcefully the government cautions the public that the results have nothing to do with the viability of the bank. The broader sense of panic may have died down, but it's not dead.
 ''I don't want to be alarmist, but I'm worried next Monday could feel like September all over again,'' said a chief executive I spoke with late last week who runs one of the 19 banks that underwent a stress test. 
 In case you've forgotten, those September memories include Washington Mutual's being taken over by the F.D.I.C. and sold to JPMorgan Chase on a Thursday night because the government worried that WaMu couldn't make it until the weekend.
 The banks are being put through a battery of tests to see whether they will hold up under pressure under the worst-case economic situations over the next two years. (Chief executives have a hard time forecasting their business for the next quarter, so it will interesting to see how well the government does for two years.) 
 ''The name 'stress test' implies a level of precision for predicting future losses and earnings that simply does not exist,'' Tom Brown, an analyst at Bankstocks.com, wrote.
 But increasingly those worst cases contemplated by the government -- 10.3 percent unemployment, a 22 percent plunge in housing prices and the economy contracting by 3.3 percent -- look less like doomsday and more like day-to-day realities. 
 ''They certainly are not the worst numbers that one could imagine,'' Joseph Stiglitz, the economist and Nobel Prize winner said Friday night on a Charlie Rose panel that I participated in. ''Stress is stress. It's not where the average is.'' 
 So here's the rub: If some banks can't pass this test -- which William Black, a former senior bank regulator during the S.& L. crisis, has called ''a complete sham'' and others have suggested is a whitewash -- perhaps we have a larger problem. 
 Maybe this test is going to show more failures than we thought. 
 Any banks that actually might ''fail'' the test, and I put those words in quote marks for a reason, will be given six months to raise new capital on their own or accept capital from the government. 
 But what private investor is going to invest in any of the failing banks, knowing full well that the government may end up coming in later on and diluting the investor's stake? 
 This may end feeling a little bit like a replay of the government's intervention in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. You'll recall that Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, received temporary powers from Congress to take over Fannie and Freddie. At the time, he said he didn't plan to use those powers, just the threat of them. 
 ''If you've got a bazooka, and people know you've got it, you may not have to take it out,'' he said. But that authority to seize the two mortgage finance giants scared off any suitor that was considering making an investment. 
 And since Mr. Geithner said in February that he planned ''a new program of capital support'' for those banks that need it, he's had to rethink that position. Without support from Congress for more bailout money, he's likely to run out of TARP money to the extent that he has floated the idea of swapping the government's preferred shares for common shares. 
 There's nothing wrong with stress-testing the banks. The problem is when the results are ignored.

HEADLINE: Never Mind What It Costs. Can I Get 70% Off?

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
AS the recession drags on, more retailers are finding they cannot get consumers to buy much of anything unless they offer huge sales, symbolized by significantly high double-digit percentage discounts. 
 The deals, signaled by ''% off'' designations in ads, appear to be winning out over descriptions of specific prices, like ''was $39.99, now $19.90,'' or promotions like ''buy one, get one'' half off or free, known to retailers as bogos.
 For a while, 50 percent off seemed the norm. But since the Christmas holiday shopping season, when some high-end department stores unexpectedly discounted prices by much more than half off, hefty percentage discounts have become the standard. 
 Experts predict the trend will last for some time as shoppers cling to frugality.
 A report released on Monday by Information Resources Inc., titled ''Dissecting the Downturn Generation,'' said that the recession was creating ''a new niche of consumers'' more likely to look through retailer ads for deals and stock up on sale items.
 A one-day home sale on April 18 at the Bloomingdale's division of Macy's Inc. offered shoppers a chance to ''save 25%-75% on the items you need and the labels you love.''
 A few days earlier, a fur sale at Bloomingdale's promised ''60%-80% off'' original prices ''when you take an extra 15% off a selection of already-reduced'' merchandise.
 A newspaper ad for the HomeGoods retail chain, promoting ''some of the biggest savings in HomeGoods history,'' featured 18 percent-off deals, ranging from a minimum of 50 percent to a maximum of 80 percent.
 Ads for the Filene's Basement chain, which was sold last week to the Buxbaum Group, advertised ''savings of 60-75%'' on Italian fashion apparel and ''savings of 40-85%'' on sportswear from American designers.
 Savings of up to 75 percent were promoted in ads for ABC Carpet & Home, while a Paragon Sports warehouse sale offered savings of 50 to 80 percent.
 And ads for the ''March essentials sale'' at the Macy's unit of Macy's Inc. wooed potential customers with ''25%-85% off storewide plus values'' -- along with ''an extra 15% off when you use your Macy's card on a selection of sale and clearance purchases storewide.''
 Is it any wonder that an editorial cartoon by Stuart Carlson of the Universal Press Syndicate showed a shopper, walking past store signs advertising 80 and 90 percent off, telling her companion, ''It's tempting ... but I think I'll wait till it goes lower.''
 The penchant for percentages off rather than specific prices or promotions can be attributed to the continuing weak retail climate, said Wendy Liebmann, chief executive and chief shopper at WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting company in New York.
 ''We've gotten to a point where the specific price isn't bold enough or specific enough'' to be noticed, Ms. Liebmann said.
 ''The magnitude of the crisis has created this sales vernacular where people are saying, 'If I'm not getting 50 percent off, I'm not even getting off the couch,' '' she added, '' 'but 70 or 80 percent off gets my attention.' '' 
 In recent visits to stores, Ms. Liebmann said, she noticed that if there was ''nothing on sale,'' there was ''nobody in the store.''
 ''Everyone's just waiting,'' she added.
 Antony Young, chief executive at the United States operations of the Optimedia media agency in New York, has been considering the phenomenon after offering clients marketing advice in a report called ''Strategies in a Downturn.''
 ''You've got people who want to spend,'' said Mr. Young, whose agency is part of the ZenithOptimedia unit of the Publicis Groupe, ''but they need more information to talk themselves into it.''
 A big percentage-off discount could woo shoppers if ''by trading down they're trading up,'' he added, but only to a point: ''If a woman sees a handbag that had been selling at $4,000 for $750, she's likely to say: 'I can afford it. I just don't want to look like an idiot.' ''
 That may be why some retailers are mixing percentage-off sales with promotions like ''doorbusters'' and playing up the low prices of specific items.
 For example, ads for a spring sale at J. C. Penney last Friday and Saturday were composed of large percentage discounts, like 70 percent off gold and sterling silver jewelry and 55 percent off bath towels; ''buy one get one'' offers, with a second item costing 88 cents if the first was bought at regular price; and items priced lower than usual, like a $30 men's St. John's Bay striped polo shirt for $11.99.
 Penney ''has always been a promotional retailer,'' said Quinton Crenshaw, a spokesman for the J. C. Penney Company in Plano, Tex. ''Our customers know and understand our promotional cadence.''
 ''To better communicate our great values'' in what Mr. Crenshaw described as ''this challenging environment,'' Penney is ''focused on simplifying and making prices clearly visible to the customer,'' he said, as well as ''stepping up the style'' of the merchandise assortment.
 The proliferation of ''% off'' signs in stores known for selling goods at regular prices places them in competition with retailers that regularly sell goods at discount prices. Take the K&G Fashion Superstore division of Men's Wearhouse, which advertises ''designer brands at up to 60 percent off everyday.''
 K&G emphasizes that its clothing ''is new, not close-outs, not clearance merchandise,'' said Mary Beth Blake, president at K&G in Atlanta, ''and the sale is from Day 1; you don't have to wait.''
 Ms. Liebmann of WSL Strategic Retail said the next strategy could be ''cost-plus, retailers saying: 'It cost us $12. We're selling it for $14.' ''

HEADLINE: Keeping Jobless Rules Intact, Florida Legislators Decline U.S. Aid

BYLINE: By GARY FINEOUT

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 

 BODY:
Days from the end of the legislative session, Florida lawmakers have refused to move a bill to expand unemployment eligibility in order to accept $444 million in federal stimulus aid. 
 While the Republican-controlled Legislature plans to use as much as $5 billion from the stimulus package to balance the budget, lawmakers balked at moving the unemployment insurance bill out of committee.
 Senator Anthony C. Hill Sr., Democrat of Jacksonville, conceded that the bill was dead for the annual session, which is supposed to end on Friday, although a budget stalemate may force legislators to extend the session by a few days.
 Republican legislators say that they do not want to increase the burden on Florida's unemployment trust fund when it is running out of money. Some statewide business groups, already bracing for an expected increase in unemployment taxes, also objected to the changes.
 ''The strings attached to the $444 million are going to potentially make a bad problem worse,'' said Representative Adam Hasner, the House majority leader from Boca Raton.
 Other Southern Republicans have raised protests about the unemployment benefits, saying that expansion could eventually require them to raise taxes. But Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida said he supported changing the law to draw the extra federal money.
 ''I think taking it is important,'' Mr. Crist said. ''I know the people need it, especially those who may be facing unemployment. I wish it would be reviewed again.''
 Democrats have accused Republican lawmakers of leaving money on the table.
 ''The unemployed in Florida are being denied their share of the economic stimulus pie,'' said United States Representative Kendrick B. Meek, Democrat of Miami, who accused the Legislature of putting ''ideology over the people of Florida in their time of need.''
 Florida has been hammered by the recession and the collapse of the real estate market and has an unemployment rate of 9.7 percent. The state is eligible for about $1.5 billion in additional unemployment aid in the stimulus package. 
 The state's unemployment trust fund is expected to run out of money in August. State officials plan to ask for a federal loan for the fund, and the Legislature is moving ahead with a bill that would increase unemployment taxes on businesses.
 Lawmakers are expected to pass a measure that would allow them to use $700 million in stimulus money to extend unemployment benefits for the rest of the year to 250,000 people whose benefits would otherwise expire. But they have been unwilling to make more changes, like offering benefits to those who left work because of domestic violence or the relocation of a spouse.

Flu New Threat 
 To Global Finance
 The financial crisis in the United States has reverberated around the world. Now the country faces a new challenge to its economic health -- fallout from the swine flu crisis. It's not yet clear, but the repercussions for the global economy could be severe.
 The government declared a health emergency after the discovery of about two dozen cases of the same strain of flu that by Monday had killed more than 100 in Mexico. As the homeland security chief, Janet Napolitano, counseled, there was no reason to panic yet. This is just a precaution. 
 But with the economy already suffering -- and bringing the rest of the globe down with it -- the last thing it can withstand is a serious epidemic. The last time the world faced anything similar was the 2003 bout of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which spread from China's Guangdong province to three dozen countries. 
 The human toll from SARS, about 900 deaths, though tragic, was a pinprick compared with the Spanish influenza at the end of World War I, when as many as 100 million died. But the resulting panic caused many travel-related businesses in the hardest-hit areas to suffer severely. The World Health Organization estimated that international travel to areas like Hong Kong, Beijing and Toronto fell by more than half, and hotel occupancy dropped 60 percent. 
 In hindsight, the epidemic did little to dent the trajectory of growth in the regions of East Asia that were most affected. China's gross domestic product grew a healthy 9.3 percent that year, reflecting only the slightest impact from the avian flu scare. Hong Kong grew 3.3 percent, up a full percentage point from the previous year. 
 This time could be different. Even assuming the Mexican flu strain is no more deadly, it comes at a fragile moment. The financial crisis and resultant economic contraction is already taking heavy casualties on the businesses and economies most dependent on trade, transportation, tourism and lodging, which are most susceptible to the flu bug. 
 Moreover, governments are managerially challenged, with bank bailouts and huge stimulus packages to finance. A severe flu epidemic would open another front. After SARS, much was learned about epidemic control. For the sake of the global economy, this had better be a flu that can be easily contained.
 China and Gold
 China is warming to gold. Its reserves agency has increased holdings of the precious metal by 75 percent over the last six years. The gold bugs think Beijing sees inflation coming and the dollar sliding and wants to own something solid. But don't bet on a Chinese gold rush. 
 The authorities certainly aren't comfortable holding about $1.4 trillion of their $2 trillion in reserves in dollar-based assets. Large American fiscal deficits, partly financed by printing money, add to the discomfort. The central bank governor has already wished for a nonsovereign currency to replace the dollar as the global monetary lingua franca. 
 For now, gold could be the next best thing. But China, even after its latest increase, has just 1.6 percent of its foreign currency reserves in gold, far less than the 10 percent average held by other major economies, according to the World Gold Council. To get to even half of that, which would start to make gold a meaningful part of its mix of reserve assets, China would need to collect 5,575 more tons. That is 19 months' worth of the world's new supply. After subtracting steady demand for gold in jewelry and manufacturing, it is more like a decade's worth of the remaining available supply. 
 Yet any push by China to get to the 10 percent level depends on gold's price, and therein lies a conundrum. The more China purchases, the more the price will be forced up, even if the government embarks on a midsize buying spree. That would reduce the value of diversification. 
 China may have other reasons for not wanting to lift the price of gold. America holds 80 percent of its foreign currency reserves in gold, the largest of any country. A higher price would make America richer, on paper at least. A tenfold rise in the gold price would be enough to cancel out America's entire $2.5 trillion foreign net debt. 
 China is probably not eager to risk wasting some of the reserves it earned from years of lucrative exports on a spending spree that would inflate a potentially unsustainable gold-price bubble. That would amount to a back-door bailout of the United States -- the country whose profligate consumption it has partly financed. ROB COX and JOHN FOLEY

HEADLINE: Shaky on the Bottom Rung

BYLINE: By HILLARY CHURA

 BODY:
Hotel jobs have long offered a first step on the economic ladder to immigrants and people without a college education or work experience. But the steep drop in travel that started last fall has hit hotels hard and, in turn, buffeted already vulnerable workers. 
 Many housekeepers, bus boys, dishwashers, doormen, valets and customer service agents have either lost their jobs or are working significantly fewer hours. 
 In some cases, hotels have laid off workers and hired them back as independent contractors, without health insurance and other benefits. The fortunate have picked up other odd jobs at their current hotels, while some have scrambled to cobble together equally low-paying second and third positions elsewhere. 
 Carrie Tucker, a hotel housekeeper in Detroit, said she earned $9.17 an hour. Pushing a 150-pound stocked cart, she cleans 16 to 22 rooms a day when the hotel has guests and she is not called off from work. She said that her hours were whittled to fewer than 36 a week from 40 late last year and that she was behind on her rent and her gas and electricity bills. 
 ''I'm stressed out every day I go to work,'' Ms. Tucker said.
 Daniel Tjhin Chin said he was demoted in November to hotel telephone operator, from night manager at the Sacramento Marriott Rancho Cordova, and his weekly hours were cut to 32 from 40. Four weeks later, he was laid off. 
 ''I understand the recession, the crisis and the impact on the industry,'' he said ''I feel bad for whoever owns that hotel, but I hope I get a job as soon as possible because I'm running out of money.''
 The hotel layoffs, said Lalia Rach, dean of the Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, have had an inordinate impact on workers who were already living paycheck to paycheck -- large percentages of women, minorities, immigrants, single parents and welfare-to-work participants. 
 ''They are the vulnerable, but they are also what we built our country on,'' Ms. Rach said. ''As paychecks decline or go away, there is going to be a ripple effect on families who are living on the edge. It's going to cascade into taking away the American dream in its entirety.''
 Hotel workers generally have less education than the American work force as a whole -- 19.1 percent have no high school diploma, versus 8.8 percent of the total work force. Their wages last year were lower as well -- their median hourly rate was $9.78, while the national rate for all workers in all industries was $15.10, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 And while 8.8 percent of workers in the United States were unemployed in the first quarter of this year, the jobless rate for hotel employees was 11.7 percent, according to the bureau. The figures do not count those still employed but working fewer hours.
 Nor has there been much hiring. From July 2007 through February 2009, hotel industry job listings were down 28 percent, according to Simply Hired, a national online job search engine. Demand for valets was down 33 percent, housekeepers almost 50 percent and waiters 86 percent. 
 Hospitality employment may not bounce back until the beginning to middle of 2010, according to Adam Weissenberg, who leads the tourism, hospitality and leisure practice in the United States at Deloitte, the accounting firm. Other experts are even more pessimistic, predicting no rebound until the middle to end of next year, at the earliest. 
 Catherene Parker, who has a customer service job at the Marriott in San Jose, Calif., was able to cover her expenses with her pay of $15 an hour and consistent overtime. But she could save nothing. Late last year, when her overtime dried up, she said she found a job as a customer service representative at a shopping mall. Now, she works 40 hours a week at the hotel and 20 at the mall. 
 Van Valiant has managed to hold onto his job by participating in retraining programs and making himself as indispensable as possible. He started waiting tables at the Wyndham Garden Hotel in Austin, Tex., in May 2008. By fall, his hours were cut to 32 a week. He asked to be trained in other areas. Now the hotel's food and beverage supervisor, he can tend bar, cook, work at the hotel's front desk and do night auditing. He is back up to 40 hours a week, with frequent overtime.
 ''It's very easy to find another server,'' Mr. Valiant said. ''It makes sense to make yourself more valuable so that they don't want to get rid of you.'' 
 At the South Point Hotel, Casino and Spa in Las Vegas, Amy DeVincentis, a parking attendant, says colleagues take turns leaving early when it is slow so that pooled tips go further. 
 ''We understand that there are certain people that can't leave early because they need the extra money, because they do have a mortgage,'' Ms. DeVincentis said. ''No one gets upset if they really need to work their hours. We're all in this together.''

HEADLINE: Higher Alert Is Issued By W.H.O., With Advice

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.; Reporting was contributed by Marc Lacey from Perote, Mexico; Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City; Ian Austen from Ottawa; Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong; Victoria Burnett from Madrid; Reed Abelson, Sewell Chan, Denise Grady, Anemona Hartocollis, Michelle Higgins, Andrew Martin, Patrick McGeehan and Elisabeth Rosenthal from New York; Andrew Pollack and Rebecca Cathcart from Los Angeles; James C. McKinley Jr. from Laredo, Tex.; and Miguel Helft and Malia Wollan from San Francisco.

 BODY:
While confirmed cases of swine flu increased only slightly on Monday, the World Health Organization voted to raise its global pandemic flu alert level, but at the same time it recommended that borders not be closed nor travel bans imposed.
 The W.H.O.'s emergency committee, after meeting until 10:30 p.m. in Geneva, also recommended abandoning efforts to contain the flu's spread.
 ''Because the virus is already quite widespread in different locations, containment is not a feasible option,'' said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the organization's deputy director general.
 The W.H.O. also recommended that vaccine makers keep making the seasonal flu vaccine instead of switching over to a new one that matches the swine flu strain, but it urged them to start the process of picking a pandemic strain, weakening it and making large batches of it, which could take six months. 
 Dr. Fukuda emphasized that the committee thought that ''a pandemic is not inevitable -- the situation is fluid and will continue to evolve.''
 In Mexico, where the only related deaths have been reported, state health authorities looking for the initial source of the outbreak toured a million-pig hog farm in Perote, in Veracruz State. The plant is half-owned by Smithfield Foods, an American company and the world's largest pork producer. 
 Mexico's first known swine flu case, which was later confirmed, was from Perote, according to Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova. The case involved a 5-year-old boy who recovered.
 But a spokesman for the plant said the boy was not related to a plant worker, that none of its workers were sick and that its hogs were vaccinated against flu. 
 American officials said their response to the epidemic was already aggressive, and the W.H.O.'s decision to raise its pandemic alert to level 4 from level 3 would not change their plans. Level 4 means that there has been sustained human-to-human transmission.
 The W.H.O. decision offered some official guidance to a world that, at least for the day, seemed swept by confusion that unnerved international travelers and the financial markets. European and Asian markets fell, and stock in airlines and the travel industry fell while those in pharmaceutical companies rose.
 Pharmacies in New York reported runs on Tamiflu, an antiflu drug -- a reaction that public health officials badly want to avoid because the drug could eventually be needed for the truly ill. 
 For now supplies of Tamiflu and Relenza, another antiflu drug, remain adequate, the manufacturers said, but both were increasing production and expressed anxiety that shortages could develop if governments placed huge orders. 
 The travel issue was the most confusing. On Monday morning, the European Union appeared to issue and then rescind a ban on travel to the United States, drawing a rebuke from American officials, who themselves later suggested that Americans drop all nonessential travel to Mexico.
 The number of deaths in Mexico for which flu is believed responsible climbed to 149. That includes 20 in which the swine flu virus has been confirmed as the cause. 
 The number of confirmed cases of the virus in the United States increased to 50, with 28 of them from one New York City school. None of the American cases have been serious, but Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said he ''would not rest on that fact.''
 ''I expect that we will see additional cases, and I expect that the spectrum of disease will expand,'' he said at a news conference.
 Asked why the W.H.O. had waited so long to raise its alert level, Dr. Fukuda said it was done on technical grounds, that there was evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new virus and movement of that virus to new areas. But he conceded that ''the committee is very aware that changes have quite significant political and economic effects on countries.''
 The W.H.O. has no power to enforce any policies on member states, but different countries may have their own pandemic flu plans that are triggered by changes in the alert level.
 Spain and Scotland became the first places outside North America to confirm cases. Suspected cases appeared in Brazil, Australia, Israel and New Zealand, but confirmation is slow because most nations' laboratories lack the test kit the C.D.C. is developing for the new virus.
 The C.D.C. began sending out the new kits on Monday, meaning that soon some states and foreign countries will be able to make their own diagnoses -- a development that could lead to a sharp increase in confirmed cases.
 Confusion regarding Europe's position on travel arose when the European Union's health commissioner, Androulla Vassiliou, was questioned on a visit to Luxembourg and said Europeans ''should avoid traveling to Mexico or the United States unless it's very urgent.''
 Early reports of those remarks led both Dr. Besser and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York City to publicly disagree.
 ''We don't think there is any reason not to travel and come to New York,'' the mayor said. ''But they have to do what they think is right.''
 Ms. Vassiliou's office later denied she had issued any travel advisory and said she was only offering her personal opinion. ''She didn't want to insinuate risk where we're not sure,'' a spokesman said, adding that formal advice would be offered later.
 Mayor Bloomberg confirmed that there were now 28 cases in New York, all connected to St. Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens. He said there had been no suspected cases in any of the city's intensive-care units. He acknowledged an increase in emergency-room visits, but he said his preliminary information indicated that there were more people who were worried rather than seriously ill.
 New York's public health situation does not now resemble Mexico City's, the mayor said, and the public does not need to don masks. 
 In Europe, a spokesman for the Stockholm-based European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said there were about 40 suspected cases beyond the confirmed case in Spain.
 The United States pork industry continued to try to allay consumer concerns about their products. Many companies and hog farmers complained that the ''swine flu'' name was unfortunate and perhaps inaccurate because, so far, the virus appeared to be spreading without any contact with pigs.
 ''I guess everything has got to have a name,'' said Kyle Stephens, who raises show pigs in Amarillo, Tex. ''The biggest thing we are up against is people thinking the worst, instead of checking into it more.''

HEADLINE: Globalism Goes Viral

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
In these post-cold war days, we don't face a single concentrated threat. We face a series of decentralized, transnational threats: jihadi terrorism, a global financial crisis, global warming, energy scarcity, nuclear proliferation and, as we're reminded today, possible health pandemics like swine flu. 
 These decentralized threats grow out of the widening spread and quickening pace of globalization and are magnified by it. Instant global communication and rapid international travel can sometimes lead to universal, systemic shocks. A bank meltdown or a virus will not stay isolated. They have the potential to hit nearly everywhere at once. They can wreck the key nodes of complex international systems. 
 So how do we deal with these situations? Do we build centralized global institutions that are strong enough to respond to transnational threats? Or do we rely on diverse and decentralized communities and nation-states?
 A couple of years ago, G. John Ikenberry of Princeton wrote a superb paper making the case for the centralized response. He argued that America should help build a series of multinational institutions to address global problems. The great powers should construct an ''infrastructure of international cooperation ... creating shared capacities to respond to a wide variety of contingencies.'' 
 If you apply that logic to the swine flu, you could say that the world should beef up the World Health Organization to give it the power to analyze the spread of the disease, decide when and where quarantines are necessary and organize a single global response.
 If we had a body like that, we wouldn't be seeing the sort of frictions that are emerging from today's decentralized approach. Europe has offended the U.S. by warning its citizens not to travel across the Atlantic. Ukraine is restricting pork imports. Europe could horde flu vaccines, leaving the U.S., which has only one manufacturing plant, high and dry. Fear of a pandemic could lead to a restrictionist race, as nations compete to curtail movement and build walls.
 Those dangers are all real. Yet, so far, that's not the lesson of this crisis. The response to swine flu suggests that a decentralized approach is best. This crisis is only days old, yet we've already seen a bottom-up, highly aggressive response.
 In the first place, the decentralized approach is much faster. Mexico responded unilaterally and aggressively to close schools and cancel events. The U.S. has responded with astonishing speed, considering there are still few illnesses and just one hospitalization. 
 The Times published a photo on Monday of the New York City health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, leading a crisis response meeting. The photo is the very image of a focused, local response. People are wearing polo shirts and casual wear -- intensely concentrating on the concrete incidents in their own backyard.
 If the response were coordinated by a global agency, those local officials would not be so empowered. Power would be wielded by officials from nations that are far away and emotionally aloof from ground zero. The institution would have to poll its members, negotiate internal differences and proceed, as all multinationals do, at the pace of the most recalcitrant stragglers. 
 Second, the decentralized approach is more credible. It is a fact of human nature that in times of crisis, people like to feel protected by one of their own. They will only trust people who share their historical experience, who understand their cultural assumptions about disease and the threat of outsiders and who have the legitimacy to make brutal choices. If some authority is going to restrict freedom, it should be somebody elected by the people, not a stranger.
 Finally, the decentralized approach has coped reasonably well with uncertainty. It is clear from the response, so far, that there is an informal network of scientists who have met over the years and come to certain shared understandings about things like quarantining and rates of infection. It is also clear that there is a ton they don't understand. 
 A single global response would produce a uniform approach. A decentralized response fosters experimentation.
 The bottom line is that the swine flu crisis is two emergent problems piled on top of one another. At bottom, there is the dynamic network of the outbreak. It is fueled by complex feedback loops consisting of the virus itself, human mobility to spread it and environmental factors to make it potent. On top, there is the psychology of fear caused by the disease. It emerges from rumors, news reports, Tweets and expert warnings. 
 The correct response to these dynamic, decentralized, emergent problems is to create dynamic, decentralized, emergent authorities: chains of local officials, state agencies, national governments and international bodies that are as flexible as the problem itself. 
 Swine flu isn't only a health emergency. It's a test for how we're going to organize the 21st century. Subsidiarity works best.

HEADLINE: Shares Drop Amid Market Concerns Over Swine Flu

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As fears grew about a deadly outbreak of swine flu, investors on Monday performed the financial equivalent of washing their hands and donning surgical masks. They bought heavily into drug stocks, spurned the Mexican peso and shied away from pork producers. 
 Broader stock markets trembled in the first half of the day, and gave up moderate gains as investors watched to see how far the flu cases would spread, and whether concerns about a pandemic were exaggerated or legitimate. The rash of cases began in Mexico and has spread to the United States and Canada. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 51.29 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 8,025, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1 percent, or 8.72 points, at 857.51, after a week of light losses for the major stock indexes. The Nasdaq fell 0.9 percent, or 14.88 points, to 1,679.41.
 American-traded shares of the European companies GlaxoSmithKline and Roche Holding, which make prescription flu drugs, closed higher -- a sign that investors are betting they will benefit as governments worldwide increase their stockpiles of antiviral drugs.
 On Friday Novavax, an American vaccine maker, soared 75 percent in New York, though it was not clear if that movement reflected anything more than a rush by investors into any stock that might conceivably gain from the epidemic. The stock rose an additional 79.6 percent Monday to $2.55.
 ''We've seen these kind of effects with outbreaks before,'' said Richard Purkiss, a drug sector analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. ''Generally speaking, you get a rally in stocks that have any kind of links to influenza.'' 
 Airline and travel companies fell sharply as the European Union urged Europeans not to travel to the United States, where some 40 cases of swine flu have been confirmed, including 28 in New York City, one of the biggest travel hubs and tourist destinations in the country. 
 Shares of Continental, Delta and the parent companies of American Airlines and United Airlines were all down by double-digit percentages. The huge cruise operator Carnival fell 13.5 percent on worries about the outbreak's potential effect on tourism to Mexico and other destinations.
 If the outbreak spreads rapidly and nervous travelers decide to stay home, airlines already struggling to endure the economic slump could suffer another setback during their peak summer months, said Hunter K. Keay, an airline analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. Mr. Keay said he was still more concerned about airlines' longer-term problems, but said investors seemed shaken up on Monday.
 ''They're drawing conclusions that if this outbreak does turn into an epidemic, it would have an impact on travel,'' he said.
 Companies that make pork products and slaughter hogs were also hurting. Hormel, the maker of Spam, and the pork producer Smithfield Foods fell after countries including Lebanon, Thailand and Indonesia imposed restrictions on pork imports, raising fears that countries would hastily build trade barriers as they rush to contain the disease.
 Health officials in the United States, the National Pork Producers Council and hog producers scrambled to reassure the public that people could not contract swine flu by eating pork. 
 Still, hog futures fell to their lowest price in a year, and an analyst at JPMorgan Chase downgraded Smithfield and Tyson Foods on Monday. Despite the lack of a link between pork consumption and swine flu, ''the fear generated by a disease named after hogs cannot be good for pork consumption,'' the analyst, Kenneth Goldman, wrote in a note.
 The price of longer-term Treasury debt rose, a sign of more defensive behavior by investors and a response to an announcement that the Federal Reserve had bought $7 billion in Treasury debt. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 22/32, to 98 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 2.91 percent from nearly 3 percent late Friday.
 But declines in the United States turned into a rout in Mexico, the center of the outbreak, where 149 people have died and more than 1,300 have probably been infected. The Mexican Bolsa stock index dropped more than 3 percent, the peso fell 4 percent against the dollar, and shares of Mexican food companies, retailers and transportation companies dropped sharply.
 Elsewhere in financial markets, investors pushed shares of General Motors 20.7 percent higher to $2.04 after the automaker said it needed an additional $11 billion from the government and was prepared to file for bankruptcy if a proposed exchange of debt for equity did not succeed.
 General Motors said it was also planning to close more plants and dealerships and eliminate its Pontiac brand as it tries to turn itself around and end quarter after quarter of billion-dollar losses.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Portfolio Magazine Shut, A Victim of Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Portfolio, the ambitious, glossy business magazine from Conde Nast Publications, closed Monday after just two years. Joanne Lipman, editor in chief, and Tom Wallace, editorial director of Conde Nast, met with editorial staff members and announced that the magazine and its Web site, Portfolio.com, were shutting down, effective immediately.
 Most of the $100 million pledged toward the start-up is gone, sunk into the very expensive printing, paper, marketing and editorial costs that go with creating a magazine, especially one published by Conde Nast. The now-folded magazine may be the last of a breed, an attempt by a Manhattan media company to build a large magazine franchise from the ground up. 
 Senior executives at the company made the decision to close Portfolio last Friday. Ms. Lipman was told to go to the office of S. I. Newhouse at 8:30 a.m. Monday, where he told her. William Li, the publisher, met with the business staff at 9:30, and Ms. Lipman met with her staff at 9:45 and delivered the news. According to people who were there, she was frank in her disappointment at the closing and lavish in her praise. She ordered lunch in for staff members, who were told that they would be permitted to return to their offices until Thursday. In all, approximately 85 people will lose their jobs. 
 The fact that the April issue, published at a time of maximum business tumult, featured a cover shot of Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska and unsuccessful candidate for vice president, seemed to etch the perils of executing business journalism on a monthly schedule during an era when financial scoops are often measured in seconds. Mr. Wallace, editorial director of Conde Nast, said that Ms. Lipman, who had been criticized during her tenure for odd cover decisions, ''was the right editor for Portfolio and created a magazine that Conde Nast was proud to publish.''
 In a phone call, Ms. Lipman cited Portfolio's accomplishments, including a National Magazine Award for its ''Briefs'' section. ''I'm tremendously proud of the magazine and the talented people who worked here,'' she said. ''We were ahead of the financial crisis, we broke news, and the staff has done exactly what we set out to do.''
 The money-losing magazine laid off most of its Web site staff last October and its frequency was reduced to 10 times a year from monthly, but tweaking on the cost side could hardly match the plummet in advertising. With the reduction in frequency, Portfolio advertising revenue was off more than 60 percent in the first quarter. Mr. Newhouse and Charles H. Townsend, president and chief executive, decided that the company could no longer afford to invest in a magazine that showed no sign of overcoming a historic recession in advertising. 
 ''We believed in the editorial concept and still do,'' said David Carey, the group publisher at Conde Nast who helped start the magazine. ''The problem in terms of the ad franchise was that the timing turned out to be terrible, launching right into the teeth of a very deep recession.''
 When Portfolio was conceived in 2005, most start-ups in the journalism space had moved to the Web, and by the time the magazine came out in April 2007, many print publications were already struggling. Conde Nast, which has historically published magazines for years and even decades before they found their footing, apparently no longer has that luxury now that its established magazines are struggling and the more than 30 newspapers owned by its parent company, Advance Publications, are deeply troubled.
 In the last several years, the company has closed House & Garden and Jane, opened and then closed Cargo, Vitals and Domino. Men's Vogue, which was published 10 times a year, became an insert in Vogue Magazine. Of its newer magazines, only Cookie, a parenting magazine, and Teen Vogue continue to publish.
 Mr. Carey said that each of the five categories that Portfolio depended on -- financial services, business-to-business, automotive, travel and luxury goods -- was in retreat, a fact that was reflected by the first-quarter performance of other magazines in the category. BusinessWeek was down 39.8 percent in advertising pages, while Fortune was off 26.3 percent and Forbes was down 15 percent. 
 Despite cuts at Portfolio, some of the old Conde Nast ways remained. To illustrate a November 2008 article arguing that credit derivatives were ''the elephant in the room'' at JPMorgan Chase, the magazine spent what one staff member, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said was $30,000 to procure the services of a real elephant to menace a model at a photo shoot. 
 ''There was an atmosphere of unreality to some of it,'' said a member of the magazine's staff, who asked not to be identified in an effort to remain in the good graces of a company that might provide a job. ''We did good work here, some of it great, but at a certain point you knew that it was going to end.''

HEADLINE: Lacy Threads and Leather Straps Bind a Business

BYLINE: By ADAM B. ELLICK

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan 

 BODY:
In Pakistan, a flogger is known only as the Taliban's choice whip for beating those who defy their strict codes of Islam.
 But deep in the nation's commercial capital, just next door to a mosque and the offices of a radical Islamic organization, in an unmarked house two Pakistani brothers have discovered a more liberal and lucrative use for the scourge: the $3 billion fetish and bondage industry in the West.
 Their mom-and-pop-style garment business, AQTH, earns more than $1 million a year manufacturing 2,000 fetish and bondage products, including the Mistress Flogger, and exporting them to the United States and Europe. 
 The Qadeer brothers, Adnan, 34, and Rizwan, 32, have made the business into an improbable success story in a country where bars are illegal and the poor are often bound to a lifetime in poverty. 
 If the bondage business seems an unlikely pursuit for two button-down, slightly awkward, decidedly deadpan lower-class Pakistanis, it is. But then, discretion has been their byword. The brothers have taken extreme measures to conceal a business that in this deeply conservative Muslim country is as risky as it is risque.
 It helps that the dozens of veiled and uneducated female laborers who assemble the handmade items -- gag balls, lime-green corsets, thonged spanking skirts -- have no idea what the items are used for. Even the owners' wives, and their conservative Muslim mother, have not been informed. 
 ''If our mom knew, she would disown us,'' said Adnan, seated on a leopard-print fabric covering his desk chair.
 ''Due to cultural barriers and religion, people don't discuss these things openly,'' Rizwan said. ''We have to hide this information.'' 
 Even customs officials were perplexed at how to tax the items, not quite sure what they were, they said. 
 Recently, when a curious employee inquired about the purpose of the sleep sack, a sleeping bag-like product used in certain kinds of bondage, she was told it was a body bag for the American military in Iraq.
 Adnan Ahmed, a former air traffic controller who is now AQTH's chief operating officer, said the items were undergarments. When asked if he considered a red-hot puppy mask an undergarment, he had a straightforward, but honest reply: ''No. It's just for joking.''
 Still, word of the business has at times escaped. Last year four ''powerful guys'' from a conservative Muslim group threatened to burn down the factory if it was not closed within a week. The brothers calmly explained that it was merely a business, and that the items were not used in Pakistan. The next day they bribed a local Islamic political organization to ensure their safety. 
 These days, the gravest danger is Pakistan's crumbling economy. The brothers idolize former President Pervez Musharraf, crediting their success to his industry friendly policies, like not requiring export licenses and banning trade unions. When Mr. Musharraf resigned last year, the brothers ''didn't eat for three days,'' Adnan Qadeer said.
 Since President Asif Ali Zardari took office, Adnan said, trade unions have been legalized and prices of some raw materials, including leather, have shot up, as have interest rates. The result: a 15 percent dip in AQTH's profits.
 Echoing the pervasive fears of entrepreneurs across the country, the brothers are considering relocating to East Asia if Pakistan becomes more unstable -- or if they receive another threat.
 The shoddy factory seems like an ode to their humble upbringing. Adnan's executive bathroom has no toilet paper. Rizwan has no office. And their preferred lunch is Kentucky Fried Chicken.
 Their inspiration for success came from their father, a civil servant who supported a family of six with a $150 monthly salary. While other children were forced into labor, or played aimlessly, the Qadeer brothers had to study.
 In 2001, after the brothers graduated from a university, their father lent them $800, enough to purchase their first computer and to cover several months of rent on a studio apartment. There, the brothers searched the Internet day and night for a high-value garment product that was not widely available. 
 They experimented with basic leather goods, like jackets and pants. Adnan slept at mosquito-infested stitching factories to oversee sample runs that, in the end, proved more costly than their Chinese competitors.
 ''It was very hard time,'' Adnan said. ''We had nothing in our pockets, not even money to fuel our motorbike.''
 Rizwan said: ''People used to say: 'You can't do business in Pakistan. You're wasting your time. Just go get a job.' '' But our father boosted our morale.''
 The brothers said Pakistan's ''stone-age production'' worked to their advantage. The country, they said, lacks visionary product development. ''Everyone's still making the same products,'' Adnan said.
 Then, they discovered a kind of straitjacket online. At first, they thought it was used for psychiatric patients, but it quickly led them to learn about the lucrative fetish industry.
 Without family connections in the finance industry, and with nothing to mortgage, they were refused a loan by four banks. ''Our education was our only connection,'' Rizwan said.
 They finally secured a loan from an American bank, and then the Sept. 11 attacks offered a timely chance. Orders for garment exports were canceled across Pakistan in the slower economic climate, allowing the prices of raw materials like leather to be cut in half.
 But fear after Sept. 11 raised suspicions among their own Western clients. On Sept. 12, 2001, a customer sent an e-mail message with a photo of two F-16s flying over Pakistan. Orders were canceled. 
 Today, they sell their products to online and brick-and-mortar shops, and to individuals via eBay. Their market research, they said, showed that 70 percent of their customers were middle- to upper-class Americans, and a majority of them Democrats. The Netherlands and Germany account for the bulk of their European sales.
 ''We really believe that if you are persistent and hard working, there is an opportunity, in any harsh environment, even in an economically depressed environment like Pakistan,'' Rizwan said.
 A major perk, they say, is attending international fetish shows to see how their products hold up in action.
 ''I go to Sin City every year,'' said Rizwan, referring to Las Vegas in a sheepish laugh. It's all business, he said. ''Clients know our country and culture, and they don't invite us to participate. We're a little bit shy.''

HEADLINE: Glorious Stadium Honors a Glorious Past

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS 

 BODY:
 Like ancient Xian statue-warriors guarding the Chinese emperor for eternity, 10 St. Louis immortals stand on permanent patrol outside Busch Stadium.
 Surely, nothing bad can ever happen at this ballpark -- not with Bob Gibson pitching inside (way inside) and Country Slaughter sliding spikes up (way up) at the corner of Eighth and Clark.
 Not only does St. Louis do baseball very well, it does stadiums well, too. For a New Yorker who has witnessed the inaugurals of two expensive and imperfect ballparks, it has been a huge thrill to wander around the third Busch Stadium, which opened in 2006 to few cavils from the public. 
 This city knows how to celebrate its glorious baseball history, with exquisite feng shui, for all the world to see. Before and after games, the fans mill around the 10 Harry Weber statues, St. Louis immortals in visceral action.
 Meanwhile, New York has the $1.5 billion fortress of the Bronx, which I like to think of as Yankeeland, where the great tradition is enclosed behind forbidding walls, with great swaths of empty luxury seats embarrassing baseball if not the un-embarrassable Yankee management. And in Queens, there is the $800 million Mets stadium named for a failing bank subsidized by us, with sightlines that are enraging thousands of fans who expected more from their costly investment.
 Funny thing, St. Louis even knows how to camouflage empty seats -- paint 'em all red. Not to call Cardinals fans conformists, you understand, but every single one of them wears a red shirt, red slacks, a red cap and red shoes. There were empty red seats when the Mets were in town last week, but it was hardly noticeable. 
 ''We expected our revenue to be down,'' said Bill DeWitt Jr., chairman of the Cardinals, whose family went into the baseball business in this town in 1916. DeWitt said the Cardinals anticipated a dip in attendance and sponsorship this year, and added, ''I don't think any team is escaping it.'' 
 The Cardinals were ranked the eighth-most valuable baseball franchise in a recent study by Forbes, behind the Yankees, who were ranked first at $1.5 billion, presumably by selling wine-and-shrimp luxury to bankers and brokers, who have been among the missing this season. 
 ''There's no cookie-cutter pattern,'' said Bob DuPuy, the president of Major League Baseball, referring to ticket policies. DuPuy, who was in St. Louis last week to promote the All-Star Game in July, added: ''New York happened to have a double whammy of two new stadiums and the economy. I'm sure they will work it out.''
 St. Louis does not get too greedy, as shown in one simple comparison: last year the ticket range for the All-Star Game in the old Yankee Stadium was $150 to $725. This year the Cardinals priced All-Star tickets from $100 to $360.
 The DeWitts have paid attention to the basics at Busch III: wide corridors, attractive food stands, lots of pleasant corners and plenty of the traditional red brick, once made by the Berras and the Garagiolas at the Laclede brickworks. There are plenty of income-producing advertisements, but Busch III somehow seems more tasteful than the new Mets and Yankees palaces, which have all the subtlety of a Nascar automobile. 
 The playing field has avoided the intentionally quirky corners and gimmicks of many newer ballparks. 
 ''Our No. 1 criteria was that we wanted it to play like the other Busch,'' said Tony La Russa, the Cardinals' manager. ''We wanted it to play fair for the hitters and the pitchers. That's the way the game should be.''
 DeWitt said, ''My belief is that asymmetry should be the result of the uniqueness of the site, not just dreamed out of nowhere.'' 
 Things are just more conservative in this river town, where the Cardinals have won 10 World Series, second only to the Yankees' 26. The Mets have won two Series in their first 47 seasons, and management is hearing it from fans who say Mets history has been minimized at the new place. 
 What do Mets fans want -- statues of Marvelous Marv Throneberry missing first and second base on a triple in 1962? Timo Perez shifting into a lower gear on a drive he imagined would be a home run in 2000? Nolan Ryan and Lenny Dykstra packing their bags? 
 The Mets have produced exactly one homegrown Hall of Famer, Tom Seaver, and a few spectacular underachievers, relying mostly on superb imports like Keith Hernandez, Gary Carter and Mike Piazza. Even factoring in Casey Stengel and Gil Hodges, that does not add up to a statue garden just yet.
 Cardinals history is worth the public promenade on a major corner behind left field. There are two immortals who were never Cardinals: George Sisler, the nonpareil star of the vanished Browns, and Cool Papa Bell, the St. Louis resident whose services were not wanted by organized baseball because of his race. 
 And there are eight Cardinals: Rogers Hornsby, Dizzy Dean, Ozzie Smith, Red Schoendienst, Gibson, Slaughter, Lou Brock and Stan Musial. (Mark McGwire is in the attic until further notice; Albert Pujols is a statue-in-progress; and there is the larger Musial statue that Stan the Man never liked.) 
 The display is not quite the thousands of terra-cotta warriors uncovered in the past century in Xian. But on game day the statues give a warm feel of permanence for a proud franchise in a grand baseball town.

HEADLINE: Obama Nudging Views on Race, A Survey Finds

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Megan Thee-Brenan, Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Barack Obama's presidency seems to be altering the public perception of race relations in the United States. Two-thirds of Americans now say race relations are generally good, and the percentage of blacks who say so has doubled since last July, according to the latest New York Times/ CBS News poll.
 Despite that, half of blacks still say whites have a better chance of getting ahead in American society, the poll found. Black Americans remain among the president's staunchest supporters; 70 percent of black respondents now say the country is headed in the right direction, compared with 34 percent of whites. 
 The poll found broad support for Mr. Obama's approach on a variety of issues, including one of the most contentious: whether Congress should investigate the harsh interrogation tactics authorized by George W. Bush. Sixty-two percent of Americans share Mr. Obama's view that hearings are unnecessary.
 Americans seem to have high hopes for the president; 72 percent said they were optimistic about the next four years. By and large, Americans expect him to make significant progress in health care, energy and immigration policy, issues central to his ambitious domestic agenda. 
 But the optimism is tempered by a feeling of resignation about two of the most difficult challenges he faces: reviving the economy and ending United States military involvement in Iraq. Most Americans say Mr. Obama has begun to make progress on both fronts, but many do not expect either the recession or the war to be over by the end of his term.
 It is not unusual for new presidents to enjoy substantial public support at this point in their tenure. But Mr. Obama's 68 percent job approval rating is higher than that of any recent president at the 100-day mark. Mr. Bush had the approval of 56 percent of the public at this juncture.
 But while Americans clearly have faith in Mr. Obama, the poll revealed something of a disconnect between what the public thinks the president has already accomplished and what it expects him to achieve.
 Fewer than half of those surveyed, 48 percent, said Mr. Obama had begun to make progress on one of his major campaign promises, changing the way business is conducted in Washington. And just 39 percent said he had begun to make progress on another major promise, cutting taxes for middle-class Americans, even though the stimulus bill he signed into law does include a middle class tax cut.
 Mr. Obama will mark his 100th day in office on Wednesday with a trip to St. Louis and a prime time news conference, where aides say he will make the case that he has made ''a down payment'' on fixing the nation's biggest problems. The poll found that Americans seem to share that view, suggesting the White House has been effective at casting Mr. Obama as an agent of change, while persuading the public that change will take time.
 ''With all Obama wants to do and all he's got going, it's going to take more than four years,'' said Larry Gibbons, 58, a retired restaurant manager and a Republican in Phoenix who voted for Mr. Obama's opponent, John McCain. Speaking in a follow-up interview to the poll, he said, ''Obama is attacking everything at once and I do approve of that.''
 Throughout Mr. Obama's candidacy and his young presidency, race has been a subtle thread woven through his message of change. Yet the president shies away from talking about it. In response to a question at his last news conference, Mr. Obama conceded that his election had created ''justifiable pride on the part of the country,'' then quickly shifted gears, adding, ''That lasted about a day.'' 
 But Americans do feel differently about race and race relations with Mr. Obama in the White House, according to poll respondents who spoke in follow-up interviews. Some, like Jacqueline Luster, 60, a retired bank employee in Macedonia, Ohio, say that the times are changing, and that Mr. Obama seems to be speeding that change.
 ''With him as president, people seem to be working together toward the same goals, and that has helped race relations,'' said Ms. Luster, who is black and a Democrat. ''Before there was more of a separation, blacks working for black goals and whites for white goals. Obama has helped change the perception of blacks in a positive way, but it's also the times.''
 Another Democrat, Lisa Fleming, 49, who is white, said that even in the small Illinois town, Potomac, where she lived, she noticed ''people of different races being kinder to each other'' since Mr. Obama's election. In Kansas City, a white Republican homemaker, Mary Robertson, 78, said Mr. Obama's ''openness and acceptance have helped others be more open and accepting.''
 The nationwide telephone survey was conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 973 adults. For purposes of analysis, blacks were oversampled in this poll, for a total of 212, and then weighted back to their proper proportion in the poll, based on the census. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all people, and plus or minus seven points for blacks.
 After nearly 100 days of watching Mr. Obama conduct the affairs of state, more than two-thirds of Americans say he is not a typical politician, though most say he is set apart more by his style and his personal qualities than his policies.
 For instance, the poll found that the public appears divided over whether the Obama administration has broken with the Bush administration in its overall foreign policy. Forty-three percent of respondents said there had been some change in foreign policy since Mr. Obama took office, the poll found, while 44 percent said there had been no change. Thirteen percent did not have an opinion.
 Yet the public does give Mr. Obama credit for improving the image of the United States with the rest of the world. And it found support for Mr. Obama's overtures to Iran and Cuba; a majority, 53 percent, said they favored establishing diplomatic relations with Iran, while two-thirds favored Mr. Obama's plans to thaw relations with Cuba.

HEADLINE: Democrats Like Any Plan For M.T.A. That Can Pass

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and WILLIAM NEUMAN; Nicholas Confessore reported from Albany and William Neuman from New York.

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Weary Democratic leaders admitted with unusual candor on Monday that they would consider virtually any proposal to bail out the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as long as it could win the 32 votes needed for approval in the State Senate.
 ''It's not about merit,'' said Malcolm A. Smith, the Senate majority leader, after emerging from a private meeting with Gov. David A. Paterson and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. ''It's just about what gets us there with the votes that we need to get it passed.''
 Mr. Paterson and Mr. Silver both favor rescue plans that would use a combination of new bridge tolls and payroll taxes to raise revenue for the transportation authority, while the Senate Transportation Committee voted on Monday along party lines to advance an alternative bill. It includes a $1 surcharge on taxi rides in place of the tolls, a step intended to placate New York City Democrats from outside Manhattan; the bill also includes some financing for bridge and road projects outside the city, money aimed at winning over Republicans. 
 The three men conceded that none of the proposals appeared likely to get 32 votes in the Senate, the minimum needed to pass in a full vote. All the Democratic proposals include some form of a payroll tax, which at least four Democrats oppose, regardless of whether the plan also includes taxi surcharges or tolls. No Republican appears ready to support the Senate Democrats' plan.
 ''I think the issues could be resolved,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''But the issues of voting seem to be the major issue, and I'm somewhat just offended by that at this point, because as professionals we've got to resolve this. Every day that we don't we're losing money.''
 Though Mr. Silver has not formally introduced his own bailout bill in the Assembly, he said that with weeks to go before the authority imposes severe service cuts and fare increases, he would be open to virtually any plan that could win a majority in the Senate.
 ''I can support a bill that has 32 votes in the Senate, that we can look at seriously as a way to solve the problem,'' Mr. Silver said. ''Nobody likes taxes. Nobody likes fare hikes. Nobody likes service cutbacks.''
 Speaking of the Senate Democrats' bill, Mr. Silver added: ''Does it get some of those Republicans who are now standing on the politics of it to put up or shut up? If it does that, that's fine.''
 Speaking separately after the meeting, Mr. Paterson said Senate Republicans had approached him with some alternative suggestions, though he declined to describe them in any detail. 
 John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said staff members had worked out a variation on Mr. Paterson's proposal. He would not share details except to say that it did not include a payroll tax. ''That is a nonstarter for us,'' Mr. McArdle said.
 As negotiations stalled in the Capitol on Monday, the authority released a new financial forecast showing that the slumping economy would increase its budget gap this year by $621 million, even after planned fare and toll increases of up to 30 percent and service cuts go into effect. Next year's deficit is now estimated at more than $1 billion. 
 Without a rescue package from Albany, the authority will now have to consider additional budget-balancing measures, which could include further fare and toll increases and service cuts before the end of the year. 
 Because job losses in New York City mean that fewer commuters are taking buses and trains to work, or paying to drive across bridges and tunnels, the authority is predicting a $221 million drop in its projected fare and toll revenue. 
 The biggest factor contributing to the new budget gap is a drop in taxes on real estate transactions and mortgages, which are projected to be $336 million lower than the authority estimated when it approved its 2009 budget in December. 
 The authority must operate with a balanced budget. Its 2009 budget used broad spending cuts, fare and toll increases and other measures to close a gap originally estimated at $1.2 billion. The new forecasts show that those measures will not be enough.

HEADLINE: Cheney for President

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Watching Dick Cheney defend the Bush administration's interrogation policies, it's been hard to escape the impression that both the Republican Party and the country would be better off today if Cheney, rather than John McCain, had been a candidate for president in 2008.
 Certainly Cheney himself seems to feel that way. Last week's Sean Hannity interview, all anti-Obama jabs and roundhouses, was the latest installment in the vice president's unexpected and, to Republican politicians, distinctly unwelcome transformation from election-season wallflower into high-profile spokesman for the conservative opposition. George W. Bush seems happy to be back in civilian life, but Cheney has taken the fight to the Obama White House like a man who wouldn't have minded campaigning for a third Bush-Cheney term. 
 Imagine for a moment that he'd had that chance. Imagine that he'd damned the poll numbers, broken his oft-repeated pledge that he had no presidential ambitions of his own, and shouldered his way into the race. Imagine that Republican primary voters, more favorably disposed than most Americans to Cheney and the administration he served, had rewarded him with the nomination.
 At the very least, a Cheney-Obama contest would have clarified conservatism's present political predicament. In the wake of two straight drubbings at the polls, much of the American right has comforted itself with the idea that conservatives lost the country primarily because the Bush-era Republican Party spent too much money on social programs. And John McCain's defeat has been taken as the vindication of this premise. 
 We tried running the maverick reformer, the argument goes, and look what it got us. What Americans want is real conservatism, not some crypto-liberal imitation.
 ''Real conservatism,'' in this narrative, means a particular strain of right-wingery: a conservatism of supply-side economics and stress positions, uninterested in social policy and dismissive of libertarian qualms about the national-security state. And Dick Cheney happens to be its diamond-hard distillation. The former vice-president kept his distance from the Bush administration's attempts at domestic reform, and he had little time for the idealistic, religiously infused side of his boss's policy agenda. He was for tax cuts at home and pre-emptive warfare overseas; anything else he seemed to disdain as sentimentalism. 
 This is precisely the sort of conservatism that's ascendant in today's much-reduced Republican Party, from the talk radio dials to the party's grassroots. And a Cheney-for-President campaign would have been an instructive test of its political viability. 
 As a candidate, Cheney would have doubtless been as disciplined and ideologically consistent as McCain was feckless. In debates with Barack Obama, he would have been as cuttingly effective as he was in his encounters with Joe Lieberman and John Edwards in 2000 and 2004 respectively. And when he went down to a landslide loss, the conservative movement might might! have been jolted into the kind of rethinking that's necessary if it hopes to regain power.
 If a Cheney defeat could have been good for the Republican Party; a Cheney campaign could have been good for the country. The former vice-president's post-election attacks on Obama are bad form, of course, under the peculiar rules of Washington politesse. But they're part of an argument about the means and ends of our interrogation policy that should have happened during the general election and didn't because McCain wasn't a supporter of the Bush-era approach, and Obama didn't see a percentage in harping on the topic. 
 He wasn't alone. A large swath of the political class wants to avoid the torture debate. The Obama administration backed into it last week, and obviously wants to back right out again. 
 But the argument isn't going away. It will be with us as long as the threat of terrorism endures. And where the Bush administration's interrogation programs are concerned, we've heard too much to just ''look forward,'' as the president would have us do. We need to hear more: What was done and who approved it, and what intelligence we really gleaned from it. Not so that we can prosecute unless the Democratic Party has taken leave of its senses but so that we can learn, and pass judgment, and struggle toward consensus.
 Here Dick Cheney, prodded by the ironies of history into demanding greater disclosure about programs he once sought to keep completely secret, has an important role to play. He wants to defend his record; let him defend it. And let the country judge. 
 But better if this debate had happened during the campaign season. And better, perhaps, if Cheney himself had been there to have it out.

HEADLINE: When Banks Discriminate

 BODY:
The Supreme Court hears arguments on Tuesday in a case that gives the justices a particularly timely chance to allow state officials to act when national banks break the law. 
 The case, which turns on whether state banking officials can investigate discriminatory lending by nationally chartered banks, comes after years in which regulators in Washington did tremendous damage to both consumers and banks by failing to do their jobs. 
 In 2005, Eliot Spitzer, then New York's attorney general, led an investigation of several state and national banks over claims that black and Hispanic borrowers were being charged higher interest rates than white borrowers. Mr. Spitzer sent letters of inquiry to several national banks asking them to provide relevant information.
 New York's was only one of many investigations of illegal banking practices taking place at the state level. In 2002, attorneys general and state banking officials from all 50 states settled a major case with Household Finance's parent company over its predatory lending practices. But instead of helping the states, the Bush administration sided with the banks. In 2004, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a rule designed to block state regulators from investigating national banks.
 Mr. Spitzer's efforts a year later met with similar resistance. Shortly after he sent his letters of inquiry, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Clearing House Association, a consortium of national banks, sued. They argued that any effort by the attorney general to enforce fair-lending laws against national banks interfered with the comptroller's exclusive authority to regulate them.
 This argument unduly restricts the role of the states. Ever since the national banking system was created, both federal and state laws have applied to national banks. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that states can sue national banks to enforce their own laws in matters like consumer protection. 
 And if the banks prevail in this case, consumers will be the losers. The current banking crisis is a result of the radical anti-regulatory policies that took hold in Washington. States, it is now clear, are often more willing than the federal government to hold banks accountable.
 The banks' position is part of a larger campaign by business interests to pre-empt state protections in several areas. Federal pre-emption of this kind leaves consumers with fewer people looking out for their interests. The Supreme Court can strike a blow for ordinary Americans by upholding the right of states to protect their citizens from illegal banking practices.

HEADLINE: Financier Invests Cautiously in India

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

DATELINE: MUMBAI 

 BODY:
Henry R. Kravis, one of the three founders of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis & Roberts, told reporters here on Monday that he was ''reasonably optimistic'' about both India and the world economy, saying ''rays of sunshine are starting to show up.'' 
 Mr. Kravis also said that his firm was committed to investing in India, but would do so at a slow and steady pace.
 Unlike competitors like the Blackstone Group, K.K.R. has been a relatively late entrant to the Indian market. The firm has made just two sizable investments here and only recently hired a senior Indian executive, Sanjay Nayar, to oversee its operation in India. Mr. Nayar previously led Citigroup's Indian unit. 
 ''India is a very special place for us because we really believe in the future of India,'' said Mr. Kravis, who was in Mumbai to visit K.K.R.'s new office. But he added that the firm was ''not going to rush in to do anything.''
 Mr. Kravis said his firm had already turned down several deals that it had been offered in India because the price, corporate strategy or management team was not a good fit.
 Like other private equity firms, K.K.R. has been hit hard by the global financial crisis. The value of its investments has fallen significantly, and banks and bond investors are no longer willing to lend it easy money. K.K.R.'s plans to become a publicly traded firm have been delayed repeatedly.
 In India, K.K.R. will face an additional set of challenges that have limited the activities and reach of foreign private equity firms. 
 It is hard to acquire 100 percent ownership of companies here because of government limits on foreign investment or resistance from the families that often control businesses here. And it can often be impossible to line up financing from banks or the corporate bond market to take public companies private, as is common in the United States and Europe.
 As a result, most private equity firms doing business here take minority stakes in companies that need capital to grow and rarely acquire entire companies.
 K.K.R., for instance, has invested $250 million in a telecommunications infrastructure company, Bharti Infratel, which is part of a bigger conglomerate.
 In 2007, K.K.R. and other firms acquired the controlling stake in Aricent, a software company, for $900 million. Aricent is based in California now but was formed in India and still has a sizable presence here.

HEADLINE: U.S. Ready to Lead on Climate Pact, Clinton Says

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After eight years largely on the sidelines of the international policy debate on climate change, the United States is prepared to lead negotiations toward a new global warming treaty, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday. 
 ''The United States is fully engaged and determined to lead and make up for lost time both at home and abroad,'' Mrs. Clinton told delegates from 16 countries at a State Department conference on energy and climate. ''We are back in the game.''
 The meeting in Washington was the first of three planned sessions among the participating countries, who together account for roughly 75 percent of emissions of the gases blamed for the heating of the planet. Officials said the conference, the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, was intended to supplement, not replace, broader talks that begin in Copenhagen in December to write a new international treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol. 
 The Kyoto accord, which was negotiated in 1997 by the United Nations and expires in 2012, set emissions targets for industrialized nations, but many have not met them. The United States never ratified the treaty, in part because it did not include growing economies like China and India. 
 Mrs. Clinton said there was no longer any question that growing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases were causing a warming of the planet, with potentially catastrophic results. She said global climate change posed environmental, economic, health and security challenges that must be addressed by individual countries and by the community of nations.
 Speaking directly to representatives of developing nations, who are skeptical of the motives of the United States and other industrialized countries on the issue, Mrs. Clinton that the United States would not seek to limit the use of energy in the developing world but would help make it cleaner.
 ''We want your economies to grow,'' she said as representatives of Brazil, China, India and Indonesia listened. ''We want your people to have a higher standard of living.''
 Dinesh K. Patnaik, a member of the Indian delegation, said his country was glad to see the Obama administration taking climate change seriously and devoting significant money and political attention to the issue. 
 Mr. Patnaik said India and other developing nations hoped the talks would establish a level of trust with the industrial world that had so far been lacking.
 ''We want assurances that the developed countries will not renege on their commitments,'' he said, adding, ''The United States cannot solve the world's problems, but the problems cannot be solved without the United States.'' 
 The meeting concludes Tuesday. American officials said they did not expect the group to issue any major policy statements.

HEADLINE: Latest G.M. Plan Cuts More Jobs, Halves Dealers

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
For all the uncertainty swirling around General Motors, the troubled automaker said Monday that one thing was clear: it must become drastically smaller if it hopes to remain a viable company, regardless of whether it has to file for bankruptcy.
 G.M. said it would eliminate another 21,000 factory jobs, close 13 plants, cut its vast network of 6,500 dealers almost in half and shutter its Pontiac division. 
 By the time it is finished, G.M. expects to have only 38,000 union workers and 34 factories left in the United States, compared with 395,000 workers in more than 150 plants at its peak employment in 1970. 
 One goal of this latest plan was to convince the Obama administration, which has been skeptical of G.M.'s previous restructuring goals, that the company is willing to take harsh measures and cut its bloated infrastructure to match its steadily declining share in the United States. 
 Absent such steps, the government has said it is reluctant to lend the company more money. But for the first time since it toppled into financial crisis last year, G.M. appears to be earning government support. 
 That might mean billions more in loans if the company's stakeholders can come to an agreement before a deadline at the end of May. G.M. said on Monday that it needed to borrow $11.6 billion more, for a total of $27 billion.
 President Obama's auto task force said Monday it had ''made no final decision'' on future investments in G.M., which is subsisting on $15.4 billion in federal loans. The task force, however, called the new plan an ''important step in G.M.'s efforts to restructure its company.''
 This plan is a far cry from G.M.'s strategy of just a year ago, when it was waging a spirited battle with Toyota for the title of world's largest automaker.
 Where once G.M. had a 50 percent share of the market for new vehicles in the United States, the company hopes to at least hang on to its current 18 percent share.
 Analysts warned that even those projections could be optimistic. ''There is still a huge risk for market share losses beyond what the company is forecasting,'' said John Casesa, an industry consultant.
 G.M., however, still faces difficult odds of restructuring outside of bankruptcy court.
 The company is still negotiating with the United Automobile Workers union. The government wants the union to accept company stock to finance half of G.M.'s $20 billion obligation for retiree health care. 
 The U.A.W. this weekend agreed to a similar health care deal with Chrysler, which has borrowed $4 billion from the government and hopes to get $6 billion more. The union's new retiree health care trust would own a majority stake in Chrysler in exchange for helping the carmaker save $4.5 billion.
 A summary given to union leaders said Fiat would ultimately own 35 percent and that 10 percent would be held by the government and Chrysler's lenders, two people with direct knowledge of the deal said.
 Chrysler would give the union a 55 percent stake to cut its obligations to the health care trust in half, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the agreement have not been released publicly.
 The deal suspends cost-of-living pay increases, limits overtime pay and reduces paid time off. It also eliminates dental and vision benefits for retirees. It also provides for Fiat to begin building cars in at least one Chrysler plant.
 G.M., however, will have more trouble winning over its bondholders.
 The company, after consulting with Treasury officials, offered on Monday to give the holders of $27 billion in unsecured debt 225 shares in G.M. stock for every $1,000 in debt.
 G.M. said it would have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection unless 90 percent of the vast bondholder group accepted the terms by June 1.
 ''I can't imagine that this is going to go through,'' Shelly Lombard, a bond analyst with the firm Gimme Credit, said. ''This is not an olive branch to come back to the table. This is basically a sledgehammer. Having said that, I'm not sure that bondholders have a lot of other options.''
 Fritz Henderson, G.M.'s chief executive, also expressed doubts that enough bondholders would take the offer. Even if they do not, which would push the company into bankruptcy, he said he expected the company to pursue its restructuring.
 ''If it can't be done outside a bankruptcy, we'll do it in a bankruptcy,'' he said.
 If bondholders approve the debt-for-equity exchange, they would own about 10 percent of G.M., making them a minority shareholder in a company controlled by the Treasury and the U.A.W.'s retiree trust.
 According to the offer, the Treasury would own at least 50 percent of G.M. in exchange for forgiving about $10 billion in federal loans. The union trust, in turn, would receive a stake of about 39 percent.
 A committee of big G.M. bondholders on Monday called the offer a ''a blatant disregard for fairness for the bondholders'' and an example of ''political favoritism'' toward the U.A.W. ''The current offer is neither reasonable nor adequate,'' the committee said.
 Representative Thaddeus McCotter, a Michigan Republican, is concerned that some bondholders want the company to go bankrupt because they also hold credit-default swaps insuring them against losses. 
 He is urging the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to disclose which G.M. bondholders have default swaps from the American International Group, the insurance company that was bailed out by the government.
 ''It would be unconscionable to use taxpayer money to help people benefit from the bankruptcy of General Motors,'' Mr. McCotter said.
 Several industry analysts said the bondholder offer appeared destined to fail.
 ''Unless the offer is revised before May 8, G.M. could potentially file for Chapter 11 protection by the end of next month,'' Brian Johnson, of Barclays Capital, wrote in a note to clients.
 Many dealers said they were stunned by how quickly G.M. wanted to eliminate more than 2,600 showrooms.
 ''This is just too rapid, and I think it's going to create a disorderly shutdown of a lot of stores,'' said John McEleney, chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association. ''In the short term, they're likely to lose sales, which is counterproductive to G.M.'s recovery.''
 Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, said he received assurances from the task force late Monday that protecting jobs would be a high priority as it evaluated G.M.'s new plan.
 ''The depth of the pain inflicted on our workers, families and communities by these decisions should not be minimized,'' Mr. Levin said. ''It appears G.M. was left no choice, and I now believe bondholders have no choice, either, but to accept significant losses as a better alternative to bankruptcy.''

HEADLINE: Invoking the Sputnik Era, Obama Vows Record Outlays for Research

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN; William J. Broad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In a speech on Monday at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, President Obama presented a vision of a new era in research financing comparable to the Sputnik-period space race, in which intensified scientific inquiry, and development of the intellectual capacity to pursue it, are a top national priority. 
 The president laid out an ambitious plan to invigorate the country's pipeline for innovation, from grade-school classrooms to corporate, government and academic research laboratories.
 Mr. Obama's plan includes fulfilling commitments dating from the Bush administration to double the budgets of the National Science Foundation, the science office of the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
 But he is also seeking increases in direct federal investment in medical and energy research, and he would make permanent what has been a sporadic research and experimentation tax credit offered to companies that push beyond the quest for quarterly profits to pursue breakthroughs.
 Over all, he described his initiative as ''the largest commitment to scientific research and innovation in American history,'' receiving hearty applause from the scientists and observers who packed the halls at the National Academy headquarters for the group's annual meeting.
 Mr. Obama made clear that a new burst of advances in energy technology, medicine and other important arenas would not come from money alone, but required scientists to get out of their laboratories and find ways to inspire young people ''to create, build and invent -- to be makers of things, not just consumers of things.''
 Many elements of his plan had already been introduced, including $400 million in initial financing under the economic recovery bill for an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, akin to a defense research agency created after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik.
 He provided fresh detail on an initiative, already included in the economics stimulus bill, creating a $5 billion ''Race to the Top'' fund available to states doing the most to increase the ranks of trained science and math teachers. Mr. Obama noted that the country faced a shortfall of more than 280,000 math and science teachers by 2015. 
 He pledged to lift public and private investment in research and development in the United States beyond its high point in 1964, at the peak of the space race and cold war, when such money was 3 percent of the gross domestic product. 
 The full text of the speech is posted on the New York Times blog Dot Earth, at nytimes.com/dotearth, where readers can comment line by line. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 29, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about President Obama's plan for investment in scientific research and development misstated the amount of public and private money it would take to achieve spending more than 3 percent of the gross domestic product on such efforts. It is at least $420 billion a year, not $46 billion.

THE FIRST TYCOON
The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt
By T. J. Stiles
Illustrated. 719 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $37.50.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, the great steamship and then railroad magnate, the man who built the original Grand Central Terminal, was not much of a conversationalist. If a man boasted in his presence, he would say, ''That amounts to nothing.'' If interrupted while speaking, he would stop talking and not resume the subject. Vanderbilt (1794-1877) didn't need words. His actions spoke with a brute eloquence.
In this whacking new biography of Vanderbilt, T. J. Stiles, previously the author of a life of Jesse James, demonstrates a brute eloquence of his own. This is a mighty -- and mighty confident -- work, one that moves with force and conviction and imperious wit through Vanderbilt's noisy life and times. The book, ''The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt,'' is full of sharp, unexpected turns. Among the biggest: Mr. Stiles has delivered a revisionist history of American capitalism's original sinner, the man who inspired the term ''robber baron.'' He has real sympathy for the old devil. 
The phrase ''epic life'' is a biographical cliche. But it fits Vanderbilt in every regard: force of personality; degrees of ruthlessness, guile and accomplishment; even sheer life span. He was born less than two decades after the end of the Revolutionary War, while Washington was still alive, and he would live long enough not only to play a significant role in the Civil War but also to do business with John D. Rockefeller.
Vanderbilt essentially invented the modern corporation through his purchase and consolidation of New York's major railroads, and brought, Mr. Stiles says, the American professional and managerial middle class into being. His influence remains so great as to be almost intangible.
As Mr. Stiles writes: ''He may have left his most lasting mark in the invisible world, by creating an unseen architecture which later generations of Americans would take for granted.''
How you feel about the ''unseen architecture'' of American economics and corporate life says a lot about, or even defines, your politics. Mr. Stiles sees both sides of Vanderbilt:
''His admirers saw him as the ultimate meritocrat, the finest example of the common man rising through hard work and ability. ... His critics called him grasping and ruthless, an unelected king who never pretended to rule for his people.'' But Mr. Stiles plainly gets a charge out of Vanderbilt's raw nerve.
Cornelius Vanderbilt grew up on Staten Island, the son of a modest farming family. He attended school for only a few months, developing what Mr. Stiles calls ''a lasting contempt for the conventions of written English.'' He was born in the right place at the right time.
''Unlike most country folk,'' Mr. Stiles writes, ''the Vanderbilts lived within sight of the place of the most densely concentrated possibilities in North America: the city of New York.''
As a young man, Vanderbilt began working on ferries and schooners and then, with their increasing popularity in the 1820s and '30s, steamboats. He made a name for himself in business for his ''elbows-out aggressiveness.''
He made a name for himself, too, with his imposing appearance. A contemporary described him as ''a man of striking individuality, as straight as an Indian, standing six feet in his stockings and weighing about 200 pounds.'' Frugal and abstemious, Vanderbilt had one vice: the constant presence of a lighted or unlighted cigar.
The most flat-out enjoyable sections of ''The First Tycoon'' are those that deal with New York's great steamship wars of the first half of the 19th century. Vanderbilt began to build and operate his own fleet, picking up the nickname the Commodore in the process. He engaged in price wars, cutting fares until competitors went out of business or paid him to go away. He slowly developed a chokehold on commerce.
By the late 1840s, Mr. Stiles writes, ''almost everyone who traveled between New York and Boston took a Vanderbilt boat or a Vanderbilt train.''
Vanderbilt loved to compete, and to smite his enemies. Mr. Stiles tells of epic steamboat races, much reported in New York's newspapers, that Vanderbilt took part in and gambled on. His boats ran against other ships up the Hudson nearly as far as West Point, then turned around and roared home. Vanderbilt helped fuel the gold rush, getting his steamships around to San Francisco. He tried to cut a more direct path to the West Coast, a canal through Nicaragua, and there are scenes of stranded steamers here that are straight out of the movie ''Fitzcarraldo.'' He provided steamships to the Union during the Civil War, including one, fitted out with a special ram, that stared down the Confederate ironclad warship, the Merrimack, keeping it in check for a short time in 1862.
The book's final sections unpack Vanderbilt's greatest coup, buying and then consolidating New York's major railroad lines, using every trick in his arsenal, including the manipulation of stock prices. His wealth became enormous.
''If he had been able to sell all his assets at full market value at the moment of his death,'' Mr. Stiles writes, ''he would have taken one out of every 20 dollars in circulation.''
Mr. Stiles is clear-eyed about his subject's nearly amoral rapacity. He writes that Vanderbilt ''exacerbated problems that would never be fully solved: a huge disparity in wealth between rich and poor; the concentration of great power in private hands; the fraud and self-serving deception that thrives in an unregulated environment.''
But again and again in ''The First Tycoon,'' he also defends Vanderbilt against his most vocal detractors and, whenever possible, corrects the historical record when it has portrayed him unfairly. Vanderbilt did not actually say, to give just one example, a line that was used against him at the time: ''Law! What do I care about the law?''
Mr. Stiles gets Vanderbilt the man onto paper. He is eloquent on Vanderbilt's love of horses and horse racing, his tangled relationships with his 13 children and his dabbling in the occult. (About the seances Vanderbilt attended, Mr. Stiles writes: ''The possibility of mastering even death itself must have been appealing.'')
He is even better on Vanderbilt's fraught relationship with New York society, which at first shunned him as ''illiterate and boorish.''
There are moments in any biography of this size when your eyes are going to glaze over; I certainly did not wish ''The First Tycoon'' were longer. But I read eagerly and avidly. This is state-of-the-art biography, crisper and more piquant than a 600-page book has any right to be.
Cornelius Vanderbilt emerges clearly in these pages as a man who, as his son-in-law put it, ''was determined to have his own way, always, to a greater extent than any man I ever saw.''
Correction: April 30, 2009, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Books of The Times review on Wednesday misstated part of the title of the subject of the review at two points in some editions. It is ''The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt,'' by T. J. Stiles, not ''The Last Tycoon.'' The review also misstated the time period in which a steamship Vanderbilt provided to the Union during the Civil War held a Confederate ironclad warship in check. It was for a short time in 1862 before the Confederates scuttled the ship, not ''for much of the war.'' The review also misspelled the name of the Confederate ship. It was the Merrimack, not the Merrimac. (The ship, originally a Union vessel that was scuttled, was rechristened the Virginia by the Confederates after they raised it and made it an ironclad but is often referred to by its prior name.)

HEADLINE: London Ponders Its Future As a Financial Powerhouse

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Tetsuya Ishikawa reaped the fruits of London's financial boom, structuring and selling his small share of the complex securities that fueled both his professional rise and the uninterrupted economic growth of Britain. When the boom went bust last year, he lost his job at Morgan Stanley, along with about 28,000 other Londoners working in finance.
Mr. Ishikawa, who has written a fictional memoir, has no plans to return to the City, as London's banking district is known. But Britain's revenue-starved Labor government will find no such escape. 
''By 2010, the U.K. will have the largest budget deficit in the developed world,'' said Richard Snook, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Business Research in London. ''The problem is that the financial services industry has been a huge cash cow for the British government for the last 10 years and now it is going into reverse.''
The country's budget deficit has soared to 12 percent of gross domestic product; its public debt burden could soon reach 80 percent of annual economic output, a figure that would leave it roughly in the same position as Greece.
But at a time when Britain more than ever needs a financial sector firing on all cylinders, its economic engine is conking out -- for a number of reasons, including some that critics blame on the government.
All told, more than 70,000 jobs in finance are expected to disappear over the next two to three years, a big chunk of the total estimated job losses of about 280,000 in London.
The British government has poured hundreds of billions of pounds into preventing several of its largest banks from falling into bankruptcy as the extent of their bad bets became evident. But there is little prospect of a revival anytime soon, as the government is about to impose stiffer demands on banks to keep high capital ratios and to rely less on leverage and once-lucrative trading activities.
That, combined with a more aggressive posture by the regulatory authorities to put a check on bonuses, is likely to hasten what has already been a sharp falloff in corporate and income taxes from the City.
The economic contribution from the British financial sector, according to the Office for National Statistics, peaked at 10.8 percent of G.D.P. in 2007 -- up from 5.5 percent in 1996, just before Labor took over. By comparison, the contribution from financial services in the United States to the American economy never exceeded 8 percent.
In a bid to capture more revenue, the British government has decided to raise tax rates on the affluent, many of them working in finance. But the new top income tax rate of 50 percent for those earning at least $:150,000 ($219,000) may only make things worse, said Mr. Snook, the economist.
''These people are highly mobile and they will leave London,'' he said. ''The impact on public finances will be negative.''
Britain's top tax rate will soon rank fourth behind those of Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands -- not quite the advertisement one would expect from one of the world's leading financial centers.
In many ways, Mr. Ishikawa's career tracked the credit explosion that has now imploded. When he began work as a lowly credit analyst in 2002, banks in London issued about $:20 billion in securities linked to various mortgage instruments. His career took off as that figure surged to over $:180 billion over the next five or six years. Mr. Ishikawa received a $3 million bonus from Morgan Stanley in 2008 as a reward for peddling assets that turned out to be toxic.
With that line of business virtually defunct, banks in the coming years must return to lower-risk and lower-return businesses like equity and bond underwriting, foreign exchange trading and traditional deal-making -- businesses that may well be profitable, but can in no way make up for the loss of such a lush specialty.
The Center for Economic and Business Research estimates that corporate and income taxes from the financial industry will shrink from 12 percent of the overall tax take in 2007 to 8 percent this year and perhaps lower in the years ahead, a prospect that could force Britain to increase its already substantial borrowing requirement.
The crisis has humbled all financial centers, from Wall Street to Dubai. According to an index produced in Britain that ranks financial centers around the world, the City of London still comes out on top, closely followed by New York. The gap, though, between these two and Singapore, which is now third, is narrowing.
Lord Adair Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, agrees that London as a financial center will be in for an adjustment and says that a large portion of the banking industry's profit contribution to the economy was ''illusory.''
But even in a more restrictive environment, he points out, London's importance as a global financial hub and the most valuable trading center in Europe will not go away.
''The City is important today for the same reason it was important in 1890,'' he said.
As for Mr. Ishikawa, who is 30 and grew up in Britain as the son of a successful Japanese executive, he is putting his hopes into a new career as a writer. His book, ''How I Caused the Credit Crunch,'' chronicles the debauched excesses of the boom -- he was briefly married to a Brazilian lap dancer -- by lightly fictionalizing his six-year stint in finance.
''I really don't miss it,'' he said, sipping a coffee near the building where he was laid off. ''There are many more kids out there more hungry than me.''
Like Faruq Rana, for example. Mr. Rana, the 26-year-old son of Bangladeshi immigrants, was born and reared in Tower Hamlets, a district abutting Canary Wharf that has Britain's highest unemployment rate.
From his window, he can see the towers of Citigroup and Barclays reaching into the sky and his ambition to one day work as a trader in one of those buildings soars nearly as high.
''Every day when I wake up and open up my window, I can smell my job,'' said Mr. Rana, who is a student in a government-financed program at Tower Hamlets College that prepares local youths for jobs in the financial industry.
Unlike Mr. Ishikawa, Mr. Rana did not go to Eton or Oxford, but he remains undeterred.
''I have the motivation and the drive,'' he said. ''I think I can be one of them.''

HEADLINE: New York Office Landlords Go Small

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
Sluggish demand for office space in New York has prompted some landlords to think small.
As vacancy rates rise, some developers are splitting large vacant blocks of space into smaller offices and ''prebuilding'' them -- finishing off the space before finding a tenant. Brokers say that landlords are also pouring more money into small spaces in their buildings than they might have a year ago.
Take, for example, the Seagram Building, which is at 375 Park Avenue, between 52nd and 53rd Streets. It is a sleek office tower designed by Mies van der Rohe and is home to the Four Seasons restaurant. When five small offices, totaling 30,000 square feet, recently became available, the owner, RFR Holding, a New York real estate company owned by Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs, gutted them and started over from scratch. 
''A year ago, we might have painted and put in some new carpet, because there would have been a better chance of renting the space with some minor renovations,'' said Richard Farley, the director of leasing for RFR Realty, the firm's leasing arm. ''But we recognized the value of prebuilding now, rather than waiting to see if the space would rent.''
Brokers refer to prebuilt offices as ''turnkey'' space, meaning it is ready for use as soon as the tenant walks through the door. Currently, such offices are being built or offered for lease in some of the city's best-known office towers, including the Metropolitan Tower, at 142 West 57th Street, and 666 Fifth Avenue, which spans the entire west side of the avenue from 52nd to 53rd Street.
A question confronting many building owners today, said Peter Turchin, an executive vice president at CB Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate brokerage company, is whether they should break up large blocks of space to prebuild small offices. ''In the past, landlords would have been less likely to break up whole floors, because it is easier to do one single transaction,'' Mr. Turchin said. ''But that's not where the market is now.''
Mr. Turchin estimates that owners are spending roughly $65 to $85 a square foot to prebuild offices.
Bill Rudin, the president of the Rudin Management Company, the operating arm of Rudin Family Holdings, said his company was prebuilding about 15 units -- a total of 100,000 square feet -- in eight of the office buildings that the family owns in Manhattan. Some plans involve breaking up larger blocks of space.
After one tenant vacated the entire fifth floor at 355 Lexington Avenue, Mr. Rudin decide to split the 16,500-square-foot floor into four prebuilt offices of 2,700 to 6,900 square feet. At another building that the Rudins own, at 55 Broad Street, they are considering carving up a vacant 20,000-square-foot office on the 10th and 11th floors.
Landlords would prefer to lease big blocks of space, of course, but large deals have become about as scarce as rain in the Sahara.
Almost 85 percent of the leases that were signed in Manhattan in the first quarter of 2009 were for offices of under 10,000 square feet, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a brokerage firm that compiles data on commercial transactions. Another 11 percent were in the 10,000-to-25,000-square-foot range.
Brokers say such a strong tilt toward small offices is unusual in New York, where the financial industry, in particular, has traditionally rented large blocks of space.
Much of the space flooding the market as large tenants sublet all or part of their offices is essentially turnkey space. ''Almost a third of the space on the market is sublease space, and much of it has been built, wired and furnished during the boom a couple of years ago,'' said Josh N. Kuriloff, a vice chairman at Cushman & Wakefield.
Sublet space is also being leased at a greater discount than during previous recessions. In the first quarter, Class A office space in Manhattan was being offered for sublet at a 28 percent discount to the asking rents for similar space that was available directly from landlords. In previous downturns, going back to 1990, the discount for Class A sublet space was about 10 to 15 percent, Cushman & Wakefield said.
Some landlords are clearly spending more money today on prebuilt offices to entice tenants. For example, Mr. Rudin said that he was using ''eco-friendly'' building materials. David Levinson, the chairman and chief executive of the L & L Holding Company, said he was wiring prebuilt offices for telephone and Internet service, something that is still relatively uncommon for offices that are prebuilt on speculation.
Mr. Levinson said that a prebuilt program at a building he owns, the Metropolitan Tower, has been so popular that around 90 percent of the 105,000 square feet of prebuilt space has been leased over the last 12 months for annual rents of $58 to $91 a square foot. So when a tenant recently vacated the 12th floor in another building Mr. Levinson owns, at 600 Third Avenue, he decided to split the 12,000 square feet into three prebuilt units.
Despite the advantages for tenants in all of this, brokers say that many tenants are choosing to stay put, rather than spending money on a move in an uncertain economy. But if tenants want to relocate, there is certainly plenty of turnkey space for them to choose from.
Burt Sivin, the president of CAI Benefits, an employee benefits consulting firm, said he would have liked to have stayed in the company's existing office, at 6 East 43rd Street. But the landlord there would offer only an 18-month renewal when the company's lease expired at the end of June.
''We were coming off a 10-year lease, and we wanted to lock in rents at existing prices,'' Mr. Sivin said. So in June, CAI Benefits will move into a 6,900-square-foot prebuilt office on the fifth floor of the Rudin family's building at 355 Lexington Avenue.
And in a sign of just how much the Manhattan office market has swung in favor of tenants, CAI Benefits negotiated a 10-year lease at the new location for a somewhat lower rent than it had at the office on 43rd Street. ''A year ago, we would probably have been looking at a substantial increase,'' Mr. Sivin said.

HEADLINE: Creating Luxury In Days Of Denial

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON

 BODY:
''WATCH out for obstacles,'' Michael White said as he navigated between two construction workers -- one hammering a plank, the other shearing plywood with a power saw. ''It's a bit precarious right now.''
Mr. White, the congenial chef behind Convivio and Alto, was referring to extension cords that hung like snakes from rafters inside Marea, his ultra-deluxe Italian seafood restaurant expected to open in early May on Central Park South. At least 45 workers milled around the dining room in early April, six of them flown in from Italy to install Indian rosewood paneling and a honey-colored onyx wall backlighted by tiny bulbs.
But by precarious, he could just as easily have been talking about Marea's future. Last July when he and his business partner, Chris Cannon, announced their latest venture, the city seemed flush. Since the stock market's collapse, though, worried New Yorkers are rejecting anything opulent, driving even gold-card-carrying customers to the nearest Shake Shack. 
Marea is one of a surprising number of high-end restaurants set to open this year. Their timing may be inopportune, but with leases signed and construction underway before the economy took its nose dive, the restaurateurs had little choice but to forge ahead. Some, like Mr. Cannon and Mr. White, have sought to pare their rent while maintaining their original vision. Others have cut prices or added new dishes to appeal to a wider array of patrons. Everywhere, there is anxiety, as owners learn to adapt to the new austerity.
The downturn has had benefits: Mr. Cannon said that some suppliers and contractors had shaved their fees, saving the restaurant about 30 percent on construction materials and labor. (They plowed those savings back into refined touches like hand-polished lacquer radiator covers.) The two also went back to their landlord three months ago to renegotiate their rent. They say it was already much less than the $750,000 a year the former tenant, the San Domenico, was reported to have paid. The landlord agreed to defer a portion of the rent for two years, at which point, Mr. Cannon hopes, the economy will have rebounded.
Still, the restaurant will cost more than $4.5 million, and they have been paying rent since signing their lease last summer. And Mr. Cannon concedes that he wishes the money had started to roll in three months ago.
''I have three kids to support,'' he said. ''I don't have an option to fail.''
It is a common refrain from the Upper East Side to TriBeCa. Among the slate of upcoming restaurants is SD26, a venture from Tony May that has already delayed its opening until the fall. (Mr. May was the owner of San Domenico, which used to occupy Marea's space.)
Even before the economic implosion, Brushstroke, David Bouley's elaborate vision of a robata grill paired with a kaiseki restaurant, was hampered with troubles, including a battle to get its liquor license. And two established restaurants, Oceana and Aureole, are leaving their East Side town houses for larger spaces in Midtown, with plans for grand openings this fall.
''Everyone wants to make a 15 percent profit margin,'' said Nick Livanos, whose family owns Oceana. ''But if you make 10 percent you are happy.''
That's if. ''A bunch of restaurants are going to close in the next year,'' said Clark Wolf, a restaurant business consultant. ''There will be a weeding out. Restaurants have to be careful how they calibrate the experience for the diner. People don't want to feel like they are paying for a stained-glass ceiling.''
As the Livanos family closes Oceana this summer before moving to a larger, 180-seat space on the ground floor of the McGraw-Hill Building near Rockefeller Center after Labor Day, they are taking the opportunity to overhaul their approach. Oceana's 54th Street location resembled the cosseted dining room of a luxury yacht, with views of the horizon off the deck.
In the new restaurant, floor-to-ceiling windows look out onto 49th Street. There will be outdoor seating and a bar where diners can order, say, a salmon burger for about $15 from a casual menu that will be offered all afternoon. Lunch and dinner will be served in a more formal dining room.
In some ways, the looser style will help to trim costs. Currently, Oceana covers every table with linens, which have to be cleaned and pressed for a princely sum. But some wood tables at the new Oceana will be left bare.
Mr. Livanos said he has grappled with the same challenges others have. ''The question was, how do you make Oceana less formal and still give the right level of service?'' he asked. ''We are all looking toward comfort. We don't want to be over-stimulated by the experience. There is always room for a Per Se experience, but at the same time people want to enjoy something simple, you know, like Craft.''
Oceana will also lower its prices. He said fish entrees now priced in the mid- to high-$30s will drop to near $30.
This approach carries some risk, according to Mr. Wolf, the restaurant consultant, who said that seafood restaurants are among the most vulnerable in a recession. ''Anyone who is serving seafood has got to be concerned,'' he said. ''No one wants cheap seafood.''
Mr. Livanos said that Oceana's chef, Ben Pollinger, will not sacrifice the quality of the fish, but serve it with simpler garnishes. (As for Mr. White of Marea, he thinks the market is still strong. ''In a poor economy, people realize fish is fragile and will pay for it,'' he said.)
Mr. Livanos expects the new location -- sandwiched between Rockefeller Center and the theater district -- will give Oceana a diverse audience, providing some cushion from the recession. ''If I was opening up downtown or in the financial district, I have to tell you, I'd be nervous,'' he said.
For some longtime chefs and restaurant owners, the worries are achingly familiar. Just as the markets were reeling from the crash of 1987, Charlie Palmer signed a $3 million mortgage on the Upper East Side town house that housed Aureole. He styled the restaurant, which opened the next year, after Lutece, with an American flair.
But Mr. Palmer contends this recession is different -- likely to be more severe and longer. What worked the last time may not succeed today, he said.
''The way people want to dine is not the same as 20 years ago,'' he said. ''You can't have the big deal dinner every night of the week. So we adjust.''
Last year, Mr. Palmer announced he was closing Aureole on East 61st Street and relocating to the Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park -- at a cost of about $8 million. His original plan to make the food prepared by Aureole's executive chef, Christopher Lee, more wallet-friendly has taken on new importance given the economic downturn.
He will serve prix fixe meals in the dining room. (A seven-course tasting menu with wine now costs $230.) But in a new casual barroom, he will also offer a la carte dishes ranging from small plates for $12 to $42 entrees. Following the lead of many new restaurants, the barroom will stay open afternoons and evenings. And Mr. Palmer is building private dining rooms, something he did not have space for at the old restaurant.
''We are not looking for a different clientele,'' Mr. Palmer said. ''We are just trying to give people more options.''
He insisted he is not going to cut the cost of dishes, though, just to get patrons in the door. ''I don't believe in slashing prices,'' he said. ''You have to ask yourself: 'How are you doing that? Is the quality cut rate?' We are not inexpensive, but it is good value.''
Instead, he has made some minor adjustments to his initial plan. For instance, the new Aureole will offer no corkage fees on Mondays. And there will be themed events, including a Sunday supper and a movie night. (Metrazur, Mr. Palmer's restaurant in Grand Central Terminal, offers a $4 beer night and classes in cheese and wine pairing.)
Mr. Palmer believes he's protected himself by diversifying, including owning an online wine store and a boutique hotel.
Mr. White, buoyant and optimistic, almost seems to relish the dangers facing so many restaurants. ''There are too many in New York,'' he said. And yet he also sees this economy as an opportunity for anyone brave enough to blunder ahead. Eventually, the recession will be over and diners hungry for a little extravagance will start spending again.
At that point, Mr. White predicted, ''We will be one of the only ones around.''

HEADLINE: Phoenix Leads the Way Down in Home Prices, Falling 50% From a June 2006 Peak

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD and JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Phoenix has achieved the unwelcome distinction of becoming the first major American city where home prices have fallen in half since the market peaked in the middle of the decade, according to data released Tuesday.
Though historical statistics are scant, experts said the precipitous decline probably had few if any equals in modern times.
''Even during the Depression, I'm not sure prices fell this quickly,'' said Karl Guntermann, a professor of real estate at Arizona State University. 
Greg Swann, a Phoenix real estate agent, took a moment to marvel at the news. ''What happened here will some day be a new chapter in 'Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,' '' the classic survey of investing mania, he said. ''We were living during the boom like there was no tomorrow. And guess what? Now it's tomorrow.''
Home prices in the Sun Belt city, the 12th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, dropped 4.5 percent in February, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller Home Price Index. Prices in Phoenix are now down 50.8 percent since the market peaked in June 2006.
For the country as a whole, the Case-Shiller numbers offered the thinnest of silver linings: things are still getting worse, but more slowly.
In February, the price of single-family homes in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 18.6 percent from the year earlier, compared with a record drop of 19 percent in January.
''Finally, we're seeing a touch of moderation,'' said David Blitzer, chairman of S.& P.'s index committee. ''This is the kind of thing one might see if we're beginning to see a bottom. I would not run out and celebrate, but I would not dig the bunker any deeper.''
Mr. Blitzer said the decline in Phoenix outpaced any during the recession of the early 1990s, for which reliable figures are available. The only precedents he could cite were the Midwestern cities hit by the Great Depression and a contemporaneous drought, and Miami after a 1920s craze for beachfront property reversed itself.
The boom in Phoenix was founded on a basic truth: it was a place where many people wanted to live. But the market turned irrational. Investors bought homes they did not even bother to rent out. They merely waited a few months until prices rose again so they could flip them.
Ordinary homeowners got caught up, too. ''People saw themselves as cashing in on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' Mr. Guntermann said.
Except for the few who managed to get out at the peak, it was a mistake. By now, anyone who bought in Phoenix a decade ago would have lost money after inflation. Many did not get off so easily. Foreclosure notices were filed against one in 40 houses in the metropolitan area in the first quarter, according to RealtyTrac Inc. That was the ninth-highest rate in the country.
The Case-Shiller data show that housing markets across the United States are still suffering. Half of the 20 metropolitan areas in the index posted record year-over-year declines. In all, the 20-city index was down 2.2 percent from January.
From Atlanta to San Francisco to Chicago, not one of the 20 cities posted a gain in home prices from January to February, and values in all but five cities dropped by double digits from a year earlier.
The nearly 51 percent drop in Phoenix is not an isolated plunge. Prices in Las Vegas are down some 48 percent from their peaks. They are down 45 percent in Miami from their highest levels, and down 40 percent in Los Angeles and San Diego.
Economists said housing prices would probably continue to fall as Americans, worried about rising unemployment and the recession, put off big financial decisions like buying a home.
Some economists expect housing prices to fall another 5 to 10 percent before they hit a bottom; others say that prices could decline by as much as a third. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median price of a home in the United States, which peaked above $230,000 in 2006, has fallen to $175,200.
As prices have dropped, frozen housing markets in hard-hit areas like Southern California, Phoenix, Las Vegas and South Florida have begun to thaw. Record-low mortgage rates and huge inventories of foreclosed homes and other fire-sale properties have enticed first-time buyers to the market and lured others who had been sitting on the sidelines.
Home sales in Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area, where foreclosures dominate many markets, have snapped back this spring as prices dropped. But sales have slowed to a crawl in other markets like New York City, where prices declined 10 percent from a year ago.
''We're seeing very strong sales in a few states and weak sales across 40 states,'' said Patrick Newport, United States economist at IHS Global Insight. ''The key factor driving them right now is just the excess inventory. Even though prices are undervalued, they're still going to drop because of the excess. Even if we were at full employment we'd still see prices dropping.''
Inventories of unsold homes are edging down slightly, but there was still a glut of 3.7 million unsold homes in March, the Realtors' group reported, representing a supply of nearly 10 months.
Mr. Swan, the realty agent, said inventories of lower-priced homes were already dwindling in Phoenix as investors snapped up bank-owned properties at bargain prices.
''I've got Canadians coming here who are putting together investment pools of millions of dollars to buy houses by the hundreds,'' he said. ''They're going to rent them out to all the people who were foreclosed and need a place to live. This is going to be a good year for us.''

HEADLINE: Obama Finds That Saving on Copters Could Be Costly

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
At a Washington conference on fiscal responsibility in February, President Obama tried to set the tone by saying he did not need the new costly presidential helicopters that had been ordered by the Bush administration.
''The helicopter I have now seems perfectly adequate to me,'' he said to laughter. On a more serious note, he added, ''I think it is an example of the procurement process gone amok. And we're going to have to fix it.''
But the president is learning that in the world of defense contracting, frugality can be expensive. Some lawmakers and military experts warn that his effort to avoid wasting billions of dollars could end up doing just that. 
The administration's plan to halt the $13 billion helicopter program, announced this month, will leave the government with little to show for the $3.2 billion it has spent since the Bush administration set out to create a futuristic craft that could fend off terrorist attacks and resist the electromagnetic effects of a nuclear blast.
Critics say the Pentagon would also spend at least $200 million in termination fees and perhaps hundreds of millions to extend the life of today's aging fleet. As a result, several influential lawmakers and defense analysts are now calling for a compromise that would salvage a simpler version of the helicopter that is already being tested.
They say it could be a more palatable alternative in tough economic times than seeking new bids for a more advanced craft, which has proved difficult to develop.
''The real question is how much does the president need, and what will it cost to do that,'' said David J. Berteau, who has studied the helicopter program as a member of a Defense Science Board task force. He said he had no doubt that the simpler version of the new helicopter, the VH-71, would be a big improvement over today's 30- to 35-year-old fleet in helping the president ''survive a crisis and operate within it.''
Others say that unless the White House reduces the intricate security requirements that have led to a doubling in the price of the program, there is no assurance that the government will be able to control the costs any better in a new bidding.
''Everyone wants to protect the president, but we are not going to pay $500 million for a single helicopter,'' said Representative John P. Murtha, a Democrat from Pennsylvania and the chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee.
Mr. Murtha said he had warned the Obama administration not to cancel the entire program, which includes a first batch of five helicopters with more seating, communications equipment and survivability than the current ones and 23 more sophisticated craft. Mr. Murtha's aides said he might insist on preserving funds for the basic version of the helicopter when Congress takes up next year's budget.
But it is also clear that, despite Mr. Obama's comments about sticking with the white-topped helicopters that have alighted on the White House lawn since the 1970s and '80s, his administration still wants new craft with some of the most demanding features that the Bush team envisioned after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the White House, declined to comment on its plans for the helicopters.
But John J. Young Jr., who stepped down on Monday as the Pentagon's acquisition chief, said he expected White House and military officials to take another look at the requirements soon.
Mr. Young said the basic version of the helicopter -- built by Lockheed Martin and AgustaWestland, a European company -- was meant to be used as a transition to the more advanced craft and has only been certified for several years of use.
Though the contractors insist the helicopters would last 30 years, Mr. Young said that with the extra weight from armor and other gear, Pentagon experts say they may not be able to count on them for more than 10 to 20 years.
Mr. Young said that neither the White House Military Office, which sets the requirements, nor a Marine squadron that operates the helicopters, wanted the more basic ones. All five of them have been built, and after flight testing and installation of sophisticated gear in Owego in upstate New York, they were expected to be ready in the spring of 2011.
As a result, Mr. Young said, Pentagon officials recommended canceling the whole program ''to save as much of the money as possible and apply all our effort, all our money and all our energy'' to another attempt to develop more advanced craft. He said Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates had made the decision after consulting with President Obama.
Other government and industry officials said that the biggest problem has been that White House planners want a helicopter that is powerful enough to dash nearly 300 miles without refueling in an emergency.
The existing helicopters can fly only about 100 miles, and industry officials say the basic new ones would go about 200. Most of the cost overruns and delays have come in designing stronger rotor blades and engines to extend the range in the advanced version.
AgustaWestland's chief executive, Giuseppe Orsi, said on Tuesday in Paris that if the White House were willing to compromise, his company could deliver 19 of the basic helicopters for the original project budget of $6.8 billion.
Reopening the bidding would provide an opportunity for Sikorsky, the company based in Connecticut that built and services the current presidential helicopters.
Sikorsky lost the bidding on the new contract in 2005 because its helicopter had a smaller cabin and was costlier. And supporters like Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, are pushing for a second chance.
But a commercial version of the Sikorsky helicopter crashed off Newfoundland last month, killing 17 people, which safety investigators say may have been caused by a faulty gearbox. The company has also had delays and cost overruns on a military project in Canada.
Sikorsky officials say they would use a new gearbox for a presidential helicopter and believe they can do a better job over all.
But Mr. Young, the former Pentagon acquisition official, said that if the White House stuck with its highly customized requirements, the effort to create new helicopters would continue to face ''significant costs for the design, significant costs for the testing and then a significant cost to buy the helicopters.''

HEADLINE: Same-Sex Marriage Holds Peril for G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was only five years ago that opposition to same-sex marriage was so strong that Republicans explicitly turned to the issue as a way to energize conservative voters. Yet today, as the party contemplates the task of rebuilding itself, some Republicans say the marriage issue may be turning into more of a hindrance than a help.
 The fact that a run of states have legalized same-sex marriage in recent months -- either by court decision or by legislative action -- with little backlash is only one indication of how public attitudes about this subject appear to be changing. 
 More significant is evidence in polls of a widening divide on the issue by age, suggesting to many Republicans that the potency of the marriage question is on the decline. It simply does not appear to have the resonance with younger voters that it does with older ones. 
 Consider this: In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, released Monday, 31 percent of respondents over the age of 40 said they supported same-sex marriage. By contrast, 57 percent under age 40 said they supported it, a 26-point difference. Among the older respondents, 35 percent said they opposed any legal recognition of same-sex couples, be it marriage or civil unions. Among the younger crowd, just 19 percent held that view.
 Steve Schmidt, who was the senior strategist to Senator John McCain of Arizona during his presidential campaign, said in a speech and an interview that Republicans were in danger of losing these younger voters unless the party came to appreciate how issues like same-sex marriage resonated, or did not resonate, with them.
 ''Republicans should re-examine the extent to which we are being defined by positions on issues that I don't believe are among our core values, and that put us at odds with what I expect will become, over time, if not a consensus view, then the view of a substantial majority of voters,'' Mr. Schmidt said in a speech.
 This does not mean, Republicans said, that most Americans are suddenly embracing the idea of same-sex couples' going to the chapel. It is more that, for a lot of these Americans, same-sex marriage is not something they spend a lot of time worrying about, or even thinking about.
 For younger respondents, this shift may in part be cultural: the result of coming of age in an era when openly gay men and lesbians have become increasingly common in popular entertainment and in public life, not to mention in their own families or social circles. The other reason, members of both parties said, is that the argument over same-sex marriage seems beside the point at a time when the country is facing a severe economic crisis, remains on edge for another domestic terrorist attack and has just inaugurated its first black president.
 ''Right now, people are not concerned about issues like gay marriage because they are concerned about the economy,'' Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former Republican mayor of New York, told reporters in Albany after meeting with Republican members of the State Senate, who are opposing legislation to legalize same-sex marriage. 
 Mr. Giuliani explained that he opposed such marriages -- while supporting civil unions -- but that he did not think it made much sense for Republicans to be emphasizing the issue if the party had any serious interest in returning to power.
 ''The Republican party does best organizing itself around economic issues and issues of national security,'' said Mr. Giuliani, 64, who ran for president last year and is now thinking about running for governor of New York. 
 In this latest New York Times/CBS News poll, 42 percent of all respondents said they supported same-sex marriage, compared with 22 percent in March 2004. By contrast, 18 percent of Republicans supported such marriages, while 49 percent said they opposed any kind of recognition of gay unions.
 ''It's a problem,'' Mr. Schmidt said in an interview. 
 Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a Republican, is a social conservative who opposes same-sex marriage and is considering a run for president. 
 Asked if he thought Republicans were making a political mistake in emphasizing gay issues, Mr. Pawlenty, who is 48, responded, ''I think it's an important issue for our conservative voters.'' But he notably did not dwell on the subject.
 Before joining Mr. McCain's campaign, Mr. Schmidt was known in Republican circles for arguing that the party needed to move away from social issues to be successful; he managed Arnold Schwarzenegger's successful campaign for governor in California. 
 ''The Republican Party is shrinking,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''One of the reasons it is shrinking is because there are large demographics in this country that view the party as intolerant or not relevant to them.''
 For Republicans, the complications of this issue could very well focus on the first state on the nominating calendar in 2012, Iowa. The courts there overturned a law banning same-sex marriage earlier this month, and social conservatives, who are a strong force in Republican politics in Iowa, are already organizing to try to amend the state's Constitution to restore the ban. 
 Republican candidates for president are going to be pressed to support that effort, and to spend time talking about an issue that could undercut their appeal to more centrist voters in a general election.
 As Mr. Schmidt noted, the winner of the Iowa Republican caucus is hardly assured of becoming the party's nominee; Mr. McCain lost there in 2008. Still, he said it would be difficult for any Republican candidate to win his party's nomination in 2012 without opposing same-sex marriage.
 ''I think it's likely that all our candidates will be against gay marriage,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''But the point is this: There should be a de-emphasis on this issue. This is not the most important issue facing the country.'' 
 Mr. Schmidt is 38 years old.

HEADLINE: Sun, Soon a Part of Oracle, Reports a Big Sales Decline

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
As Oracle prepares to acquire Sun Microsystems, it is learning how the company it will buy has been battered by the recession and a hefty cost structure. 
 On Tuesday, Sun reported its largest drop in third-quarter sales since 2002. The sales falloff underscores the challenges that Oracle will take on when it acquires Sun for $7.4 billion and becomes one of the major players in the market for server computers. Sun's woes are the result of long-term strategic problems, recession-choked corporate spending and doubts surrounding the future of its products. 
 ''The deceleration in the business was pronounced,'' said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at the investment research firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. 
 For the quarter that ended March 29, Sun posted a net loss of $201 million, or 27 cents a share. That's a sharp downturn from the loss of $34 million, or 4 cents a share, it reported the same period last year. 
 Revenue at the company, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., tumbled to $2.6 billion, down 20 percent from $3.27 billion a year ago. The last similar third-quarter decline occurred in 2002, when revenue fell 24 percent, as the former dot-com darling reeled from reduced Internet infrastructure spending. 
 Excluding charges for restructuring and other items, Sun missed the consensus analyst forecast for its net income by 5 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Sun's revenue also fell well below the consensus forecast of $2.86 billion.
 Breaking from past practice, Sun canceled its planned conference call with investors and securities analysts to discuss the results.
 Oracle's decision to buy Sun caught those watching the technology infrastructure market by surprise. 
 Traditionally, Oracle has sold databases and business application software, partnering with hardware makers like Sun, Hewlett-Packard and Dell. With Sun, Oracle would move into direct competition with its partners, selling Sun's server and storage hardware. Oracle would also gain Sun's software assets, like its Solaris operating system and Java programming language. 
 Oracle has yet to comment in detail on its new role as a hardware maker. 
 Sun's sales may have been affected by the uncertainty over its future. In March. I.B.M.'s negotiations to buy Sun became public. Ultimately, Sun's board rejected I.B.M.'s offer. 
 ''Customer uncertainty presents a significant pressure point on their revenue going forward,'' Mr. Sacconaghi said. 
 While Sun cut research and development and administrative costs during the quarter, its revenue fell at a quicker clip. This disparity again highlighted concerns about Sun's cost structure, which has been characterized as bloated for years. Analysts expect Oracle to cut up to 10,000 jobs after acquiring Sun and its 30,000-plus work force. 
 If the acquisition closes as planned this summer, Sun may have issued its last financial report as an independent company, marking an unceremonious end to one of Silicon Valley's most prominent companies.
 Shares of Sun were flat during Tuesday's trading, closing at $9.16 a share, and were little changed after hours.

HEADLINE: Navy Boot Camp Stays in Revamp Mode

BYLINE: By LONG HWA-SHU

DATELINE: NORTH CHICAGO, Ill. 

 BODY:
The nearly century-old Great Lakes Naval Station here, home of the Navy's only boot camp, has been rejuvenated by a $770 million capital construction program that began more than a decade ago and is still under way. This is not the end of the planned improvements, however; more construction is already being planned.
 The work is aimed at ''making this training base the very best in the world,'' said Capt. David Schnell, commanding officer of the base. Great Lakes, which is the world's largest naval basic training facility, covers 1,600 acres and has 1,300 buildings along Lake Michigan, about 35 miles north of Chicago.
 ''We have visitors from other navies,'' Captain Schnell said. ''They come here to see what we do and go back to improve theirs.'' The base has a population of more than 23,000, including more than 14,000 recruits and students. As the largest employer in Lake County, it is an integral part of the local economy. 
 Some 2.8 million square feet of improvements have already been completed: 15 barracks, a facility for emergency sea rescue training, a small-arms marksmanship trainer and three drill halls. The reconstruction began in 1998, and it is expected to finish on schedule next year. So far, there have been no cost overruns, according to Cmdr. Phillip G. Cyr, the public works officer.
 But more construction is already planned after that. Subject to Congressional approval, the base intends to follow up the current reconstruction with a five-year $520 million Recapitalization 2 program to modernize the original sector of the Naval Station, where the base headquarters and the Training Support Center are housed. ''There is no letup here,'' said Captain Schnell, who has been commanding officer of the base for two years.
 The center, which conducts the Navy's largest technical training program anywhere, offers more than 80 courses covering numerous aspects of surface warfare, including electronics, gunnery, machinery repair and gas turbine operations. On top of the 42,000 recruits who graduate from the boot camp each year, more than 15,000 sailors receive specialized training at the center.
 ''Many of these old buildings are not energy-efficient and are no longer adaptable to the changes needed to facilitate better training,'' said Commander Cyr, who recently returned to the base after serving for a year as deputy operations officer for the $22 billion reconstruction program in Iraq.
 Noteworthy among the structures completed under the current program is the $13 million 58,000-square-foot Atlantic Fleet Drill Hall, used for drills, sporting events, physical fitness and other training. The base is seeking silver certification from the United States Green Building Council for the hall for energy efficiency and the use of local vendors and recycled materials.
 Another showcase of the current program is a $82 million high-tech sea rescue trainer, called Battle Stations 21, encased in a two-story building; it won the 2008 excellence award from the Design-Build Institute of America, a commercial construction trade group based in Washington.
 The station is a scaled-down replica of a guided missile destroyer, moored in a moat. It offers realistic simulations of the sights, sounds and smells that might be encountered at sea. One such simulation is the suicide bombing attack on the U.S.S. Cole in the port of Aden, Yemen, on Oct. 12, 2000.
 As many as 352 recruits at a time practice firefighting, damage control, flood control, rescue operations and other emergency measures on board. ''This is a rite of passage for recruits before graduation,'' Commander Cyr said of the grueling 12-hour session, which leaves recruits soaking wet and fatigued.
 The buildings that have been finished replaced ramshackle structures dating back to World War II and the 1960s. The new structures were built of red bricks to match the exterior of existing architecture. They are laid out like a college campus on a 230-acre site with connecting pathways, solar-powered street-crossing signs and landscaping.
 The new facilities, officials say, have greatly improved the quality and efficiency of boot camp and have therefore cut costs. The three-story barracks, each capable of holding more than 1,200 recruits, are self-contained, with sleeping quarters, galleys and classrooms. 
 ''There's more training and less marching around,'' said Senior Chief Petty Officer Victor Hernandez, at a barracks named for the U.S.S. Enterprise, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. ''It cuts the length of training by a week.''
 Recruits graduate after eight weeks of intensive training, and those who continue for further technical training complete their studies in two weeks to six months before they join the fleet. 
 Graduations are held practically every Friday. The demand for food, lodging and gas has helped the local economy as family members and friends come to attend graduation ceremonies. 
 Among the remaining projects in the current program is a $48.2 million 223,000-square-foot barracks, set to be completed next year. Also scheduled for 2010 are a $73 million package including a parking garage, visitor center and improvements to roads, a $16 million renovation of a historic building, a $5 million makeover of the bachelors' apartments. 
 For Recapitalization 2, Commander Cyr said, plans are to demolish 43 of a total of 160 buildings on the older side of the base that are deemed obsolete, inadaptable and costly to maintain. Ten buildings will be erected in their place. One structure scheduled for demolition is a Naval Hospital built in 1960. It is to be replaced by a $130 million joint project of the Navy and Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates a medical center adjoining the base. The project is expected to save $160 million over 40 years, the lifespan of the buildings, by streamlining maintenance, utilities and other costs, according to a base spokesman, Bill Couch. 
 The project, which is to be finished next year, will create an ambulatory care center, a parking garage and a new wing for the V.A. medical center, which is also being renovated.
 ''We're hopeful that we'll be authorized to proceed with Recapitalization 2 to modernize the older side of the base,'' Captain Schnell said during an interview in his office in the imposing 100-year-old three-story headquarters building with a 150-foot clock tower. The neo-Classical-style building has recently undergone a $17.3 million renovation.
 ''We wouldn't be sitting here if it weren't for the generosity and patriotism of the Merchants Club of Chicago,'' a club of prominent business executives, founded in 1896, he said.
 The Navy nearly backed out of a deal in 1905 to buy the original 172 acres because Congress had appropriated only limited funds. But the club, which is no longer in existence, raised $175,000 to buy the land and donated it to the Navy. 
 The base's leaders expect its role to continue long into the future. ''We plan to be here for another 100 years and beyond,'' Captain Schnell declared.

HEADLINE: As More Apply for Welfare, Concern for Those Denied

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Even as the welfare rolls in New York State dropped steadily over the last decade, the number of applications in the state increased by 35 percent from 1999 to 2007, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. 
 That trend left advocates wondering if more people were withdrawing their applications or were being turned down for welfare benefits because of overly stringent or confusing requirements -- a fear that will only deepen as a growing number of unemployed and low-income people turn to cash assistance. 
 ''Our social safety net system in the state and in the city has been weakened since the welfare restructuring,'' said Bich Ha Pham, the director of policy, advocacy and research for the federation and an author of the report. ''A lot of the unemployed New Yorkers who have lost their jobs in this recession are going to encounter barriers to social services that are meant for them.'' 
 In the state, cash-assistance applications rose to 554,307 in 2007 from 410,518 in 1999. In New York City, applications rose to 341,635 in 2007 from 221,895 in 1999, a 54 percent increase, the report said. 
 Last month, the number of welfare recipients in New York City inched up slightly for the second month in a row, after a long decline. There were 343,384 recipients of cash assistance in New York City in March, up 0.4 percent from February, according to data from the Human Resources Administration, which administers welfare in New York City.
 In February, the city's unemployment rate jumped to 8.1 percent from 6.9 percent in January, the largest jump in a single month on record. 
 The national welfare reforms of 1996 ushered in a new program with work rules, time limits and greater latitude for states to discourage people from receiving welfare.
 The report released Tuesday blamed those reforms for ''roadblocks'' to receiving welfare: a cumbersome application process, excessive documentation requirements and a strict sanctions process, which contributed to an increase in application denials. (The tally includes applications that were voluntarily withdrawn.) The findings echoed a survey released in November by Betsy Gotbaum, the city's public advocate, which said welfare help centers imposed unnecessary barriers for people seeking cash assistance, including long waits and confusing instructions from employees. 
 Michael Hayes, a spokesman for the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, said he had ''some concern'' with the report's analysis. David A. Hansell, commissioner of temporary and disability assistance, said that in response to the economy, state officials had financed new job training programs and increased the basic welfare grant for the first time in 19 years.
 ''Today's difficult economic climate has forced us to redouble our efforts to help welfare recipients move into the work force and stay employed,'' Mr. Hansell said in an e-mail message. ''That has been, and remains, the core focus of welfare reform, and the basis of its success.''
 Robert Doar, the city's commissioner of human resources, said the report ''badly mischaracterizes welfare reform in New York City.'' 
 ''Most notably, it fails to acknowledge that welfare policies that require work have significantly increased employment for welfare recipients, reduced child poverty and lowered welfare caseloads to their lowest level in 40 years,'' he said. 
 Some advocates praised the expansion of safety nets beyond welfare -- like food stamps, unemployment benefits and Medicaid, entitlement programs that low-income New Yorkers have turned to in greater numbers -- but said cash assistance should be made just as accessible. 
 ''The welfare program could be helping a lot of the same population,'' said Don Friedman, a managing lawyer for the Empire Justice Center, a legal advocacy group. ''Yet it continues to be run in a way that makes it difficult for people to receive benefits. If you miss any appointment, or if you do something that they consider a failure to comply, it begins the sanction process, where there is a reduction or termination of benefits. This is a punishment-driven system.'' 
 Wendy A. Bach, a clinical professor in the Economic Justice Project at the CUNY School of Law, said the economic crisis called for a renewed focus on welfare. 
 ''We're very focused on getting certain benefits to households,'' she said of food stamps and Medicaid. ''But with welfare, the system is designed to be extraordinarily cumbersome and difficult. Welfare policy is, in very large part, designed to divert people from receiving welfare.''

HEADLINE: Pfizer Profit Dips 2% as Demand for Lipitor Declines

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
As the drug giant Pfizer sails toward its merger with Wyeth, the company is hitting headwinds in the form of patent expirations and weakening sales in some important products, including Lipitor. 
 Pfizer reported a 2 percent decline in first-quarter profits on Tuesday, to $3.7 billion, and an 8 percent decline in revenue, to $10.9 billion. While more than half the revenue decline came from the effect of a stronger dollar on overseas sales, company officials and analysts said, the profits fell in response to generic competition and weakening demand for some of Pfizer's leading drugs.
 The cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the world's top-selling drug, had sales of $2.7 billion, a decline of 8 percent from the first quarter of 2008, on lower-than-expected sales in the United States. Pfizer has been hoping to wring more revenue from Lipitor, whose patent expires in November 2011. 
 Pfizer also reported declining sales in two brand-name drugs that went off patent last year -- the allergy medicine Zyrtec and the chemotherapy drug Camptosar. And Chantix, a smoking cessation drug the company had formerly hoped could be a blockbuster, had a sales decline of 36 percent, to $177 million, for the quarter, on concerns that it can have psychiatric side effects.
 But several analysts praised Pfizer for slightly beating expected earnings per share, which it achieved mainly through cost-cutting. Excluding restructuring costs, the company earned 54 cents a share, compared with 49 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. 
 ''A solid quarter, and the earnings beat is encouraging, especially on the heels of Merck's miss last week,'' Jami Rubin, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in a note to investors. Merck announced a 56 percent drop in earnings last week, and an 8 percent decline in sales in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier. 
 Pfizer shares closed down 10 cents, to $13.39, on Tuesday.
 On the brighter side, the deal to acquire Wyeth, intended to replenish Pfizer's drug pipeline, is going better than expected, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, said in a conference call with analysts. 
 Pfizer, based in New York, is buying Wyeth, 30 miles west in Madison, N.J., for cash, stock and debt, with the deal still expected to close in the third or fourth quarter. 
 Pfizer's stock has declined by 23 percent since the purchase was announced in late January, in part because the company is cutting dividends in half to help finance it. Responding to analysts' questions Tuesday, Frank A. D'Amelio, Pfizer's chief financial officer, said that financing and merger agreements required dividends to be kept low ''until the deal is closed.'' 
 The merger deal has spurred a round of drug industry consolidation. Merck has agreed to pay $41 billion for Schering-Plough, while Roche paid $47 billion for the 44 percent share of Genentech it did not already own. 
 The lower stock price means Pfizer will end up paying less than the $68 billion calculated in January. And Mr. Kindler said lower interest rates in the global recession have also made borrowing cheaper.
 Mr. Kindler said 34 banks were now financing the deal, none of them committed for more than $600 million.
 Three weeks ago, Pfizer announced that the merger would result in creation of two major research units in the combined operation to build on each company's strengths. A biotechnology group will be led by Mikael Dolsten, Wyeth's head of research, while his Pfizer counterpart, Martin Mackay, will lead a traditional pharmaceuticals group. 
 Pfizer is also giving crucial roles to Menelas Pangolas, who leads Alzheimer's disease research for Wyeth, and Emilio Emini, who heads vaccine research for Wyeth, as the company searches to replace profits from older drugs facing generic competition.
 Catherine J. Arnold, a Credit Suisse analyst, wrote in a note to investors that the restructuring and personnel moves ''appear well thought out and make us more optimistic'' the merger will succeed.
 Mr. Kindler said the combined company would produce $20 billion cash flow a year by 2012.

HEADLINE: Stocks Barely Move, Pending New Signals

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Nothing, it seemed, could move the stock markets on Tuesday.
 Faced with news about big banks and stress tests, home sales, consumer confidence and the future of the auto industry, investors offered almost no reaction. The major indexes swung between light gains and losses all day before ending slightly lower. 
 Transportation and telecommunications companies buoyed the broader markets, while financial stocks dragged them lower. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 8.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to end at 8,016.95, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.35 points, or 0.3 percent, to 855.16. The Nasdaq was down 0.3 percent at 1,673.81.
 To some extent, investors were waiting for two important economic developments set for Wednesday. The government is scheduled to report its preliminary estimate of economic growth in the first quarter, and the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is expected to release a statement as it concludes a two-day meeting in Washington.
 Shares of major banks declined as investors looked for more details of the government's stress tests of the nation's top 19 banks. Bank of America fell 8.6 percent, to $8.15 a share, and Citigroup declined 5.9 percent, to $2.89, after a report that the government was urging the banks to raise more capital.
 Investors barely reacted to better economic reports, including an unexpected increase in consumer confidence and slower declines in prices of single-family homes.
 While neither report showed that the nation's economy had suddenly returned to health, analysts said they offered more glimmers of evidence that the recession's declines could be abating.
 Shares of department stores and other retailers, cable companies and other consumer companies paced the rest of the market after the Conference Board reported that its consumer confidence index rose in April. 
 The index rose to 39.2 this month, from 26.9 in March, as people said their economic situation had not significantly worsened, and that their expectations for the future had improved. Fewer people said business conditions were bad, and they said they expected more jobs to be available in the months ahead.
 Still, consumers are more pessimistic than they were last November, when the financial crisis was erupting, and their hopes about jobs could change if unemployment continues to increase.
 Drug stocks also continued to rise after the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert for swine flu to level 4 from level 3, increasing fears that the spreading outbreak could disrupt commerce and economic recovery in some countries.
 On Monday, investors bought heavily into pharmaceutical shares, fled the Mexican peso and Mexican companies and pushed shares of airlines sharply lower as they watched to see how concerns over swine flu would ripple through the global financial system.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 27/32, to 97 26/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.01 percent, from 2.91 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Signs G.O.P. Is Rethinking Stance on Gay Marriage

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was only five years ago that opposition to gay marriage was so strong that Republicans explicitly turned to the issue as a way to energize conservative voters. Yet today, as the party contemplates the task of rebuilding itself, some Republicans say the issue of gay marriage may be turning into more of a hindrance than a help.
 The fact that a run of states have legalized gay marriage in recent months -- either by court decision or by legislative action -- with little backlash is only one indication of how public attitudes about this subject appear to be changing. 
 More significant is evidence in polls of a widening divide on the issue by age, suggesting to many Republicans that the potency of the gay-marriage question is on the decline. It simply does not appear to have the resonance with younger voters that it does with older ones. 
 Consider this: In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, released on Monday, 31 percent of respondents over the age of 40 said they supported gay marriage. By contrast, 57 percent under age 40 said they supported it, a 26-point difference. Among the older respondents, 35 percent said they opposed any legal recognition of same-sex couples, be it marriage or civil unions. Among the younger crowd, just 19 percent held that view.
 Steve Schmidt, who was the senior strategist to Senator John McCain of Arizona during his presidential campaign, said in a speech and an interview that Republicans were in danger of losing these younger voters unless the party comes to appreciate how issues like gay marriage resonate, or do not resonate, with them.
 ''Republicans should re-examine the extent to which we are being defined by positions on issues that I don't believe are among our core values, and that put us at odds with what I expect will become, over time, if not a consensus view, then the view of a substantial majority of voters,'' he said in a speech.
 This does not mean, Republicans said, that most Americans are suddenly embracing the idea of same-sex couples going to the chapel. It is more that, for a lot of these Americans, gay marriage is not something they spend a lot of time worrying about, or even thinking about.
 For younger respondents, this shift may in part be cultural: the result of coming of age in an era when openly gay people have become increasingly common in popular entertainment and in public life, not to mention in their own families or social circles. Familiarity in this case breeds relative comfort, or perhaps just lack of interest.
 The other reason, members of both parties said, is that the argument over gay marriage seems beside the point at a time when the country is facing a severe economic crisis, remains on edge for another domestic terrorist attack and has just inaugurated its first black president.
 ''Right now, people are not concerned about issues like gay marriage because they are concerned about the economy,'' Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former Republican mayor of New York, told reporters in Albany after meeting with Republican members of the state Senate, who are opposing legislation to legalize gay marriage. 
 Mr. Giuliani explained that he opposed gay marriage -- while supporting civil unions -- but that he did not think it made much sense for Republicans to be harping on the issue if the party had any serious interest in returning to power.
 ''The Republican party does best organizing itself around economic issues and issues of national security,'' said Mr. Giuliani, 64, who ran for president last year and is now thinking about running for governor of New York. 
 The difference in attitudes among age groups has been noted by Republicans at a time when party leaders are engaged in discussion about what policies and messages can best help them regain some of the power they have lost to Democrats. Some conservative leaders said that unless something happened to reverse the trend, it would simply be a matter of time -- perhaps as many as 10 years, perhaps as few as 3 -- before opposition to gay marriage would get traction in only a few parts of the country.
 In this latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, 42 percent of all respondents said they supported gay marriage, compared with 22 percent in March 2004. By contrast, 18 percent of Republicans supported gay marriage, while 49 percent said they opposed any kind of recognition of gay unions. The electorate at large seems to be moving while Republican base voters are not, a challenge to any Republican seeing to win his or her party's nomination in 2012.
 ''It's a problem,'' said Mr. Schmidt said in an interview.
 This was reflected in a recent conversation with Tim Pawlenty, the Republican governor of Minnesota, a social conservative who opposes gay marriage and is considering a run for president. 
 Asked if he thought, given recent events, that Republicans were making a political mistake in emphasizing gay issues, Mr. Pawlenty, who is 48, responded: ''I think it's an important issue for our conservative voters.'' But he notably did not dwell on the subject.
 Before joining Mr. McCain's ill-fated campaign, Mr. Schmidt was known in Republican circles for arguing that the party needed to move away from social issues to be successful; he managed Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign for governor in California. 
 ''The Republican Party is shrinking,'' he said. ''One of the reasons it is shrinking is because there are large demographics in this country that view the party as intolerant or not relevant to them. Politics is about addition.''
 For Republicans, the complications of this issue could very well focus on the very first state on the nominating calendar in 2012, Iowa. The courts there overturned a law banning gay marriage earlier this month, and social conservatives -- who are a strong force in Republican politics in Iowa -- are already organizing to try to amend the state Constitution to restore the ban. 
 Should developments continue apace, Republican candidates for president are going to be pressed to support that effort, and to spend time talking about an issue that could undercut their appeal to more centrist voters in a general election.
 Will that matter? As Mr. Schmidt noted, the winner of the Iowa Republican caucus is hardly assured of becoming the party's nominee; Mr. McCain lost there in 2008. Still, he said it would be difficult for any Republican candidate to win his party's nomination in 2012 without opposing gay marriage.
 ''I think it's likely that all our candidates will be against gay marriage,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''But the point is this: There should be a de-emphasis on this issue. This is not the most important issue facing the country. In states where this has been made legal, there has been a collective yawn from the citizenry in a lot of these states. The party should focus on disagreeing with the president on the axis of issues that we agree on.''
 Mr. Schmidt is 38 years old.

HEADLINE: School Nurse's Response to Flu Wins Applause

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Too often school nurses are all but forgotten in the education wars over test scores, standardization and vouchers. Across the country, from Atlanta to New York City, amid budget cuts and economic turmoil, advocates say, the jobs of school nurses are increasingly at risk.
 Now nurses are crowing over the role of one of their own, Mary Pappas, in uncovering the first swine flu cluster in New York State. Through her quick thinking, she might have lifted the status and perhaps even saved the jobs of thousands of nurses. 
 It was her call to the New York City Health Department last Thursday morning that prompted the city to send samples from sick students to Atlanta for testing, and resulted in the first eight confirmed cases of swine flu in New York State on Sunday, triggering a nationwide response.
 Five days later, Ms. Pappas has become a sort of folk hero to nurses across the country, interviewed on radio and celebrated by the National Association of School Nurses.
 Ms. Pappas, who is responsible, with two assistants, for 2,700 students at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens, first spotted signs that something was wrong last Thursday, when five or six seniors came to her office complaining of sore throats and fever soon after school opened.
 By 10 a.m., dozens of students were pouring into the hallway outside her office, sitting miserably on the floor, nauseous and confused.
 ''Wow, we have something going on here,'' she recalled thinking in an interview on Tuesday.
 ''I don't feel like I'm a hero,'' said Ms. Pappas, who had not been identified on Sunday when the city revealed her role in spurring its investigation. ''But I feel like I have very good instincts, based on my experience, and that's why I'm here. I think school nurses should be at all schools. You're like the hub, if something doesn't go right.''
 Among her previous experiences was a whooping-cough outbreak, which forced the postponement of a few football games, but nothing else of the magnitude she was seeing.
 By about 10:30 Thursday morning, she said, she had gone to the principal's office and called Dr. Gary Krigsman, a supervising doctor in the bureau of school health, on his cellphone to tell him that students were dropping sick, many with fevers of 101.5 and 102 degrees. (Her son, a junior at the school, also came down with a mild fever.)
 Dr. Krigsman connected her to Ada Santiago, a nurse who works closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
 ''Then I felt better and went back to my office, where it was pretty chaotic,'' Ms. Pappas recalled. Her two assistants, her mother, Agnes, and Kathy Carroll, were so busy that they had been joined by secretaries, assistant principals and even school security officers. Everyone was taking temperatures, triaging cases and using cellphones to call parents to come and take their children home.
 Students sat on the floor, miserable and confused, as school employees scrambled to find enough chairs. Ms. Pappas sent 102 students home on Thursday and another 80 on Friday, even though a small number of those, she noted, were suffering from allergies and injuries rather than flu symptoms.
 The health department had asked for a list of absences beginning the day before, along with her log of every student and their symptoms.
 Swine flu never occurred to her, even though she recognized the symptoms as some kind of flu.
 Oddly, Ms. Pappas said, neither she nor anyone who worked with her that day has become sick. They took no special precautions, she said, beyond washing hands because there just wasn't time.
 ''I don't live life like that, in fear,'' she said. ''I try to just do my job and stay calm. The know me, they trust me. If we were calm, they were better.''

HEADLINE: Swine Flu Vaccine May Be Months Away, Experts Say

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Federal officials said it would take until January, or late November at the earliest, to make enough vaccine to protect all Americans from a possible epidemic of swine flu.
 And beyond the United States and a few other countries that also make vaccines, some experts said it could take years to produce enough swine flu vaccine to satisfy global demand.
 Although production is much faster than would have been possible even a few years ago, it still may not be in time to avert death and illness if the virus starts spreading widely and becomes more virulent, some experts said. 
 In this country, the biggest problem is that despite years of effort, the country is still relying on half-century-old technology to make the flu vaccines. 
 Federal authorities have spent years and more than a billion dollars trying to shift vaccine production to a faster, more reliable method -- one that involves growing the vaccine viruses in vats of cells rather than in hen's eggs, the old technology. And there are numerous small companies developing totally new approaches that might allow for the production of huge volumes of vaccines in a matter of weeks.
 But the cell-based production is not quite ready, and some of the newer techniques are not proven enough to satisfy many experts. 
 ''Those are all great technologies, but it isn't going to happen in time,'' said Dr. Greg Poland, head of the vaccine research program at the Mayo Clinic. 
 Federal officials have not yet made a decision on whether the swine flu is enough of a threat to warrant vaccine production. But they are taking the initial steps. 
 A potential problem is that producing swine flu vaccine might interfere with production of the seasonal flu vaccine for next winter. 
 ''We would have to most likely make a compromise,'' Andrin Oswald, chief executive of the vaccine division at the drug maker Novartis, said in an interview. 
 But Robin Robinson, who runs the emergency preparation research program for the federal Department of Health and Human Services, said most manufacturers would have finished producing the bulk of seasonal vaccine by June. 
 If production of the swine flu vaccine were to start right after that, the first 50 million to 80 million doses would be available by September, Dr. Robinson said. 
 A full 600 million doses, enough to provide the required two shots for each American, could be finished by January. If immune stimulants called adjuvants were added to the vaccine, that could reduce the dosage needed by each person, allowing enough doses to be ready by late November, he said. 
 The vaccine industry is in a much stronger position to respond now than it was five years ago, when the United States had only two flu vaccine suppliers and was hit by a severe shortage. 
 Now there are five suppliers to the domestic market. And the vaccine industry, once a backwater of the pharmaceutical industry, is attracting new investments, lured by government subsidies and higher prices for vaccines. 
 Still, a study done with the World Health Organization and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations estimated that it would probably take four years of production to satisfy fully global demand for a vaccine to protect against the bird flu strain that has concerned health authorities for the last few years. 
 Similar projections might apply to the swine flu vaccine, some experts say. 
 ''The bottom line is there won't be enough vaccine quickly enough and the vaccine will largely go to the countries that already produce the vaccine,'' because countries will restrict exports in a pandemic, said Dr. David Fedson, an independent expert on pandemic preparedness. 
 The federal government is encouraging manufacturers to set up production in the United States, since all companies but one, Sanofi-Aventis, now import their flu vaccines. 
 The government also gave $1.3 billion, spread among several manufacturers, to develop ways of producing the vaccine in vats of animal cells rather than in eggs. Cell culture is less vulnerable to contamination and the process could save at least a few weeks. 
 The results so far have been mixed. Solvay, which was awarded the biggest federal grant, nearly $300 million, decided it was economically too risky to build a flu vaccine plant in the United States. (Most of the grant money had not yet left federal coffers and will not be lost, Dr. Robinson said.) Sanofi-Aventis has also put cell culture production on the back burner, Dr. Robinson said. 
 But Novartis is building a cell culture flu vaccine factory in Holly Springs, N.C., which might be ready for use in 2010 or 2011. The federal government is providing nearly $500 million in construction costs and guaranteed vaccine purchases.

HEADLINE: The Naming of Swine Flu, a Curious Matter

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
What to call the new strain of flu raising alarms around the world has taken on political, economic and diplomatic overtones. 
 Pork producers question whether the term ''swine flu'' is appropriate, given that the new virus has not yet been isolated in samples taken from pigs in Mexico or elsewhere. While the new virus seems to be most heavily composed of genetic sequences from swine influenza virus material, it also has human and avian influenza genetic sequences as well, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
 Government officials in Thailand, one of the world's largest meat exporters, have started referring to the disease as ''Mexican flu.'' An Israeli deputy health minister -- an ultra-Orthodox Jew -- said his country would do the same, to keep Jews from having to say the word ''swine.'' However, his call seemed to have been largely ignored. 
 Janet Napolitano, the secretary for homeland security, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack went out of their way at a press conference in Washington on Tuesday to refer to the virus by its scientific name, as the ''H1N1 virus.''
 ''This is not a food-borne illness, virus -- it is not correct to refer to it as swine flu because really that's not what this is about,'' Mr. Vilsack said.
 The World Organization for Animal Health, which handles veterinary issues around the world, issued a statement late Monday suggesting that the new disease should be labeled ''North American influenza,'' in keeping with a long medical tradition of naming influenza pandemics for the regions where they were first identified. This has included the Spanish flu of 1918 to 1919, the Asian flu of 1957 to 1958 and the Hong Kong flu of 1967 to 1968. 
 The debate is likely to continue as scientists and health authorities try to trace the disease. While all signs now point to Mexico as the epicenter, the genetic material in the virus there includes part of a swine influenza virus of Eurasian origin. And influenza viruses tend to emerge from Asia. 
 Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China called for stepped up measures on Tuesday to prevent and control any possible cases of swine flu that might show up in the country.
 Many medical historians believe that the Asian and Hong Kong flus started in southeastern China near Hong Kong, where very high densities of people live in close proximity to hogs and chickens in rural areas and can share their viruses. Some historians also suggest that the Spanish flu also started in southeastern China. 
 The Mexican ambassador to Beijing, Jorge Guajardo, has been outspoken this week in suggesting that the disease did not originate in Mexico. He said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that the disease was brought to his country by an infected person from somewhere in ''Eurasia,'' the land mass of Europe and Asia.
 Ambassador Guajardo said in a telephone interview that his government had been told by American and Canadian experts that the genetic sequence of the virus pointed to Eurasian origin.
 ''This did not happen in Mexico,'' he said, adding, ''It was a human who brought this to Mexico.'' 
 But flu specialists in Asia said that the new virus probably did not make the jump from animals to people in Asia. 
 ''If that is the case, you would see a lot of infections in Asia by now,'' said Subash Morzaria, the regional manager for Asia and the Pacific at the Emergency Center for Transboundary Diseases, which is part of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 The neuraminidase genetic segment of the virus, which gives the virus its ''N1'' name and controls the ability of the virus to break out of infected cells, comes from a Eurasian strain of swine flu, said Dr. Yuen Kwok-yung, a microbiologist at Hong Kong University. But he added that enough pigs are moved across national borders that it is impossible to place the location more precisely. 
 There seems little indication of any outbreak of the new flu in China. There have been no recent surges in illnesses among pigs or pig farmers, according to Ben Boake, the executive vice president of the Henan Zhongpin Food Company Ltd., one of China's largest pork processors. 
 Millions of pigs died in China two years ago in an epidemic so severe that it pushed pork prices up 90 percent. Veterinarians attributed the deaths at the time mainly to blue-ear disease, which does not affect humans, but also to swine flu. The Chinese government did not issue a public report assessing the outbreak and provided very few details to international organizations.

HEADLINE: Pork Industry Fights Misbeliefs as Trade Bans Arise and Shoppers Grow Wary

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN and CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Denise Grady contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The swine flu is producing global hesitation over eating pork.
 As more cases of the new influenza emerged on Tuesday, deepening worries about a possible pandemic, several nations slammed their borders shut to pork from the United States and Mexico. Wall Street analysts predicted a sharp decline of pork sales in grocery stores, and some consumers began steering clear of pork chops.
 The pork industry reacted with frustration. Medical authorities say that people cannot contract the swine flu from eating properly cooked pork. There is no evidence so far that the people who are becoming sick were in contact with pigs. In fact, authorities are not even sure how susceptible pigs are to infection with the new flu. 
 Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, convened a hearing on Tuesday on a subject he described as ''the so-called swine flu,'' even as a campaign was mounted by farm groups to rename the virus ''North American influenza.''
 ''Swine flu is a misnomer,'' said C. Larry Pope, the chief executive of Smithfield Foods, who said he feared panic among consumers. ''They need to be concerned about influenza, but not eating pork.''
 Researchers say that based on its genetic structure, the new virus is without question a type of swine influenza, derived originally from a strain that lived in pigs. But the experts are still sorting out how long ago it infected pigs and how much it might have mutated when it jumped to humans.
 ''It's fair to say that at some point the virus passed through a pig,'' said Dr. Paul A. Offit, an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ''It could have been months; it could have been years ago.''
 Even if pigs were the original source of the disease, experts said they did not appear to be playing any role in its transmission now. The virus is passing from person to person, they said, most likely by the spread of respiratory droplets.
 The assurances from medical authorities have not forestalled a pork panic.
 Several countries on Tuesday announced that they were banning some or all pork products from the United States, angering trade negotiators and hog farmers. To date, countries including the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Ecuador have banned pork from the United States, with Mexican pork exports also covered by most of those bans.
 China banned pork from certain states, and Russia banned all meat imports, not just pork, from certain states.
 Trade officials said it was not uncommon for countries to impose trade restrictions upon news of an outbreak, either as an emotional response to appease consumers or a convenient excuse to impose a trade barrier. For instance, South Korea banned American beef for five years because of fears of mad cow disease. 
 The challenge, the officials say, is persuading those countries to reverse the restrictions so they do not become permanent.
 ''If you don't reverse bad policy quickly, people get used to it,'' said Allen F. Johnson, a former chief agriculture trade negotiator for the United States trade representative and now a consultant. 
 On Tuesday, the Obama administration's chief trade representative, Ron Kirk, urged trading partners to base their decisions on science and international trade obligations, and he suggested that bans on American pork ''may result in serious trade disruptions without cause.''
 Some hog producers were furious at the trade bans, saying they were simply a political ploy by countries to give their own farmers a leg up. ''We are in a very economically stressed economy, and anything a country can do to discredit another country's product, they will do that for trade advantage,'' said Scott Burroughs, the chief operating officer at Nebraska Pork Partners.
 While it may be too soon to know how the swine flu outbreak will affect pork sales, early indications are mixed. Pork sales at Wal-Mart are down by high single digits, a spokeswoman said. However, pork sales have remained constant at Publix, a grocery chain based in Florida.
 At a grocery store in downtown Houston, Gina Tran, a homemaker, said she usually bought pork but had stopped because of safety concerns.
 ''People in Mexico ate some pork and got sick, right?'' said Ms. Tran, who was looking for selections in the beef case. (That is not what happened, as far as anyone knows.)
 Yvonne Enard, a retired warehouse worker, said she too believed there was a connection between pork and swine flu but figured it would be safe to eat anyway. ''I'll buy it, but I wouldn't buy it from just any store, and I would season it and cook it very well,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Dealing With the Swine Flu Outbreak

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''U.S. Declares Health Emergency as Cases of Swine Flu Emerge'' (front page, April 27): 
 As someone who has worked in a nursing home for many years, I've seen outbreaks of infections. And I've seen our rapid responses to contain and prevent their spreading by quarantining. So I'm frankly quite baffled by our government's response, or lack of it, to the swine flu outbreak.
 We now know that the only confirmed outbreak in New York City is at St. Francis Preparatory School, where you reported that students visited Mexico on spring break. Once it became apparent last week that the source of the flu was Mexico, why wasn't our immediate response to prevent passage into Mexico or out to the United States? And if we delayed in doing that, why aren't we doing that now? Isn't the job of our government to protect us? 
 Sandy Meyers Bronx, April 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The rabid anti-immigration-ism that is stoked by mistruths and omissions of the mainstream media, especially on television but in newspapers as well, is a continuing public health menace when outbreaks of infectious disease like the swine flu occurs -- in that immigrants without green cards will not feel free to seek medical care at health institutions. 
 The vigilante atmosphere is self-sabotaging and as mentioned is in and of itself a public health hazard because, similar to the critical census-taking protocol, it relies on people to identify themselves in an atmosphere of racism, hate, xenophobia and scapegoating. 
 A many-pronged approach by local, state and federal institutions needs to address this obstacle to isolating and treating outbreaks of contagious illnesses.
 Cindy Shapiro Beulah, Mich., April 27, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The Senate should not have delayed acting on the nomination of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas as health and human services secretary, so a permanent director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could be appointed. 
 The secretary of homeland security and the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, are not the usual individuals to decide on the status of a public health emergency.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''The New Swine Flu'' (editorial, April 28): Here are the nonmedical problems associated with this potential pandemic disease: 
 The Republicans in Congress took $900 million out of the stimulus bill that was to be used as an ''insurance policy'' against possible pandemics. 
 There are thousands of people coming across our border from Mexico, and if the news reports are to be taken seriously, most are coming into the United States with virtually no screening or questions asked. 
 The party of ''no,'' the same Republicans on Capitol Hill, have until recently been blocking action on the nomination of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to become secretary of health and human services, leaving a huge void at the top of the agency that has the responsibility to protect us from pandemics.
 The alerts and warnings that have gone up worldwide are a very good thing indeed. America might want to look at temperature-screening devices at all entry points into this country starting today! The last thing we need right now is an epidemic of swine flu that could become a global pandemic.
 Henry A. Lowenstein New York, April 28, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Officials Point to Swine Flu in New York'' (front page, April 26): 
 Dare we ask why this happening? While its exact origin is still unclear, this pathogen, and many others (like avian influenza), originated from animals being raised or eaten for food. 
 As the world moves toward raising the majority of animals in the unnatural setting of factory farms, it is likely that more, and worse, such pathogens will arise. What will it take for us, and our public health leaders, to question our addiction to meat and tolerance of factory farming? The meat industry is environmentally devastating, incredibly inhumane and now potentially the end to us all.

 To the Editor:
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists staying home from school or work as one of the several precautionary measures for dealing with the swine flu. Common sense also tells people who are sick to limit contact with others. Yet for millions of people, that step could result in loss of wages or disciplinary action at work.
 Ensuring that those who are ill can stay home, or keep their sick children home, is exactly why we need to guarantee a minimum number of paid sick days to all workers. Every one of us needs this critical protection carried out before the country faces a pandemic. 
 We urge Congress to take action on the Healthy Families Act and employers to assure workers that they will not be punished for following guidelines from the nation's health experts.

 A recent Times article (''Texas Governor's Secession Talk Stirs Furor,'' April 18) quoted Gov. Rick Perry of Texas expressing sympathy for secessionist sentiment in his home state: ''If Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, who knows what may come of that?''
 But on April 26, you report that ''Gov. Rick Perry of Texas asked the C.D.C. to send 37,430 doses of Tamiflu.''
 It would appear that the governor has realized that membership has its privileges.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sets Fight In the Poppies To Stop Taliban

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS

DATELINE: ZANGABAD, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
American commanders are planning to cut off the Taliban's main source of money, the country's multimillion-dollar opium crop, by pouring thousands of troops into the three provinces that bankroll much of the group's operations.
 The plan to send 20,000 Marines and soldiers into Helmand, Kandahar and Zabul Provinces this summer promises weeks and perhaps months of heavy fighting, since American officers expect the Taliban to vigorously defend what makes up the economic engine for the insurgency. The additional troops, the centerpiece of President Obama's effort to reverse the course of the seven-year war, will roughly double the number already in southern Afghanistan. The troops already fighting there are universally seen as overwhelmed. In many cases, the Americans will be pushing into areas where few or no troops have been before.
 Through extortion and taxation, the Taliban are believed to reap as much as $300 million a year from Afghanistan's opium trade, which now makes up 90 percent of the world's total. That is enough, the Americans say, to sustain all of the Taliban's military operations in southern Afghanistan for an entire year.
 ''Opium is their financial engine,'' said Brig. Gen. John Nicholson, the deputy commander of NATO forces in southern Afghanistan. ''That is why we think he will fight for these areas.'' 
 The Americans say that their main goal this summer will be to provide security for the Afghan population, and thereby isolate the insurgents. 
 But because the opium is tilled in heavily populated areas, and because the Taliban are spread among the people, the Americans say they will have to break the group's hold on poppy cultivation to be successful.
 No one here thinks that is going to be easy. 
 Only 10 minutes inside the tiny village of Zangabad, 20 miles southwest of Kandahar, a platoon of American soldiers stepped into a poppy field in full bloom on Monday. Taliban fighters opened fire from three sides.
 ''From the north!'' one of the soldiers yelled, spinning and firing.
 ''West!'' another screamed, turning and firing, too.
 An hour passed and a thousand bullets whipped through the air. Ammunition was running low. The Taliban were circling.
 Then the gunships arrived, swooping in, their bullet casings showering the ground beneath them, their rockets streaking and destroying. Behind a barrage of artillery, the soldiers shot their way out of Zangabad and moved into the cover of the vineyards.
 ''When are you going drop the bomb?'' Capt. Chris Brawley said into his radio over the clatter of machine-gun fire. ''I'm in a grape field.''
 The bomb came, and after a time the shooting stopped.
 The firefight offered a preview of the Americans' summer in southern Afghanistan. By all accounts, it is going to be bloody. 
 Like the guerrillas they are, Taliban fighters often fade away when confronted by a conventional army. But in Afghanistan, as they did in Zangabad, the Taliban will probably stand and fight. 
 Among the ways the Taliban are believed to make money from the opium trade is by charging farmers for protection; if the Americans and British attack, the Taliban will be expected to make good on their side of that bargain. 
 Indeed, Taliban fighters have begun to fight any efforts by the Americans or the British to move into areas where poppy grows and opium is produced. Last month, a force of British marines moved into a district called Nad Ali in Helmand Province, the center of the country's poppy cultivation. The Taliban were waiting. In a five-day battle, the British killed 120 Taliban fighters and wounded 150. Only one British soldier was wounded.
 Many of the new American soldiers will fan out along southern Afghanistan's largely unguarded 550-mile-long border with Pakistan. Among them will be soldiers deployed in the Stryker, a relatively quick, nimble armored vehicle that can roam across the vast areas that span the frontier.
 All of the new troops are supposed to be in place by Aug. 20, in order to provide security for Afghanistan's presidential election.
 The presence of poppy and opium here has injected a huge measure of uncertainly into the war. Under NATO rules of engagement, American or other forces are prohibited from attacking targets or people related only to narcotics production. Those people are not considered combatants.
 But American and other forces are allowed to attack drug smugglers or facilities that are assisting the Taliban. In an interview, General Nicholson said that opium production and the Taliban are so often intertwined that the rules do not usually inhibit American operations.
 ''We often come across a compound that has opium and I.E.D. materials side by side, and opium and explosive materials and weapons,'' General Nicholson said, referring to improvised explosive devices. ''It's very common -- more common than not.''
 But the prospect of heavy fighting in populated areas could further alienate the Afghan population. In the firefight in Zangabad, the Americans covered their exit with a barrage of 20 155 millimeter high-explosive artillery shells -- necessary to shield them from the Taliban, but also enough to inflict serious damage on people and property. A local Afghan interviewed by telephone after the firefight said that four homes had been damaged by the artillery strikes. 
 Then there is the problem of weaning poppy farmers from poppy farming -- a task that has proved intractable in many countries, like Colombia, where the American government has tried to curtail poppy production. It is by far the most lucrative crop an Afghan can farm. The opium trade now makes up nearly 60 percent of Afghanistan's gross domestic product, American officials say. The country's opium traffickers typically offer incentives that no Afghan government official can: they can guarantee a farmer a minimum price for the crop as well as taking it to market, despite the horrendous condition of most of Afghanistan's roads. 
 ''The people don't like to cultivate poppy, but they are desperate,'' Mohammed Ashraf Naseri, the governor of Zabul Province, told a group of visitors this month.
 To offer an alternative to poppy farming, the American military is setting aside $250 million for agriculture projects like irrigation improvements and wheat cultivation. General Nicholson said that a $200 million plan for infrastructure improvements, much of it for roads to help get crops to market, was also being prepared. The vision, General Nicholson said, is to try to restore the agricultural economy that flourished in Afghanistan in the 1970s. That, more than military force, will defeat the Taliban, he said.
 ''There is a significant portion of the enemy that we believe we can peel off with incentives,'' the general said. ''We can hire away many of these young men.''
 Even if the Americans are able to cut production, shortages could drive up prices and not make a significant dent in the Taliban's profits.
 The foray into Zangabad suggested the difficulties that lie ahead. The terrain is a guerrilla's dream. In addition to acres of shoulder-high poppy plants, rows and rows of hard-packed mud walls, used to stand up grape vines, offer ideal places for ambushes and defense.
 But the trickiest thing will be winning over the Afghans themselves. The Taliban are entrenched in the villages and river valleys of southern Afghanistan. The locals, caught between the foes, seem, at best, to be waiting to see who prevails.
 On their way to Zangabad, the soldiers stopped in a wheat field to talk to a local farmer. His name was Ahmetullah. The Americans spoke through a Pashto interpreter.
 ''I'm very happy to see you,'' the farmer told the Americans.
 ''Really?'' one of the soldiers asked.
 ''Yes,'' the farmer said.
 The interpreter sighed, and spoke in English.
 ''He's a liar.''

HEADLINE: An Industry That Sells Takes a Look in the Mirror

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
 THE advertising industry needs to do a better job of advertising itself, speakers and attendees at the 2009 American Association of Advertising Agencies leadership conference here said.
 That rebranding began close to home. On Tuesday, the association's president and chief executive, Nancy Hill, announced the group would now go by the name 4A's, since the ''American'' was too limited (advertisers do business internationally), as was ''Advertising Agencies'' (firms now offer public relations services as well).
 The name was not the only thing Ms. Hill wanted to change. With clients cutting budgets and the federal government considering stricter regulation of advertising, the industry needed an improved image, she said in a speech Tuesday. 
 ''Our business is still fighting for more respect in the public sphere,'' Ms. Hill said. ''The common perception of our business in the United States continues to be so negative for so many people.''
 She referred to a Harris Interactivesurvey released this month in which 66 percent of Americans attributed at least some of the economic crisis to advertising agencies for causing people to buy things they could not afford. 
 ''Who says advertising doesn't work?'' Ms. Hill said, which drew laughter.
 But worry over how agencies should prove their importance now that clients are cutting budgets was widespread at the association's 91st annual meeting, which was scheduled for Monday through Wednesday.
 ''When you're under siege as a corporation and you need to meet next quarter's earnings,'' Miles S. Nadal, the chairman and chief executive of MDC Partners, said in an interview, ''the reality is tomorrow morning you can turn off the tap'' of advertising money.
 Agencies would have to change in order to attract clients, Mr. Nadal said. Recent news that Coca-Cola is moving from paying its agencies flat fees, and instead will pay them for upfront costs and bonuses based on a project's performance, was one example of that, he said.
 ''The biggest fear that exists in the industry is it's never had to be accountable to the degree that clients want today,'' he said. 
 While clients in general want accountability, even they said how hard it was to measure the effectiveness of some new-media projects.
 Mich Mathews, the senior vice president of the central marketing group at Microsoft, said she measured advertising efforts by looking at things like downloads and where they went on the site. 
 But, Ms. Mathews said, some of the results she got back, like views of a YouTube video, were just plain confusing. ''I would confess, though, we look at it: 'Is that a good number or not a good number?' '' she said. The response from consumers, she said, could seem as vague as ''I think they feel nicer about me.''
 The lack of measurement in new media, she said, hinders innovation.
 ''The fundamental challenge is the measurement system,'' she said. ''People gravitate to the old world where there are tried and tested research methodologies.''
 Laura Desmond, the chief executive of Starcom MediaVest Group, also pushed agencies to change their ways in her speech.
 ''Now is the time to rethink, take some leaps into the future,'' Ms. Desmond said. ''Instead of saying no, we have to say yes, and fail forward.''
 As the 4A's looks to the future, next year it will combine the leadership conference with its annual meeting for media planners. The conference will be held in Austin, Tex.
 And despite worries about low attendance this year because of the economy, there were 302 registered attendees by Tuesday afternoon. That was down from about 370 attendees last year, but not as grim as the most recent low, 257 attendees in 2003.
 ''It would've been easy to not come, and it's good that you did come, because it's a much stronger showing than we thought we'd have a couple of months ago,'' Tom Carroll, the president and chief executive of TBWA Worldwide and chairman of the 4A's, said in his opening remarks Tuesday. 
 As for executives' complaints about the changing nature of their jobs, ''too bad,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''This is the business that we chose, and you can't whine about it.''

HEADLINE: High-Caffeine Farce, With a Dark Viennese Roast

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Sometimes New York seems like a small town, as the saying goes. But it seems to have shrunk to the size of a venti latte -- no, make that a tall latte -- in ''The Singing Forest,'' a play by Craig Lucas that opened on Tuesday night at the Public Theater. This ambitious but muddled comedy-drama asks us to believe that three generations of an angst-ridden family, some of whom have not spoken to each other in decades, happen to frequent the same Starbucks.
 Even though Grandma lives on Staten Island. And her grandson is a reclusive billionaire. 
 Perhaps Mr. Lucas intends to suggest that the force of neurosis provides a kind of magnetic attraction. But if that were true, half the population of Manhattan would be found in a toxic mass, trading complaints in Central Park. In any case, the Starbucks convergence is not the only rank implausibility in this sprawling play, running three acts and nearly three hours, about trauma and reconciliation and the transmission of neuroses in the family tree. 
 Olympia Dukakis plays the alienated matriarch, Loe Rieman, who has not spoken to either of her adult children in about 30 years. A former psychoanalyst and a former patient of Sigmund Freud himself, Loe now indulges her interest in probing the human psyche through a rather unusual form of bait-and-switch. 
 Using a voice-disguising mechanism, she provides phone sex to anonymous callers, but her bedside manner is more analytical than aphrodisiac. When she receives a call from Gray Korankyi (Jonathan Groff), an unemployed actor, she quickly segues from questions about his sexual tastes to probing suggestions about his unresolved issues relating to his mother's suicide. Hot! 
 Gray earns the money for these therapeutic calls by posing as a fabulously wealthy recluse, Jules Ahmad (Louis Cancelmi), Loe's grandson, who hires him to shop for a psychiatrist. He relates what he claims are Jules's dreams to Dr. Oliver Pfaff (Mark Blum) and Dr. Shar Unger (Rob Campbell), who are themselves connected through Dr. Unger's ex-boyfriend, the Starbucks barista Laszlo (Randy Harrison), who has now taken up with Dr. Pfaff -- unbeknownst to Dr. Unger. 
 Meanwhile, Jules's mother, Bertha Ahmad (Deborah Offner), chases around town trying to track down her son, who has not yet forgiven her for incinerating his father many years before. And Gray's girlfriend, Laszlo's Starbuck's colleague Beth Adler (Susan Pourfar), newly pregnant, becomes obsessed with the journals Gray has stolen from Jules's apartment -- journals written by Loe many years before during her psychoanalysis in Vienna in the years just before the Anschluss.
 Are you feeling overcaffeinated? 
 I'll leave the surprising genetic links among some of the characters to be discovered by audiences, since the mechanical contraption of the plot is really the chief engine of interest. Populating the stage with enough characters to supply dramatic fodder for a half-dozen plays, each amply stocked with emotional and psychological baggage, Mr. Lucas unsurprisingly fails to draw any of them in depth. In addition to the convoluted latter-day plot, incidentally, the play leaps back to the late 1930s in Vienna to provide the tortured history of Loe's emotional problems, which she duly passed on to her children. 
 Mr. Lucas, a wildly uneven playwright who inspires respect for the eclectic reach and emotional depth of his best work, has retooled the play somewhat since its debut four years ago at the Long Wharf Theater, in a production directed by Bartlett Sher. But the changes seem mostly cosmetic. 
 The director of this staging, Mark Wing-Davey, brought out the emotional riches in a similarly complex but far better play by Mr. Lucas, ''Small Tragedy,'' which considered some of the same themes about the chains of pain that link people together. Here he mostly has to settle for arranging traffic patterns smoothly, and he does not always succeed even at that. (And I wish he'd sped by the lingering scene in which Ms. Dukakis, as the younger Loe, is raped by a Nazi.) 
 Still, the cast members do what they can to humanize the characters, purportedly real people dropped into the machine of farce, scrabbling like hamsters in a maze. Ms. Dukakis's Loe is a dryly funny portrait of a troubled woman who ignores her own glaring psychic flaws by immersing herself in other people's. Mr. Groff's natural emotional transparency helps add layers to Gray, mostly described rather than depicted as a generic commitment-phobe. Mr. Blum, given some of the more outlandish business -- including the unlikely brandishing of a gun -- entertains with his winning comic desperation. 
 The play's contemporary plot climaxes in a farcical scene vaguely redolent of Joe Orton that finds all the characters beating down the door of Loe's Staten Island apartment, each in search of somebody else, each hoping to lay to rest any number of psychic ghosts or tease out the roots of their emotional problems. It's spectacular, sure, but was it Freud or someone else who wrote something about the limits of our ability to suspend disbelief? 
 ''There are no coincidences,'' one of the overanalyzed characters says, by way of explaining the absurdity. But in art coincidence must be used sparingly. When indulged recklessly, it can only be called contrivance.

HEADLINE: 100 DAYS: Early Resolve: Obama Stand In Auto Crisis

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG, PETER BAKER and BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- By the time he sat down in the Oval Office to brief Michigan's Congressional delegation, President Obama had made up his mind. Days earlier, he had decided to oust the head of General Motors and give it and Chrysler weeks to fix themselves. If they could not, he was prepared to let them go bankrupt, a prospect fraught with economic and political repercussions.
 Some lawmakers on the conference call that Sunday night last month thought he was bluffing. No president had ever let one of the Big Three car makers go bankrupt. Surely Mr. Obama would not be the first.
''You need to say that to get people to the table, and we totally understand that,'' Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, told Mr. Obama, according to two people privy to the conversation. 
 Mr. Obama corrected him. ''I don't want you to leave with that impression,'' the president said. ''I'm telling you that because it's a real possibility.''
 For a new president, the automobile industry crisis has tested the boundaries of his activist approach and the acuity of his political instincts. As with so many issues in his action-packed 100 days in office, Mr. Obama confronted choices few of his predecessors encountered. His ongoing intervention in an iconic sector of the economy offers a case study in the education, management and decision-making of a fledgling president. 
 Tutored by veterans of past administrations, Mr. Obama, often after dinner with his wife and daughters, devoured briefing papers until midnight to master the intricacies of the auto industry. But he had advisers deal directly with the car companies and never spoke with the G.M. chief executive he effectively fired.
 Methodical and dispassionate, Mr. Obama aggravated powerful players in Congress and the unions that helped elect him, then moved to assuage them. He encouraged internal debate but was forced to head off tensions as his treasury secretary and White House economic adviser maneuvered for position. In the end, he struggled with the proper balance between government power and market forces, a theme that has defined his first months in office.
 ''The issues were obvious -- balancing his interest in seeing the companies survive and prosper for the benefit of the workers and communities in which they operate and all the offshoot businesses, versus the interests of American taxpayers,'' said David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser. ''And overlaid on that is, when is it appropriate for the government to intervene?''
 But for all Mr. Obama's confidence -- even some friends refer to a certain cockiness -- this is a president just four years out of the Illinois legislature and very much learning on the job. His instincts for compromise, seen frequently in dealings with Congress, have left him facing questions about his willingness to face down powerful interests. 
 With G.M. and Chrysler restructuring as he demanded, the ultimate success of Mr. Obama's strategy may rest in part on how far he will go to take on constituencies like unions that have been vital to his political standing.
 He has set the country further down a road where the government owns a fair share of the banking and insurance sectors and now may become the majority owner of G.M. Critics warn he is overreaching. ''We're crossing a threshold here that's not one that's normal in this country,'' said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee.
 The process hurtled toward another critical juncture as Chrysler rushed to finalize a deal with creditors and unions and form an alliance with Fiat, the Italian carmaker, by the Thursday deadline set by Mr. Obama. Whatever doubts Mr. Levin once harbored, most of the players have concluded that the president was not bluffing.
 Opportunity in Crisis
 Mr. Obama was elected the same week the Big Three reported their worst monthly sales in a quarter-century, suddenly thrusting the future of the industry onto his agenda. When he met with prominent Democratic economic figures in an ornate hotel banquet room in Chicago days after the election, the car industry was the lead topic. Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan recalled that even there, the notion of bankruptcy crept into a conversation otherwise steeped in possibility.
 A reconstruction of the events since then, based on interviews with roughly two dozen participants, found that the discussions began with a heady optimism that the crisis could provide an opportunity to push the industry to produce cleaner ''cars of the future,'' an idea Mr. Obama had often invoked. 
 But the first decision Mr. Obama faced was whether to let automakers go bankrupt right away.
 At that point, he said no. An unstructured bankruptcy would send shockwaves through the economy and endanger tens of thousands of jobs. So Mr. Obama effectively began his presidency by prodding President George W. Bush and Congress, in public statements, private meetings and personal telephone calls, to provide a temporary bailout.
 A former community organizer with little business experience, Mr. Obama had developed a basic knowledge of the auto industry during the campaign, touring factories, stumping with Ron Gettelfinger, a powerful ally as president of the United Auto Workers, and meeting with William Clay Ford Jr., the executive chairman of Ford who later recalled discussing ''the electrification of our industry.''
 As Mr. Obama prepared to take office, he increasingly relied on his closest aides, primarily Lawrence H. Summers, his newly tapped economic adviser, and Timothy F. Geithner, who would become his treasury secretary. Few in his inner orbit had much experience in business, much less the auto industry. 
 Mr. Obama grew irritated at the auto executives, who in his view had a long history of bad decisions. ''What are these guys thinking?'' Mr. Axelrod remembered Mr. Obama asking when the chief executives of Chrysler, Ford and G.M. flew to Washington aboard corporate jets to request a bailout. On NBC's ''Meet the Press'' in December, Mr. Obama castigated automakers for ''repeated strategic mistakes'' and ''failure to adapt to changing times,'' adding that voters were ''fed up'' -- and so was he.
 But his tough language angered some Democratic allies, like Representative John D. Dingell and Senator Carl Levin, both of Michigan, who scolded him as talking down the industry. ''He comes from Illinois, which is auto-producing country, but apparently not his part of Illinois,'' Mr. Dingell said. ''Had he had an auto factory in his town, he'd have had a better understanding of what was going on.''
 'Not a Motel Chain'
 As Inauguration Day approached, G.M. and Chrysler were living on borrowed time -- thanks to $17.4 billion in federal loans approved by Mr. Bush -- and Mr. Obama was juggling multiple, conflicting pressures, and trying to figure out how to manage the process. 
 Washington was buzzing with talk of a ''car czar'' who would restructure the industry; the presumed front-runner was Steven Rattner, a savvy New York financier and prominent Democratic fund-raiser with no real auto-industry experience. 
 Michigan lawmakers and union leaders took the reports as a sign that Mr. Obama was taking a cold business-oriented approach. Carl Levin, Sandy Levin's brother, protested. ''I was very blunt with Larry Summers, very direct,'' he said. ''This is not a motel chain. This is an industry whose future is tied up with the future of this country.''
 Union leaders similarly complained about Mr. Rattner and the lack of labor voices around Mr. Obama. ''I've made that point a lot,'' said Leo W. Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers.
 At the same time, Mr. Obama faced internal politics. A car czar would presumably need a boss, but Mr. Obama had created an economic team without making clear whether Mr. Geithner or Mr. Summers was top dog. Putting one of them in charge of the auto situation would be a slight to the other.
 Mr. Obama, who prides himself on getting strong personalities to work together, decided not to ''outsource'' the job to a single car czar and instructed Mr. Summers and Mr. Geithner to sort it out. After what one official called ''a lot of back and forth'' with Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, Mr. Summers and Mr. Geithner agreed on a cabinet-level task force reporting to them both. In a nod to labor, Mr. Rattner's partner in leading the task force would be Ron Bloom, a longtime adviser to Mr. Gerard's union. Mr. Obama approved. 
 ''He said he wanted to make sure that we had good people -- that we had very good people -- working on it, and a range or perspectives,'' Mr. Summers said in an interview.
 What few knew was that Mr. Rattner's solicitation of business from the New York State pension fund was under investigation. Mr. Rattner informed Mr. Obama's vetting team, which concluded that he was not facing charges, but no one told key players like Mr. Summers, who learned from the news media.
 The task force was announced the same day G.M. and Chrysler submitted restructuring plans. By 10 the next morning, Obama aides were sorting through the companies' financial straits in a Treasury Department conference room quickly filled with strewn paper, takeout food containers and empty Diet Coke cans. Mr. Obama did not speak with them as they worked, relying instead on updates from Mr. Summers and Mr. Geithner and memos stuffed into the briefing binder he took home each night.
 Mr. Rattner and Mr. Bloom flew to Detroit to meet with G.M. and Chrysler executives and Mr. Gettelfinger, who was keeping a low public profile. 
 The task force quickly concluded the car companies were in worse shape than suspected, especially Chrysler. But unlike the banks, which had received hundreds of billions of dollars of federal money, the car industry lacked one form of protection: In the minds of officials, including the president, they were not too big to fail.
 'You Do It, You Own It'
 At 10:15 a.m. on Thursday, March 26, Mr. Obama sank into his chair in the Oval Office and listened to his advisers discuss the fates of G.M. and Chrysler. As Mr. Summers ran through figures, Mr. Obama coolly cut him off, saying: ''I know that. I read that memo.'' Mr. Obama had stayed up the previous evening reading a task force ''decision memo'' laying out options.
 Mr. Obama had often said that he would focus on the hardest decisions, leaving easier calls to deputies. The decision that generated the biggest headlines fell in that easier category: He readily accepted a recommendation to push out G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, and order the new leadership to produce more aggressive plans to save their company, according to Mr. Geithner, Mr. Summers and other aides. 
 A half-hour into the meeting, an aide entered the Oval Office and slipped Mr. Obama a note informing him another meeting was to begin. The president told advisers he needed more time to decide Chrysler's fate. He then headed off for a day consumed by a new strategy for Afghanistan, a threatened rocket launch by North Korea and the evacuation of a flooded Fargo, N.D. (''What is this, a 'West Wing' episode?'' Mr. Axelrod recalled asking Mr. Emanuel.)
 At 6 p.m., the president reconvened his auto advisers in the Roosevelt Room. By then, Mr. Obama had reached what Mr. Geithner called ''a fork in the road judgment'' on Chrysler that would not be popular with his union backers or his Michigan allies. ''We were not prepared to spend what they needed to stand alone, because they were not viable,'' Mr. Geithner said.
 The question became whether to let Chrysler slip into bankruptcy or to give it another month to finalize a life-saving alliance with Fiat, participants said. Some argued to let Chrysler go. Others argued a bankruptcy would ripple beyond the company to its extensive network of suppliers and dealers.
 No longer was the discussion focused on using the crisis to build a clean-energy auto industry. Instead, the issue was more fundamental: Was survival even an option? Advisers agonized over whether to make clear bankruptcy was possible even if the companies were given more time. Just uttering ''the B-word,'' as some called it, could scare the country. 
 Sitting at a long conference table, scratching notes on briefing papers, Mr. Obama peppered advisers with questions and solicited opposing opinions, according to people in the room: How many jobs would a bankruptcy cost? How much exposure would taxpayers have? Would keeping Chrysler afloat just add to the inventory of unsold cars? 
 ''He wants to know all the bad things, all the risks, and all the dark things,'' Mr. Geithner said. 
 As is his habit, Mr. Obama called on people who had not spoken and pressed those who sounded tentative. ''When he feels he's getting thoughtful answers, he tends to move on,'' Mr. Summers said. ''When he feels like he's not getting thoughtful answers, he becomes more concerned.''
 After 75 minutes, Mr. Obama determined he would give the companies one last chance while making clear bankruptcy awaited should they fail. Either way, Mr. Wagoner was out.
 With his chief political aide, Mr. Axelrod, and chief spokesman, Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama sorted through the political implications. Mr. Obama and his team had long believed that the public was hungry for greater regulation. Mr. Obama's popularity also gave him room to maneuver. 
 Yet Americans have traditionally shown uneasiness with government involvement in the private sector. Mr. Axelrod said that if anything, the plan had more political risk than reward. 
 With supreme faith in his ability to explain anything to the country, Mr. Obama shrugged off concerns and said he would openly signal that bankruptcy was a possibility, advisers recalled.
 The next morning, Mr. Rattner pulled Mr. Wagoner aside before a meeting at the Treasury Department and told him to resign immediately. With no contact from Mr. Obama, as far as advisers know, Mr. Wagoner ended his 31-year career at G.M., although the news was not announced for days.
 When Mr. Obama got on the phone with the Michigan delegation two nights later to inform them, he did not invite debate. ''We weren't asked about it,'' Carl Levin recalled. ''We were notified.''
 At the suggestion of Senator Debbie Stabenow, another Michigan Democrat, Mr. Obama revised his speech the next day to praise advances at Buick and Chevrolet. But he did not flinch from what he was doing. Thirty years earlier, Jimmy Carter left no fingerprints when he pushed out the head of Chrysler. Mr. Obama had no problem with anyone knowing he had toppled a giant.
 ''His feeling,'' Mr. Axelrod said, ''was, you do it, you own it.''
 Playing Poker, No Bluffs
 For good or ill, Mr. Obama has done a lot in his first 100 days, and now owns a lot. The auto crisis forced him to look at options once unthinkable, and, like many challenges, remains unresolved.
 In terms of leadership style, Mr. Obama at times has seemed like a cross between his two most recent predecessors -- intellectually curious, philosophically flexible and eager for input like Bill Clinton, while disciplined, willing to delegate and comfortable with bold decisions like George W. Bush.
 Unlike Mr. Bush, who preferred that his memos be kept to two pages, Mr. Obama has not trusted instinct during the auto-industry crisis so much as conduct a law school-style review of his options. Unlike Mr. Clinton, who was famous for making phone calls late at night without his aides knowing, Mr. Obama generally did not reach out independently to auto executives, union leaders or Congressional allies. 
 Yet in his first three months, he has struggled to avoid the isolation that has beset so many predecessors. Upon taking office, Mr. Obama set up a group of outside economic advisers to provide him an array of opinions. ''He doesn't want to get insulated,'' said one member, Richard L. Trumka, the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 But as the auto-industry talks accelerated, Mr. Obama relied mainly on his core advisers. Mr. Geithner was the only cabinet secretary in the room when the president made his decision. The outside economic panel has not formally met with Mr. Obama since its February inception, though its chairman has.
 Mr. Obama is learning fast that he cannot be all things to all constituencies, and the labor leaders who did so much for him during the campaign sometimes chafe at his approach. The U.A.W. last week called on members to send e-mail messages to the White House demanding that it ''stand up for the interests of workers and retirees in these restructuring negotiations.'' 
 As with his predecessors, strength at times can be weakness. Mr. Obama's confidence has been a powerful asset at a time of national anxiety, even as close advisers acknowledge that it risks blinding him to the drawbacks of some decisions. In the end, Mr. Obama is gambling that his judgment is the right one to salvage an industry at the heart of America's economic self-image.
 ''At this point, the administration is just playing poker,'' Mr. Dingell said. ''If he gets the damn loans and saves the industry, I guess I won't be able to complain.''
 And if Mr. Obama does not, the next 100 days promise to be even more challenging than the first.

HEADLINE: Asking for More Funding, U.S. Steps Up Flu Response

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS and DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.; Reporting was contributed by Anahad O'Connor and Anne Barnard from New York; Nicholas Confessore from Albany; David Stout from Washington; Marc Lacey from La Gloria, Mexico; Alan Cowell from London; Ian Austen from Ottawa; and Keith Bradsher and Mark McDonald from Hong Kong.

 BODY:
State and federal officials intensified their response to the swine flu outbreak on Tuesday, with President Obama asking Congress for $1.5 billion in supplemental funding.
 The global response included more restrictions on travel to and from Mexico, identified as the likely origin of the outbreak and the only country to have reported deaths from swine flu. Officials there shut down schools across the country and limited restaurant service in Mexico City in an effort to curb transmission of the virus, which is suspected in the deaths of 159 people. 
 Israel confirmed its first two cases of swine flu, which is now in at least seven countries. Ten others, including China and Russia, which were set to quarantine passengers suspected of having the flu, are investigating possible cases. 
 Dr. Richard E. Besser, the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, termed the early days of swine flu in the United States as a ''prepandemic period'' and was blunt about the potential impact of this influenza. ''As this moves forward,'' he said, ''I fully expect that we will see deaths from this infection.'' 
 He said that five people confirmed to have swine flu had been hospitalized in the United States -- two in Texas and three in California, where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency. But the nation's highest number of cases continued to be in New York City, where 45 people were confirmed to have swine flu.
 In Washington, Congressional hearings addressed the seriousness of the outbreak. 
 ''I really think we need to be prepared for the worsening of the situation,'' Rear Adm. Anne Schuchat, the C.D.C.'s interim science and public health deputy director, told a Senate Appropriations health subcommittee. ''It's more of a marathon than a sprint,'' she said, echoing what Dr. Besser had said on Sunday, when the country first declared swine flu a public health emergency.
 Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who heads the subcommittee, noted that ''there's a lot of anxiety right now across the country.''
 Still, that anxiety is not on the same scale as in Mexico, where the number of people believed to have been sickened was about 2,500 on Tuesday.
 The economic response to the health crisis rippled from Mexico throughout the globe. Cuba canceled all flights to and from Mexico and Argentina banned all flights from Mexico. Carnival Cruise Lines said it had canceled Mexico stops for three of its cruise ships because of the swine flu alert, according to Reuters. So far, nine countries have some kind of ban on pork imports: China, Croatia, Indonesia, Lebanon, Russia, South Korea, Thailand, Ukraine and Ecuador. 
 Mexico City, meanwhile, was looking increasingly like a ghost town. On Tuesday morning, the city government ordered all restaurants, except those that serve take-out food, closed until May 6 to large gatherings of people. About 30,000 restaurants are affected. Movie theaters, bars and discos have also been shut.
 But the city has yet to make the decision to shut down public transportation, a move that would freeze most economic activity in the capital. Schools all over the country were closed Tuesday, affecting some 33 million students, and many tourist sites were put off limits. 
 Citigroup's Mexican subsidiary, Banamex, ran a newspaper ad asking customers to wear their masks and wash their hands. At bank branches, where employees have been told to wash their hands every hour, antiseptic gel dispensers were being installed. Banamex also asked customers to do as much banking by phone and Internet as possible.

 BODY:
Crises, not days, is the first word that comes to mind when we think about the number 100 and Barack Obama's presidency. 
 The list of failed policies and urgent threats bequeathed to him by former President George W. Bush could easily be that long. In his first 14 weeks plus two days, President Obama has made a strong start at addressing many of the most critical ones. 
 He is trying to rebuild this country's shattered reputation with his pledge to shut down the prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, his offer to talk with Iran and Syria, and, yes, that handshake with Venezuela's blow-hard president, Hugo Chavez. 
 Mr. Obama has not allowed a once-in-four-generations recession -- or politically driven charges that he is over-reaching -- to rob him of his ambition. He is right that there can be no lasting recovery until the country reforms its health care system and tackles the clear and present danger of global climate change. 
 The government is promoting women's reproductive rights. It is restoring regulations to keep water clean and food safe. The White House has promised to tackle immigration reform this year. 
 Mr. Obama and the country still have a long way to go. The Taliban's power grabs in Afghanistan and Pakistan are a reminder of why the White House must chart a swift exit from Iraq so it can focus on the real front in the war on terror. Recent horrifying bombings are a reminder of how far Iraq is from political conciliation and how much remains to be done to ensure an orderly exit.
 We are skeptical that the bank rescue plan is aggressive enough to salvage those that are at the edge of insolvency or protect the taxpayers' investment. 
 We know that President Obama, and many voters, don't want the fight, but until there is a full investigation of detainee abuse, ''extraordinary rendition'' and the other outlaw policies authorized during the Bush years, there is no way to ensure they will never be repeated. 
 These are very tough times, but Mr. Obama seems to have lifted the spirits of a divided and fearful nation. In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, 72 percent of Americans said they were optimistic about the next four years. They also recognized that some problems may be too difficult to solve even in four years. 
 Here is a look, by no means comprehensive, at the president's early efforts:
 THE WORLD Mr. Obama has promised to quickly bring home American troops from one of the longest and most divisive wars in American history. He must now persuade Iraq's Shiite-dominated government to reconcile with the Sunnis and to defuse tensions with the Kurds. Iraq still has not agreed on a law to equitably share its oil resources. Thousands of members of the Sunni Awakening Councils, the former insurgents whose decision to switch sides helped change the course of the war, are still waiting for promised government jobs. 
 Mr. Obama pressed his advisers to come up with a comprehensive plan for the dangerously inter-related conflicts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Now they must implement it -- and quickly. Last week, the Taliban advanced within 60 miles of Islamabad. Pakistan's leaders still do not seem to grasp the mortal threat. 
 The president has begun new negotiations with Russia to reduce nuclear arsenals. The Pentagon has started to make the tough choices to shift spending to weapons needed by troops fighting today's wars. Mr. Obama's commitment to Israeli-Palestinian peace is already being tested by Israel's new prime minister, who says he doesn't believe in a two-state solution. 
 Americans can feel both pride and relief at the enthusiastic welcome Mr. Obama has received in his early travels abroad. The president will soon have to find ways to leverage that popularity. He must persuade European allies to contribute more troops and resources to Afghanistan. If negotiations with Iran fail, he will have to convince Europe, Russia and China to impose tough sanctions to try to constrain Iran's nuclear ambitions. 
 THE ECONOMYAfter eight dismal years, the president's stimulus bill, his budget and even the flawed bank rescue strategy offer a welcome return to the rational proposition that some problems are so big that the government must step in. Our main concern is that he has been too reluctant to challenge traditional interests on Wall Street or Capitol Hill. 
 His attempt at bipartisan consensus-building crashed against Republicans' obstruction of the stimulus package and weakened the final legislation. The $787 billion stimulus is small when compared with the size of the contraction; the 3.5 million new jobs projected pale against the 5 million lost since the end of 2007. 
 The administration has been similarly timid on the banking crisis. The White House is so far refusing to consider a temporary takeover of foundering banks -- the best way to ensure that they are efficiently restructured and the taxpayers' money is protected. Instead, the administration has offered hundreds of billions in subsidized loans to hedge funds and other private investors to entice them to offer inflated prices for bad assets. 
 We are concerned that Mr. Obama's anti-foreclosure plan -- which relies on lenders to voluntarily modify troubled loans -- will falter unless Congress quickly reforms the bankruptcy code. All of this fosters the belief that the White House and Congress will not stand up to the banks. It is also likely to slow the recovery.
 CIVIL LIBERTIES Less than 12 hours after taking office, Mr. Obama halted the military tribunals at Guantanamo. Then he ordered the detention camp closed within a year. He has issued orders to prohibit torture and shut secret prisons overseas and to create a detainee policy based on the law and Constitution rather than Mr. Bush's grandiose visions of executive power.
 Earlier this month, Mr. Obama overruled his C.I.A. director and ordered the release of four horrifying memos on prisoner interrogation written by the Bush Justice Department. He has ruled out punishing C.I.A. interrogators who participated in the detainees' abuse and reluctantly decided to leave it to the Justice Department to make the call about other prosecutions.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Obama has not dropped overly broad state secrets claims used by the Bush team to try to block lawsuits on rendition, torture and illegal wiretapping. He needs to rethink that position as well as his opposition to a full public inquiry to determine why, how and by whom so many orders were given to violate the law and the most cherished Constitutional rights.
 ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT Mr. Obama and his new team have been as aggressive on these issues as Mr. Bush was passive or obstructionist. The Environmental Protection Agency quickly issued a formal determination that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and welfare -- the necessary prelude to regulating those pollutants. The Interior Department has rejected Mr. Bush's industry-driven drill-anywhere policies in favor of a more balanced approach to energy production.
 The stimulus package includes money to encourage energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, higher-mileage cars and coal that is truly clean. Mr. Obama has also endorsed, in general terms, legislation that would put strict caps on greenhouse gas emissions and invest in technologies to make it easier to achieve those caps. 
 HEALTH CARE Far too many Americans still have no health insurance; those who do pay too much and the quality of care is too low. Mr. Obama's bold 10-year budget plan proposed a substantial $634 billion down payment to widen coverage and improve the delivery of care. He offered sensible proposals to pay for these reforms -- including higher taxes on the rich and eliminating unjustified subsides for private Medicare plans -- that met with immediate Congressional resistance. 
 This is going to be a tough fight. Mr. Obama must keep reminding Americans that reforms are essential for their personal health and the nation's economic health.
 EDUCATIONMr. Obama has demonstrated a welcome breadth of knowledge on education but will need to use bare-knuckled clout to get needed changes. That is especially true of his student loan plan, which would end wasteful subsidies to private lenders and permit college students to borrow directly from the government. The president's plan for using stimulus money to force reforms that the states were supposed to carry out under the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 will also require energy, vigilance and an end to loopholes in education regulations.
 During the campaign, then-Senator Obama declared that ''government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves.'' In his first 100 days, President Obama has started to show Americans just what he meant.

HEADLINE: Run Away to the Circus? No Need. It's Staying Here.

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Not content with performing in 271 cities in 32 countries and attracting 11 million customers last year, Cirque du Soleil, the Montreal-based circus empire, will establish a permanent presence in New York City next year. 
 In February 2010 Cirque, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary, plans to bring a new show to the Beacon Theater in Manhattan for a multiple-month run that it hopes will become an annual institution. And in 2011 Cirque is to establish a four-month summer extravaganza in Radio City Music Hall as a warm-weather counterweight to the ''Christmas Spectacular'' -- sans Rockettes, but populated with acrobats and clowns. 
 These will be in addition to the company's touring tent productions, which have played New York periodically since 1988; the most recent show, ''Kooza,'' opened on April 16 at Randalls Island. Also continuing will be ''Wintuk,'' Cirque's $20 million annual winter holiday show at the WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden. 
 But dashed for now are the company's plans to build a New York City space that would give it a permanent home in Manhattan. ''Dead,'' said Guy Laliberte, Cirque's founder and majority owner, when asked about its real estate negotiations, most recently a 2007 deal with the Related Companies to establish an outpost at Pier 40 in Manhattan. ''So instead, you come in by the back door,'' he added, ''or even a window.''
 That window is Madison Square Garden Entertainment -- which programs both the Beacon and the Music Hall -- and which provided Cirque's theater for ''Wintuk'' two years ago. 
 ''We want something solid and permanent in the entertainment capital of the world, and we are hoping to have a presence in New York for 12 months a year,'' Mr. Laliberte said.
 Some might worry that New York is facing a circus glut. In addition to the annual Madison Square Garden stand of Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey's traveling arena show, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently announced that Ringling's smaller, touring Gold Unit will be performing under a Coney Island tent starting on June 18, and Ringling hopes that it will become a yearly fixture.
 Then there's New York's own nonprofit one-ring little top, the Big Apple Circus, which since 1980 has dominated the Christmas circus season.
 ''Certainly Cirque will compete with us for disposable dollars and audience attention,'' said Gary B. Dunning, Big Apple's executive director. ''But we have been succeeding in the most competitive market in the world for 31 years.'' 
 Indeed, in 2007, the first year it went up against ''Wintuk,'' Big Apple achieved record high revenues of $7.5 million. During last year's recession Christmas, Big Apple was down 2.3 percent in sales. Cirque did not release figures, but box office experts who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss confidential information said ''Wintuk'' sales were down some 20 percent. Nevertheless, ''Wintuk'' has sold 750,000 tickets since 2007, according to Cirque. 
 ''We and Big Apple have different niches and audiences.'' Mr. Laliberte said on a recent afternoon, during which he chain-smoked Gauloises.
 He described the Beacon production, possibly titled ''Vaudeville,'' as a show about that tradition, with a cast of 50 to 55, to be directed by David Shiner, also the director of ''Kooza.'' The show, written by Laurence O'Keefe, the author of music and lyrics for ''Legally Blonde,'' is to be in tryouts from Nov. 19 through Dec. 31 at the Chicago Theater in that city. The show will run at the Beacon for at least three months and could be extended to half a year. 
 During those months ''we will continue to work with all artists, including the Allman Brothers Band, to find the best alternative performance options while the vaudeville Cirque show is at the Beacon,'' said Jay Marciano, president of Madison Square Garden Entertainment.
 Another $20 million still unnamed show, for the Music Hall, ''will fully utilize the space and spend half of each year in Paris or London,'' and have 72 to 80 performers, said Mr. Laliberte, a wiry 49-year-old former street accordionist, stilt walker and fire-breather who rarely talks to the press. 
 Mr. Marciano said that ''it's only natural that we partner with them, given 'Wintuk,' '' adding that the Music Hall ''is the only stage in the city that can handle such a large-scale production.'' Cirque has long been circumspect about its profits, but Mr. Laliberte acknowledged that it has felt the effects of the recession. In Las Vegas, it has been ramping up its discount offers at its six shows. As a result, Mr. Laliberte said, in that city ''our lowest occupancy is 82 percent.'' 
 So, though Mr. Laliberte said that the Cirque touring shows were up about 7 percent in revenues this year, Cirque's six shows in Las Vegas are down 7 percent. 
 Meanwhile, the company's casino show in Macau, Asia's gambling capital, has suffered after the Chinese government curtailed visits from the mainland because of concern about gambling losses. And an agreement to develop a permanent Cirque show on Palm Jumeirah, a manmade island in Dubai, is now in recession postponement. 
 Despite the down economy, Mr. Laliberte is aggressively making ''optimistic plans,'' of which New York's shows are a part, he said, adding that ''we've gone through three recessions in Cirque history, and they were all growth periods for us.''
 Cirque has the wherewithal to expand. Last August the company sold a 20 percent stake to a Dubai sovereign wealth fund and a real estate developer for $600 million, Mr. Laliberte said. The sale lined his pockets as well: according to Forbes, Mr. Laliberte's personal wealth is $2.5 billion.
 The privately held Cirque does not disclose profits, but analysts who asked not to be named because they did not want to jeopardize their relationship with the company estimated a margin of more than 20 percent, better than the 18 percent return that casinos customarily aspired to before the recession. Mr. Laliberte said Cirque was forecasting $810 million in total revenue this year. 
 ''But we are not tsunami-proof,'' he said. Referring to the casinos, he added, ''It is a scary crisis in Vegas -- our partners have so much debt.'' Cirque has been fighting against the undertow in which hotels have posted historically low occupancy despite historically low room rates. 
 Some circus people, most of whom would not speak for the record because they did not want to alienate Cirque, have suggested that with two more New York shows on the way and an Elvis tribute show headed for Las Vegas, Cirque is overextended, and have wondered whether the once-scruffy, former avant-garde commune -- which has transformed itself into a blue-chip multinational Disney would-be that has sold $7 billion worth of tickets -- is losing touch with its creative soul. 
 ''There has been some dilution of the quality of their product,'' said David Rosenwasser, a veteran arena manager and former circus executive who is director of the Greater St. Charles Convention and Visitors Bureau in Missouri. ''I'm not as awed as I used to be. The shows are almost indistinguishable to me.'' 
 But Mr. Laliberte countered that ''we constantly readdress the issue of our shows being too corporate,'' adding: ''Every show must be one of a kind. And we must have fun.''

HEADLINE: 'No Child' Law Is Not Closing A Racial Gap

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
The achievement gap between white and minority students has not narrowed in recent years, despite the focus of the No Child Left Behind law on improving the scores of blacks and Hispanics, according to results of a federal test considered to be the nation's best measure of long-term trends in math and reading proficiency.
 Between 2004 and last year, scores for young minority students increased, but so did those of white students, leaving the achievement gap stubbornly wide, despite President George W. Bush's frequent assertions that the No Child law was having a dramatic effect. 
 Although Black and Hispanic elementary, middle and high school students all scored much higher on the federal test than they did three decades ago, most of those gains were not made in recent years, but during the desegregation efforts of the 1970s and 1980s. That was well before the 2001 passage of the No Child law, the official description of which is ''An Act to Close the Achievement Gap.'' 
 ''There's not much indication that N.C.L.B. is causing the kind of change we were all hoping for,'' said G. Gage Kingsbury, a testing expert who is a director at the Northwest Evaluation Association in Portland. ''Trends after the law took effect mimic trends we were seeing before. But in terms of watershed change, that doesn't seem to be happening.''
 The results no doubt will stoke debate about how to rewrite the No Child law when the Obama administration brings it up for reauthorization later this year. Education Secretary Arne Duncanhas said he would like to strengthen national academic standards, tighten requirements that high-quality teachers be distributed equally across schools in affluent and poor neighborhoods, and make other adjustments. ''We still have a lot more work to do,'' Mr. Duncan said of the latest scores. But the long-term assessment results could invigorate those who challenge the law's accountability model itself. 
 Despite gains that both whites and minorities did make, the overall scores of the United States' 17-year-old students, averaged across all groups, were the same as those of teenagers who took the test in the early 1970s. This was largely due to a shift in demographics; there are now far more lower-scoring minorities in relation to whites. In 1971, the proportion of white 17-year-olds who took the reading test was 87 percent, while minorities were 12 percent. Last year, whites had declined to 59 percent while minorities had increased to 40 percent.
 The scores of 9- and 13-year-old students, however, were up modestly in reading, and were considerably higher in math, since 2004, the last time the test was administered. And they were quite a bit higher than those of students of the same age a generation back. Still, the progress of younger students tapered off as they got older.
 Some experts said the results proved that the No Child law had failed to make serious headway in lifting academic achievement. ''We're lifting the basic skills of young kids,'' said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California, Berkeley, ''but this policy is not lifting 21st-century skills for the new economy.'' 
 But Margaret Spellings, Mr. Duncan's predecessor under President Bush, called the results a vindication of the No Child law.
 ''It's not an accident that we're seeing the most improvement where N.C.L.B. has focused most vigorously,'' Ms. Spellings said. ''The law focuses on math and reading in grades three through eight -- it's not about high schools. So these results are affirming of our accountability-type approach.'' 
 Whether anyone knows how to extend the results achieved with younger students through the turbulent high school years remains an open question. 
 The math and reading test, known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Long-Term Trends, was given to a nationally representative sample of 26,000 students last year. It was the 12th time since 1971 that the Department of Education administered a comparable test to students ages 9, 13 and 17. The scores, released on Tuesday in Washington, allow for comparisons of student achievement every few years back to the Vietnam and Watergate years. 
 The results point to the long-term crisis in many of the nation's high schools, and could lead to proposals for more federal attention to them in the rewrite of the No Child law, which requires states to administer annual tests in grades three to eight, but only once in high school.
 The 2008 score gap between black and white 17-year-olds, 29 points in reading and 26 points in math, could be envisioned as the rough equivalent of between two and three school years' worth of learning, said Peggy Carr, an associate commissioner for assessment at the Department of Education.
 Freeman A. Hrabowski III, the president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who has written about raising successful black children, said the persistence of the achievement gap should lead policymakers to seek new ways to increase low-performing students' learning time. 
 ''Where we see the gap narrowing, that's because there's been an emphasis on supplemental education, on after-school programs that encourage students to read more and do more math problems,'' Dr. Hrabowski said. ''Where there are programs that encourage that additional work, students of color do the work and their performance improves and the gap narrows.''
 But he said that educators and parents pushing children to higher achievement often find themselves swimming against a tide of popular culture.
 ''Even middle-class students are unfortunately influenced by the culture that says it's simply not cool for students to be smart,'' he said. ''And that is a factor here in these math and reading scores.''
 Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools, which represents more than 60 metropolitan school systems, said that much of the progress among the nation's minority students has been the result of hard work by urban educators, not only since the No Child law took effect but for decades before.
 ''N.C.L.B. did not invent the concept of the achievement gap -- much of the desegregation work in the '70s and '80s was in fact about giving poor, Hispanic and African-American kids access to better resources and curriculum,'' Mr. Casserly said. ''You do see from these results that in that period, the gains were steeper. It wasn't being called an achievement gap, but that was what that was about.''

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: MEASURING STUDENTS' PROGRESS: Reading and math scores for 17-year-old students have remained similar to levels of the 1970s, while younger students have made more progress, especially on math tests. The achievement gap between black and white students, meanwhile, narrowed most dramatically during desegregation efforts of the 1970s and 1980s. Though improvements have been made in recent years, they are less significant than promised with President Bush's No Child Left Behind law, an effort to hold schools accountable for minority students' test scores.

HEADLINE: Haircuts And Their Discontents

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The big debate about President Obama's financial rescue plan has centered on whether he's been right to avoid nationalizing the country's biggest banks. But there is another, more pressing question about the plan that has received considerably less attention. 
 After the Federal Reserve's stress tests identify the country's sickest banks next week, who will bear responsibility for shoring up their balance sheets?
 Will it be solely the government? Or will the government force institutions that lent money to sick banks in better times -- their creditors -- to take a hit by forgiving some of the loans?
 Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and other officials are reluctant to force losses, often called haircuts, on banks. They worry that haircuts could create a cascade, in which some of the creditors that take losses become insolvent, while creditors of healthier banks begin wondering whether they will be subject to future haircuts. In the ensuing panic, financial markets could freeze up, as they did last fall. 
 But relying on the government alone to shore up the banks brings risks, too. In the long term, it could leave taxpayers with an enormous bill. In the short term, it could destroy the already thin political support for the rescue plan.
 Recently -- and, I'd argue, fortunately -- the Obama administration seems to have become more open to the idea of encouraging loan forgiveness in certain situations. Beyond those situations, officials hope that no others are needed. 
 Yet that may turn out to be wishful thinking. The Treasury Department has only about $130 billion remaining in its Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, fund. By comparison, American banks are probably facing an additional $1 trillion in losses over the next two years, the International Monetary Fundprojects. 
 The gap between those numbers means that the debate over haircuts could be with us for a while.
 The case against haircuts starts with Lehman Brothers. When Lehman collapsed into bankruptcy on the night of Sept. 14, its creditors were left with billions of dollars in loans to Lehman they would never recover. Needing to conserve capital and fearful that other firms might collapse soon, they largely stopped lending. 
 ''That's when this crisis took a quantum leap up in terms of seriousness,'' as Janet Yellen, the president of the San Francisco Fed, recently said. 
 So imagine that on Monday, when releasing the results of its stress tests, the Fed says that several banks need more money to survive a deep recession. Assuming private investors are not willing to put it up, the government will then have two options. 
 It can increase the banks' assets, by giving them more taxpayer money in exchange for an even greater ownership stake. Or the government can reduce the banks' debts, by using its influence to encourage, or even demand, loan forgiveness. 
 Debt reduction, in exchange for an equity stake, is a standard strategy for dealing with failing companies. It's what the Obama administration is trying to do with Chrysler's and G.M.'s creditors. Under the tentative deal worked out on Tuesday, Chrysler's creditors would receive about 28 cents in stock for every dollar of loans they forgave. 
 But banks aren't like other companies. Like it or not, they are the heart of the credit system and thus the economy. No matter what happens to Chrysler's creditors, Honda won't stop making cars, and people won't stop buying them. Imposing losses on Bank of America's creditors, though, has the potential to freeze the financial markets.
 One sign that such concerns are legitimate is the fact that they're shared by some economists who saw the financial crisis coming well before Fed officials or Mr. Obama's current advisers. At a Fed conference in 2005, Raghuram Rajan -- then the director of research at the I.M.F. and now a University of Chicago professor -- criticized Alan Greenspan for turning a blind eye to risk (and was in turn criticized by Lawrence H. Summers, now Mr. Obama's lead economic adviser). Today, Mr. Rajan says that haircuts really do have the potential to make some financial firms insolvent and cause worldwide problems.
 Yet he also says that the government should study whether it can sensibly impose any losses on creditors, rather than unquestioningly accepting Wall Street's self-interested view that haircuts would be bad for the economy. ''We constantly have to question the arguments the Street puts forward,'' he said, ''and ask whether they are really these holy cows who can't be touched.''
 Ever so gradually, the administration may be moving toward this more skeptical position.
 In February, the Treasury began twisting the arms of some holders of Citigroup preferred stock to get them to convert it into common stock. (Preferred stock, despite its name, is something between a loan and stock.) The credit markets hiccupped, but quickly returned to their previous state. In the wake of the stress tests, the Fed and the administration may well push for more conversions along these lines. 
 The trickier issue is what to do with holders of so-called subordinate debt. In the spectrum of investments, subordinate debt is considered safer than preferred stock and tends to be subject to haircuts only when a company slides toward bankruptcy. Pushing a bank to the brink of bankruptcy would raise the specter of Lehman Brothers.
 Now, some debtholders may be fearful enough of bankruptcy that they would willingly accept haircuts, figuring they are better than the alternative. On ''Meet the Press'' on April 19, Mr. Summers said one option for increasing the banks' capital was ''asset liability swaps,'' by which he meant a voluntary exchange of loan forgiveness for equity. 
 The government's main role would be to force existing equity holders to offer the swaps to creditors. Equity holders often oppose such swaps because their own stake is diluted. But government regulators could insist that the offer be made and then allow debtholders to accept or reject it. If the offer were, say, 60 cents on the dollar and the market price of the debt only 50 cents, the creditors might accept.
 If steps like these, along with TARP, are enough to repair the financial system, haircuts won't be needed. If not, the only remaining options will be more taxpayer money, more haircuts or both.
 We already know what the bankers will say about haircuts, regardless of how carefully they're devised: that they'll end up hurting the rest of us. Remember, though, they said the same thing about stronger financial regulation, and they turned out to be spectacularly wrong. Stronger regulation would indeed have hurt many bankers. It would have benefited the rest of us.
 This month, I interviewed Mr. Obama for a Q. and A. to be published Sunday in The New York Times Magazine, and I asked him why his economic inner circle was dominated by proteges of Robert Rubin. These proteges, like Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers, are deeply thoughtful people, just as Mr. Rubin is. But in retrospect, they all gave too much deference to Wall Street.
 Mr. Obama replied that his economic team also included people from outside the Rubin circle, which is certainly true. Still, Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers remain the dominant forces in the team. 
 When they -- and the president -- consider Wall Street's warnings about haircuts, I hope they also consider its track record. Lately, taxpayers haven't done very well when they've listened to Wall Street's advice.

HEADLINE: Bank Regulation Case Pits U.S. Against States

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday in a case that could change the way big banks are regulated.
 In the case, Cuomo v. the Clearing House Association, federal and state regulators have squared off over which part of the government should serve as the nation's watchdog for national banks. The case began four years ago, when Eliot Spitzer, New York's attorney general at the time, questioned why some national banks seemed to be making a disproportionate number of high-interest home mortgage loans to black and Hispanic borrowers. 
 The fight involves fundamental issues of federalism and consumer protection, and, should the court decide for Mr. Cuomo's position, could open new powers of regulation to the states. 
 Mr. Spitzer was trying to enforce New York's antidiscrimination laws, but he ran up against federal precedent that tended to leave regulation of national banks to the Treasury Department, and, specifically, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. A consortium of banks sued Mr. Spitzer, and so did the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.
 The banks and federal regulators argued that letting state officials regulate the banks would force the financial institutions to deal with a national patchwork of conflicting regulations. States can make laws concerning the banks' practices, they argued, but only the federal government should enforce those laws.
 That argument appeared to resonate with Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who pictured 51 regulators -- one from each state and the federal government -- poring over a bank's books for statistical patterns of differentiation in setting interest rates. ''As long as, most unfortunately, income is correlated with race, with minorities being toward the bottom, of course such statistical disparities will exist, some legitimate, some not,'' he said. In such analysis, ''reasonable people will often differ,'' he noted.
 Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, however, called the unusual arrangement depicted by the government as ''passing strange,'' while Justice Antonin Scalia called it ''weird.'' He asked: ''What incentive does the federal government have to enforce state law? It has so much spare time after enforcing federal law that it's going to be worrying about state law?''
 A federal district judge in 2005 and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 2007 ruled against New York and for federal regulation.
 But much has changed since Mr. Spitzer began his inquiry. For one thing, he is no longer attorney general; Andrew M. Cuomo has succeeded him. And, at the same time, the nation has been shaken by financial scandal and failure in ways that have led many to question the sagacity and effectiveness of the regulatory structure. A brief filed by the 49 other state attorneys general argues, ''The recent (and continuing) fallout from the subprime lending debacle demonstrates the need for more oversight and consumer protection enforcement in the area of mortgage lending.''
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the brief states, ''has no experience in enforcing state public protection laws, has a minimal track record in consumer protection and has no accountability to the citizens of any state.''
 James E. Tierney, director of the National State Attorneys General Program at Columbia Law School, said that the federal regulators' job was to promote ''bank fiscal soundness and not protection of consumers,'' and that battling fraud in mortgage lending was an area where state attorneys general had long excelled. ''They got it first,'' Mr. Tierney said, ''and they got it right.''
 A brief filed by all the Comptrollers of the Currency since 1973, however, takes a different view. The comptroller's office, according to the brief, works quietly with banks to address consumer issues in a ''prophylactic'' way, and ''uses the wide range of its supervisory powers in an effort to alert national banks of potential noncompliance that poses risks to consumers and to ensure that they are addressed as early as possible.'' 
 The threat of action by the federal regulators, the comptrollers stated, is ''a significant incentive for national banks to address any compliance issues before they become serious problems.'' And when such gentle measures fail, the comptrollers wrote, the agency ''does not hesitate to take aggressive enforcement action against national banks.''

HEADLINE: Specter Switches Parties; More Heft for Democrats

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Reporting was contributed by David M. Herszenhorn, Robert Pear and Jeff Zeleny from Washington, and Katharine Q. Seelye from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In an unexpected turnabout in political loyalties, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania announced on Tuesday that he was leaving the Republican Party to become a Democrat, bolstering President Obama at a pivotal moment for his policy agenda and further marginalizing Republicans on Capitol Hill.
 Mr. Specter acknowledged that the surprise decision was driven by his intense desire to win a sixth term next year. It came after he and his political advisers concluded over the weekend that he could not win a Republican primary against a conservative challenger, particularly in light of his vote for the president's economic stimulus package.
 ''I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate -- not prepared to have that record decided by that jury,'' said Mr. Specter, 79, a moderate who has long been known for breaking with his party. 
 Republicans were knocked off stride by the announcement, and many had no warning from Mr. Specter, who met a polite but chilly reception when he entered a party luncheon to inform his colleagues. They immediately labeled it, in the words of Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who heads the party's campaign arm, a naked act of ''political self-preservation,'' and they sought to portray it as an isolated case growing out of Pennsylvania's political environment. 
 The defection of Mr. Specter creates the potential for Democrats to control 60 votes in the Senate if Al Franken prevails this summer in the court fight over last November's Minnesota Senate election, a prospect that appears increasingly likely. 
 If Democrats could hold those votes together, Republicans would be unable to mount filibusters as Congress moves into the critical phase of acting on Mr. Obama's ambitious agenda on health care and energy. A last line of defense against a Democratic-controlled Congress and White House would thereby be eliminated. 
 ''This is transformative,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ''It's game-changing.''
 Democrats warned that it would remain a formidable challenge to keep their ranks together. Mr. Specter said he would not be an automatic Democratic vote, though he will be pulled in that direction since he now faces the prospect of running in a Democratic primary.
 Mr. Specter was one of just three Republican senators to vote in favor of the stimulus package this year. He is a supporter of abortion rights and expanded embryonic stem cell research, and he opposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. But he also voted to authorize the war in Iraq, backed President George W. Bush's Supreme Court nominees, favors school vouchers and has taken many other positions that put him at odds with most Democrats. 
 Mr. Specter said he had received commitments from Mr. Obama and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, to support him in any primary, backing intended to deter Democratic challengers. Mr. Obama is scheduled to endorse Mr. Specter on Wednesday morning at a joint appearance. 
 Administration officials said Mr. Obama was handed a note from an aide at 10:25 a.m. Tuesday in his daily economic briefing. The note, said a senior administration official, read, ''Specter is announcing he is changing parties.'' Seven minutes later, Mr. Obama reached Mr. Specter by telephone. 
 In a brief conversation, the president said, ''You have my full support,'' said the official, who heard the phone call. The president added that Democrats were ''thrilled to have you.''
 White House officials said Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had been at the center of the effort to persuade Mr. Specter to change parties. They said a switch had been the subject of years of bantering and discussion between the two men, who often sat together while riding the Amtrak train home. But the conversation turned more earnest after Mr. Biden lobbied Mr. Specter to vote with the White House on the stimulus bill this year.
 One adviser to Mr. Biden said that since that day 10 weeks ago, Mr. Biden and Mr. Specter had spoken 14 times -- six times in person and eight in telephone conversations. In each case, White House officials said, Mr. Biden argued that the Republican Party had increasingly drifted away from Mr. Specter since the election and that ideologically, he was closer to the Democratic Party.
 White House officials said that there was no realistic way to guarantee that Mr. Specter would not face a primary race for the Democratic nomination, but noted that there was no Democrat in a position to resist the state's political machine and make a serious challenge. More than that, White House officials said they had assured Mr. Specter that Mr. Obama would campaign for him and raise money for him if necessary.
 ''The president's appreciative of this decision and particularly appreciative of the support that he gave on a number of things, the stimulus package being one of them,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser. ''And the president will do whatever he can do to help.''
 Some Republicans bade good riddance to Mr. Specter, who was badly trailing in polls against former Representative Patrick J. Toomey, who also once led the Club for Growth, a group of fiscal conservatives who have financed primary challenges against Republicans they consider to have strayed too far from conservative principles. 
 Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, did not mince words, saying Mr. Specter ''left to further his personal political interests because he knew that he was going to lose a Republican primary due to his left-wing voting record.'' 
 But Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, a Republican who also supported the administration's economic stimulus plan, said Mr. Specter's view that the party had shifted too far to the right reflected the increasingly inhospitable climate for moderates in the Republican Party. 
 Ms. Snowe said national Republican leaders were not grasping that ''political diversity makes a party stronger, and ultimately we are heading to having the smallest political tent in history.''
 Other Republicans said Democrats were on the verge of unchecked power in Washington, a theme Republicans have pushed in an effort to turn political weakness into a strength. 
 ''The danger of that for the country,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, ''is that there won't automatically be an ability to restrain the excess that is typically associated with big majorities and single-party rule.''
 Mr. Specter, who sat on the Democratic side of the dais during a committee hearing Tuesday afternoon, said he had been assured that his seniority would be recognized by his new party, which would put him in line to jump over some Democrats for subcommittee chairmanships after the 2010 midterm elections. 
 Mr. Specter has suffered from a variety of serious illnesses over the years, but said on Tuesday that he was ''full of vim, vigor and vitality.'' 
 He has angered many Democrats over the years with his positions, particularly his support of Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. But he said that with his record of 10,000 votes cast over almost 30 years, he had done something to anger virtually everyone.
 ''I don't expect everybody to agree with all my votes,'' he said. ''I don't agree with them all myself at this point.''

HEADLINE: In India, Shadows of Past Violence Cling to a Politician on the Rise

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: AHMEDABAD, India 

 BODY:
Narendra Modi, India's most incendiary politician, is trying to cast himself as the vanguard of India's modern industrial future. The ghosts of this city's savage past, though, are refusing to leave his side. 
 Mr. Modi, 59, is the thrice-elected chief minister of the western state of Gujarat. On his watch, this city witnessed one of the worst episodes of Hindu-Muslim violence in the history of independent India: in the spring of 2002, mostly over three days, 1,180 people were killed across the state. Most were Muslims. Mr. Modi's administration was accused of doing little to stop the fury and on occasion, abetting it. 
 On Monday, India's Supreme Court, in its strongest move yet, ordered a special police team to investigate Mr. Modi's role in the alleged conspiracy to attack Muslims.
 With national elections under way, Mr. Modi is the biggest crowd-puller for India's main opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party. And while party hierarchy means he is not the B.J.P.'s candidate for prime minister this year, he is positioning himself for the top slot in the next race. 
 On the campaign trail, he is sardonic, often churlish, always theatrical. At one rally, he compared the ruling Indian National Congress, the nation's oldest party, to an aging woman. At another, he assailed the incumbent prime minister, Manmohan Singh of Congress, as so ''weak'' that he ought to get a medical check-up; Mr. Singh had recently recovered from heart bypass surgery. 
 At a third, stabbing the air with his finger, he taunted Mr. Singh for turning to the United States for support in the aftermath of the Mumbai terrorist attacks in November, which India said were the work of a Pakistan-based militant group. 
 ''O-baaaa-maaa,'' he whined, referring to President Obama. ''O-baaa-maaa. Our neighbor has come and attacked us. Do something!'' The crowd lapped it up, hollering, clapping and imitating his cry of ''O-baaa-maa.''
 Mr. Modi's success offers a window into the B.J.P.'s delicate balancing act: It has to hold on to its radical Hindu support base even as it pitches itself as a force of prosperity and security. His rise also suggests a turning point in Indian politics, in which voters weigh what matters more: identity issues, like faith and caste, or practical issues, like electricity, water and roads. Opinion polls show that Hindutva, or Hinduness, has diminishing appeal.
 With a national profile clearly in mind, Mr. Modi has assiduously sought to reinvent himself from a scruffy mascot of Hindu nationalism to a decisive corporate-style administrator. His talking points these days are Gujarat's double-digit economic growth, private seaports and round-the-clock electricity in Ahmedabad, a booming western city that Gandhi once called home. He wears business suits to business meetings, instead of homespun tunics. He still lampoons the urban, English-speaking elite, but he is also honing his English skills.
 His biggest coup has involved the Tata Nano, the world's least expensive car. Last fall, Mr. Modi persuaded Tata Motors to relocate its Nano factory to government-owned land not far from here. The company had been buffeted by protests over land acquisition in another state.
 Soon afterward, several of India's most prominent industrialists gathered in Gujarat for a meeting and declared Mr. Modi, a former tea shop manager, fit to be a future prime minister.
 Swapan Dasgupta, a columnist who advises the B.J.P. on strategy, described him as India's ''aggressive modernizer.''
 The B.J.P ''promises growth, good governance, development and security.'' But it also returns to the party's original ideological pillars, from pledging to build a Hindu temple on the site of a razed 16th-century mosque to resurrecting a preventive detention law that Muslims said had been unfairly applied to them.
 Rarely does Mr. Modi make overt appeals to faith. He does not have to.
 ''Modi has learned that you have to do development to get re-elected, you have to have a secular image if you want to be prime minister,'' said Ajay Umat, editor of a Gujarati-language daily newspaper, Divya Bhaskar, who has known Mr. Modi for more than 20 years. 
 Mr. Modi has also learned, Mr. Umat said, that his core Hindu supporters will not easily forget his original incarnation as their ''protector.''
 That image was sealed in 2002, after a train ferrying Hindus was set on fire by Muslims in a town called Godhra, killing 59 people on board and prompting Hindu mob attacks on Muslims across the state. The mobs stabbed, raped and set their victims on fire; they burned homes and businesses. Mr. Modi has never apologized for what happened. (His office did not respond to numerous requests for an interview with The New York Times.)
 His admirers say he has moved on. They credit him for removing red tape for business, improving the state's road networks, and cracking down on lawlessness and petty corruption. His detractors call him an autocrat. (Sonia Gandhi, the president of Congress, once called him ''a merchant of death.'')
 If and when Mr. Modi becomes the standard-bearer for his party, Indian voters will have to decide whether they can overlook what is called the ''2002 stigma'' in favor of the ''aggressive modernizer.'' His critics hope they will not.
 ''This man can't represent India, either as a civilization or as a nation,'' said Shiv Visvanathan, a sociology professor and one of Mr. Modi's critics. ''He can represent a part. He can never represent the whole. That is the sanity of Indian democracy.''
 Unfortunately for Mr. Modi, the past has been hard to cast off. A police team appointed by the Supreme Court has begun to pry open several cases from 2002, making fresh arrests. 
 Maya Kodnani, Mr. Modi's former minister for women and child development, was arrested on charges of helping a Hindu mob attack two nearby Muslim enclaves. She is awaiting trial on accusations of arming the mob with kerosene cans, which were then used to set people on fire. All told, the mob killed 106 people on a single day, including seven members of Abdul Majid Mohammed Usman Sheikh's family. 
 Mr. Sheikh, 56, who came to the courthouse on the morning of the arrest in late March, called it the beginning of justice for the dead. Among them were his pregnant wife, three sons and three daughters. He carried their pictures in a plastic shopping bag. He said he felt ''a little satisfied.''

HEADLINE: State Finance Plan Predicts Peril When Gains Expire

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
The state will face a perilous financial situation when federal stimulus money and temporary state tax increases on the wealthy expire two years from now, according to the financial plan released by the governor's office on Tuesday.
 For the fiscal year beginning in April 2011, the budget deficit is projected to balloon to $8.8 billion. The year after that, the deficit is expected to be $13.7 billion. 
 While far lower than what Gov. David A. Paterson's budget office projected before this year's budget deal, the gaps would still be enormous: On paper, they would be the second- and fourth-largest deficits in state history (the largest was this year).''Federal stimulus funding provided the state a soft landing as it transitions to a new fiscal reality, but much more needs to be done to get our fiscal house in order,'' Mr. Paterson said in a statement. ''This year we took the first step toward implementing reforms that will make our state government more cost-effective and accountable, and we must continue the important work of reining in state spending in the future.'' 
 This year, Mr. Paterson and lawmakers closed a budget gap that his administration estimated at $20.1 billion with a mix of spending cuts, federal stimulus aid and new taxes and fees. Including stimulus funds that were required to be spent, the state's overall budget came to $131.8 billion.
 While the deficit projected for next year -- when Mr. Paterson and every state lawmaker will seek re-election -- is projected at $2.2 billion, that assumes a relatively strong recovery in tax receipts, according to state budget figures. Excluding money from the tax increase on high earners and other new taxes and fees, budget officials are projecting a 4.8 percent increase in revenues for the fiscal year beginning next April, after two years of substantial declines.
 And when lawmakers return from the campaign trail in 2010, they will confront the effects of Wall Street retrenchment and the resulting revenue decline. Budget officials expect the financial and insurance industries to shed jobs every year until 2015, when they project a small amount of growth. Wall Street bonuses will fall by more than half from their 2007 peak of $50.9 billion, the plan projects.
 Though Mr. Paterson won some spending concessions from the health care industry this year, rising Medicaid enrollment is expected to swallow much of those gains in the coming years. By the 2013 fiscal year, Medicaid rolls will have grown by 1.1 million, according to the financial plan's estimates.
 Some fiscal pressures are already making themselves felt. Payments submitted with individual tax returns this month were 30 percent lower than those of last April, according to Laura L. Anglin, the governor's budget director. Payments submitted with requests for an extension were down 50 percent. 
 While some drop-off has already been built into the current budget, more bad news could come on June 15, when individuals must make quarterly tax payments and corporate tax bills come due.
 ''That is what keeps me awake at night,'' Ms. Anglin said during a briefing on Tuesday.
 The budget division also projected that the United States economy would decline by 2.9 percent this year, the largest annual decline since World War II and one that is twice the rate predicted by budget officials in December, when Mr. Paterson proposed his budget. State officials now expect the recession -- which in New York officially began in August -- to end during the third quarter of 2009, marking the longest downturn since the Great Depression.

HEADLINE: As Detroit Is Remade, the U.A.W. Stands to Gain

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- In the devastating slump that has forced one of Detroit's automakers into bankruptcy and another to the edge of it, the United Automobile Workers union stands to become one of the industry's few winners.
According to restructuring plans proposed this week, the union will have more than half the stock in Chrysler and a third of General Motors, meaning it will have tremendous influence, with the government, in determining the future of the companies. 
The United Automobile Workers union said Wednesday that its members ratified a cost-cutting deal with Chrysler by a 4-to-1 margin.
''Our members have responded by accepting an agreement that is painful for our active and retired workers, but which helps preserve U.S. manufacturing jobs and gives Chrysler a chance to survive,'' Ron Gettelfinger, the union's president, said in a statement.
The prospect of a big ownership stake for the U.A.W. in G.M. has angered holders of billions of dollars in bonds, who stand to get only a fraction of the restructured company. As for Chrysler, the banks, hedge funds and others that lent it money have been promised only cash, not stock.
''We believe the offer to be a blatant disregard of fairness for the bondholders who have funded this company and amounts to using taxpayer money to show political favoritism of one creditor over another,'' a group of G.M. bondholders said in a statement this week.
The U.A.W. members at both automakers stand to lose some of their pay and benefits, but the cuts are not as deep as those faced by airline and steel workers when their companies went bankrupt. Under proposed deals devised by the Treasury Department, U.A.W. pensions and retiree health care benefits would largely be protected.
The U.A.W. has derived its leverage in part from the support of a Democratic president and Congress. But it also results from a long-term strategy to build support in Washington that stretches back more than 60 years.
''We have to fight both in the economic and political fields, because what you win on the picket lines, they take away in Washington if you don't fight on that front,'' Walter P. Reuther, the union's best known president, said in 1947.
Mr. Reuther and every succeeding U.A.W. president invested significant amounts of time and money to pursue that goal.
In the last 20 years, the U.A.W. has donated more than $25.4 million to federal candidates, 99 percent of it to Democrats, according to OpenSecrets.org, a site that tracks campaign contributions.
The union ranks No. 16 on the group's list of top 100 political donors, known as ''heavy hitters.'' The U.A.W. was well ahead of G.M., which gave $10 million in that period, ranking it 73rd. Chrysler and Ford Motor did not make the list.
Mr. Gettelfinger, the current president, has also been an effective, steel-nerved leader, and has managed to maintain the union's importance in recent negotiations, even though the U.A.W. has lost nearly 200,000 members since he took office in 2003.
Mr. Gettelfinger's influence stems in part from the fact that the U.A.W. represents nearly all the auto workers at the Detroit companies. (Workers at a few plants are represented by the I.U.E.) By contrast, airline workers are represented by multiple unions.
''The U.A.W. is so overwhelmingly dominant,'' said Duane Woerth, former president of the Air Line Pilots Association. ''You're only talking to one union and that gives them more power.''
Mr. Woerth, whose union was involved in 22 bankruptcy cases involving big and small airlines during his tenure as its president, said the pressure that bondholders and other investors might put on the U.A.W. has been mitigated by Democrats' support.
For example, the union has yet to complete a deal with G.M., which laid out an offer to its bondholders this week that would pay them about 41 cents on the dollar. In order for the deal to succeed, 90 percent must accept it, which analysts say is unlikely given bondholders' criticism of the offer.
Only this week did the U.A.W. come to terms at Chrysler, facing a Thursday deadline set by the administration.
The tactics have won admiration from others in the labor movement, even those forced to grant concessions to bankrupt companies.
Robert Roach Jr., a general vice president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, said a successful outcome for the U.A.W. and the auto companies would benefit the economy, and in the process help his 650,000 members at major airlines, aircraft makers and other companies.
''We're all in this,'' Mr. Roach said. ''The corporations, the federal government, the taxpayer, the cities and the states. If we are able to save these auto companies, that will be good for everybody.''
But many of the U.A.W. members who voted Wednesday on the Chrysler proposal were struggling to see the benefits of the cuts they were agreeing to.
The deal suspends cost-of-living pay increases, limits overtime pay and reduces paid time off. It also eliminates dental and vision benefits for retirees.
It also provides for Fiat to begin building cars in at least one Chrysler plant.
''Either you vote for it or it's bankruptcy,'' said Bruce Clary, 58, who was an electrician at a Detroit engine plant until being laid off in January. ''And it may be bankruptcy anyway.''
At Chrysler's Jefferson North assembly plant nearby, the oldest auto plant still operating in Detroit, workers said the consequences of rejecting the deal would be far worse than the concessions that it would force.
''This was the best deal we could get,'' said John Davis, who has worked at Chrysler for 33 years. ''We did our part, and now the banks need to do their part.''

HEADLINE: You're Choosy. So Are We.

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
UNTIL the recession hit and reduced luxury shopping to a furtive activity -- buy that $20,000 Hermes bag if you must, but get it wrapped in brown paper like Daddy's pork chops -- spending money was the name of the game. Stores didn't feel the slightest compulsion to avoid the impression that clothes, no matter how well made and loaded with special gizmos, were absurdly expensive. That was the beauty of selling all that specialness: You could keep ratcheting up the prices without necessarily worrying about quality or value. The profits were huge.
Now stores are deserted, and executives are asking fashion houses to reduce prices to roughly 2005 levels, according to several retailers. They have to do something to plug the losses.
But despite the economic pressures, is it realistic to think that a woman who wears Prada will give her love to Theory? She'll buy less of what she's used to rather than give it up entirely. And what about those cheap-and-cheerful stores like Topshop that everybody says are such a great wardrobe fix? Can a woman over 35 really hope to find something that doesn't make her look as if she still sleeps under a Bon Jovi poster? 
Thinking about an older, sophisticated consumer who is buying less but not cutting quality, I asked three stylists to go shopping with me and put together a half-dozen looks. Each stylist approaches dressing with a different objective: Brana Wolf, a consultant to several designer brands, including Michael Kors, is the editor at large at Harper's Bazaar; Leslie Fremar, who began her career as an assistant to Anna Wintour at Vogue, helps dress actresses like Julianne Moore and Jennifer Connelly; Darina Byrne runs Wardrobe Guru, a personal shopping service in Manhattan, with a post-30 clientele.
I met with the stylists on three separate days, in different parts of the city. Although we didn't work with a budget, we were strict with our choices; each piece had to be worth the money, as well as be age-appropriate, whether it was a $55 cardigan from Topshop or a $3,000 Rick Owens leather jacket. Some outfits were pricey, like the one Leslie put together with the Owens jacket, a L'Wren Scott blouse and a pair of wide Comme des Garcons pants. But we thought that each piece was a keeper. The other outfits were a high-low mix; and a few seemed to offer great value, like a long Andrea Lieberman A.L.C. dress in draped jersey that Brana and I found at Barneys Co-Op, at $473.
Shopping in this way disabuses you of certain notions while it informs you of others. We all thought this was not Prada's best season; the wrinkled prints are too trendy. And who exactly is the customer for a $1,600 blue baby-doll dress? Not a woman over 40. You also realize that despite the economy, you're not going to go crazy in a place like Topshop or Uniqlo just because the prices are low.
Brana and I met at Topshop, down on Broadway, on a chilly morning. Dressed in a gray vintage-looking coat and black trousers with a cardigan, Brana quickly flipped through the racks. ''That's a cute cardigan,'' she said, stopping at a rail of sweaters in an array of colors. ''Similar to my Saint Laurent. Long, a little pocket. Mine is cashmere, this would be cotton. Still, it's a good piece for $65.'' She also liked a striped cotton shirt for $55 and ribbed tank tops for $12.
Later, though, as we walked toward Miu Miu and Phillip Lim, Brana revised her opinion. ''To be honest, even though I say I would buy a T-shirt from Topshop, I'd prefer to buy one from James Perse'' for about $80, she said. ''Because I care about the stitching and the edging.''
At Miu Miu, Brana picked out a cotton peplum shirt for $925. (''It's very Lanvin. Wear it as a jacket over a tank top.'') Glancing at some ornate shoes, she said: ''I don't know about you, but I'm so sick of looking at ridiculous shoes. And I don't know who buys them because I don't see them in the street.''
The Lim boutique, to our surprise, yielded a lot of affordable, well-made clothes, notably a tailored cream jacket ($550) and a silk jumpsuit ($450). ''That's very cute,'' Brana said of the jumpsuit. ''Maybe for someone in her 30's, with a big cardigan.''
After stopping at the Michael Kors shop, where we found a terrific Michael by Michael trench for $200, we went over to the Marni and Marc Jacobs shops on Mercer Street. Brana is a big fan of Marni: ''It's easy to wear, very age-appropriate but with just a little extra something.''
But, looking at a $1,400 silk print dress, Brana said with a rueful laugh, ''I don't know anymore if that's expensive or not.'' She decided that it was a good buy, along with a $2,100 metallic leaf-patterned coat at Marc Jacobs and a below-the-knee striped jersey dress with a long, winding sash.
A few days later, Leslie and I met at Barneys, where the plan was to put together looks from designer and Co-Op labels. We sort of skipped past Nina Ricci and Bottega Veneta ''I usually love Bottega, but I don't really understand it this season,'' said Leslie, who wore a black double-breasted Row blazer, a gray T-shirt and skinny jeans with flats. As we looked at a Lanvin/Acne denim trench coat (perfect, we later decided, with a black Alaia dress), I asked Leslie if her clients were still shopping.
''They're shopping because, unfortunately, they're scrutinized all the time and they have to change their clothes,'' she said. Leslie, who likes Dries Van Noten and Isabel Marant, said she often finds things in small boutiques like Mick Margo, Ludivine and No. 6.
Reaching the third floor, she said: ''You know what everyone loves? L'Wren's dresses. The girls are crazy about them. They look in the mirror, and all the insecurities go away.'' We thought one of her tie blouses could work with something.
It was easy to put together age-friendly looks that were reasonably kind to the purse. In fact, except for one or two pieces, most of the things we found were under $1,500, and some, like a cute Wayne silk dress, were less than $500. We paired that dress with a Row blazer, which Leslie liked for its modern proportions. One of our favorite looks was a long Balenciaga shirtdress ($1,195) in navy silk crepe. You could wear it during the day with sandals, or dress it up with chains at night.
As for getting the right fit with a garment, her secret is to use a tailor. ''I do it with every client,'' she said. ''People are so much happier when they've had their clothes tailored.''
Darina Byrne seems built for shopping. Slim and angular, with choppy blond hair, she had on a flippy brown Prada dress with a gray Chloe cardigan and flat-heel boots when we met at Etro on Madison. After picking out some print pants and a couple of scarves, which she thought would punch up an outfit, we headed down to the meatpacking district. We breezed through some of the designer boutiques, uninspired or stung by the prices.
At Jeffrey, we found a hooded white Marni jacket and a cropped Dries shirt that looked versatile. But our best finds were across the street, at Diane Von Furstenberg, where Darina pulled out a beige suede coat ($885) and a flared olive cotton skirt with a canvas belt ($330).
''This is a great little skirt,'' she said. ''Anyone can wear this.'' She saw the coat with the Etro pants and a T-shirt from Calypso. We put the DVF skirt with a mint-green leather bomber from Brunello Cucinelli -- expensive, but the silhouette hit the right note.
Darina said her clients are still shopping but buying less. ''They're pulling back and saying, 'Do I really love this?' '' she said.
Like Brana and Leslie, though, she is picky even about the quality of casual pieces. ''I think you have to be careful at the moment,'' she said. ''If your focus is about saving money, you can actually make bigger mistakes.''
I asked Darina about hemlines and older women. ''I used to say the tip of the kneecap was the perfect place,'' she said. ''But everything has gotten so short, it's now about half an inch to an inch above the knee.'' With the DVF skirt, she added, ''it looks a little more age-appropriate if you're in flats rather than heels.''
Happy or fearful, rich or cautious, one thing women don't want is to look old. ''That lady look,'' Darina said. ''It's not a good look! Everybody wants a little edge, and they want to feel they came up with it.''

HEADLINE: Toyota's Troubles Slam Japan's Motor City

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
TOYOTA CITY, Japan -- For years, Toyota City prospered along with the giant carmaker that shares its name, growing into a global automotive manufacturing center as its official sister city, Detroit, slid into decline.
Now, the current economic crisis has halted the good times in Japan's Motor City. Toyota Motor, the city's largest employer and dominating presence, has idled factories and slashed production amid its first annual net loss in 59 years. This has pushed Toyota City into its worst slump in memory, as jobs have vanished, tax revenues have dried up and tidy downtown shopping streets have grown eerily empty. The reversal of fortune has turned both Toyotas, the city and the car company, into grim symbols of a global downturn that has spared few, including the once seemingly unstoppable Japanese auto industry.
''In the beginning, we used to aspire to be a second Detroit,'' said Tatsuya Yoshimura, who owns a camera shop in downtown Toyota City. ''Now, that is what we are afraid of becoming.''
Many in this proud company town of 423,000 are questioning their extreme economic dependence on a single corporation, even if it is the world's largest automaker. 
''When Toyota sneezed, we caught pneumonia,'' said Shoji Sawahira, head of the finance section at Toyota City's city hall. ''We never imagined this would happen to the world's No. 1 company.''
Fear of the future is palpable at the local unemployment office, the optimistically named Hello Work Toyota, which has suddenly found itself overrun by the newly jobless.
Until last summer, the office sat largely empty as the local auto industry faced a chronic labor shortage, drawing workers from across Japan and as far away as Brazil and Peru. Now, Hello Work is crowded with more than 1,000 job seekers a day who line up for hours to claim unemployment insurance or sit anxiously at computer terminals scouring a job database.
One of those who came to find work was Masahiro Tanaka, 30, who lost his job at an auto glass factory in February. He said it was the first time he or anyone he knew had been cut in 12 years of working at auto parts factories in Toyota City.
''The only places that are still busy are those producing for the Prius,'' Mr. Tanaka said, referring to Toyota's fuel-efficient hybrid sedan, which has remained popular despite the slump. ''Everywhere else, jobs are just gone. Completely gone.''
Hello Work's vice director, Masami Kawajiri, said 8,042 job seekers visited the office between January and March, up 133 percent from the same period a year ago. The sudden surge in job seekers has kept Hello Work's staff working six-day weeks without breaks, Mr. Kawajiri said.
''We've never seen it this busy,'' said Mr. Kawajiri, who explained that overwork had turned one of his eyes blood-red. ''I don't even want to think of what will happen if the economy gets even worse.''
He and others said jobs began disappearing after last summer, as collapsing global auto sales led Toyota Motor to cut its work force by 6,000 and slow production at its seven factories in Toyota City, where most of the company's 72,000 Japan-based employees are. Toyota said it expected a $3.5 billion net loss in the last fiscal year, its first loss since 1950.
Many residents worry what could happen if the recession drags on. But they seem confident that Toyota City can weather the downturn in the long run. They point to a traditional ethic of thrifty self-reliance that led the city government to shun extravagant projects during the boom years, and instead set aside $719 million in emergency savings, exactly for such a rainy day.
The city retains its spotless streets, immaculate shops and nonexistent crime rate. Since the slowdown, only one manufacturing company has gone bankrupt, says the city's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, because Toyota spread out orders among many of the more than 400 auto parts factories in the city, to keep them afloat through hard times.
Nonetheless, Toyota's downturn has rippled through the city's economy, idling many smaller auto-related suppliers, which also cut payrolls, mainly by refusing to renew the contracts of short-term workers. After losing their jobs, many of the city's 16,400 foreign residents, mostly ethnic Japanese from Brazil and Latin America, packed up and left, residents and city officials said.
These have been wrenching setbacks for a city that has long flourished as the best known of Japan's ''corporate castle towns,'' as company towns are known here. The city, about an hour east of the central city of Nagoya, changed its name to Toyota City in 1959 when the auto company relocated here.
Despite Toyota's dominating presence, residents say they do not expect the company to come to their rescue. A spokesman for Toyota, Paul Nolasco, said the company was not extending direct aid to the city.
''We are a major member of the community,'' Mr. Nolasco said, ''but we are not city planners.''
City finances have taken a huge hit from the crisis. According to Mr. Sawahira, the finance section chief at city hall, losses by Toyota and other companies drove down the city's corporate income tax revenues to $16 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, from $442 million the year before. Personal income taxes, the city's other main source of tax revenues, did not drop as sharply, though they are likely to fall again this year as unemployment spreads, Mr. Sawahira said.
To help offset the lower revenues, the city has cut spending on several projects, including construction of a $100 million wing in city hall and purchases of artwork for the city's art museum.
Mr. Sawahira said the drop in tax revenues, while severe, did not catch the city completely by surprise. Toyota accounts for such a huge portion of corporate income taxes -- some three-quarters -- that city planners had gotten in the habit of monitoring the company's regular earnings forecasts in order to predict the size of city budgets. ''Our finances closely track the company's,'' Mr. Sawahira said.
Local merchants have also joined to try to reverse both the city's and the car company's slouching fortunes. They introduced a ''We Love Toyota'' campaign in which shop owners will chip in $200 when one of their customers buys a new Toyota car at a local dealership.
''Can't let Toyota Motor fail,'' said Mr. Yoshimura, the camera shop owner. ''We don't want to have to change the city's name again.''

HEADLINE: Big Loss for Lewis

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The applause thundered inside the Belk Theater on Wednesday for a fading star of American finance: Kenneth D. Lewis, the beleaguered head of Bank of America.
But all those huzzahs, offered up by loyal employees and steadfast believers, did not sway Mr. Lewis's shareholders.
Mr. Lewis, who helped build Bank of America into the nation's largest bank, was stripped of his chairman's title -- a stinging blow that leaves his stewardship and legacy in doubt. At a contentious annual general meeting, angry investors held him accountable for what they view as a series of missteps that forced the once-mighty bank to accept not one but two government bailouts. 
For Mr. Lewis, the bad news arrived shortly before 6 p.m., after a gathering that seemed to captivate much of Charlotte, where Bank of America's soaring headquarters punctuates the skyline.
While Mr. Lewis remains chief executive -- the board expressed its unanimous support for him -- many inside and outside the bank wonder if he can hang on. Mr. Lewis confronts daunting challenges, and many of his investors are losing patience. Even after receiving billions of taxpayer dollars, some analysts say, the bank may still need to raise more to shore up its weakened finances.
''Ken Lewis has now become the lightning rod of controversy, and that is highly distracting,'' said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, who believes Mr. Lewis should resign. ''Even if everything he did was appropriate, it has hampered his legitimacy to lead.''
It was not long ago that Mr. Lewis was celebrated for his vision. His daring takeover of Merrill Lynch was the latest in a series of high-profile acquisitions that helped transform Bank of America into a national powerhouse. His conquests included the Countrywide Financial Group, the giant mortgage lender which, for many, came to symbolize the excesses of the subprime era. In December, the American Banker, the daily chronicle of the banking industry, named him 2008 Banker of the Year.
But that was then. Now Mr. Lewis is drawing fire for overpaying for Merrill, whose gaping losses prompted Bank of America to seek a second rescue from Washington. The attorney general of New York is examining whether Mr. Lewis adequately disclosed the risks of the takeover to his shareholders, drawing headlines -- and more ire. The timing could hardly be worse. Bank of America is bracing for another wave of loans to go bad as the recession drags on.
Walter E. Massey, the president emeritus of Morehouse College in Atlanta, will replace Mr. Lewis as chairman.
On Tuesday night, before the shareholder gathering, Mr. Lewis seemed chipper as he chatted with colleagues over drinks at Sonoma, a swanky restaurant at the base of the bank's headquarters. As usual, he and his executives wore red, white and blue Bank of America pins on their lapels.
But by 7 a.m. Wednesday, news crews were setting up outside the bank, expecting a showdown. Employees made their way through the growing crowd.
Jonathan Finger, a prominent bank shareholder and a vocal critic of Mr. Lewis, strode from camera to camera. A few protestors turned up with signs. One of them, Judy Koenick, wore a T-shirt emblazoned with a phrase that summed up the view of Mr. Lewis's most ardent detractors: ''Fire!!! Kenneth Lewis Fire!!!''
Soon the Belk Theater was packed. The throng overflowed into the lobby, where a crowd watched on video monitors. Some 2,200 people turned up, a bank spokeswoman said.
Many of them welcomed Mr. Lewis, a man who helped put Charlotte on the world's financial map. The applause rang out for more than half a minute. Shareholders took turns at the microphone to offer testimonials.
''If we don't have Ken, who do we have?'' one asked. Even Evelyn Davis, the corporate gadfly who calls herself ''Queen of the Corporate Jungle,'' defended Mr. Lewis. At one point, she ran up and kissed him on the cheek.
The president of the city's Chamber of Commerce spoke in support of Mr. Lewis, as did representatives from Habitat for Humanity and several environmental groups. One shareholder suggested Mr. Lewis donate his $1.5 million salary to charity. Someone in the audience yelled: ''Oh, stop!''
Mr. Lewis, who has worked for the bank for 40 years, replied: ''Unfortunately, because of my pledges, I actually did give away more than I make.'' Again, applause.
Mr. Lewis shed little light on the Merrill transaction, though he did say in his prepared remarks that both Merrill and Countrywide helped the bank's first-quarter results.
''These acquisitions are not mistakes to be regretted. Both are looking more like successes to be celebrated,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''We are building this company for the long run.''
Gradually, the crowd thinned and, after four hours, the meeting broke up, with Mr. Lewis's fate still unknown. So many shareholders cast votes that it took the bank longer than expected to count them all.
Robert Stickler, a bank spokesman, said some large shareholders had told the bank they voted to remove the chairman title from Mr. Lewis because of corporate governance concerns, not because they did not support him.
In the end, it was close: 50.34 percent of shareholders -- 25 million votes -- opted to remove Mr. Lewis as chairman. A third voted to remove him from the board altogether. Even before the vote count was final, the bank's directors were considering replacing Mr. Lewis as chairman because it was clear he had lost the support of so many shareholders.
Carl Wagle, a retired machinist from nearby Greensboro who said he had lost most of his $65,000 life savings on Bank of America stock, left the meeting shaking his head. He said he had come to suggest that Bank of America pay higher interest rates on savings accounts.
''They need to understand what the average American person thinks of banks,'' Mr. Wagle said. ''They see banks as a place where fat cats live. Americans are not going to start having confidence in their banks until they see the bankers changing.''
Mr. Lewis, hewing to his routine, stopped in at Sonoma. Several executives hugged him. Then he emerged, waved and smiled at people gathered in the courtyard, and disappeared into Bank of America's headquarters.

HEADLINE: Containing Flu Is Not Feasible, Specialists Say

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.

 BODY:
''Containment is no longer a feasible option,'' Dr. Keiji Fukuda, deputy director general of the World Health Organization, announced Monday night in Geneva after a meeting of the agency's emergency committee on the spreading swine flu virus. ''The world should focus on mitigation. We recommend not closing borders or restricting travel.''
Many countries are still ignoring that advice. The globe is a confusing welter of bans, advisories and alerts on some pork and some people. 
On Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano was heavily pressed in Congressional hearings to ignore the advice and close the border with Mexico. She defended her decision not to do so, saying it ''would be a very, very heavy cost for what epidemiologists tell us would be marginal benefit.''
President Obama defended it too, telling a reporter that it would be ''akin to closing the barn door after the horse is out.''
Experts on the global movement of flu say Dr. Fukuda, Ms. Napolitano and Mr. Obama are right. The world, they say, must bow to the inevitable: closing borders would not only fail to stop the virus, but would also cause economic collapse and possibly add to the death rate.
''But it's wrong to think we're throwing up our hands and saying 'Let 'er rip and let's hope for the best,' '' said Dr. Martin S. Cetron, director of global migration and quarantine for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ''This has all been in the national pandemic flu plan since 2007.''
Closing borders is dangerous because many goods needed in a pandemic are made abroad, said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, including most masks, gowns and gloves, electrical circuits for ventilators and communications gear, and pharmaceutical drugs and the raw materials to make them. (For example, most suppliers of shikimic acid, the base ingredient in the antiviral drug Tamiflu, are in China.)
''You cut those off and you cripple the health care system,'' he said. ''Our global just-in-time economy means we are dependent on others.'' Much of our food is from overseas. ''A Kellogg's Nutri-Grain bar has ingredients from nine countries in it,'' he noted.
The fallback position, experts said, is mitigation, the use of ''nonpharmaceutical measures.'' They include personal ones like washing hands and wearing a mask, occupational ones like working from home or arranging care for children who are sick or whose schools close, neighborhood-level ones like closing theaters, museums or restaurants, and metropolitan-wide ones like shutting a school system or canceling a major league ballgame.
The three goals, Dr. Cetron said, can be plotted on the graph of new infections called the epidemic curve. ''You want to shift the curve to the right, blunt the peaks and squash the area under them,'' he said.
Moving right is slowing new transmissions until the arrival of hot summer weather, which is unfriendly to flu, and to buy time -- the 16 to 20 weeks it takes to make a new vaccine.
Blunting the peaks of new cases decreases demand on hospitals, so patients do not have to be triaged off ventilators to die because others are waiting.
Ventilators cost $30,000 each, though models as cheap as $100 are stockpiled for pandemics. But patients whose lungs are delicate or mucus-jammed need professional monitoring. And fewer people infected per day slows the multiplier effect. Each one usually infects two or three more.
For the World Health Organization, mitigation is an about-face from the strategy that has contained the H5N1 avian flu, which has caused fewer than 300 deaths. That flu's first appearance in 1997 was contained by killing every chicken in Hong Kong. Since then, each time a cluster appears, the public health authorities try to cull all the local poultry, vaccinate birds in a large ring around that, and drop the ''Tamiflu blanket'' on people -- dosing everyone in the area.
The 1976 swine flu was also beaten by containment, said Dr. Pascal J. Imperato, dean of the school of public health at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, who was the chairman of the New York City Swine Flu Task Force in 1976. The 230 cases were all among soldiers at Fort Dix, N.J., ''and they were all just held within that base,'' he said. ''They had no external contacts. One died, the rest had mild infection.''
Experts feared that flu was a re-emergence of the 1918 strain and that it would come back with a vengeance in the winter. They vaccinated 40 million people, but it never did come back.
In the 1918 Spanish flu, American cities that reacted quickly had fewer deaths than those that acted slowly and used fewer precautions, according to a 2007 study of 43 cities by researchers from the University of Michigan and the Centers for Disease Control. The most common combination was school closings and bans on public gatherings, which in 34 cities lasted for a median of four weeks. All those cities except New York, Chicago, and New Haven closed their schools; the median time was six weeks.
Deaths per 100,000 population ranged from 210 for Grand Rapids, Mich., to 807 for Pittsburgh.
Although some scientists and historians have argued that those measures just delayed deaths that later happened anyway, Dr. Cetron, one of the authors of the 2007 study, denied it.
''There's no evidence of that,'' he said. ''Cities that acted early and layered on different interventions did well.''
Many people do not realize how long measures take to work. A child can shed flu virus for 10 days, Dr. Imperato said, an adult for 5.
Some experts are cautiously optimistic. A computer simulation of this outbreak released Wednesday by a team from Northwestern University projected a worst-case scenario, meaning no measures have been taken to combat the spread. It predicted a mere 1,700 cases in the United States four weeks from now.

HEADLINE: British Supermarket Chain Places Bets on Banking

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
As traditional banks scale back, their reputations tarnished by major losses, Tesco, the largest retailer in Britain, is moving onto their turf.
 Despite the shrinking economy and rising unemployment in Britain, the company, a supermarket chain, is expanding the financial services it offers, like loans, savings and insurance programs, to add checking accounts and, in the future, mortgages. Tesco is hoping for an additional source of revenue just as its traditional grocery business is losing market share.
 But other retailers in Britain and the United States have made similar forays in far better economic climates -- with less-than-spectacular results. Some analysts said they feared that Tesco's gamble could end up undermining both its image and its bottom line. 
 Brian Sozzi, an analyst at Wall Street Strategies, said the expansion plan represented an ''unnecessary risk.''
 ''They could have too much exposure to a risky market,'' Mr. Sozzi said.
 ''If you're a retailer, then stick to retailing.''
 Tesco said its experience in financial services would help it avoid the mistakes made by others, and Sir Terry Leahy, the Tesco chief executive, said he was confident the timing was right. What is happening in the banking sector and the economy, he said, ''might actually help us.''
 While the ASDA unit of Wal-Mart Stores and other rivals plan to beat the recession by cutting prices further, Tesco has declared its intention to become ''the people's bank.'' Tesco believes it will be seen as a ''safe haven'' because it does not tap the financial markets for funds but instead operates like a more traditional bank, using deposits to make loans.
 ''There will not be a better time to increase our commitment to financial services,'' Sir Terry, the Tesco chief, said. ''Customers are looking for a better deal.'' Tesco has already started to benefit: Customers have opened more than 100,000 savings accounts since the beginning of the year. The chain now has six million savings and credit card accounts, up by one million over the past year, and deposits have reached about $:4.5 billion, or $6.6 billion.
 Tesco could use the extra income. Sales growth in Britain has slowed as lower-cost competitors, like ASDA, cut food prices. The recession has undermined consumer spending on other goods Tesco sells, like clothing and furniture.
 Because Tesco imports much of its goods, the recent drop in the value of the pound has further weighed on its profits. An expansion into the United States last year, where Tesco opened Fresh & Easy stores, has not been the success it hoped for.
 The company, which had a profit of $:2 billion last year, said it expected its retailing services division -- which mainly consists of the personal finance unit but also includes its Web site and sales of mobile phone, telephone and Internet access services -- to make annual profits of $:1 billion within a decade, up from about $:400 million last year. Some analysts said such aims are ambitious but not unrealistic.
 Tesco said the financial crisis also allowed it to hire senior banking executives who might have been reluctant to work for a supermarket chain in the past.
 Benny Higgins, who managed consumer banking for HBOS, before the company, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, ran into trouble, joined last year to take control of the business.
 Like many grocery chains, Tesco branched out into financial services 11 years ago, after financial industry deregulation. It set up a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland to offer credit cards and insurance, but the business remained small. When Royal Bank of Scotland came under pressure last year to shed assets to repay government loans, Tesco bought the bank's half of the personal finance business for $:950 million and vowed to invest in it.
 Tesco's banking plan stands relatively unrivaled for now, partly because competitors are currently focusing more on grabbing market share in the traditional food business. But in addition, many tried already but struggled to build successful banking services.
 J Sainsbury has had its own joint venture with Lloyds Banking Group since 1997 but it was hit by bad-debt charges and is only expected to return to profit this year. Wal-Mart offers a credit card, payroll-check cashing and a money transfer service, but it dropped plans to apply for a banking license in 2007 following opposition from banks and lawmakers. In France, chains like Groupe Auchan and Casino also offer some credit card and insurance services.
 ''The others just don't have the financial clout or interest to expand into financial services,'' said Tim Attenborough, an analyst in London for Exane BNP Paribas. Tesco's personal finance unit has a core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, of 12 percent, more than Barclays.
 As much as banking could be an opportunity for Tesco, it also poses risks.
 Investing in a business that relies on the creditworthiness of its clients at a time of rising unemployment and credit card defaults could backfire.
 Target and Sears are among those retailers that learned that lesson the hard way. Target finally bowed to shareholder pressure and sold a 47 percent interest in its credit card receivables to JPMorgan Chase last year. Sears invested more than $38 billion in the early 1980s, buying a brokerage and a real estate firm, in a ''socks and stocks'' strategy, but eventually sold off the businesses because they failed to generate the expected synergies.
 Still, a Bank of America analyst, John Kershaw, cited growth prospects linked to the banking business as a reason for upgrading Tesco stock to ''buy'' in April.
 Some analysts said profits would come from synergies with Tesco's enormous customer-loyalty plan, Clubcard, which records the shopping habits of more than 12 million Britons and could be used to focus marketing for financial services.
 Up to now, Tesco has offered its financial services through literature in its stores, online, and by telephone. But Tesco plans to open 30 bank branches in its stores by the end of the year and to start offering checking accounts within the next two years. The unit plans to hire 500 people over the next year, more than doubling its staff.
 ''The reputation of banks in the U.K. has taken a real battering whereas Tesco is definitely a brand that people trust,'' said Sam Hart, an analyst at Charles Stanley, a London stockbroker. ''There's extremely good potential in financial services for them in the long-term.''

HEADLINE: Envisioning the End of 'Don't Cluck, Don't Tell'

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
 In the modest backyard of Rosemarie Morgan's 1890-era house, about a half-mile from Yale University, there is a small Buddha, azalea and forsythia, Japanese cherry and plum trees, and an Amish-made chicken coop with five residents -- four who lay eggs and Gloria, who is barren but one heck of a watchdog.
 The fowl are technically illegal under New Haven's zoning code, which prohibited raising hens and other livestock when it was updated during the 1950s. But these days, many dozens of backyard hens are generally tolerated under the city's informal enforcement program -- call it ''don't cluck, don't tell'' -- that mostly looks the other way. With urban fowl increasingly common, Alderman Roland Lemar has introduced legislation that would allow residents to raise up to six hens. 
 Ms. Morgan, a Victorianist at Yale who specializes in Thomas Hardy and grew up with assorted animals in England and Scotland, may not be the face of modern agriculture. But she's a perfect representative of a tiny sliver of it -- the vogue for urban farming that has cities around the country updating and tweaking zoning codes.
 To Ms. Morgan -- whose other Rhode Island reds and hybrids are named Brunnhilde, Tosca, Carmen and Mimi -- the zoning fight is a little baffling.
 ''It seems extraordinary to me that you could have a cat or a dog or a caged bird, but you can't have a chicken,'' she said the other day, sprinkling corn in the yard for her little brood. ''Slightly barbaric really.''
 Of course, not many New Haven residents or Yale professors were raising chickens a few years ago. But some combination of the locavore craze, the growth of immigrant communities with traditions of raising hens and the recession making the idea of free eggs or milk in the backyard attractive, cities and suburbs around the country are reviewing all manner of critter ordinances.
 Seattle recently allowed residents to have up to three goats. Minneapolis just legalized beekeeping. 
 At the center of the Brave New World of urban ag is the humble hen, whose care and keeping is the subject of Web sites like thecitychicken.com, urbanchickens.org, backyardchickens.com, or Just Food's City Chicken Meetup NYC, which has 101 hen-friendly members in New York.
 Ms. Morgan, whose East Rock neighborhood was once known as Goatville, took up raising hens when she lived in the Berkshires and, along with some friends, resumed it when she moved back to New Haven seven years ago. She likes the fresh eggs and the link to our vanished natural past. She's very fond of her feathered friends, who eat bugs and mosquitoes and don't make much noise other than a triumphant squawkwhen laying.
 ''The eggs are fabulous,'' she said. ''And it's very emotionally fulfilling. They're not exactly pets -- they still have a wild way about them, but they're very smart and easy to have around. And noise? They're not as loud as blue jays, no worse than a cat's meow, certainly quieter than a barking dog.'' 
 Most municipalities are much less hospitable to roosters (consider that next door every dawn) than hens. But the clear trend is toward being more permissive. Jennifer Blecha, who did a doctoral dissertation on people's attitudes about urban livestock, surveyed the zoning codes of American cities and found 53 allow hens, 16 prohibit them and 9 make no mention. In general, Ms. Blecha said, cities are much more tolerant of domestic livestock than suburbs.
 ''People like the idea of I take care of them, and they take care of me,'' she said, explaining that the personal agrisystem of feeding food scraps to chickens that, in turn, produce breakfast, has enormous appeal. 
 Of course, not everyone is happy. New Haven's head of code enforcement does not like the idea of adding chicken coop inspection to his portfolio. On the New Haven Advocate's Web site, one resident lamented the presence of ''these foul, filthy, half flying, eat anything rats in the East Rock nabe.'' And any health scare involving animals -- see: swine flu -- can lead to a pushback, though advocates say the real threat is from factory farming, not small urban populations.
 Owen Taylor of Just Food, which promotes local agriculture in New York, said the key is for people to explain their plans to their neighbors, so they know what to expect. He praised New York's codes, which deal with potential bad behavior (smell, noise, rodents) rather than the existence of the hens, for allowing responsible fowl behavior and punishing those who create a nuisance. Citing New York street wisdom, he added, ''You deal with it on a coop by coop basis.''

HEADLINE: Despite Outcry, Derby Owners Fall Silent on Drugs for Horses

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky. 

 BODY:
The death of the filly Eight Belles at last year's Kentucky Derby, along with the revelation that Big Brown had been treated with steroids before his dazzling victory, spurred pledges of reform and accountability for the welfare of the American thoroughbred. But as racing prepares for its biggest show on Saturday, many top owners and trainers still resist discussing what legal medications their horses are receiving.
 Of the 20 owners or their trainers who as of Monday intended to run a horse in the Derby, only three shared their veterinary records with The New York Times.
 Even with the prohibition of steroids in the past year, the United States continues to have the world's loosest medication policies for thoroughbreds, and there is a growing concern within the veterinary community that overmedication -- with drugs like corticosteroids, anti-inflammatories that can have dangerous consequences -- and lax oversight have imperiled the safety and welfare of racehorses. 
 The aggressive use of legal drugs is a big reason this country has the worst mortality rate for thoroughbreds, veterinarians say. In effect, they say, short-term fixes with legal drugs have left horses vulnerable. 
 The 17 owners unwilling to show the records offered a variety of reasons for their refusal. Some talked about competitive pressures, and one trainer cited his horse's privacy.
 David Lanzman, co-owner of the Derby favorite, I Want Revenge, referred the inquiry to his trainer, Jeff Mullins. ''I'm a mortgage banker,'' Lanzman said. ''I don't know what goes on back there.'' Mullins declined to provide the records. 
 The owners' responses make it impossible to tell what practices even racing's most prominent and accomplished people follow when using chemistry to improve their horses' performance.
 ''We've got to quit giving these horses drugs they do not need, and show the public that we are serious about cleaning this sport up,'' said Rick Porter, who owned Eight Belles and co-owns the Derby contender Friesan Fire. A necropsy of Eight Belles, who was euthanized after breaking down just beyond the finish, showed that she had no pre-existing injury or ailment and was free of steroids and other drugs.
 Porter provided the records for a dozen of his horses now training with Larry Jones. Joining him in offering their horses' full medical records -- which are not required to be disclosed -- were Jerry Myers, the owner of Win Willy, and Bo Hirsch, who campaigns Papa Clem. On Wednesday, Win Willy's owners withdrew him from the Derby when they discovered a possible crack in his left front ankle. 
 According to the records, each of those owners took a conservative approach to medication. Porter paid $165 last month for Friesan Fire's veterinary care. The monthly bills for routine care for some horses surpass $1,000.
 The 17 who declined to make their veterinary records available include a who's who of thoroughbred racing.
 Edward Evans is the owner of the Florida Derby winner Quality Road, who was among the Derby favorites until his scratch on Monday. Evans is one of 98 members of the Jockey Club, one of the sport's most prestigious organizations, dedicated, it says, ''to the improvement of thoroughbred breeding and racing.''
 Bill Casner and Kenny Troutt, owners of WinStar Farm, which will enter three horses in the Derby, are trustees of the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, which is dedicated ''to improve the economics, integrity and pleasure of the sport.''
 Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, who has spent hundreds of millions at American horse sales, will send two runners in search of his first Derby win on Saturday.
 The drug issue has been contentious in horse racing, and what comes off a veterinarian's truck and goes into a horse is often perceived to be as important to the performance of a horse as its talent. Before the 2005 Derby, Churchill Downs and Kentucky racing officials began 24-hour surveillance and more comprehensive drug testing.
 Last spring at Keeneland, the trainer Patrick Biancone, who finished second in the 2004 Derby with Lion Heart, and his veterinarian were barred from the Kentucky circuit when cobra venom -- a powerful, illegal painkiller -- was found in his barn.
 The Hall of Fame trainer Jack Van Berg told a Congressional subcommittee last June that training horses had become ''chemical warfare.'' Arthur Hancock, a fourth-generation breeder and owner, said that after routinely receiving medication bills for more than $1,000 per horse, he told his vet to give his horses drugs only when they were sick.
 ''You want to win races, don't you, Arthur?'' Hancock said the vet replied.
 Thoroughbreds routinely receive medications whether they have ailments or not. Mullins, the trainer of I Want Revenge, will serve a seven-day suspension after the Derby for giving one of his horses a cough remedy before a stakes race last month at Aqueduct in New York. He acknowledged that his horse did not have a cold and that he gave the treatment to all his horses in the hope of increasing their air capacity.
 Drugs help prevent ulcers, treat inflammation and open air passages. A common medication is Lasix, which prevents blood from seeping into the lungs and airways. It is given to nearly every horse that goes to post in the United States, although the practice is prohibited in Europe and Hong Kong. Most regulators and veterinarians say Lasix enhances performance because it is a diuretic that flushes 20 to 30 pounds of water out of a horse.
 A consensus among equine researchers and surgeons has developed that legal medications and cortisone shots, over time, leave a horse vulnerable to a catastrophic breakdown. 
 Nancy Heitzeg, a professor at St. Catherine University in Minnesota, has tried to track all horse racing fatalities in the United States. She calculated that there had been about three breakdowns a day nationwide since last year's Kentucky Derby.
 In America, racehorse fatalities have occurred at the rate of 1.47 per 1,000 starts for synthetic surfaces, and 2.03 per 1,000 starts for dirt tracks, said Mary Scollay, the equine medical director for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, who conducts research for the Jockey Club.
 In England, the average risk of fatality is much lower, from 0.8 to 0.9 per 1,000 starts. In Victoria, Australia, studies have reported the risk of fatality from 1989 to 2004 at 0.44 per 1,000 starts.
 Corticosteroids can be injected into joints and are prevalent at American tracks. They are often given within days of a race, especially in the sport's lower levels. In essence, that helps a sore horse make the starting gate. 
 ''These are strong drugs and have therapeutic benefits,'' said Dr. Wayne McIlwraith, a surgeon and leading researcher on joint injuries at Colorado State University. ''The question we need to answer: When are we helping a horse, and when are we desensitizing pain to dangerous levels?''
 This will be the first Kentucky Derby in which anabolic steroids are expressly prohibited. That is a victory for the industry's Racing Medication and Testing Consortium, which has also pushed through uniform rules in 32 of the country's 38 racing jurisdictions.
 Many within the sport would like to eliminate all but the medicines that treat illness or injury.
 ''Sometimes there is a conflict for what is best for the horse and what's best for the owner, and what's best for the trainer or the vet,'' said Rick Arthur, the equine medical director for the California Horse Racing Board. ''The easiest way to regulate something is to take away the opportunities forbad judgments.''
 Mac Robertson, the trainer of Win Willy, is the son of a trainer. He grew up at third-rate tracks in the Midwest, where horses were injected because horsemen needed them to run to feed their families. As he rose in the sport, he said, he was disappointed that some trainers and owners treated their horses as commodities.
 ''I've watched my favorite horse break his leg when I was a kid, and I know how much that hurts,'' Robertson said. ''We should get rid of all medications because they are bad for the horse, and it's bad for the breed. If a horse is not healthy, he should not be running. 
 ''We have too many people hold them together with drugs so they can win races and go to the breeding shed and make money. If they won on drugs, they really weren't the best, and their flaws are going to keep being passed on.''
 Porter will hardly feel outgunned when he sends Friesan Fire to the gate Saturday. His colt received only vitamins and electrolytes since arriving here from Louisiana, though he was treated by a chiropractor.
 As Eight Belles's death showed, racing is dangerous under the best conditions. Porter, however, is disappointed that the sport has not gone further in eliminating medications and conducting itself more transparently. 
 ''Everyone who participates in this game should be taking care of these horses,'' he said. ''We're the ones that speak for them.''

HEADLINE: Coffee, Tea, Lawn Ghoul?

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
NOT recession-proof: The Peeing Boy of Brussels Sculpture and Fountain. The Marshmallow Shooter. The Bunion Regulator. 
 And yet, the Zombie of Montclaire Moors, at $89.95, a ghoulish, 13-pound lawn sculpture, is still a top seller in the SkyMall catalog, the advertiser of unusual gadgets and other products you never knew you needed. 
 The Pet Observation Porthole ($29.95), a clear plastic dome that can be mounted in a fence to ''give an inquisitive canine a panoramic view of the world,'' was so popular that it sold out. There also remains a huge demand for the cordless Keep Your Distance Bug Vacuum ($49.95), which can suction up flies, bees and spiders from up to two feet away.
 The catalog's annual circulation -- via the seat pocket in front of you -- is 20 million. Each year as many as 688 million bored and restless airline passengers can flip through its pages to ponder, in the latest edition, 2,000 products. 
 ''If there is any piece of writing that defines our culture, I submit it's the SkyMall catalog,'' the author Bill McKibben wrote in a 2006 essay in Orion magazine, a nature and culture magazine published every two months. ''To browse its pages is to understand the essential secret of American consumer life: That we've officially run out not only of things we need, but even of things we might plausibly desire.''
 In its 19 years, the SkyMall catalog has served not only as a reflection of consumer behavior, but as a symbol of Americans' love of shopping and curious delight with oddball items. SkyMall pulls together merchandise from hundreds of retailers, including Brookstone, Hammacher Schlemmer and Frontgate. 
 With fewer people flying or spending money, the economic downturn may have tilted the catalog's sales slightly more toward utilitarian items -- the No. 1 best seller this year is a 10-by-22-foot square of polyvinyl floor covering for the garage ($359), and the first truly frivolous item, the Giant Cupcake Pan, comes in at No. 17.
 But last year, the Bunion Regulator, which costs $15.99 and straps onto the toe overnight to ease bunion pain, came in at No. 9 on the best-seller list, after the Breathe Fit Snoring Aid ($29.95) with the Marshmallow Shooter not far behind. Still, the recession does not appear to have diminished the catalog's kitschy appeal.
 ''Some may think that what we provide is just a good laugh,'' Christine A. Aguilera, SkyMall's president, said in an e-mail message after a phone interview. ''There's nothing wrong with that. But when you are standing eye to eye with a giant spider, you will be thankful you bought the Keep Your Distance Bug Vacuum.''
 She added, ''Even when times are tough, I think Americans are still optimistic about the future and interested in products that can make their lives a little easier. There is no secret category or line of goods that are recession-proof. What is recession resistant is innovation.''
 In 2007, SkyMall embarked on an aggressive marketing campaign that drove up its Web sales. In January, SkyMall ventured into social networking territory, hiring an official corporate Twitterer. The tweets generated enough interest in the Wonder Woman Cuff bracelet ($24.95) that sales of the item more than doubled, Ms. Aguilera said.
 ''Philosophically, Americans like to have products, they like to have new things, they like to have things the neighbors don't have,'' Ms. Aguilera said in the phone interview. ''I know that some of the products people find a little entertaining, comical, whimsical, but I don't think there's anything bad about that.''
 Although there are plenty of practical items in the catalog, including suitcases and sneakers, it is the weird and wacky ones that tend to get the attention. Last year, one humor blog, Cracked.com, listed ''The 5 most ridiculous SkyMall Products Money Can Buy,'' putting at No. 4 ''a baffling array of lawn ornaments'' like the Zombie and the Peeing Boy of Brussels.
 ''What it does: Makes your house look like it's occupied by a complete lunatic,'' the post said.
 Kit Yarrow, a professor of psychology and marketing at Golden Gate University, said that the SkyMall catalog could have a particular appeal in the recession.
 ''Their audience is really looking for relief, not just something to alleviate boredom, but also a little bit of fantasy,'' she said. ''If you look at the products in there, they are lifestyle and gadget-oriented, both the sort of thing that transports you in a way. You can imagine a different lifestyle, imagining yourself out in the backyard barbecuing, with the kids shooting marshmallows, the birds chirping and life is good.''
 Technically, SkyMall is an advertising company. Retailers pay to have their products listed in the catalog, which is published four times a year and changes most of its product selection each time. SkyMall has a variety of financial arrangements with its retailers, Ms. Aguilera said, and sometimes gets a cut of sales in addition to charging for advertising.
 Some top-selling items, like the Bug Vacuum and the Edge Baking Pan ($39.95), which is meant to prevent burnt edges and gooey centers in brownies, appear regularly in consecutive catalogs, or else remain available on SkyMall.com. The products are advertised in the catalog, which is distributed through 13 airlines and Amtrak and on SkyMall.com. 
 SkyMall, which is privately held and based in Phoenix, would not release information on its profitability or total sales. Forty percent of SkyMall customers order merchandise through the company's toll-free telephone number and the rest order through the SkyMall Web site; SkyMall said sales from the Web site alone were up last year, to $81.5 million from $75 million in 2007.
 The top-selling categories for SkyMall include housewares and pet products, such as gates, indoor dog restrooms, pet drinking fountains and feeders, and the Bark Free Pro ($89.95), which uses ultrasonic tones heard only by dogs to stop them from barking. It's No. 4 on the list of the 60 top sellers on sale in the late spring 2009 catalog.
 Among Ms. Aguilera's top five all-time favorite products in the SkyMall catalog: The Bug Vacuum, currently the No. 5 best seller. She uses it to rid her home of any desert insects that survive the exterminator.
 ''I gave this to all my sisters one year at Christmas,'' she said. ''They are still sucking up scorpions. Now if they could only invent one that would suck up small snakes.''

HEADLINE: Panel Advises Clarifying U.S. Plans on Cyberwar

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
The United States has no clear military policy about how the nation might respond to a cyberattack on its communications, financial or power networks, a panel of scientists and policy advisers warned Wednesday, and the country needs to clarify both its offensive capabilities and how it would respond to such attacks. 
 The report, based on a three-year study by a panel assembled by the National Academy of Sciences, is the first major effort to look at the military use of computer technologies as weapons. The potential use of such technologies offensively has been widely discussed in recent years, and disruptions of communications systems and Web sites have become a standard occurrence in both political and military conflicts since 2000. 
 The report, titled ''Technology, Policy, Law, and Ethics Regarding U.S. Acquisition and Use of Cyberattack Capabilities,'' concludes that the veil of secrecy that has surrounded cyberwar planning is detrimental to the country's military policy. 
 The report's authors include Adm. William A. Owens, a former vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff; William O. Studeman, former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and Walter B. Slocombe, former under secretary of defense for policy. Scientists and cyberspecialists on the panel included Richard L. Garwin, an I.B.M. physicist. 
 Admiral Owens said at a news conference Wednesday in Washington that the notion of ''enduring unilateral dominance in cyberspace'' by the United States was not realistic in part because of the low cost of the technologies required to mount attacks. He also said the idea that offensive attacks were ''nonrisky'' military options was not correct. 
 In the United States, the offensive use of cyberweapons is a highly classified military secret. There have been reports going back to the 1990s that American intelligence agencies have mounted operations in which electronic gear was systematically modified to disrupt the activities of an opponent or for surveillance purposes. But these activities have not been publicly acknowledged by the government. 
 The report concludes that the United States should create a public national policy regarding cyberattacks based on an open debate on the issues. The authors also call on the United States to find common ground with other nations on cyberattacks to avoid future military crises. 
 The authors point to a 2004 Pentagon statement on military doctrine, indicating that the United States might respond to a cyberattack with the military use of nuclear weapons in certain cases. ''For example,'' the Pentagon National Military Strategy statement says, ''cyberattacks on U.S. commercial information systems or attacks against transportation networks may have a greater economic or psychological effect than a relatively small release of a lethal agent.'' 
 Pentagon and military officials confirmed that the United States reserved the option to respond in any way it chooses to punish an adversary responsible for a catastrophic cyberattack. While the options could include the use of nuclear weapons, officials said, such an extreme counterattack was hardly the most likely response. 
 ''The United States reserves the right to respond to intrusions into government, military and national infrastructure information systems and networks by nations, terrorist groups or other adversaries in a manner it deems appropriate,'' said one senior Pentagon official.
 Another senior Pentagon official added, ''While the United States would always reserve the right to respond appropriately to defend the nation and its citizens, this kind of scenario is extremely speculative and requires an enormously vivid imagination.'' 
 The two officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the highly classified nature of planning for cyberwarfare and nuclear warfare. Both officials emphasized that in American military planning, there are only rare instances when any specific option would be declared off-limits in advance. 
 This effort to specifically project a lack of clarity is viewed as important to keeping an adversary uncertain of the severity of an American counterattack. Introducing that uncertainty into the thinking of an adversary's government and military has historically been an essential element of deterrence, whether traditional nuclear deterrence or today's cyberwar planning. 
 For example, during the cold war, when the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies stationed an overwhelming conventional force in Central Europe, American planners were never certain that NATO's tanks and artillery could hold back the Soviet-led armor if an offensive was begun across the Fulda Gap in Germany. 
 Thus, the United States never declared that it would be bound to respond to a Soviet and Warsaw Pact conventional invasion with only American and NATO conventional forces. The fear of escalating to a nuclear conflict was viewed as a pillar of stability and is credited with helping deter the larger Soviet-led conventional force throughout the cold war. 
 Introducing the possibility of a nuclear response to a catastrophic cyberattack would be expected to serve the same purpose.

HEADLINE: From the Web to the Power Grid

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
KRISTOPHER R. FARRUGGIA used to run a Web design company, but ''the virtual world wasn't paying well enough,'' he said. So now he is computerizing the real world, in a way that he hopes will make it cleaner. 
 Four years ago, Mr. Farruggia, of Arvada, Colo., went to work for Xcel Energy, which supplies electricity and gas to the Denver area. Lately, he has been supervising the installation of equipment that will extend computer control of the electricity grid in Boulder.
That has meant overseeing contractors as they install network elements, boxes about the size of a desktop PC that will receive radio signals from a dozen or so advanced electric meters at nearby homes and businesses and transmit that information to an Xcel Energy office. 
 About 50 or 60 boxes are being installed every day, and by early June Boulder is expected to have a smart grid that will let the utility communicate minute to minute with customers who have volunteered to participate. The system could eventually exchange information with thermostats, dishwashers, refrigerators and other appliances.
 They will get a real-time view of their electricity use, enabling them to moderate their energy consumption at peak times, reducing the company's reliance on relatively dirty generators and its need to build more power plants. And those who have smart meters are expected to use less electricity overall, Mr. Farruggia said.
 Positions like Mr. Farruggia's are expected to increase over the next few years as some of the more than $780 billion in federal stimulus money is spent on energy and environmental projects around the country. The Obama administration has pinned many of its hopes for stemming unemployment on the creation of high-tech green jobs.
 For Mr. Farruggia, 28, who is to graduate from Regis University in Denver on Saturday with a degree in computer information systems, the work is about more than just a better-paying job.
 ''I'm excited for the possibilities of what this project could bring,'' he said. ''Not only for us as a utility, but for our customers and the environment as well.'' MATTHEW L. WALD

HEADLINE: Economy Slides At Fastest Rate Since Late 1950s

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE and EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The American economy is contracting at its steepest pace in 50 years, the government reported Wednesday, but an unanticipated rise in consumer spending since January suggested to many economists that the worst of the recession might have passed. 
 The last six months were brutal. Output fell at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the January-through-March quarter after falling at a rate of 6.3 percent in last year's fourth quarter, according to the Commerce Department. If that pace were to continue, nearly $1 trillion would be wiped out this year from the nation's economic output of $14.2 trillion last year. 
 Not since 1958, in the wake of a brief but severe collapse in home construction, has the national economy lost so much ground in just six months. But as tax breaks and government stimulus spending kick in, the decline in the gross domestic product could be cut in half by summer. 
 ''The situation is not nearly as dark as the first-quarter number suggests,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com, echoing the opinion of many forecasters, who see the contraction continuing, but at a slower rate until growth returns late this year or in early 2010.
 Stock prices rose, partly in response to this prospect. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 168.78 points, or 2.11 percent, closing at 8,185.73.
 The looming question remains the severity of job losses. More than five million jobs have disappeared since the recession began in December 2007. As their wages disappear, households spend less, and business, in response, reduces the output of goods and services, cutting more jobs in the process. 
 That dog-chasing-its-tail cycle was evident in the latest G.D.P. report, except for consumer spending, which rose at its best pace since the recession began. A sharp drop in fuel prices, economists said, helped to free up money for other spending.
 ''The biggest wild card going forward is whether that spending can hold up,'' said Brian A. Bethune, an economist at IHS Global Insight. 
 The Federal Reserve's policy makers, echoing the incipient optimism, said in a statement issued Wednesday, at the end of a two-day meeting, that the outlook had ''improved modestly'' and that the Fed would continue to pump tens of billions of dollars into the economy to keep credit flowing. To encourage this borrowing, and spending, interest rates controlled by the Fed would remain near zero, the policy makers said.
 In a rare public forecast, Paul A. Volcker, a former Fed chairman and now an economic adviser to President Obama, added his voice to the optimism, although cautiously. ''I'm not here to tell you the economy is going to recover very strongly in the short run,'' Mr. Volcker said in an interview recorded for a weekend show on Bloomberg Television. But he said the improvement was sufficient to avoid a second government stimulus on top of the $787 billion in spending and tax breaks enacted in February. 
 An obstacle to easier credit, however, might come from the Treasury Department, which said in a report issued Wednesday that it would step up the issuing of 30-year bonds. The funding is needed to help finance the hundreds of billions of dollars that the government is spending on bank bailouts and stimulus. But the quickening pace could force Treasury to raise long-term interest rates to attract enough buyers for the bonds -- an action that in turn could impede lending. 
 A special advisory committee to the Treasury warned in a report that the government's huge and rapidly escalating need to borrow money would weigh heavily on the financial markets and that investors would demand higher interest rates in exchange for buying up the avalanche of new bonds.
 Until now, that has not been a problem, the report said. Investors have snapped up Treasury bonds as a haven for their money in a troubled world economy, and China invested the proceeds of a huge trade surplus in United States government securities.
 ''Treasuries will probably not receive the same favorable demand treatment from either source over the coming quarters,'' the advisory committee's report said. 
 Consumer spending stood out as the only significant bright spot in the Commerce Department's otherwise bleak update on the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the nation's economic activity, which has now posted three straight quarters of decline. Consumer spending turned up in the first quarter, rising at a 2.2 percent annual rate, for the first time since last summer. 
 Most of the spending was on autos, kitchen appliances, computers and other durable goods. But retailers allowed shoppers to draw down inventories, without reordering to fill their shelves. Indeed, imports, a source of much of the nation's consumption, fell sharply, along with exports. And so did business investment.
 Adding to the damage, government spending at the state and local level either declined or fell sharply. That presumably will reverse in the current quarter, as the $787 billion stimulus package kicks in this spring. Indeed, many economists are counting on the federal spending and on various small windfalls for consumers to ease the recession in the months ahead.
 The Social Security Administration, for example, is sending $250 checks in early May to each of the millions of older people getting benefits. And thousands of employers, responding to new federal rules, are cutting the amounts withheld from their employees' weekly and monthly pay checks -- in the process fattening take-home pay.
 ''These fiscal policy measures will play a key role,'' said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG Investment Technology Group, ''in gradually lifting economic growth.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rally in a Rejection of Pessimism

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
It may still be months before the economy turns around, but investors on Wednesday were acting as if a recovery was just around the bend, and bet heavily that the worst economic declines were over. 
 Stock markets rallied broadly as investors stampeded into financial stocks and abandoned the safe-haven investment of Treasury debt. Their mood was leavened by an optimistic gloss on the country's first-quarter output and a statement from the Federal Reserve saying that the pace of economic contraction was ''somewhat slower.''
 Although stocks gave up some of their gains in the last minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average still rose 168.78 points, or 2.1 percent, to 8,185.73. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 18.48 points, or 2.2 percent, to 873.64, its highest close in three months.
 ''The market seems to be looking forward,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners. ''It's a good sign that the market's focusing on the potentials of a rebound as opposed to the decay in economic activity.''
 An analyst's report predicting healthier bank profits helped lift financial shares. Bank of America rose 6.5 percent to $8.68 as shareholders meeting in North Carolina re-elected the bank's board. After the markets closed, the company announced that its chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, was voted out as chairman.
 Shares of the media and entertainment companies Time Warner and DreamWorks Animation rose after they reported earnings that beat investors' expectations. 
 On its face, there was little cause for jubilation in the day's economic news. The government reported that the gross domestic product -- an important measure of the economy's total output -- fell at an annual pace of 6.1 percent from January through March, nearly identical to its plunge of 6.3 percent in the last months of 2008..
 But investors took consolation because consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, rose slightly after six months of declines. And they expressed hopes that government spending would pick up and other economic indicators would brighten as the government's $787 billion stimulus program kicks into gear.
 And they fixed on a statement from the Fed's Open Market Committee that looked ahead to a ''gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.''
 But as the government tries to combat the sluggish economy with tax cuts and huge new spending projects, investors showed signs of balking at the vast new supply of Treasury debt pouring into the marketplace. The Fed has already laid out plans to buy $300 billion in longer-term Treasuries to keep interest rates low, but it announced no additional measures on Wednesday. As credit markets begin to heal and once-wary bond investors develop an appetite for higher returns, they are beginning to stray from Treasury notes, sending yields sharply higher and potentially increasing the cost for the government.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 26/32, to 97. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.11 percent, from 3.01 percent late Tuesday.
 Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of seven-year notes:

HEADLINE: Bail Is Set For Executive In Fraud Case

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
A federal judge set bail on Wednesday for the chief executive of a suburban New York investment firm who has been indicted in a $400 million fraud case. 
 The executive, Nicholas Cosmo of Lake Grove on Long Island, was arrested in January in connection with a reported investment fraud that had been exposed in the financial crisis. He was indicted April 23 and charged with 10 counts of wire fraud and 22 counts of mail fraud. 
 Mr. Cosmo pleaded not guilty on Wednesday before Magistrate Judge E. Thomas Boyle in Federal District Court in Central Islip, N.Y. The judge approved a bail package that included $750,000 secured by properties and home confinement under electronic monitoring.
 Mr. Cosmo was held Wednesday because he had not yet met all of the conditions of bail. The next hearing was scheduled for May 19. A spokesman for prosecutors said the government would appeal the bail.
 Federal prosecutors claim that during the five years before his arrest, Mr. Cosmo cheated investors in several states out of money that was supposed to be used for bridge loans to commercial borrowers.
 The indictment accused Mr. Mr. Cosmo of hiring representatives for two of his companies, Agape World and Agape Merchant Advance, to attract investments by promising high returns for short-term loans to businesses. Some loans were to be made through Professional Merchant Advance Capital, known as Promac, in which Mr. Cosmo had a 20 percent stake.
 Few such loans were made, according to the indictment, and Mr. Cosmo created and delivered fraudulent account records of profits to investors.
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has brought civil charges against Mr. Cosmo.

HEADLINE: Panel Warns U.S. on Cyberwar Plans

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
The United States has no clear military policy about how the nation might respond to a cyberattack on its communications, financial or power networks, a panel of scientists and policy advisers warned Wednesday, and the country needs to clarify both its offensive capabilities and how it would respond to such attacks.
 The report, based on a three-year study by a panel assembled by the National Academy of Sciences, is the first major effort to look at the military use of computer technologies as weapons. The potential use of such technologies offensively has been widely discussed in recent years, and disruptions of communications systems and Web sites have become a standard occurrence in both political and military conflicts since 2000. 
The report, titled ''Technology, Policy, Law, and Ethics Regarding U.S. Acquisition and Use of Cyberattack Capabilities,'' concludes that the veil of secrecy that has surrounded cyberwar planning is detrimental to the country's military policy. The report's authors include Adm. William A. Owens, a former vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff; William O. Studeman, former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency; and Walter B. Slocombe, former under secretary of defense for policy. Scientists and cyberspecialists on the panel included Richard L. Garwin, an I.B.M. physicist.
 Admiral Owens said during a news conference in Washington on Wednesday that the notion of ''enduring unilateral dominance in cyberspace'' by the United States is not realistic in part because of the low cost of the technologies required to mount attacks. He also said the idea that offensive attacks wre ''nonrisky'' military options was not correct. 
 In the United States, the offensive use of cyberweapons is a highly classified military secret. There have been reports going back to the 1990s that United States intelligence agencies have mounted operations in which electronic gear was systematically modified to disrupt the activities of an opponent or for surveillance purposes. But these activities have not been publicly acknowledged by the government.
 The report concludes that the United States should create a public national policy regarding cyberattacks based on an open debate on the issues. The authors also call on the United States to find common ground with other nations on cyberattacks to avoid future military crises.
 The authors point to a Pentagon statement on military doctrine issued in 2004, indicating that the United States might respond to a cyberattack with the military use of nuclear weapons in certain cases. ''For example,'' the Pentagon National Military Strategy statement says, ''cyberattacks on U.S. commercial information systems or attacks against transportation networks may have a greater economic or psychological effect than a relatively small release of a lethal agent.''
 Pentagon and military officials confirmed that the United States reserved the option to respond in any way it chooses to punish an adversary responsible for a catastrophic cyberattack. While the range of options could include the use of nuclear weapons, officials said, such an extreme counterattack was hardly the most likely response.
 ''The United States reserves the right to respond to intrusions into government, military and national infrastructure information systems and networks by nations, terrorist groups or other adversaries in a manner it deems appropriate,'' said one senior Pentagon official.
 Another senior Pentagon official added, ''While the United States would always reserve the right to respond appropriately to defend the nation and its citizens, this kind of scenario is extremely speculative and requires an enormously vivid imagination.''
 The two officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the highly classified nature of planning for cyber and nuclear warfare. Both officials emphasized that in American military planning, there are only rare instances when any specific option would be declared off-limits in advance.
 This effort to specifically project a lack of clarity is viewed as important to keeping an adversary uncertain of the severity of an American counterattack. Introducing that uncertainty into the thinking of an adversary's government and military has historically been an essential element of deterrence, whether traditional nuclear deterrence or today's cyberwar planning.
 For example, during the cold war, when the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies stationed an overwhelming conventional force in Central Europe, American planners were never certain that NATO's tanks and artillery could hold back the Soviet-led armor if an offensive was begun across the Fulda Gap in Germany.
 Thus, the United States never declared that it would be bound to respond to a Soviet and Warsaw Pact conventional invasion with only American and NATO conventional forces. The fear of escalating to a nuclear conflict was viewed as a pillar of stability and is credited with helping deter the larger Soviet-led conventional force throughout the cold war.
 Introducing the possibility of a nuclear response to a catastrophic cyberattack would be expected to serve the same purpose.

HEADLINE: From Smokestacks To Your Tank

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
IF the government regulates carbon dioxide emissions, power plants and other factories will probably start removing CO2 from their smokestacks and will have to pay to get rid of it. The conventional wisdom is that it will be sequestered underground.
 But one audacious concept is to recycle the carbon by turning it into liquid hydrocarbon fuels. 
Chemical plants, in this vision, could generate liquid hydrocarbons by taking hydrogen from natural gas or even water and combining it with CO2 to make fuels that would cut the demand for crude oil. In effect, each carbon atom would be used twice: the first time in a coal-fired power plant and the second in a car engine. 
 For the United States, such a system would also have a strategic benefit, substituting chemical processing here for oil imports from abroad. Its financial viability would depend on the cost of making new fuel from carbon, and on how much a company with surplus carbon would be willing to pay to get rid of it. 
 A crucial consideration, though, is how much energy it would take to recombine carbon with hydrogen to produce a fuel that could substitute for gasoline. Energy costs money, but it also comes with a cost in carbon emissions that could reduce or eliminate any environmental benefit to the process. 
 As unlikely as the concept may seem, chemists have been working on it for decades. Chemistry journal articles in the 1990s reported various approaches to the problem, with the target product often being methanol, which can be used as a vehicle fuel or as an intermediate product. 
 But it took so much energy that ''the juice was not worth the squeeze,'' said Byron H. Elton, president and chief operating officer of Carbon Sciences, a company in Santa Barbara, Calif., that believes it has what it calls a biocatalyst that will combine the hydrogen in water with the carbon dioxide, without the usual large expenditure of energy required to break the chemical bond between water's hydrogen and oxygen. 
 The company has one patent and is applying for several more. It declined to provide details, except to say that a pilot plant produces methanol a few ounces at a time. Scaling up will be a challenge, Mr. Elton said. 
 ''It's drip, drip, drip, not gush, gush, gush,'' he said.
 A different group of scientists, at the University of Southern California, made a deal at the end of 2007 with Honeywell, which has a large chemical business, to work on making methanol from carbon dioxide.
 The methanol is not so much a fuel as a carrier that incorporates energy from different sources, some of them clean, like wind. Electricity made from wind can be used to separate hydrogen, which can then be combined with the carbon dioxide to make liquid hydrocarbons like methanol. 
 ''Earth does not have an energy problem; we have an energy carrier and distribution problem,'' said G. K. Surya Prakash, one of the U.S.C. scientists, at a conference on the subject last year. ''We have plenty of alternative energies.''
 Dr. Prakash and two U.S.C. colleagues, George Olah, a Nobel laureate in chemistry, and Alain Goeppert, wrote a book called ''Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy,'' which foresees a system built on turning carbon dioxide back into fuel.
 Methanol has only about half the energy content of gasoline, per gallon, and like ethanol, it eats away at the seals and gaskets in cars and service station fueling systems. But it can run well in engines designed for it, and oil refineries already have experience in converting it into synthetic gasoline.
 It can also be used directly in a fuel cell and converted to electricity, although fuel cells are today far too expensive to be practical for cars.

HEADLINE: A Little Give And Take on Electricity

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
YOUR utility wants to talk to you.
John Kieken of Manhattan, Ill., is already listening. He used to turn on the lights and run the washing machine, air-conditioners and other electrical appliances in his 106-year-old farmhouse whenever he wanted. At the end of the month he would get a bill from Commonwealth Edison, the big Chicago-based utility, and write a check. 
 Now he is in continuous conversation. He watches a Web page that gives him an estimated price for electricity at the current time, and he treats a kilowatt-hour as if it were a pound of hamburger or a shirt on a department store shelf; if it is on sale, buy now, and if not, wait. 
 He routinely turns off an air-conditioner if the price rises too high, and if the price sinks low enough he turns off his oil furnace and heats with electricity instead. 
 ''I'm saving a ton of money,'' said Mr. Kieken, a Web page developer -- $900 in the last 14 months. He has discovered that at odd times at night, the utility will pay him to use electricity, a quirk previously obvious only to wholesale customers. ''Normally I wouldn't think of heating with electricity,'' he said. 
 Mr. Kieken is an early volunteer in an experiment in the ''smart grid'' -- a suite of technologies intended to even out demand for electricity, cut expenses and make the electric system more stable. 
 Experts have talked about a smart electric system for two decades, with many false starts, but cheaper communications and computing -- and federal stimulus money -- could soon make the idea a reality. ''The rewards are massive, and it's highly transformational and has amazingly powerful environmental consequences,'' said Roger W. Gale, a former Energy Department official and now a consultant to utilities.
 Start-up companies, as well as giants like I.B.M., Honeywell and Cisco, working in the United States and around the world, are offering smart meters or products that allow digital control of the demand for electricity. Other devices monitor transmission lines, transformers and switches more closely, to warn early of blackouts.
 The first ''dumb'' thing to go may be flat pricing. Today, a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to burn a 100-watt bulb for 10 hours, costs the same to most customers at all times, whether it is a sweltering summer afternoon or a balmy spring night. But the cost to the utility swings wildly, and the company may have to spend much more money to supply extra energy at peak times than during slack periods. None of this can be inferred from the bill, even though it eventually turns up there. 
 ''What customers have paid for 75 years or more in this industry is an averaged rate,'' said Anne Pramaggiore, executive vice president for customer operations at Commonwealth Edison, which is experimenting with rates that depend on when electricity is used.
 Flat pricing may not be helping customers either, said Frederick F. Butler, president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. 
 ''It's like if you walked into the supermarket and everything was priced the same, and you could take as much or as little as you wanted, swipe a card at the cashier, walk out, and six weeks later they'd send you a bill,'' said Mr. Butler, who is also commissioner of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. ''It gives you no data on how much things cost, how much you're using and how you can switch from one thing to another.''
 A smart grid, according to advocates, would let consumers take control.
 Smart meters cost $200 or so, compared with well under $100 for the conventional kind, and the new technology, like many kinds of electronics, could become obsolete in a few years. Standard mechanical meters can survive for 20 years or more, one reason public service commissions have been reluctant to let the utilities they regulate install the new ones at customer expense. 
 But a smart grid serves other purposes. Either through a smart meter or directly, the system can also give operators an important tool for balancing supply and demand, especially as supply becomes less predictable. 
 Wind turbines provide little of the grid's electricity today, so if a turbine farm or two are becalmed the grid will barely notice. But if wind provided, for example, 20 percent of the nation's electricity, some grid operators would need a quick way to shed some load, or at least defer it, to cope with calm conditions. With solar power there is an even greater potential need for flexibility: clouds could knock out hundreds of megawatts of supply in a few seconds. 
 Some utilities learned 30 years ago how to shed load without blacking out whole neighborhoods. For example, some have convinced thousands of customers, in exchange for a discounted price on energy, to let the utility put a radio-controlled kill switch on a water heater or a pool pump -- the idea being that most customers would not notice if these devices were shut off for two or three hours. Other utilities take control of central air-conditioners and turn them off for about 15 minutes at a time. 
 But a full-scale smart grid would multiply the possibilities. The messages might go to a person by e-mail, or more likely to a household thermostat or appliance or industrial equipment. The message might be the equivalent of, ''Are you sure you want to run the dishwasher now? You can save money by waiting till tonight.'' 
 The meter could become a participant in the utility's auction, agreeing to turn off certain equipment at the right price. The customer, either by watching that price or programming the appliances, could decide how much to buy, sometimes forgoing a purchase and sometimes delaying it to an hour when energy would probably be cheaper.
 Such a system would require that appliances and other equipment be outfitted with new circuitry -- which might not add much to the cost, but won't happen until there are industry standards. Right now, smart meters being considered or installed by utilities differ in technical details and capabilities. 
 The ''conversation'' would give most consumers their first inside view of the electricity world, with its extreme fluctuations in price. Prices are estimated for each hour of the day, but the actual charge is not always what was estimated, and in off-peak hours in mild weather, prices can be negative -- that is, the utility will pay the customer for using power. (Some power plants are hard to shut down, and their owners would prefer to run them during periods of low demand.)
 Not everyone is confident that the smart grid will work well. ''I think it makes sense, if we can do it economically,'' said Gregory P. Kunkel, vice president for environmental affairs at Tenaska, an Omaha-based energy company. ''But these things are often a lot easier to describe in some theoretical way than to actually implement.'' Getting into tens of millions of houses to evaluate energy efficiency and install equipment is ''just not so easy,'' he said.
 At the Electric Power Research Institute , a utility consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif., Revis James, director of the Energy Technology Assessment Center, said a smart grid could trim peak loads and avoid the need for expensive new ''peaker'' plants, which generate power only at times of high demand. But, he added, ''We don't know for sure how much you can buy through smart grid improvements.'' 
 Mr. Butler, the utility regulator, said smart meters could lead to a revolution in how electricity was provided in the United States, unless they started a revolt among ratepayers first. ''Smart meters are expensive -- rightnow we're talking about approximately $150 to $200 per meter -- so we must be very careful in forcing anyone to upgrade if they are not willing,'' he said in testimony to the Senate energy committee in March. ''A pilot program must be structured in such a way that creates a buzz and excitement, not a ratepayer revolt,'' he said.
 In one such program, in Boulder, Colo., Xcel Energy and its partners have started converting some of the city's roughly 50,000 electric meters to smart meters. The companies plan to convert about half of the meters, and make other changes, at a cost of about $100 million. 
 Dennis L. Arfmann, a lawyer at the Boulder office of Hogan & Hartson who specializes in environmental law, said he had no idea how much electricity he and his wife, Dr. Julie Brown, had used before he filled his roof with solar panels producing 4.5 kilowatts of power. During the day he sells power to Xcel and at night he buys it back; his goal is to cut his use so his net sales rise. He also helped arrange for a smart meter for his office. 
 At home, a smart meter installed by GridPoint, one of the Xcel partners, tells him how much electricity he uses in each 15-minute period, and an e-mail every Sunday tells him how much he used in the preceding week. He bought a meter he could use on individual appliances to tell how much each is using. 
 Xcel does not have time-of-day pricing, but it tells customers that nighttime power is often cheaper for customers over all, and better for the environment. Mr. Arfmann and Dr. Brown do a substantial amount of laundry; she bikes to her dental practice and then changes into the clothes she works in. But they have not shifted their clothes drying to off-peak periods because they have already unplugged the dryer and switched to a clothesline, as part of Mr. Arfmann's campaign to cut his use to below 4,000 kilowatt-hours a year. 
 ''I got into negotiating with my wife for the clothes dryer and the freezer,'' he said. They unplugged the 35-year-old freezer, and now she washes the clothes and he hangs them, he said. ''It's worked out really, really well,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Partnerships Bolster The Big and the Small

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
The eXpresso Corporation, a start-up company in Palo Alto, Calif., followed a well-worn path in technology by aligning with Microsoft, Cisco, Salesforce.com and other big-name companies to market its services.
 ''All of these major corporations, at some point, have a need for new, innovative products and services because they can't develop them all in-house,'' said John Howard, vice president for business development at eXpresso, which offers an online service that allows people to store, edit and share Microsoft Office documents. 
 ''They look to start-ups for the next great things they want to add to their product offerings.''
 In turn, the smaller company can tap into the expansive reach of its bigger partner, which is critical in a downturn, Mr. Howard added. ''We can piggyback to some extent on their marketing power.'' 
 These small-business/big-business partnerships have spread beyond technology and now can be found in every industry, said Steve King, a partner at Emergent Research in Lafayette, Calif.
 In the service industry, for example, Luggage Forward started a white-glove shipping business in 2004 with the help of larger partners like FedEx. This year, it has enjoyed double-digit quarter-to-quarter shipment growth, even in the middle of the economic downturn.
 ''We realized it made a lot more sense to acquire customers with partners than go out and get them one-off,'' said Aaron Kirley, a co-founder.
 In addition to FedEx, Luggage Forward works with U.P.S., DHL and smaller shippers as well as other big global partners like Starwood Hotels. ''We are organically growing the entire shipping industry,'' Mr. Kirley added. ''It's not like we're taking boxes from U.P.S. and giving them to FedEx.''
 FedEx, in turn, has featured Luggage Forward in a direct-mail flier sent to 300,000 small business customers that promotes its rewards program. ''We really do have a tight relationship with them,'' Mr. Kirley said. 
 Denise Yunkun, the FedEx director of small-business marketing, said, ''There's that perception that big companies don't care about small-business customers, and that's not the case.''
 ''Especially the times we are in right now,'' Ms. Yunkun added, ''a lot of huge companies are having problems. Companies are quite aware of the potential and the power small business brings. This is a way that we both grow together.''
 In addition to its rewards program, FedEx has an online center for owners to go for resources and information. Other companies like Intuit, with its Small Business United campaign, and American Express, with its Open Forum, have done the same, according to Anita Campbell, editor of Small Business Trends. 
 ''We've seen this explosion in small community sites and small-business help sites these large companies are putting up,'' she said, with free tools, advice and news.
 ''The whole attitude has changed,'' Ms. Campbell said, ''instead of selling to, marketing to the small business and that being the end of it, now it's much more 'we're standing side-by-side to help you.' ''
 Mr. King of Emergent Research credited Procter & Gamble with spreading the word about strategic partnerships with smaller companies. ''They were so successful with it that lots of companies are doing it,'' Mr. King said, citing Unilever and Kraft, among others.
 Procter & Gamble, an $83.5 billion company, began its Connect and Develop program about eight years ago, according to Jeff LeRoy, external relations manager. 
 The idea, he said, was to look for outside innovators like OneCare, which owned the technology used in the Bounce Roller, a scented lint roller. Butler Home Products took the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser and developed the Magic Eraser Mop. And Sederma helped in developing an anti-aging technology found in Olay Pro-X skin product.
 ''We have 9,300 global researchers, including about 1,100 Ph.D.'s,'' Mr. LeRoy said in an e-mail exchange. ''A few years ago, we estimated there are 1.5 to 2 million scientists and engineers globally in the same fields that we work in. Why not collaborate? That's across 150 areas of science.
 ''So the search has been on to find them, their companies, their universities, and accelerate our own innovation,'' he said. ''It's been a great success. We have about 1,000 active contracts under management now and in 2007 opened a new Web site for innovators to contact us -- www.pgconnectdevelop.com. 
 To be sure, there will always be David versus Goliath when it comes to small concerns pitting themselves against industry giants, but larger companies tend to migrate toward innovators.
 ''In the next decade, small businesses will embrace innovation even more broadly than they do today,'' according to the Intuit Future of Small Business Report released in March. Mr. King co-wrote the report with Carolyn Ockels, managing partner at Emergent Research.
 And innovators may well lead the country out of recession, they wrote. ''Small businesses react quickly to changing economic conditions and their owners have a can-do attitude, enduring and even creating opportunity out of adversity,'' they said.
 Still, Mr. LeRoy of Procter & Gamble said, the hurdles are high for those innovators to tap into its huge network.
 ''We get about 300 submissions a month,'' he said, ''About 40 percent of those pass the initial screening level for interest. Less than 5 percent, however, will end in deals,'' he added. ''It's about finding the right partner, the right culture fit, the right needs.''
 What's more, trying to score a big-time deal is ''a high-risk, high-reward strategy,'' Mr. King said. ''If you win, you win big, but you have to be ready that it will not work out at all.''
 Mr. Howard of eXpresso said timing and patience were crucial to making the partnership pay long-term dividends. Most big companies have programs aimed at smaller partners, he said. His company was selected for Microsoft's Accelerator start-up program, for example.
 ''If you can get in early enough to that partner program, where you stand out and you can help them with some high-value application or niche that they haven't built yet, it's worth looking at those programs,'' Mr. Howard said. If you wait too long, you lose that chance to be noticed.
 Once a small company is in the right program, he added, then it is a matter of adjusting to working in a larger bureaucracy. ''You have to set your expectations differently. As a start-up, we're used to running fast, turning on a dime, making decisions quickly.''
 Integration can take a toll on a smaller company, Mr. Howard added. ''You can't expect to produce revenue in 60 days. You have to mentally prepare yourself for that.''

HEADLINE: MGM Mirage Reaches Deal On Project In Las Vegas

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
MGM Mirage and Dubai World said on Wednesday that they had reached an agreement with lenders on a plan to fully finance their $8.5 billion CityCenter venture on the Las Vegas Strip. 
 The deal comes after Dubai World, which is owned by the government of Dubai, filed suit against MGM last month, claiming mismanagement of the project in which it has so far invested $4.3 billion. The lawsuit has now been dismissed.
 ''Dubai World was concerned that the problems MGM was having at the corporate level would spill over into CityCenter,'' an analyst at Susquehanna Financial, Robert LaFleur, said. ''This clears the way for CityCenter to get completed and opened by the end of year.''
 MGM said it had also amended its senior credit facility, including a waiver through June 30 of financial covenant requirements and leverage restrictions. Lenders were repaid $100 million and MGM gave them security interests in the Gold Strike Tunica resort in Mississippi and undeveloped Las Vegas Strip land.
 MGM Grand Detroit has also granted lenders a security interest in its assets, the company said.
 Under the new plan, Dubai World and MGM will finance their remaining equity contributions to CityCenter through letters of credit. Dubai World has also agreed to repay $135 million to MGM in construction payments the casino operator had made on its behalf.
 In addition, CityCenter's lenders, led by the Bank of America Corporation, will immediately finance a $1.8 billion senior secured credit facility, for which the interest rate was increased by two percentage points.
 MGM said it would be responsible for completion costs to the extent that CityCenter's net condominium proceeds are less than $243 million and for completion costs over the current budget of $8.5 billion.
 Until the project's completion, MGM said, any obligations it has with respect to additional construction costs will be secured by the assets of its Circus Circus Las Vegas resort and adjacent land.

HEADLINE: Altering Planes, and the Way They Fly, to Save Fuel

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
FOR the aviation industry, its fate inextricably linked to the price of oil, fuel conservation is more than environmentally sound -- it's a matter of survival. That is why, in research labs and in airline conference rooms, any measure is open for discussion if it reduces the use of fuel. 
 ''Fuel economy and carbon emissions are exactly the same thing,'' said Alan Epstein, vice president for technology and the environment at Pratt & Whitney, the jet engine manufacturer. ''If you want to reduce carbon emissions, you reduce the fuel consumption.'' 
The most significant improvements come from broad changes in the way planes fly. Using global positioning information, airliners fly shorter, more direct routes to destinations rather than following rigid paths that can take them miles out of the way as they move from one ground-based radar beacon to another. Special landing procedures called continuous descent approaches let pilots reduce fuel to the engines to the idle setting as they begin their descent.
 ''The ultimate goal is to be able to push back, roll to the runway, take off and land and go to the gate, all without ever having to hit the brakes,'' said Bob Smith, vice president of advanced technologies for Honeywell Aerospace in Phoenix. ''If you can get that level of sophistication in the system, that's a big deal.''
 It's a big deal because these kinds of operational changes affect an airline's costs. In the past four years, fuel has surpassed labor as the airlines' largest operating expense, so conservation efforts are bound to have an impact.
 Environmental benefits are secondary but significant. In the United States, commercial aviation accounts for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Air Transport Association, an industry group. 
 On a recent trial flight, Southwest Airlines used satellite navigation and continuous descent approaches on a round trip between Dallas and Houston and determined it could reduce fuel consumption by 6 percent. 
 ''If we were able to reduce and get 6 percent savings across all our flights, that would equal 90 million gallons a year in fuel reduction and a reduction in carbon emissions of 1.9 billion pounds,'' said Jeff Martin, Southwest's senior director of flight operations.
 Nancy Young, vice president of environmental affairs for the Air Transport Association, said that changing from a radar-based system to a satellite-based one was ''a big, big thing.'' 
 But incorporating the new flights into an older traffic infrastructure takes time. Air traffic control centers and airlines are in transition, with some updating equipment faster than others. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, about 80 percent of American airliners have the necessary devices.
 Brian Will, program manager for American Airlines and a pilot, said the agency needed to do more to reward companies that make an investment in new technology. Air traffic control ''is compelled to maintain a system that will accommodate everybody,'' he said. ''In my opinion, this is a mistake.'' 
 The aviation authority is considering ways to expedite satellite-guided planes through the system. ''Clearly there is a policy that we're looking at right now to try and improve our delivery of services to those who are better equipped,'' said Carl E. Burleson, the F.A.A.'s deputy acting administrator for policy planning and the environment.
 If America's air traffic infrastructure wasn't so well established, it might be more nimble. Instead, less developed countries seem to be adapting faster, according to one industry expert.
 ''You'll see this first in places like China; they're leapfrogging a generation of technology,'' said Ken Shapero, director of marketing communications for Naverus, an advanced navigation company in Kent, Wash. ''But in the U.S., so much investment and infrastructure is in the old ways of doing things.''
 Since fuel is consumed in the engine, manufacturers are eager to develop new models. Mr. Epstein of Pratt & Whitney said that 20 years ago, when jet fuel was less expensive, the company spent $1 billion inventing a gear to allow the engine fan to run at a slower speed than the turbine so that each part could work most effectively. That technology, called PurePower, had its first sale last month, when the Canadian aircraft maker Bombardier bought Pratt & Whitney's engine for its CSeries airliners, which the company trumpets with the slogan ''New Planet New Plane.'' 
 Mr. Epstein said that when the work began, he didn't know what its environmental impact would be. ''We weren't ahead thinking about carbon but we were thinking about fuel,'' he said.
 A plane's design and the weight it carries also contribute to fuel consumption, which is why jetliners like the CSeries, Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 are being made from lighter-than-metal composite materials. Planes already in service are undergoing expensive modifications to take advantage of new knowledge about aerodynamic efficiency.
 In Kansas City, Mo., mechanics at American Airlines are making an extensive after-market change to many planes in their fleet by installing 11-foot vertical panels called winglets on the wingtips of 58 long-range Boeing 767's. The winglets reduce drag and increase the amount of weight the plane can carry by 12,000 pounds, increasing the profit-making potential of those flights. 
 Other airlines are adding winglets to their airplanes for a fuel savings that can be as much as half a million gallons per plane a year, said Patrick LaMoria, vice president of sales and marketing at Aviation Partners Boeing, in Seattle, the designer of the winglets. Winglets for the 767 can take a month to install and cost nearly $2 million per plane, he said.
 Environmental concerns even extend to contrails, the white streams of condensation that trail the engine, as cooling exhaust gases freeze into ice crystals. These wispy clouds can remain in the atmosphere for up to eight hours, and studies have shown that they could be altering the earth's temperature. On the list of priorities, contrails rank below anything else that saves fuel, money or greenhouse gas emissions.
 ''People are studying how to eliminate contrails,'' Mr. Epstein said. ''And if I could eliminate them for free I would, but if there's a cost, particularly in carbon, you'd better understand the relative importance.''

HEADLINE: Clean Tech's Future Dims As Financing Drops Off

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
OVER the past few years, as venture capitalists poured money into solar companies and green technology start-ups, the mood in Silicon Valley resembled the sunny days of the dot-com boom in the late 1990s. 
 All that changed this winter. Now, venture capitalists are backing off, leaving some clean-tech entrepreneurs wondering whether the next few years will feel more like the dreary days following the dot-com bust.
 During the first quarter of 2009, investment in green technologies by venture capitalists, who drive a disproportionate amount of financing in new technologies, shriveled. 
 In the first quarter of this year, they invested only $154 million in 33 young companies, a drop of 84 percent from the last quarter of 2008 when, despite the crumbling economy, they invested $971 million in 67 start-ups, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association. Investment in the first quarter of 2009 reached the lowest level since 2005, before clean technology became Silicon Valley's newest new trend. 
 This reversal has led to a debate about whether market forces see little future for alternative energy and other green technologies on a large scale, or whether the economic downturn is taking its toll on this industry as well.
 The debate comes down to this: has the green bubble burst? 
 ''We were in the typical hype cycle -- a green-tech investment can do no wrong, therefore incredible dollars were pulled in, even in business models that made no sense,'' said Michael L. Goguen, a venture capitalist who focuses on clean-tech investments at Sequoia Capital, in Menlo Park, Calif. ''When the credit crunch happened and the economy took a nose dive, the brakes screeched on.'' 
 Mark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, prefers to call the clean-tech investment cycle ''an education curve.'' 
 Still, he said, ''if the industry has gotten one criticism year after year, it's that we have a lemming mentality, and solar probably represents that in the clean-tech space.'' 
 In recent years investment in solar companies fueled the rapid growth in clean technology. Now, venture capitalists' wariness of solar companies is driving the drop-off in financing. 
 According to PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association, in the first quarter of 2009, only two solar companies raised money through venture capital -- a total of $14 million, just 9 percent of clean-tech investment in the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2008, 12 solar firms raised a total of $460 million, accounting for half of clean-tech investment. 
 The biggest venture capital deal of any technology sector in the fourth quarter of 2008 was for Solyndra, a company in Fremont, Calif., that makes photovoltaic rooftop systems. It raised $219 million in its fourth round of financing. CaliSolar, a solar cell manufacturer in Sunnyvale, Calif., raised $52 million in the tenth biggest deal of the quarter. In the first quarter of 2009, though, there were no clean-tech deals in the top 10 of all venture capital investments. 
 Some investors say it is unlikely that investment in solar companies will return at the same level, even if the economy improves. 
 ''Would I invest in solar today? No, unless it were very, very disruptive and had potential for really changing the landscape,'' said Steve Vassallo, a principal at Foundation Capital, a venture firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that is investing a $750 million fund, about a quarter of which is going to clean tech. 
 Instead, clean-tech investing will be in new areas when it comes back, many venture capitalists said. Already, companies that make batteries and water-treatment equipment are drawing investment. Many investors also intend to focus on more capital-efficient projects. 
 Though investment in all major technology sectors posted double-digit declines in the first quarter of 2009, clean tech's descent was the sharpest. How could a sector rising so quickly drop off so precipitously? 
 ''Venture capitalists became conservative in the first quarter, and a clean-tech deal is not a conservative deal,'' Mr. Heesen said. ''It's pushing the envelope in technology.'' But he said he was confident that investment would return. ''One quarter does not make a trend,'' he said. 
 David J. Prend, managing general partner at RockPort Capital in Boston and Menlo Park, Calif., said that the promise of big returns prompted too much ''me-too investing,'' when venture capitalists put money into start-ups that do the same work as other companies. 
 ''There was probably some stuff that shouldn't have been funded,'' he said. ''It's kind of good for some of that to get washed out.'' For clean tech to be a viable industry, investment should not return to recent highs, he said. 
 Mr. Vassallo blamed the credit crunch for the decline in clean-tech investing. More than half of clean-tech investments have been in alternative energy like solar and biofuels, which typically require building big factories. These projects depend on capital like project finance loans as well as tax equity investments, whereby corporations back green energy projects and reap the tax credits. These have been ''frozen or completely disintegrated,'' he said. 
 One of his firm's investments, SunRun, a home solar service company in San Francisco, raised $105 million in tax equity in October. ''It felt like we were the last helicopter out of Saigon,'' he said. ''It was scary.'' 
 The pullback of venture capitalists is happening just as the Obama administration begins funneling money to clean-tech companies. 
 That could cause investing to pick up again now -- but that's not necessarily welcome news to all. ''I'm afraid it will swing too far to the positive,'' said Mr. Goguen of Sequoia Capital. ''Slamming on the brakes was a good, healthy thing. It served a Darwinian function. Now we just have to be careful we don't swing back to the hype side.'' 
 Some are relying on Washington to create an environment in which clean technology can thrive again. Otherwise, badly needed innovation in alternative energy could stall, they say. 
 ''As early stage funding dries up, how is all this innovation in academia and government labs going to reach commercial potential?'' asked Noubar Afeyan, chief executive of Flagship Ventures in Cambridge, Mass. ''If this persists for several quarters, it certainly is going to set us back in terms of having viable energy solutions at a time when we need them.''

HEADLINE: '09ers Take a Turn As '49ers

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
HERE is just one measure of how severe the impact of the recession has been on New Yorkers' shopping habits: In March 2008, 24,000 potential customers walked through the doors of the four Olive & Bette's stores in Manhattan. In March 2009, there were 6,000. 
 ''When you are watching your sales fall off a cliff, you've got to feel like you can control at least something,'' said Stacey Pecor, who opened the first of her zippy sportswear boutiques 17 years ago and had seen nothing but sales increases -- until last October, that is, when they started falling by 40 percent or more. ''Our job now has to be to get more bodies through the door.''
 You may have noticed some strange offers to entice you to shop, like last month at the Tibi store in SoHo, where adoptable puppies and kittens were an adorable lure, or starting May 1 at Aldo, where men who purchase $70 worth of shoes can get a free pair of flip-flops. Ms. Pecor had another idea. 
 On Tuesday afternoon at her Madison Avenue store, customers could sell unwanted jewelry to a licensed gold buyer -- who would weigh it, test it and issue a check on the spot -- and then shop for something new. The first to try this happened to be named Michaela D. Gold, a vice president at Halstead Property, whose daughter works for Ms. Pecor. Ms. Gold traded a necklace and a mismatched earring, totaling 14.4 grams of 14 karat gold, for $154. 
 ''You know the sock monster?'' she asked. ''It's the same with earrings. I think every woman has at least a half-dozen earrings without a match.''
 Adrienne Nagy, a guidance counselor at the nearby Loyola School, handed over a thin gold chain with a pendant of stones that could have been rubies or could have been glass. She didn't appear to care much, either way.
 ''The day my boyfriend gave me this was the day we broke up,'' she said.
 The gift was, how shall we say, a little light. Weighing in at 1.6 grams, the chain garnered an offer of only $10.80.
 ''I'll take it,'' Ms. Nagy said. 
 While not exactly a gold rush, the store was hopping, and Ms. Pecor was prospecting for customers.
 ''We're going to be fine,'' she said. ''I just want to keep them shopping -- from me.''

LOCKHEED MARTIN is best known for building stealth fighters, satellites and other military equipment. But since late 2006 the company has taken on a different kind of enterprise -- generating renewable power from the ocean. 
 The technology is still being developed in the laboratory, but if it succeeds on a large scale, it could eventually become an important tool in the nation's battle against global warming and dependency on foreign oil.
Lockheed and a few other companies are pursuing ocean thermal energy conversion, which uses the difference in temperature between the ocean's warm surface and its chilly depths to generate electricity. 
 Experts say that the balmy waters off Hawaii and Puerto Rico, as well as near United States military bases on islands like Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean or Guam in the Pacific, would be good sites for developing this type of energy.
 Hawaii and many other islands rely on imported oil to generate most of their electricity, which is expensive, and last year's spikes in oil prices have reinvigorated their search for homegrown alternatives.
 ''The vagaries of petroleum impact Hawaii far more than any other state,'' said Theodore Peck, an energy administrator in the state's department of business, economic development and tourism. Generating energy from the ocean's temperature variations, he added, is ''a natural for Hawaii.''
 The Navy is also interested in the technology and in the next few months plans to award a contract to explore it, according to Whit DeLoach, a spokesman for the Naval Facilities Engineering Command. As of last year, he said, the Navy had spent slightly more than $1 million to research the technology for Diego Garcia.
 In the approach that Lockheed is pursuing (with another company, Makai Ocean Engineering), the water on the ocean's surface is used to heat a pressurized liquid, usually ammonia, which boils at a temperature slightly below that of warm seawater. That liquid becomes gas, which powers a turbine generator. Cold water is then pumped from the ocean's depths through a giant pipe to condense the gas back into a liquid, and the cycle is repeated.
 An important advantage of this method of producing energy is that it could run all the time, unlike solar plants, which cannot work at night, or wind turbines, which stop in calm conditions.
 But the technology is expensive and can work in only a limited number of places, like the tropics, where there is a large difference in temperature between the ocean's layers. This excludes many major population centers, although proponents hope that Florida and the Gulf Coast could also be markets. (Other types of ocean energy being explored would harness the tides and waves.)
 Meanwhile, Lockheed is developing a test cold-water pipe -- to be 13 feet in diameter and 40 feet long -- in a laboratory in Sunnyvale, Calif. 
 Last year, Gov. Linda Lingle of Hawaii announced a partnership between Lockheed and the Industrial Technology Research Institute in Taiwan to build a test plant in Hawaii.
 Lockheed says it hopes to obtain financing for the project from the Defense and Energy Departments, as well as from the private sector; if enough is available, the company says it would like to have the platform working by 2013. A Japanese engineering company, Xenesys, is also exploring ocean thermal energy for Cuba and Tahiti, among other countries.
 Lockheed and the federal government have worked on this type of energy before, after the 1970s oil crises. In 1979, a 50-kilowatt test project was briefly run off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island. Financing for ocean-energy projects was slashed significantly by the Reagan administration, and Lockheed abandoned its pursuit of the technology in the mid-1980s.
 Proponents say that since the last attempt to develop it, the technology has improved enormously. Offshore oil platforms similar to the platforms needed for the ocean energy system have become more sophisticated, for example in their ability to withstand hurricanes and to moor in deeper water.
 In theory the technology could, among other uses, provide substantial amounts of power to Hawaii and other warm-water sites and also be used in floating power plants making industrial products like ammonia. However, such goals are distant. 
 Skeptics say that the technology is highly inefficient because it requires large amounts of energy to pump the cold water through the system.
 Patricia Tummons, who edits the newsletter Environment Hawaii, said a major question about the technology was ''just how economical it can be.''
 Robert Varley, who is helping to lead Lockheed's efforts, estimated that just 3.5 percent of the potential energy from the warm water pumped might actually be used. ''In reality that doesn't matter -- the fuel is free,'' he said.
 But building and operating the platform will be costly. Harry Jackson, the president of Ocees International, an engineering firm based in Honolulu also working on the technology, estimated that a test plant of the size Hawaii is planning -- which is still far smaller than commercial scale -- would cost $150 million to $250 million.
 Some environmental groups are cautiously embracing the technology as one of many approaches that could help reduce fossil fuel consumption and thus combat climate change.
 ''The environmental impacts associated with it would be probably a lot less than other sorts of power,'' said Henry Curtis, executive director of Life of the Land, an environmental group in Hawaii.
 Still, the technology would not leave its surroundings unscathed. A huge amount of cold water would have to be pumped up from the depths. If that water, which is rich in nutrients, is discharged into a different part of the ocean, it could confuse fish and alter the balance of the ecosystem.
 Mr. Varley of Lockheed also said that the warm water must be siphoned in slowly enough so that fish could swim away.
 ''We'll have to put up screens, of course, on the intakes of the warm water so we don't suck in marine mammals,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Name Hurts Main Unit Of A.I.G.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Less than two months after changing its name, the biggest and best-known unit of American International Group is preparing to change its name again, in the latest sign of damage to one of the world's most famous brands.
 A.I.G. changed the name of the worldwide holding company for its property and casualty unit to American International Underwriters in early March. 
 The renamed A.I.U. quickly began issuing new business cards to employees and printing promotional materials, particularly in Asia. But A.I.G. has now decided that the A.I.U. name does not represent enough of a change, and is in the final stages of choosing a new one, said Leslie J. Mouat, A.I.U.'s regional president for Southeast Asia. 
 ''The advice we've received is A.I.U. may be a bit close to A.I.G. -- we don't want to appear as the same leopard with different spots,'' Mr. Mouat said in an interview, adding that he was told only Saturday of the decision to change the name again, which has not been publicly announced. 
 A.I.U. has stayed profitable even as derivatives trading by a small A.I.G. unit in London has left A.I.G. struggling. A.I.G. has received a series of government bailouts and led to the United States government owning nearly 80 percent of the company.
 A small committee of company executives has narrowed down a list of potential names to two or three, Mr. Mouat said. The committee is researching how those names will be received in the 130 countries and jurisdictions in which A.I.U. does business. It is trying to figure out the legal issues involved in a name change as well as how consumers might receive the new name.
 Mr. Mouat added that he was not on the committee and did not know if the new name would even include ''American.'' 
 Big companies that change their names often choose new words, like the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, which decided in 1972 to become Exxon and replaced names like Esso, Humble and Enco.
 The decision to abandon the A.I.U. name represents a setback for the company's huge operation in Asia, which dominates the region's property and casualty insurance market, and a victory for the company's units elsewhere, particularly in the United States.
 The offices outside Asia never agreed to use the A.I.U. name with consumers. They thought it sounded too much like A.I.G. But the Asian offices lobbied for A.I.U., partly because it was the original name for A.I.G. when it was founded in Shanghai in 1919. 
 The name had just been abandoned in mainland China in favor of the A.I.G. name when the company found itself enveloped by a series of crises last autumn. (The property and casualty business in Hong Kong and Indonesia never stopped using A.I.U.)
 The repeated name changes come as A.I.U. defends the company's once unassailable position as Asia's leading insurer. Rivals have been seeking to lure away customers and employees.
 Mr. Mouat said that 94 percent of customers in Southeast Asia were staying with the company. But mainly because of the global economic slowdown, net written premiums in Southeast Asia were down 4 percent in the first quarter compared with a year ago and are down 7 percent in the current quarter from a year ago. 
 A.I.G. is in the process of disentangling the call centers, offices and other intertwined operations of its two biggest business units -- the property and casualty unit and the life insurance unit -- with the goal of eventually conducting separate initial public offerings for each. The life insurance unit does business under many names around the world that do not sound much like A.I.G., and they are not likely to change their names, Mr. Mouat said.
 A.I.G.'s struggle to come up with a new name also underlines the complexities that big companies face in rebranding a well-known product.
 Tom Doctoroff, the Shanghai-based chief executive for North Asia at JWT, the advertising agency, said that A.I.U. would need to define clearly how it wants to change its image before introducing the new name. ''There's no magic solution for this,'' he said. ''This is a name in search of a strategy.'' 
 Contemplating the marketing strategy of the rebranded company, Mr. Mouat, A.I.U.'s regional president for Southeast Asia, said, ''I suspect it'll be something like, 'a brand new insurance company is coming to Asia, it's one you've known for the past 90 years.' ''
 When Standard Oil of New Jersey became Exxon, it reintroduced the Esso tiger in its advertising as the Exxon tiger, and used the slogan, ''We're changing our name but not our stripes.''
 Standard Oil wanted to do business under a single name, but lacked nationwide rights to the Standard Oil name.
 Fully introducing a new name for A.I.G. around the world could take a year. The company is still paying to use the old A.I.G. name on the jerseys of the Manchester United football team, and is unlikely to have a new name ready for the jerseys in time for the next season even though this means that marketing dollars will go to waste promoting a brand that is disappearing, Mr. Mouat said.

HEADLINE: Recession Has Left Health Agencies Weakened in Swine Flu Fight, Officials Say

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
The recession has drained hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of workers from the state and local health departments that are now the front line in the country's defense against a possible swine flu pandemic. 
 Health officials in affected states said they had thus far been able to manage the testing and treatment of infected residents and mount vigorous public education campaigns. But many said they had been able to do so only by shifting workers from other public health priorities, and some questioned how their depleted departments might handle a pandemic.
 ''I'm very concerned,'' said Robert M. Pestronk, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. ''Local health departments are barely staffed to do the work they do on a day-to-day basis. A large increase in workload will mean that much of the other work that is being done now won't be done. And depending on the scale of an epidemic, capacity may be exceeded.'' 
 At a news conference on Monday, Dr. Richard E. Besser, the acting director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the public health system was in ''a tough situation.''
 ''We hear about tens of thousands of state public health workers who are going to be losing their jobs because of state budgets,'' Dr. Besser said. ''It is very important that we look at that resource because this outbreak was identified because of a lot of work going on around preparedness.''
 Mr. Pestronk's group estimates that local health departments lost about $300 million in financing and 7,000 workers in 2008, a year when more than half of all agencies shed employees. There were about 160,000 health department workers in 2005, according to the group. Mr. Pestronk said he expected to lose at least another 7,000 jobs this year.
 State public health agencies lost an additional 1,500 workers through layoffs and attrition from July 2008 to January 2009, according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. The group anticipates 2,600 job losses in the coming fiscal year.
 South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, which also staffs local health departments, has lost $30 million in state money and a third of its 6,000 employees over the last decade, said Thom W. Berry, a spokesman. The department is currently investigating several ''probable'' cases of swine flu.
 In New York City, which has the highest concentration of confirmed flu cases, federal grants for emergency preparedness have fallen to $23 million, from $28 million a year ago, said Andrew S. Rein, the city health department's executive deputy commissioner. 
 In California, which has 14 confirmed cases, the Department of Public Health recently absorbed a 10 percent budget cut ordered by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to help close a huge budget gap. It did so without laying off workers, instead reducing grants to local health departments, said Dr. Bonnie Sorensen, the chief deputy director of policy and programs. During the flu scare, about 100 state health workers have been diverted from other duties, Dr. Sorensen said.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency that calls for all California agencies to assist the health department. It gave the department special powers to enter into contracts, suspend competitive bidding and waive certification requirements for laboratories. The federal disease control agency has shipped equipment and chemicals used to test for swine flu to California so the state can hasten its laboratory work without sending samples elsewhere. 
 ''The bottom line is, we are prepared,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said this week. 
 The White House asked Congress on Tuesday to provide $1.5 billion in emergency financing to battle the swine flu outbreak, but it is not clear how that money might flow downstream.
 Public health officials said Congress had missed an opportunity by excising nearly $900 million in proposed financing for pandemic flu preparation from this year's stimulus bill. It was to be the final installment of President George W. Bush's request for $7 billion in federal spending on vaccines, medical equipment and planning. Congress last allocated money for pandemic planning by state and local governments in 2006 -- about $600 million over two years, said Dr. Paul E. Jarris, executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
 ''The entire system is lining up to decrease resources at the time we need them most,'' Dr. Jarris said. ''We have to realize that we're at the starting line. The stress will come if this escalates.''
 Jeffrey Levi, executive director of the Trust for America's Health, said the financial strain made ''it more important that we luck out'' with a mild outbreak.
 Dr. Alvin D. Jackson, the state health director in Ohio, which has one confirmed case of swine flu, said his agency's state appropriation had declined by about $10 million over the last two years. Dr. Jackson said his budget to prepare communities and hospitals for an influenza pandemic had dropped to $34 million, from $55 million in 2004. 
 ''Right now we're O.K.,'' he said. ''We feel that we can do an excellent job protecting our citizens. But looking forward, we do understand that some additional resources would be appreciated.''
 In Cleveland, Dr. Terry Allan, the Cuyahoga County health commissioner, said the decline in state and federal money had prompted a 25 percent cut in spending on pandemic preparedness over the last two years. That had cost the department at least 10 workers, Dr. Allan said, and further cuts are expected.
 ''Those are people we would have had available to expand and build on our plans for social distancing, for mobilizing antivirals,'' Dr. Allan said. ''Our plan is not adequate. It's barely started.''

HEADLINE: A Clean Energy Machine That Works Like the Sun

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
WHAT could be the world's most expensive clean energy project is under way in a quiet corner of southern France.
China, the United States, Japan and the European Union have committed billions of dollars to construction of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or ITER, in a heavily forested corner of Provence called Cadarache that is a center for atomic research.
 The goal is to prove that energy can be generated through nuclear fusion -- a process akin to how light and heat are produced by the sun. The promise is virtually unlimited amounts of energy from abundantly available sources. 
 Fusion creates no greenhouse gases and produces far less hazardous waste than fission, the current nuclear process, although fusion reactors do become radioactive and waste would still require special disposal.
 If successful, the concept is not expected to be commercially viable until midcentury. There has already been a two-year delay because of difficulties setting up an international organization for the project.
 Rising costs for equipment could further complicate relations among the participants, which include South Korea, India and Russia.
 Even so, scientists say an international approach is critical.
 ''No one nation can develop fusion alone,'' said Pascal Garin, the project leader at the International Fusion Material Irradiation Facility in Japan, which is helping to develop materials for the reactor. ''The technical and economic challenges are enormous compared with other low-emissions technologies like solar power or conventional nuclear power.'' The original budget, set in 2001, was about $10 billion, to be spent over 30 years. About half that amount was to be spent by participating governments on national projects to build components for the reactor.
 That budget is being revised because prices of crucial commodities like steel and copper have soared, and because features are being added to the original design to help to ensure that the experiment works.
 The seven parties are expected to decide on a new amount, which could be significantly higher, and on how to share the burden of paying for it, at meetings in June and November, said Neil Calder, a spokesman for the ITER Organization.
 The parties are also expected to decide this year whether Kazakhstan, which offers nuclear expertise, and mineral and oil wealth, will join the organization, Mr. Calder said.
 While adding another country could help defray the costs borne by each member, it also could make the project even more complicated.
 The United States has already spent about $27 million to finance the ITER Organization, which is responsible for the construction and safe operation of the reactor, according to the Department of Energy. The country's total contribution to the project will be $1.45 billion to $2.2 billion over the next decade, the department said.
 The European Commission, which is the union's executive body here in Brussels, said the 27 member nations and Switzerland had committed to spend about 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) on ITER over the next five years, but that sum could rise sharply.
 Over all, the European Union is supposed to contribute most of the costs, or more than 45 percent of the total, in exchange for locating the project in France. The agreement consists of funds contributed by the union and Japan totaling about 700 million euros. 
 So far, experimental fusion reactors have required more energy to operate than they have produced. ITER and the project in Japan are supposed to prove that fusion could be much more than a drain on the grid.
 Nuclear plants now generate power through fission, splitting heavy uranium atoms. Fusion involves heating very lightweight hydrogen atoms to about 100 million degrees Celsius -- or about 10 times the temperature of the sun.
 This process creates a so-called plasma gas in which normally repelling particles combine and yield vast amounts of additional energy. By confining the hot plasma with the use of powerful magnets, the scientists aim to keep the process going in much the same way that the sun, confined by gravity, continues to burn.
 Scientists say the heat from fusion could be used to drive electrical turbines with steam.
 Scientists already know how to make a reactor like ITER work, but they say they need to conduct about 15 years of experiments once the machine is built to learn how to keep it running and to test materials under extreme conditions.
 Keeping the financing going over that period could be a challenge as governments and priorities change. Experts also warn that nations like China, keen on developing their own fusion industries, could eventually split from the group.
 The project is a vast undertaking. In March, the authorities at Cadarache finished clearing and flattening a forested area the size of 70 football fields where the reactor will be built. The foundation will be laid in September and shortly after construction should begin on dozens of other buildings where huge components like magnets, each weighing several tons, will be assembled.
 By 2018, the machine should be ready.
 Scientists then would spend the next decade or so trying to create bursts of power of up to 500 megawatts for several minutes at a time, and experimenting with the plasma gas.
 Critics say that if the primary purpose of the ITER venture is to create large supplies of emissions-free electricity to mitigate climate change, then the money would be better invested in existing technologies like wind and solar power, which have been proven and are ready for deployment.
 But defenders of the project say the total that will be spent on ITER and its associated projects is small when compared with what some companies would spend on research and development for consumer goods, like new car models, over the same time frame.
 Defenders also liken the project to the NASA space program, which yielded spinoff technologies that benefit other industries.
 European Union officials said that work on the reactor could lead to a host of breakthroughs, including the development of new coatings that perform well under very high temperatures, as well as new designs for microchips.

BRONX-WHITESTONE 
 Spans 70 Years
 After just 22 months of construction -- and at a cost of $18 million -- the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge opened to traffic 70 years ago, rushed to completion for the start of the New York World's Fair. 
 Previewing the opening ceremony in 1939, The New York Times wrote: ''The bridge's freedom from heavy structural lines and ornamentation gives a breathtaking grace to the 2,300-foot center span and 3,770-foot overall length.'' Officials from M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels, the arm of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that which operates the bridge, observed the anniversary with statements.
 ''Our bridge occupies an especially noteworthy place in New York City history,'' said Susan Kupferman, president of M.T.A. Bridges and Tunnels. ''In the first year of operation, 6 million vehicles used the bridge; in 2008 there were 43 million crossings. ''
 The bridge is used by about 120,000 drivers each day.
 In 1946, stiffening trusses were added to the edges of the bridge deck to improve stability and guard against high winds; the original walkway was removed, and the roadway widened to six lanes, three in each direction.
 To lighten the load on the bridge, the heavy trusses were removed in 2004 and lightweight V-shaped wind fairings were installed, improving the bridge's aerodynamics and appearance. And in 2007, the original concrete roadway was replaced with a stronger and lighter steel orthotropic deck.
 Other improvements occurred this year, transit officials noted: the repainting of the 377-foot-high towers, main cables and suspender ropes, and the installation of tower floodlights. And the bridge is undergoing a major reconstruction of its Bronx approach, including the deck, foundations and piers.

 You're Not From Here: When a Bronx woman came home on Tuesday, she had an unusual visitor: a 30-inch, 60-pound tortoise. An escapee of the Bronx Zoo? No; officials there had all their tortoises accounted for. The current theory is that the sulcata tortoise, indigenous to Africa, is a lost pet. On Wednesday evening, someone showed up claiming to be the tortoise's owner, according to workers at Animal Care and Control, who had named it Shelly.
 More Street Vending? Even as demand has surged, the number of city street vending licenses for food and merchandise has been capped at fewer than 4,000 for decades, though 1,000 new permits for fruit and vegetable vendors were introduced last year. Now, in a move that some say may help alleviate the city's unemployment rate, City Council members have proposed lifting the number of licenses to 15,000 and food vending to 25,000. 
 Handguns to Coat Hangers: At its latest gun buyback program in the Bronx, the Police Department collected 987 weapons in six hours, said Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly -- the most ever since the program started last year.
 The weapons, collected at churches, will be melted down into wire clothes hangers, Mr. Kelly said, offering a biblical reference: ''You might say we are beating our swords into plowshares, spears into pruning hooks and handguns into hangers.''

HEADLINE: Fed Cites Easing of Decline and Affirms Policy

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On a day when the government reported another chilling plunge in economic activity, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it saw tentative signs of stabilization but vowed to keep pumping out money at full speed for the foreseeable future.
 The central bank made no changes to its existing policies, all of which are intended to prop up the ailing credit markets and the economy by creating vast amounts of new money and lending it out through more than a half-dozen special programs.
 As expected, the central bank said it would continue to keep the benchmark interest rate -- the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks -- at virtually zero for ''an extended period.'' It also maintained its previously announced program to buy up mortgage-backed securities and Treasury bonds without changes. 
 In a statement accompanying its decision, the Fed said that ''the economy has continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower.'' It also said that household spending appeared to be stabilizing but it cautioned that consumers would be held back as the economy continued to shed jobs.
 The Fed had already reduced the overnight rate to almost zero in December, and it cannot reduce it any further. But with the economy still shrinking and the nation losing more than 600,000 jobs a month, the big question before its policy meeting this week was whether the Fed would expand its unconventional efforts to stoke the economy by simply increasing the supply of money.
 In March, Fed officials announced that they would buy up to $1.25 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities and bonds issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage finance companies. The Fed also surprised investors by announcing that it would buy up to $300 billion in longer-term Treasury securities. 
 Both of those efforts, which the Fed finances by printing more money, were intended to push down long-term interest rates, especially for home mortgages but also for other kinds of borrowing. In buying Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, the Fed activity pushes up bond prices and pushes down the yield, or interest rate, that investors have to accept.
 In recent weeks, the pressure on the Fed has eased slightly. Fed officials have reported some signs that the housing market might finally be close to hitting bottom. Though housing prices are still declining, the latest data suggest that the decline has slowed. Homeowners, meanwhile, are racing to take advantage of lower borrowing rates to refinance their existing mortgages.
 On Wednesday, hours before the Fed announced its decision, the Commerce Department reported that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 6.1 percent in the first three months of this year -- the second huge quarterly decline in a row. 
 But many economists said the decline, while steeper than expected, contained glimmers of good news. Consumer spending was stronger than expected, and much of the decline stemmed from a sharp drop in company inventories. A drop in inventories signals that demand for goods is outpacing production, and it often leads to an increase in production as manufacturers try to catch up.
 Fed officials have made it clear they have no intention on backing down yet on their efforts to spur demand with easy money. At best, Fed officials are hoping that the economy stops contracting later this year and begins what they expect will be a weak revival. 
 Even if that happens, Fed officials are expecting unemployment to rise through the end of this year, and to climb above 9 percent before its starts to decline. With inflation all but nonexistent, Fed officials have concluded that they can keep their policies in place for some time before having to worry about rising consumer prices.

HEADLINE: Panel Changed To Get Pay Cut

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
A California panel that sets pay for elected officials tried Wednesday to cut the salaries of California's 120 lawmakers and 12 constitutional officers by 10 percent, but was momentarily stymied when one of the four members needed for passage voted against the cut. So Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger immediately named three new people to fill the vacancies on the seven-member board in an effort to get the four votes needed to make the cut. 
 ''As Californians are cutting back in this tough economy, state government should be doing the same,'' said Mr. Schwarzenegger in a statement.
The California Legislature's budget analyst recently predicted that the state's budget would soon face a new $8 billion hole; lawmakers recently closed a $42 billion gap through June 2010 through tax increases and cuts, some subject to voter approval in a special election next month.
 Because of the three vacancies, all four people currently on the panel would have had to vote for the 10 percent cut for it to go into effect. 
 The one vote against it was cast by a carpenters union official on the commission, to which the governor appoints all members. Unions and legislators have always had a close financial and legislative relationship in the state. 
 The panel will take up the compensation issues again soon, and assuming a fourth vote is had by a June 1 deadline, the reductions will apply to officials elected next year. Mr. Schwarzenegger accepts no salary; his administration members have already taken a 10 percent cut. 
 The panel, which was formed in June 1990, was working off a survey that found that the $116,208 annual pay for state legislators was higher than the compensation for comparable positions in eight other states, including New York.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Debate: A Broader Party or a Purer One?

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A fundamental debate broke out among Republicans on Wednesday over how to rebuild the party in the wake of Senator Arlen Specter's departure: Should it purge moderate voices like Mr. Specter and embrace its conservative roots or seek to broaden its appeal to regain a competitive position against Democrats?
 With consensus growing among Republicans that the party is in its worst political position in recent memory, some conservatives applauded Mr. Specter's departure. They said it cleared the way for the party to distance itself from its record of expanding government during the Bush years and to re-emphasize the calls for tax cuts and reduced federal spending that have dominated Republican thought for more than 30 years. 
 ''We strayed from our principles of limited government, individual responsibility and economic freedom,'' said Chris Chocola, a former Indiana congressman who is head of Club for Growth, a group that has financed primary challenges against Republicans it considers insufficiently conservative. ''We have to adhere to those principles to rebuild the party. Those are the brand of the Republican Party, and people feel that we betrayed the brand.''
 But Republican leaders in Washington argued that Republicans would be permanently marginalized unless they showed flexibility on social issues as well as economic ones.
 Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said he would seek to recruit candidates who he thought could win in Democratic or swing states, even if it meant supporting candidates who might disagree with his own conservative views.
 Mr. Cornyn said he was taking a page from Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the last head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who led his party to big gains by embracing candidates who, for example, opposed abortion rights or gun control.
 ''If you think about it, Schumer has been very good at this; I complimented him this morning in the gym,'' Mr. Cornyn said, adding, ''Some conservatives would rather lose than be seen as compromising on what they regard as inviolable principles.''
 Senator Lindsay Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said: ''We are not losing blue states and shrinking as a party because we are not conservative enough. If we pursue a party that has no place for someone who agrees with me 70 percent of the time, that is based on an ideological purity test rather than a coalition test, then we are going to keep losing.''
 The debate broke out as the party found itself in a particularly dire state. Mr. Specter's departure came a week after Republicans lost a special Congressional election in an upstate New York district with a significant Republican voter edge; as such, it underlined the extent the party was contracting, not only ideologically but also geographically. 
 In 2006, there were 55 Republicans in the Senate, compared with 45 Democrats. With Mr. Specter's departure, there will be 40 Republicans. Depending on the outcome of the election between Norm Coleman and Al Franken in Minnesota, Democrats could end up with 60 votes, enough, assuming they hold the party together, to take away the minority party's most powerful weapon, the filibuster. 
 The wide margin puts Democrats in a strong position as they prepare to deal with President Obama's agenda on issues like health care and global warming.
 Politics are cyclical; not long ago Karl Rove, at the time the chief political adviser to President George W. Bush, was boasting about the Republican Party enjoying a permanent majority. 
 The dominance now enjoyed by Democrats could prove equally transitory. Several Republicans said Democrats could suffer a backlash if economic policies pushed by Mr. Obama failed to lift the country out of a recession. 
 ''These policies that he is pursuing expanding the size of the government are going to be policies which the country will find hard to accept when they look at the levels of debt and the levels of spending that they require,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire.
 Saying that their party should do more to draw economic contrasts with the Democrats, several Republicans said Mr. Specter's departure was in effect a purification rite for the party that would make it better able to make its case to the public. 
 ''I'm not hurt by Arlen Specter walking away,'' said Michael Reagan, the son of former President Ronald Reagan and a conservative talk show host. ''At least now the party doesn't waste money supporting someone who does not support the party.''
 ''It's interesting that people say the right has taken over the Republican Party -- but no one can say what we've done,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''We've been closeted for the last eight years; it's time for the right to come out of the closet.''
 Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina said ideological purity was the road to success. ''The best way to get to 60 is to have a core group of Republicans who really do what they say and stand for their principles,'' Mr. DeMint said.
 Patrick J. Toomey, a former head of the Club for Growth whose primary challenge to Mr. Specter led the senator to bow out in the face of what he thought was a probable defeat, said Republicans should be open to a ''wide range of opinions on a wide range of issues.''
 ''But I think fundamental common ground that the vast majority of Republicans share is the belief in limited government, freedom and personal responsibility,'' Mr. Toomey said. 
 The question of how the party should respond to Mr. Specter's departure was the main subject of a Senate Republican lunch on Wednesday. The party can be a ''big tent,'' said Senator John Ensign of Nevada, ''but here are some core principles: fiscal responsibility, more personal responsibility, looking for a smaller, more effective government.'' 
 Mr. Graham scoffed at the notion that the party was suffering because it was not conservative enough. 
 ''Do you really believe that we lost 18-to-34-year-olds by 19 percent, or we lost Hispanic voters, because we are not conservative enough?'' he said. ''No. This is a ridiculous line of thought. The truth is we lost young people because our Republican brand is tainted.''

HEADLINE: New Cuts Could Doom Late-Night Subway Service, M.T.A. Director Says

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said on Wednesday that a possible second round of service cuts and fare increases in the near future would take the transit system ''beyond doomsday'' and that extreme measures like stopping late-night subway service could not be ruled out. 
 Other officials of the authority added that while a late-night shutdown was not expected, a sharp reduction in such service was possible. 
 The dire predictions came as Gov. David A. Paterson said in Albany that he had a ''new idea'' that would move forward a financial rescue plan for the authority and that he planned to discuss it with the Democratic leaders of the Senate and the Assembly. 
 But Mr. Paterson's office refused to reveal the idea. And there was no sign of any shift in the Senate, where some Democrats have blocked the rescue plan, most recently over objections to a regional payroll tax. 
 Without a rescue package from Albany, the authority would have to ''throw our budget out the window and ratchet it down and come up with a new budget that will enable us to deal with the significant deficits in '09 and '10,'' the authority's executive director, Elliot G. Sander, said after a meeting of the agency's board.
 That new budget would have to include more service cuts or fare and toll increases, or both. They would be much worse, Mr. Sander said, than the measures already planned, which he has described as being part of a ''doomsday'' budget.
 ''I'm not sure the English language captures what goes beyond doomsday, but to me, as a transit professional, as a citizen and a user of the system, they are just unbelievably difficult, and I think some would view them as horrific,'' Mr. Sander said. 
 Asked if he would consider shutting down the subway late at night to save money, he said, ''One can't say that anything is off the table.''
 He said that he had not discussed an overnight shutdown with the president of New York City Transit, Howard H. Roberts Jr., and that there were strong arguments for maintaining all-night service. 
 A transportation authority spokesman, Jeremy Soffin, later clarified those remarks, saying, ''We are not actively studying a nighttime shutdown of the system.'' He said running fewer trains at night was a more likely option.
 The authority revealed on Monday that it faces an additional $621 million shortfall this year, even after deep service cuts and fare increases of as much as 30 percent go into effect. The new deficit estimate is due to the slumping economy, which has cut revenues from taxes and fare and toll collections. 
 A deficit of more than $1 billion is forecast for next year. 
 Subway and bus fares are scheduled to go up on May 31, with the base fare rising to $2.50, from $2. Service cuts, including the elimination of 35 bus routes and the W and Z subway lines, will be phased in over the rest of the year. 
 The authority budget normally runs from January through December. But because of the economic conditions, the board decided on Wednesday to come up with a new budget that will begin in July and run through the end of 2010. 
 The move appeared to be an admission that the authority could not reasonably balance its budget this year and would seek instead to spread the pain over 18 months. 
 The change, however, does not exempt the authority from a legal requirement that it balance spending and income each calendar year, and officials said they might have to borrow money -- perhaps from the state -- to do so this year. 
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester, chairman of a committee that oversees the authority, questioned whether the authority had the power to change its budget process without legislation. 
 ''Whether or not it's a good idea, it's going to get bogged down in whether or not they have the legal authority,'' said Mr. Brodsky, a strong supporter of a state rescue plan. ''It's a little gimmicky.'' 
 At the board meeting, the authority's chairman, H. Dale Hemmerdinger, blasted legislators about their inaction on the bailout. 
 ''The fact is that the time for action has come -- and, as of today, gone,'' Mr. Hemmerdinger said. ''At this point there is no tomorrow. There's no next week. There's no next month to fall back on.''

HEADLINE: Obama Voices Concern on Pakistan and Defends Interrogation Memo Release

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama said Wednesday that he was ''gravely concerned'' about the stability of the Pakistani government but that he was confident Pakistan's nuclear arsenal would not fall into the hands of Islamic militants.
 Speaking at a prime-time news conference on his 100th day in office, Mr. Obama called the government in Pakistan, where army forces are at war with Taliban insurgents who have been advancing on Islamabad, ''very fragile.'' Pakistan's leader, President Asif Ali Zardari, is to visit Washington next week, and American officials have been pressing his government to be more aggressive in battling the insurgency.
 ''I am more concerned that the civilian government right now is very fragile,'' Mr. Obama said, because it lacks the capacity to deliver services like health care and the rule of law. ''As a consequence,'' he added, ''it's very difficult for them to gain the support and loyalty of their people.''
 Mr. Obama also hit back at critics including former Vice President Dick Cheney, maintaining that harsh interrogation techniques used by the previous administration did not yield any information that could not have been obtained through other means. 
 Responding to the fallout over his decision to release secret memorandums that laid out the Bush administration's legal justification for interrogation techniques like waterboarding -- which Mr. Obama called torture -- the president said that none of the intelligence reports he had seen left him thinking such methods were justified or necessary. ''I will do whatever is required to keep the American people safe,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But I am convinced that the best way to do that is to make sure we're not taking shortcuts that undermine who we are.'' 
 He offered no shift, however, in his opposition to an independent inquiry into the Bush administration's policies on the interrogation of terror suspects.
 During the one-hour news conference, Mr. Obama struck a variety of notes, ranging from historian-in-chief to mom-in-chief, when he lectured Americans to take precautions against the swine flu.
 ''Wash your hands when you shake hands; cover your mouth when you cough,'' he said. ''I know it sounds trivial, but it makes a huge difference.''
 There were a few light moments, particularly when Mr. Obama was asked what has surprised, troubled, enchanted and humbled him in the past 100 days. ''Wait, let me get this all down,'' he said, taking out a pen.
 He was surprised, he answered, by the number of critical issues that appear to be coming to a head all at the same time. 
 ''I didn't anticipate the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,'' he said. ''The typical president has two or three big problems, we have seven or eight.'' 
 He said he was troubled, or at least, ''sobered'' by how much ''political posturing and bickering takes place even when we're in the middle of really big crises.''
 He called himself enchanted by American servicemen and women, and their sacrifices they make, although he allowed that ''enchanted'' might not be the exact characterization.
 By the time he got to what humbled him, he was ready to expound, going on about the how the presidency was ''just part of a much broader tapestry of American life'' and how ''the ship of state is an ocean liner, not a speed boat.''
 Often over the course of the hour, he sought to draw distinctions between himself and his predecessor, and said that he had changed America's relations with the world. ''We have rejected the false choice between our security and our ideals,'' he said.
 Asked about his administration's support in several recent court cases for the Bush administration's position that the government had a broad right to invoke national security secrets to block litigation, Mr. Obama responded that he wants to modify the so-called state secrets doctrine, but had not had time to do so when the court cases came up. 
 ''I actually think that the state secret doctrine should be modified,'' he said. ''I think right now it's over broad.''
 Addressing the economy, Mr. Obama said his administration had made progress but that there was much more to be done and that he ultimately wants a more stable economy less prone to boom and bust. 
 ''We cannot go back to an economy that is built on a pile of sand -- on inflated home prices and maxed-out credit cards, on overleveraged banks and outdated regulations that allowed the recklessness of a few to threaten the prosperity of us all,'' Mr. Obama said in an eight-minute speech before taking questions from reporters. 
 He offered a new catchphrase to describe his economic program, calling for a ''new foundation for growth,'' that would encompass increased spending on issues like education and renewable energy.
 Mr. Obama suggested that the pressures of governing at a time of economic crisis, war and now a potential flu pandemic have led him to pay less attention to some issues of intense interest to his political base. Asked if he would keep a campaign promise to eliminate federal, state and local restrictions on abortion, he said that while he favored abortion rights, getting rid of those restrictions were ''not my highest legislative priority.'' 
 Asked about how he would use the government's power as a major shareholder in companies like General Motors and Citigroup, he said the government should limit its involvement.
 ''I don't want to run auto companies. I don't want to run banks,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I've got two wars I've got to run already. I've got more than enough to do. So the sooner we can get out of that business, the better off we're going to be.''
 The news conference in the East Room of the White House was the final act in a daylong series of events staged to mark Mr. Obama's 100th day in office. 
 Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Obama traveled to Missouri for a town meeting in a state that he narrowly lost last year. He offered an upbeat assessment of his first three months in the White House, but implored patience as he tackles a mountain of challenges, saying he could not work miracles.
 The tone of Mr. Obama's remarks on Wednesday reflected an assessment from several advisers that the next chapter of his presidency is likely to be even more difficult than the first. But his job approval rating remains high, particularly given the wave of challenges on his desk, which in the last week grew even larger with the first health emergency of his administration.

HEADLINE: Starbucks, Awaiting Recovery, Says Profit Fell 77%

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
Starbucks was one of the first companies to recognize the United States was in a recession when it halted its expansion plans last July. Still sensitive to the spending habits of consumers, the company has not glimpsed an end to that recession.
 Howard D. Schultz, Starbucks' chief executive, told investors Wednesday after announcing that the company's second-quarter net income had dropped 77 percent that, ''The global economy continues to be weak.'' 
 He also said, ''We did not see any improvement in U.S. consumer spending in Q2,'' and added that he was not expecting any improvement in 2009.
 Customers continued to cut back at Starbucks. The company said revenue from stores open at least a year in the United States declined 8 percent during the first three months of this year. It said 5 percentage points of that decline were due to fewer transactions and the rest was caused by customers spending less. 
 Starbucks has for the last year tried to reverse declining revenue by closing stores and recasting itself as an affordable brand for value-conscious consumers. The company has long been characterized as appealing to affluent professionals, while abandoning the lower end of the market to competitors like McDonald's, which has begun selling specialty coffee drinks.
 So in March, Starbucks began offering a breakfast value meal. Customers can buy a cup of coffee and an egg sandwich, cup of oatmeal or piece of coffee cake for $3.95. 
 Mr. Schultz said the company's new value-oriented strategy is paying off. While same-store sales declined in the most recent quarter, the decline was less than in the last three months of last year. 
 Jack Russo, an analyst with Edward Jones, said the fact that same-store sales did not show more improvement was a disappointment, and said that January and February were trying months for the company. ''This is a turnaround story, and it's going to take some time,'' he said. ''It's too early to tell.''
 The company, based in Seattle, reported net income of $25 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with $108.7 million, or 15 cents a share, in the year-ago second quarter. Revenue declined 7.6 percent, to $2.33 billion, in the second quarter ended March 29. 
 Charges associated with closing stores and other restructuring costs amounted to $152 million in the quarter. Excluding those charges, the company said it earned 16 cents a share.
 Despite beating analysts' estimates of 15 cents a share, Starbucks shares climbed only slightly in after-hours trading to $13.90. The stock had closed at $13.69, up 19 cents, in regular trading before the earnings announcement. Analysts also expected $2.37 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Financial.
 In January, Starbucks announced it would close 900 stores. Since then, it has closed 507 stores in the United States and 64 stores in other countries. The company said it planned to close most of the remaining stores by the end of September. 
 The company plans a multimillion-dollar ad campaign focused on Starbucks' ability to offer value without compromising quality. Starbucks executives said the company planned to change the pricing of certain drinks in the coming months, raising the price of some drinks while lowering the prices of more basic ones.
 ''Speculation that Starbucks is losing retail market share to competitors has been grossly exaggerated,'' Mr. Schultz said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. ''Starbucks coffee does not cost $4, as people are charging.'' The comment was a reference to a recent ad campaign by McDonald's that says, ''Four bucks is dumb.''

HEADLINE: Boeing Presses Congress to Order More of Its Planes

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
The Boeing Company, which was hit harder by the Obama administration's spending cuts than any other defense contractor, is pushing Congress to increase its orders for planes and fighter jets by $3 billion, industry officials said Wednesday. 
 Boeing is trying to get more orders for C-17 cargo planes and F/A-18 fighter jets added to a supplemental war-funding bill, officials said. They said Boeing's lobbyists contend that building the extra planes would help preserve the military's industrial base. Several analysts said they were likely to prevail because members of Congress are seeking to preserve thousands of jobs in their districts.
 President Obama has pledged to halt the Bush administration's practice of using the supplemental bills to pay for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and to add the costs to the Pentagon's annual budget. But White House officials said earlier this month that one final supplemental bill was needed to avoid disruptions, setting off a lobbying frenzy before the special financing door closes.
 Legislators have predicted that Congress will add $10 billion to $15 billion to the $83.4 billion that the White House requested, not only to keep jobs but also to block the cancellations of several of major weapons programs.
 Boeing has lobbied the hardest among the major defense contractors, Congressional aides and industry officials said, mainly because it stands to lose the most in a reshaping of defense programs announced this month.
 Boeing, the aerospace giant based in Chicago, is the lead contractor on the Army's vast $160 billion modernization program and on two missile defense programs that are being sharply scaled back. 
 The Defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, also proposed halting production of the C-17 transport planes, and he canceled plans to spend at least $15 billion developing a search-and-rescue helicopter, a contract that Boeing also was coveting.
 ''The company that's most exposed right now is Boeing,'' said James McAleese, a consultant in McLean, Va., who advises top military contractors. 
 Boeing has pushed in recent years to expand its military business to offset some of the fluctuations in its manufacturing of commercial airliners, a business that also now faces difficulties with the global recession.
 But with Democrats in control of Congress, Boeing is unlikely to win support for salvaging the missile defense programs, and Army officials are still trying to figure out how to revamp their modernization program.
 As a result, Boeing's lobbying efforts have focused on winning Congressional approval in the supplemental bill for 11 to 15 more C-17 planes, at a cost of more than $200 million each. The company is also seeking orders for nine more F/A-18 Super Hornets, at $60 million apiece.
 Mr. Gates has included a request to buy 31 more F/A-18's in the Pentagon's budget for fiscal 2010. But Boeing would like to see that wrapped into a three-year contract for at least 92 planes.
 Labor unions and aerospace associations also are pushing to save programs, including Lockheed Martin's F-22 fighter jet, which includes components made by Boeing.
 But Lockheed Martin has said it will not lobby for more than four more of the planes. And other industry officials said Wednesday that without a strong push from Lockheed Martin, Congressional leaders are likely to let the program die.

HEADLINE: It's Still My Party

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN. 
Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, was the governor of New Jersey from 1994 to 2001.

 BODY:
I HAVE always admired Arlen Specter for his willingness to stand up for his principles and to put policy ahead of party when he thought it was necessary. I do, however, regret his decision to switch parties and I worry about the direction this country could go with a filibuster-proof Democratic majority. Some historians suggest that no president has had such power since 1937, when large Democratic majorities in Congress gave President Franklin Roosevelt tremendous leverage.
 The United States needs two vibrant, competitive parties. With the economic crisis, the war in Iraq and countless other issues facing the nation, the stakes are too high to simply let one ideological segment of the country determine our fate. If we are to prevent this kind of one-party dominance, Republicans need to reassess where we are and what we stand for -- and we need to do it now. 
 Unfortunately, a preview of the Republican Party's future came from the reaction to Senator Specter's switch -- many conservatives evinced a sense of ''I told you so'' satisfaction and denigrated his service to the country. As was to be expected, the blogosphere is full of people saying that Arlen Specter was always a Democrat and now he's simply proved it.
 In reality, until Tuesday, Arlen Specter caucused with the Republicans, and he voted with his party 70 percent of the time in the 110th Congress. It is a sure bet that his voting record will now change. I fail to see the satisfaction in that. 
 Mr. Specter's announcement portends a challenge for Republicans, in terms of both governance and political prospects. To those Republicans counting on the usual phenomenon of off-year election losses for the party holding the presidency, I say do not forget the examples of Roosevelt and George W. Bush, whose parties prospered in 1934 and 2002, respectively. Besides, given the re-election rate of incumbents and the number of Republicans from competitive districts who have retired, the chances of gaining more than a handful of seats is remote.
 I also worry about the impact of this defection on the gubernatorial races this year in New Jersey and Virginia. Mr. Specter did not reach his decision in a vacuum. He was responding to what he and others saw as a trend in the party -- a trend that will make it harder to get out a centrist message. 
 Arlen Specter made his decision to leave the party after years of being attacked by fellow Republicans. I can understand how he felt, but I believe that now, more than ever, it is important for us moderates to stay and work from within. One thing we can be sure of is that we will have no impact on the party's direction if we leave. 
 Moderate Republicans should use Senator Specter's switch as the impetus to force a re-evaluation of where our party is going -- a review that can happen only from the inside. Besides, third parties in the United States don't have a particularly successful history. 
 In the coming election cycle, we have the opportunity to remind the nation that our party is committed to such important values as fiscal restraint, less government interference in our everyday lives, environmental policies that promote a balanced approach between protection and economic interest, and a foreign policy that is engaged with the rest of the world. The responsibility of ensuring that the party follows the right path lies with those moderates who are willing to work to make it happen. I anticipate that centrists will convene in the coming days to discuss how we can return the party to the sensible middle. 
 This isn't just about winning elections. To the extent we lose more members of the Republican Party, we lose what ability we have left to affect policy, and that is going to be devastating to our nation. Our democracy desperately needs two vibrant parties. And for Republicans to be that second party, we need to remind the nation of the principles for which we once stood. 
 We cannot simply be the party of no; we need to provide a compelling counterpoint to the Obama administration's tax-spend-and-borrow policies. The Republican Party has a proud heritage and much to add to the current debates, but only if we can return to the principles that made us the party of Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.

HEADLINE: Immigration Agents to Turn Their Focus to Employers

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In an effort to crack down on illegal labor, the Department of Homeland Security intends to step up enforcement efforts against employers who knowingly hire such workers. 
 Under guidelines to be issued Thursday to Immigration and Customs Enforcement field offices, agents will be instructed to take aim at employers and supervisors for prosecution ''through the use of carefully planned criminal investigations.'' 
 Senior officials of the Homeland Security Department said Wednesday that illegal workers would continue to be detained in raids on workplaces. But the officials said they hoped to mark an abrupt departure from past practices by making those arrests as part of an effort to build criminal and civil cases against employers. 
 Under the Bush administration, the officials said, most raids were conducted largely on the basis of tips that an employer was hiring illegal workers, rather than on information gleaned from audits of employer records or undercover investigations. As a result, agents rounded up thousands of illegal immigrants but rarely developed the evidence necessary to show whether businesses were knowingly using illegal labor.
 Last year, for example, nearly 6,000 people were arrested in workplace immigration raids across the country, but only 135 were employers or managers. The new guidelines, meant to provide a road map to agents who have been operating with little guidance and oversight from Washington, instruct them to pursue evidence against the employer before going after the workers.
 ''Enforcement efforts focused on employers better target the root causes of illegal immigration,'' say the guidelines, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. ''ICE must prioritize the criminal prosecution of actual employers who knowingly hire illegal workers because such employers are not sufficiently punished or deterred by the arrest of their illegal work force.'' 
 The rules could draw a storm of complaints from employers, who argue that they are easily duped by workers with bogus documents and that the government has not established a reliable system for verifying immigration status. 
 The rules are likely to win praise, though, from advocates who have long considered raids at work sites to be symbols of a crackdown that, they say, violates workers' rights and divides immigrant families while ignoring employer abuses. Raising the bar on what is required to undertake such raids could result in fewer of them.
 The guidelines are a significant step toward President Obama's pledge to overhaul the nation's immigration system. The president's aides said recently that he would ask Congress this year to consider changes that among other things would give legal status to the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants now in the country. 
 But a worsening economy could weaken political support for such changes. In the meantime, the administration has begun a review of steps it can take without Congressional approval.
 In his news conference Wednesday night, Mr. Obama restated his commitment to an immigration overhaul, saying the United States could not continue with a ''broken'' system. With regard specifically to workplace enforcement, he said he was looking for ''a more thoughtful approach than just raids of a handful of workers, as opposed to, for example, taking seriously the violation of companies that sometimes are actively recruiting these workers to come in.''
 ''That's something we can start doing administratively,'' he added.
 Among Janet Napolitano's first acts as secretary of homeland security was to order reviews of many parts of the nation's immigration system. Ms. Napolitano promised to stem the rising tide of illegal immigration by strengthening border enforcement and cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants.
 Work on the guidelines that are to be issued Thursday began after a February raid against a mechanic shop in Bellingham, Wash., where 28 illegal workers were seized. Ms. Napolitano, angry in part that her office had not been notified about the raid, ordered a review, and a couple of weeks later ICE officials took possession of the employer's files, released the immigrants from detention and gave them permission to work while they cooperated with an investigation of the company, Yamato Engine Specialists. That inquiry continues.
 One senior official said ICE agents worked from a field manual offering a menu of strategies that can be used in pursuit of workplace enforcement. But the manual does not lay out the order in which the strategies should be employed, or explain the agency's objectives. As a result, enforcement actions have been undertaken at the discretion of each field manager rather than Washington's direction.
 ''That's how you ended up with investigations that focused on low-hanging fruit,'' the official said, ''rather than on both the employers and the illegal workers that they intentionally hired.''
 Among the most significant of the new guidelines is one in which agents are instructed to ''obtain indictments, criminal arrest or search warrants, or a commitment from a U.S. attorney's office to prosecute the targeted employer, before arresting employees for civil immigration violations at a work site.''
 The guidelines call on agents to seek civil penalties, including fines and disbarment from federal contracts, in cases where they do not have enough evidence to press criminal charges. And they require that at least 14 days before conducting a raid, the relevant field office notify ICE headquarters with information including a proposed strategy for prosecuting the employer. 
 They also require that rules involving humanitarian considerations be taken into account in raids on work sites that have at least 25 employees. Those rules, which previously applied to raids involving at least 150 workers, generally allow the authorities to release detainees who are sick or who are sole caregivers for small children.

HEADLINE: Obama Welcomes Specter to the Party

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and ADAM NAGOURNEY; Reporting was contributed by John H. Cushman Jr., David M. Herszenhorn, Robert Pear and Jeff Zeleny from Washington, and Katharine Q. Seelye from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. welcomed Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania to the Democratic fold at the White House on Wednesday morning, praising Mr. Specter warmly and telling him he can count on their support for re-election in 2010. 
 Mr. Specter announced his unexpected switch of political loyalties on Tuesday, saying that he was leaving the Republican Party because it had shifted far to the right of his views and because he did not think he could overcome a primary challenge next year. His move bolstered President Obama at a pivotal moment for his policy agenda and further marginalizing Republicans on Capitol Hill by bringing the Democratic majority within reach of a filibuster-proof 60 seats in the chamber.
 At the early morning White House appearance, Senator Specter turned to Mr. Obama and said, ''I think I can be of assistance to you, Mr. President.'' 
 Mr. Specter said he was ''comfortable'' with how Mr. Obama has conducted his presidency, which is 100 days old today, and that his own ''centrist'' approach on governance would help reach solutions on matters like health care, climate change, immigration, and the fiscal balancing act during a time of economic strain. 
 Mr. Biden, who spoke warmly of Mr. Specter as ''my friend, my confidant, my partner,'' said that ''anyone who thinks Arlen is going to cash in his independence has another think coming.'' Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama served with Mr. Specter in the Senate before the 2008 presidential election. 
 Mr. Obama pledged enthusiastic support for Mr. Specter's candidacy as a Democrat in 2010, saying, ''We are confident that Arlen Specter is going to get a sixth term.''
 Mr. Specter acknowledged on Tuesday that his decision to change parties was driven by his intense desire to win that sixth term. It came after he and his political advisers concluded over the weekend that he could not turn away a conservative challenger in a Republican primary, particularly in light of his vote for the president's economic stimulus package.
 ''I am not prepared to have my 29-year record in the United States Senate decided by the Pennsylvania Republican primary electorate -- not prepared to have that record decided by that jury,'' said Mr. Specter, 79, a moderate who has long been known for breaking with his party.
 Republicans were knocked off stride by the announcement, and many had no warning from Mr. Specter, who met a polite but chilly reception when he entered a party luncheon to inform his colleagues. They immediately labeled it, in the words of Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who heads the party's campaign arm, a naked act of ''political self-preservation,'' and they sought to portray it as an isolated case growing out of Pennsylvania's political environment.
 The defection of Mr. Specter creates the potential for Democrats to control 60 votes in the Senate if Al Franken prevails this summer in the court fight over last November's Minnesota Senate election, in which repeated recounts gave him a slight edge over the Republican incumbent, Norm Coleman, that has stood up in litigation so far. 
 If Democrats could hold those 60 votes together, Republicans would be unable to mount filibusters as Congress moves into the critical phase of acting on Mr. Obama's ambitious agenda on health care and energy. A last line of defense against a Democratic-controlled Congress and White House would thereby be eliminated.
 ''This is transformative,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. ''It's game-changing.''
 Democrats warned that it would remain a formidable challenge to keep their ranks together. Mr. Specter said he would not be an automatic Democratic vote, though he will be pulled in that direction since he now faces the prospect of running in a Democratic primary.
 Mr. Specter was one of just three Republican senators to vote in favor of the stimulus package this year. He is a supporter of abortion rights and expanded embryonic stem cell research, and he opposed a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. But he also voted to authorize the war in Iraq, backed President George W. Bush's Supreme Court nominees, favors school vouchers and has taken many other positions that put him at odds with most Democrats.
 Even so, Mr. Specter said on Tuesday that he had received commitments from Mr. Obama and from Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, to support him in any primary, backing intended to deter Democratic challengers. Mr. Obama made good on that pledge on Wednesday. 
 Administration officials said Mr. Obama was handed a note from an aide at 10:25 a.m. Tuesday in his daily economic briefing. The note, said a senior administration official, read, ''Specter is announcing he is changing parties.'' Seven minutes later, Mr. Obama reached Mr. Specter by telephone.
 In a brief conversation, the president said, ''You have my full support,'' said the official, who heard the phone call. The president added that Democrats were ''thrilled to have you.''
 White House officials said Vice President Biden had been at the center of the effort to persuade Mr. Specter to change parties. They said a switch had been the subject of years of bantering and discussion between the two men, who often sat together while riding the Amtrak train home. But the conversation turned more earnest after Mr. Biden lobbied Mr. Specter to vote with the White House on the stimulus bill this year.
 One adviser to Mr. Biden said that since that day 10 weeks ago, Mr. Biden and Mr. Specter had spoken 14 times -- six times in person and eight in telephone conversations. In each case, White House officials said, Mr. Biden argued that the Republican Party had increasingly drifted away from Mr. Specter since the election and that ideologically, he was closer to the Democratic Party.
 White House officials said that there was no realistic way to guarantee that Mr. Specter would not face a primary race for the Democratic nomination, but noted that there was no Democrat in a position to resist the state's political machine and make a serious challenge. More than that, White House officials said they had assured Mr. Specter that Mr. Obama would campaign for him and raise money for him if necessary.
 ''The president's appreciative of this decision and particularly appreciative of the support that he gave on a number of things, the stimulus package being one of them,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser. ''And the president will do whatever he can do to help.''
 Some Republicans bade good riddance to Mr. Specter, who was badly trailing in polls against former Representative Patrick J. Toomey, a former leader of the Club for Growth, a group of fiscal conservatives who have financed primary challenges against Republicans they consider to have strayed too far from conservative principles.
 Michael Steele, chairman of the Republican National Committee, did not mince words, saying Mr. Specter ''left to further his personal political interests because he knew that he was going to lose a Republican primary due to his left-wing voting record.''
 But Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, a Republican who also supported the administration's economic stimulus plan, said Mr. Specter's view that the party had shifted too far to the right reflected the increasingly inhospitable climate for moderates in the Republican Party.
 Ms. Snowe said national Republican leaders were not grasping that ''political diversity makes a party stronger, and ultimately we are heading to having the smallest political tent in history.''
 Other Republicans said Democrats were on the verge of unchecked power in Washington, a theme Republicans have pushed in an effort to turn political weakness into a strength.
 ''The danger of that for the country,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, ''is that there won't automatically be an ability to restrain the excess that is typically associated with big majorities and single-party rule.''
 Mr. Specter, who sat on the Democratic side of the dais during a committee hearing Tuesday afternoon, said he had been assured that his seniority would be recognized by his new party, which would put him in line to jump over some Democrats for subcommittee chairmanships after the 2010 midterm elections.
 Mr. Specter has suffered from a variety of serious illnesses over the years, but said on Tuesday that he was ''full of vim, vigor and vitality.''
 He has angered many Democrats over the years with his positions, particularly his support of Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. But he said that with his record of 10,000 votes cast over almost 30 years, he had done something to anger virtually everyone.
 ''I don't expect everybody to agree with all my votes,'' he said. ''I don't agree with them all myself at this point.''

HEADLINE: Budget Passes but Critics Say the Deficit Is in the Details

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Congress gave final approval to its $3.5 trillion federal budget on Wednesday, opening the door to President Obama's policy initiatives on health care, energy and education while sidestepping the difficult question of how to pay for them.
 The spending plan, which did not receive a single Republican vote in the House or Senate, would result in substantial red ink over the next five years but foresees a $1.2 trillion deficit in 2010 being cut by more than half within five years. 
 Democratic backers of the budget called it an improvement over the economic approach followed by Republicans in recent years. They said it was more honest than previous budgets and would require Congress to pay for new spending or tax cuts.
 ''This budget puts America back on the path to fiscal responsibility,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, said.
 But Republicans heaped criticism on the fiscal outline, saying it hid the true extent of future deficits, created unfair legislative advantages for Democrats and expanded the size and reach of the federal government.
 ''I am really so concerned about where this takes our opportunities as a nation,'' said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, senior Republican on the Budget Committee, who said the budget would cause an ''explosion of federal debt.''
 The budget outcome reflected the deep ideological divide in Congress. The vote in the House was 233 to 193, with 17 Democrats joining 176 Republicans in opposition; the Senate result was 53 to 43, with 4 Democrats, including newly minted Democrat Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, joining 39 Republicans against the plan.
 Despite the unanimous Republican opposition, the budget moved through Congress more easily than in past years and marked a victory for President Obama and Congressional Democrats. At the urging of the White House, the leadership raced the spending plan through on Wednesday.
 ''This vote on the economic blueprint is an exclamation point at the end of the 100 days,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff.
 But the budget leaves for the coming months the heavy work of fashioning details of the new policies that the Obama administration is pursuing. While clearing the way for overhauls in health care, energy and education, the budget requires that they not add to the deficit. The budget also does not spell out how to pay for the legislation.
 It gives Democrats significant room for maneuvering as they move ahead with a health care plan, by providing procedural protection against a Senate filibuster for that legislation, which is still in the early stages of drafting, and allowing 11 years to pay for any health care initiative.
 President Obama did not get all he wanted. Lawmakers in both parties dismissed a plan to raise $318 billion by limiting income tax deductions for wealthier taxpayers. The budget also does not extend a middle-class tax cut established by the president beyond 2010 unless Congress finds a way to pay for it. 
 The final document also shaves billions from other tax relief sought by the White House and reduces the administration's overall spending request for 2010 by about $10 billion.
 Congress has also been cool to the administration's push to raise $600 billion over 10 years by auctioning off permits for the right to produce carbon emissions. And Congress did not provide $250 billion sought by the administration for more financial bailout programs if necessary.
 The budget does grant three years of relief from the alternative minimum tax for middle-income taxpayers, who would be increasingly hit by the automatic tax. In recent years, Congress has been forced to spend time and effort coming up with an annual adjustment.
 Democrats called the budget responsible and said that current economic conditions, and the need to recover from the policies of the Bush administration, were the main reasons for the deficits.
 Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee, said the Congressional plan would spend $555 billion less over five years than the administration's initial proposal. He said domestic spending would increase an average of 2.9 percent a year over the five-year stretch.
 ''That is not a big-spending budget,'' Mr. Conrad said. ''That is a tough budget.''
 He and other Democrats said the budget would reduce the deficit to less than 3 percent of the gross domestic product, a level deemed acceptable by some economists. But Republicans said the Democrats were severely underestimating future deficits because the budget failed to account for costs of a health care overhaul, popular tax breaks and other spending that would drive the deficit much higher.
 ''What we see before us is a budget resolution that is nothing short of the most audacious move to a big socialist government in Washington,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader. 
 But Democrats said the budget reflected the themes that Mr. Obama campaigned on and the priorities of most Americans.
 ''This is a magnificent blueprint for the future,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.

HEADLINE: Developers Say Labor Pact Saves Less Than Claimed

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
For months, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been eager to stand beside labor leaders and contractors to announce projects that would employ thousands of construction workers. News conferences were scheduled first for April 16 and then for Wednesday.
 But those dates came and went, in part because many powerful developers balked, threatening to tell anyone who asked that the soon-to-be-announced ''project labor agreement'' between builders and construction unions, with labor givebacks, was worth far less to developers than what was claimed in a press release. Further, they said it would probably not lead to a new burst of construction.
 ''Most of us on the contracting side feel far and away that it's not enough,'' said Joel I. Picket, chief executive of Gotham Construction. ''The unions are saying it's close to a 20 percent giveback. I think that most of the contractors think it's only single digits.'' 
 Mayor Bloomberg, who has rarely missed an opportunity to praise his administration's efforts to assist small businesses or create jobs, is eager to publicize this tentative labor agreement. The developers are desperate to keep projects alive, while unions are eager to keep their members employed
 The agreement, which claims to cut project costs by ''an average of 16 to 21 percent,'' is all but finished and a news conference still expected. More than a dozen projects have lined up to participate. But, developers and bankers say, that does not necessarily mean that any of them will proceed. The matter has become an object lesson in the intricate dance steps of New York politicians, real estate executives and union officials. 
 ''The key to any agreement is that it pave the way for construction to move forward that otherwise wouldn't due to the economic downturn,'' said Andrew Brent, a spokesman for the Bloomberg administration. ''The specific terms are up to the parties negotiating it.'' 
 The Bloomberg administration, which has cut many deals with construction unions to get their support for rezoning parts of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Willets Point, Queens, has been largely uninvolved in the talks, even as it sought to arrange the news conference.
 Mr. Bloomberg routinely seeks endorsements, and often political contributions, from unions. So, even as he has asked city employees for concessions, the project labor agreement would not apply to city projects, which are often more likely to proceed during an economic downturn than private developments.
 Developers who use union contractors have focused on New York's high labor costs. But many of them concede that the industry's problems include the dearth of real estate financing, a glut of new apartments in some neighborhoods and high land costs.
 Developers do say that a few projects that are currently stalled could benefit from a substantial reduction in labor costs. 
 The developer Bruce Ratner recently stopped work at the 38th floor of his planned 76-story Beekman Tower downtown, threatening to cap the building at 40 stories if he did not get concessions. Real estate executives say, however, that part of why Mr. Ratner -- and others -- are struggling is because annual rents are about one-third less today than the $80 per square foot that had been projected.
 Builders and labor officials have been talking for four months, but many unions have been reluctant to make concessions that might permanently erode their wages and benefits.
 ''The trades are concerned that if this kick-starts things,'' one lawyer who works with unions said, ''there'll be a lot of pressure to make it the status quo.''
 The three top negotiators for the labor agreement -- Gary La Barbera, president of the union alliance, the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York; Louis J. Coletti, president of the Building Trades Employers Association, and Raymond G. McGuire, president of the Contractors Association of New York -- have declined to comment, fearing they would jeopardize the talks. 
 But according to a three-page description of the concessions, the plumbers, carpenters, lathers, concrete workers and other construction unions would sign a no-strike pledge through June 30, 2010, and agree to standardize overtime costs, safety rules, staggered lunch hours and in some circumstances, a reduction in crew sizes and an eight-hour day. 
 Developers and contractors say that the electrical workers' and carpenters' unions, in particular, have made serious concessions, while the higher paid operating engineers, who handle heavy equipment like the cranes that swing across the skyline, have been unwilling to budge.
 Contractors, in turn, have vowed to reduce their fees, executives' wages and the number of project managers. They also agreed to pass on to developers and owners any reduction in the cost of construction materials.
 All of this would amount to ''substantial money,'' if not a savings of 20 percent, according to two of the city's largest construction managers. 
 But Stephen Spinola, president of the powerful Real Estate Board of New York, the developers' lobbying arm, said that the agreement would not result in big savings or a new building boom.
 ''The feedback I'm getting from developers and some contractors is that it's not very deep in terms of having an impact on costs,'' Mr. Spinola said. ''The cost savings could be as little as 5 percent, or as high as 12 percent. Nobody really knows.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Thursday about complaints by New York City developers that a tentative project agreement with unions, involving givebacks by labor, would save far less than what the Bloomberg administration and unions are claiming referred incorrectly to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's political overtures to unions. He routinely seeks their endorsements, but has never sought contributions from them.

 BODY:
G.D.P. DROPS STEEPLY The American economy is contracting at its fastest pace in 50 years, but some signs of life in the economy emerged. Forecasters like Mark Zandi, left, an economist, expected the contraction to continue. 
 LEWIS LOSES A TITLE Kenneth D. Lewis, who built Bank of America into the nation's largest bank, was stripped of his title as chairman. Angry investors held him accountable for a series of missteps that forced the bank to seek two government bailouts. [B1.] 
 NEW OFFER ON CHRYSLER DEBT The Treasury Department is said to have sweetened its offer to holders of Chrysler's secured debt to try to keep the carmaker out of bankruptcy court. [B1.] 
 AUTO WORKERS GAIN CLOUT Under reorganization plans proposed this week for Chrysler and General Motors, the auto workers' union appears to have gained significant power. [B1.] 
 A.I.G. SEEKS ANOTHER NEW NAME The best-known unit of the American International Group just changed its name to American International Underwriters in March after months of turmoil. Now, another name change is coming. [B1.] 
 ADVANCE IN S.L.R. TECHNOLOGY Panasonic has shrunk its single-lens reflex camera by removing the mirror box. The new model, the GH1, still comes in a large size and with a big price. State of the Art: David Pogue. [B1.] 
 WYETH'S FLAT QUARTER The drug maker Wyeth posted a flat first-quarter profit but beat analysts' expectations. Its cost cuts offset lower revenue. [B8.] 
 SHRINKING OF GERMAN ECONOMY Germany predicted a 6 percent contraction in its economy this year. The country's finance minister said it would have its ''worst recession since the Second World War'' and raised concerns about the entire euro zone [B7.] 
 WORRIES AT CLEAR CHANNEL At Clear Channel Communications, which was taken over in a leveraged buyout, tight cash flow is making it harder to meet debt payments. Scott Sperling, above, co-president of a firm that bought the company, recently said it still could ''generate reasonable cash flow.'' [B1.] 
 BANK CHAIRMAN LEAVING Daniel Bouton, the chairman of the French bank Societe Generale, said he would step down because of personal attacks against him. He lost his job as chief executive shortly after a $6 billion trading scandal became public. [B10.]
