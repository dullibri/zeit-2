Stock Market Ends Higher, But Early Gains Are Pared
After a big drop the day before, the stock market roared back, only to give up much of its gains late in the session. The Dow industrials, up nearly 130 points during the day, closed up 50.97 points at 7,136.62.
The Nasdaq composite closed up 7.92 points at 1,330.83. Technology stocks did particularly well, with I.B.M., Intel and Microsoft all gaining. [Page D6.]
 
Mutual fund investors, apparently unfazed by the stock market's rampant volatility, added some $13.5 billion to equity funds last month. And in recent days, it appears that investors have further stepped up their fund purchases. Market Place. [D6.]
 
Treasury prices rallied, with the 30-year bond yield falling to 6.93 percent from 6.96. [D13.]
 
Retailers Report Sluggish Sales
Running counter to recent buoyant economic statistics, retail sales have been sluggish. The Goldman, Sachs Retail Composite Index rose 3 percent in April from a year earlier.

Possible U.S. Trade Victory
The European Union's ban on hormone-treated beef is illegal, a World Trade Organization panel has decided in a preliminary ruling, potentially giving the American cattle industry a victory but turning over new ground on issues of national sovereignty. [A1.]
 
Thousands of banana farmers in the Caribbean find themselves at the center of another trade dispute between the United States and the European Union. The World Trade Organization has issued a preliminary ruling that a policy of guaranteeing Caribbean banana farmers special access to the European market is an unfair restriction on American companies like Chiquita that produce bananas in Central and South America.

Clinton Promises to Soften Law on Deportations
President Clinton met with the leaders of seven Central American and Caribbean nations in San Jose, Costa Rica, and said he would seek to suspend the deportation provision of a new American immigration law. The Central American leaders had told him they feared mass deportations of their citizens could wreak havoc on their fragile economies. A6
 
The President will go next to the Caribbean, where small banana farmers are worried about American efforts to overturn a trade agreement that gives them special access to the European market. A6 

Changing Lebanon Awaits Pope
Christians in Lebanon hoped Pope John Paul II would use his visit this weekend to protest the extent of Syria's influence in the country, as well as address other anxieties they have about their dwindling role in Lebanon's political order. The Pope is expected to praise the country's spirit of reconciliation after a civil war between Christians and Muslims. A1
 
Mobutu May Return to Zaire
The leaders of six African countries, including President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, met in Gabon and suggested that Zaire's transitional Parliament elect a leader who would assume power if Mr. Mobutu resigned. Diplomats doubted that the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, would consider the proposal, and one said the chances were increasing that Mr. Mobutu would return to Zaire. A3
 
Separatists Seize Venice Tower
A small group of men raced two vans with Venetian flags through Saint Mark's Square in Venice and broke into the Campanile, the square's historic bell tower, to demand a separate state in northern Italy. The police said the men were armed, but no shots were fired and no one was injured during the takeover. A5
 
Wiesel Declines Swiss Fund Job
Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Prize-winning Holocaust survivor, indicated he would turn down the post of international chairman of a fund set up by Swiss banks and businesses to compensate Holocaust victims. He said he was not "a person who can quantify." A12
 
Colombian Prosecutor Resigns
Alfonso Valdivieso, a popular anti-drug and corruption fighter in Colombia, resigned as chief prosecutor and said he would run in next year's presidential elections. The current President, Ernesto Samper, took office in 1994 amid charges that he had received millions of dollars in drug money for his campaign. (Reuters)
 
Gandhi's Widow Joins His Party
Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, joined his Congress party. Since her husband's assassination in 1991, Mrs. Gandhi, 50, had spurned repeated offers to enter politics and instead led a reclusive life. But her name is often invoked during power struggles in the party, which has been beset by scandals and electoral misfortune. (Reuters)

G.O.P.'s Turn to Admit Taking Illegal Foreign Gifts
The Republican National Committee announced it was returning more than $100,000 in illegal donations from a Hong Kong company. It was the Republicans' first admission that they had used substantially the same practice as the one that has embroiled the Democrats in scandal. A1
 
Bill to Combat Juvenile Crime
The House voted overwhelmingly to offer states $1.5 billion to fight juvenile crime if they change their laws and require young people -- ages 15 or older -- accused of violent crimes to be tried as adults and, in some cases, jailed with them. A1
 
Flood Relief Backed, With Rider
The Senate endorsed an emergency $8.4 billion spending bill intended for flood relief in the Dakotas, but two Republican Senators insisted on including a provision intended to prevent future Government shutdowns over budget disputes. President Clinton has threatened to veto it because of that provision, which faces an uncertain fate in the House. A26
 
Letter Read at Bombing Trial
A prosecutor at the Oklahoma City bombing trial read a letter in which the defendant, Timothy J. McVeigh, told a Michigan woman that his mindset had shifted from "intellectual" to "animal" and made vague references to "patriot" and "militia" activities. A15
 
Abortion Bill Based on Viability
Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, proposed banning all abortions after a fetus is viable, except if the pregnancy threatened a "grievous injury" to a woman's physical health. The measure is intended as an alternative to a measure banning a procedure known as partial birth abortion to its opponents; they called Mr. Daschle's health exception a huge loophole. A26
 
3 Die in Chemical Plant Fire
An explosion and fire heavily damaged a farm chemical distribution plant at West Helena, Ark., killing three firefighters and injuring 16 people. A hospital, nursing home and subdivision were evacuated because of the fire, which involved chemicals used to make a pesticide. A28

Housing Experiment Is Dropped
The New York City Housing Authority abandoned a plan to seek a waiver from Federal regulations that restrict the rents it charges, the kind of people it houses and the way it spends huge but shrinking Government subsidies. The plan had faced strong opposition from tenants even though the authority said it planned no rent increases or evictions. B1
 
Landlords Woo Elderly on Rent
New York City's largest landlords' group began mailing brochures to about 200,000 elderly residents of rent-regulated apartments, seeking to reassure them that they would not be affected if the rent laws were changed. A leader of the group said it wanted to let the elderly know they would be protected even if other rent regulation laws are repealed, as the landlords want. B6
 
For Violinist, a Labor Sentence
An immigrant who was charged with smuggling rare 18th-century violins into the country from Germany in hopes of reselling them was sentenced to play his own violin at ceremonies to swear in new citizens.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S BUDGET PLAN: THE OVERVIEW;
GIULIANI PROPOSES A RISE IN SPENDING IN HIS NEW BUDGET

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
With New York City benefiting from the boom on Wall Street, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed a $33.5 billion election-year budget yesterday that, for the first time in his tenure, calls for an increase in spending and in the size of the municipal work force. Much of the new money would go to education and other services for children.
Mr. Giuliani said the rebounding local economy was generating new tax revenues that helped him shape a budget that was less austere than those earlier in his term. He detailed his plan in a presentation at City Hall that gave a glimpse of many of the themes that he is expected to stress in his re-election campaign. 
 "We have changed the direction of the city," he declared, maintaining that his fiscal management had contributed to the economic recovery. Later, he added, "Remember where we were three and a half years ago, and take a look at where we are now."
He proposed that the city increase its spending by roughly 2 to 3 percent -- or $700 million to $1 billion -- and called for $284 million in new tax cuts, including the elimination of the city's 4 percent sales tax on clothing under $500.
The Republican Mayor also relaxed his effort to trim the municipal bureaucracy, which had been a hallmark of his agenda. After cutting the work force by nearly 23,000 people in his first three years in office, he proposed an increase of 2,644 employees, to 202,730, mostly because of hiring at the Board of Education and the Administration for Children's Services.
Mr. Giuliani has vowed to overhaul and increase financing for both of those agencies, seeking to demonstrate that he is a champion of the city's children.
He proposed spending more than $170 million on new programs for the Board of Education from the city's operating budget, and close to $1 billion over the next few years from the separate capital budget to buy computers, renovate schools and build temporary classrooms.
The capital spending would help create space for 40,000 students, which would lessen, though not solve, chronic overcrowding in the school system. For the last few years, the school population has grown at a rate of about 20,000 students a year, many of them immigrants.
Education is certain to be one of the most contentious topics during the mayoral campaign, and yesterday, Mr. Giuliani's Democratic rivals trained much of their criticism of his budget on this area.
They asserted that he had ignored the public schools throughout his tenure and had repeatedly cut projected spending at the Board of Education, adding that the new programs could not make up for his past neglect.
The Mayor contends that he did not feel confident enough in the leadership of the school system to devote more resources to it, but now that Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew is in charge, he is more willing to raise school aid.
In presenting his plan, Mr. Giuliani said the surplus from the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, is projected to be $856 million, a record amount caused largely by higher-than-expected tax revenues from robust profits on Wall Street. He said for the first time that he wanted to use $99 million of that money to help the city adapt to the new strict Federal welfare rules by paying for child care, job training and other programs.
Yet, even as he was proposing how to handle the surplus and promoting an array of tax cuts, the Mayor was also calling for $660 million in new spending cuts, spread across most city agencies. Mr. Giuliani said the cuts were needed to help close a projected budget deficit for the next fiscal year of more than $1 billion.
He could have allocated all of the surplus to forestall the spending cuts, but instead he chose to use the surplus money to make up for revenue lost from the proposed tax cuts and to pay off some of the city's growing long-term debt.
And beyond the 1998 fiscal year, the city still must grapple with projected budget deficits in the next four years that climb to more than $3 billion annually by 2001. Some independent budget experts, in fact, said the Mayor should have allocated all of the surplus to close those projected shortfalls.
Most of the proposals that Mr. Giuliani announced were first disclosed in his preliminary budget, which he issued in January, so he used much of the presentation yesterday to look back on his tenure.
As a result, he often sounded as if he were making a campaign stump speech, filled with references to initiatives from his administration that he said had bettered the lives of city residents. He spoke of tax cuts that he had pushed and new ones that he was proposing, the declining welfare caseloads and the growth in private-sector jobs.
Mr. Giuliani's predecessors did not usually highlight the city's murder rate at the annual briefing on the budget, but yesterday that, too, was a focus. "I couldn't do a budget presentation without showing you how crime is going down in the city," he quipped as he pointed to a chart.
Part of the speech was devoted to an unusual attack on the way that the state has historically treated the city. Mr. Giuliani said the city deserved more state aid, and he said he would try to pressure Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature to insure that when the state divides its surplus, the city gets its fair share.
The state wields great power over the city's finances, and approval from Albany is required for nearly all of the Mayor's tax reduction plans before they can become law. What's more, Mr. Giuliani wants $47 million in new state aid -- jumping to more than $700 million in 2001 -- to make up for lost revenue from some of the cuts.
Technically, the $33.5 billion budget reduces spending by $500 million compared with the current fiscal year because of an accounting maneuver.
It works like this: the city now has an $856 million surplus, but accounting rules require City Hall to spend the money in the current fiscal year.
The Mayor, though, wants to use the money in the next fiscal year. So he is paying for some of next year's expenses this year. In other words, he is prepaying an anticipated expense.
That artificially inflates spending for the 1997 fiscal year, and deflates it for the 1998 fiscal year. Therefore, in reality, Mr. Giuliani is proposing a spending increase of 2 to 3 percent for 1998, administration officials and independent budget experts said.
In his first three budgets, Mr. Giuliani proposed reducing city spending, both technically and in reality.
But after negotiations with the City Council, he agreed to restore funds to some programs, and is likely to do so again this year. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, a Queens Democrat, said he was generally pleased with the budget, particularly the proposals for tax reductions, though he said he would fight some of the spending cuts.
"That, obviously, is something that is a concern for all of us," Mr. Vallone said.
The Democrats running for mayor, though, were more critical. "There is no structural change in the funding of education, no real commitment to the future of New York," said one candidate, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, who is also running for mayor, said Mr. Giuliani had done little to cure the city's long-term budget problems, noting that the future projected deficits remained large.
"This is not moving us toward structural balance," Ms. Messinger said. "And he has been talking about that for four years."

Chart: "Budget Highlights"
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed $33.5 billion budget would raise total city spending by 2 to 3 percent. But it also includes an array of spending cuts totaling $660 million, which are spread among most city agencies. The budget features $284 million in tax cuts. Here are some details:
 
USING THE SURPLUS
The Mayor's plan would use a projected $856 million surplus for the current fiscal year for three purposes:
 
43 percent to reduce the city's long-term debt.
39 percent for new programs.
18 percent to make up revenue lost to proposed tax cuts.
 
NEW SPENDING
$125 million to improve reading scores.
$99 million for child care, job training and programs to help the city respond to new Federal welfare rules.
$25 million for arts education.
 
SPENDING REDUCTIONS
$114 million cut in the Health and Hospitals Corporation.
$15 million cut in the Department of Cultural Affairs.

HEADLINE: GIULIANI'S BUDGET PLAN: SERVICES;
More Money for Schools and Child Welfare and Less for Police

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
After shearing more than $1 billion from the Board of Education's projected spending in the first two years of his administration, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday proposed increasing the board's budget next year. He wants to add $172 million for new programs, and nearly $1 billion over several years for new classrooms and computers.
The Mayor did not explain his reasoning yesterday, but he has done so many times in the last eight months, in announcing many of the plans that he bundled together yesterday in his proposed budget for the coming fiscal year, which begins on July 1. The reason is his confidence in Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew. 
 Whatever Dr. Crew's influence, critics have been quick to note that this is a mayoral election year, and they contend that the Mayor has been responding to polls showing that voters give him low marks for his handling of education issues.
Since schools opened in September, the Mayor has repeatedly referred to his intention to add money to the board's budget. The Mayor said yesterday that he wanted $125 million to go to a reading program for elementary school students and $25 million to restore some arts programs, and he said he would provide $22.7 million for technical support and staff development as more classrooms are equipped with computers.
Mr. Giuliani estimated that the budget would ultimately grow by 0.7 percent over the current fiscal year, to $8.3 billion next year. School enrollment, however, is expected to grow by 1.4 percent, or 15,000 students, to 1.09 million.
The proposed increases in capital spending are far more drastic. The Mayor has proposed spending $500 million to create thousands of new classrooms. The Mayor and the City Council have also agreed to spend $275 million to refurbish aging school buildings and $150 million on computers and wiring.
The Mayor's proposed spending drew praise from the Chancellor, but his operating budget drew criticism from the city teachers' union and parents' groups. Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, called the new programs "mostly one-shots that sound suspiciously like election-year promises."
And John Fager, the executive director of the Parents' Coalition, a citywide group, accused the Mayor of "micromanaging" the school system, and argued that school administrators, teachers and parents should decide how the money is spent.
 
Social Services
Advocates for the poor found nuggets of hope yesterday in Mayor Giuliani's proposed social services budget. While they said there was not nearly enough money for day care, there were 93 new positions for the child welfare agency, $75.9 million to support elderly and disabled immigrants expected to lose their Federal cash benefits and $900,000 to help finance a telephone line for public assistance recipients bewildered by changes in the Federal welfare law.
But to finance these initiatives, among others, Mr. Giuliani is relying, in part, on several assumptions.
He expects, for instance, that a state proposal will save the city $77 million by decreasing the amount of money the city must contribute toward public assistance for single parents with children. But the proposal has yet to be voted on by the State Legislature.
Mr. Giuliani also fails to include the potential costs of developing and running a new voucher program proposed by Mr. Pataki. The plan would replace the state's cash-assistance program for single adults and would offer the poor vouchers for food, shelter and clothing.
And in totaling the dollar figure needed for the city's legal immigrants, the Mayor is also hoping that the Federal Government will pay for many of them.
Under Mr. Giuliani's plan, the Administration for Children's Services, the child welfare agency created last year, would get $492.1 million in city money, $145.6 million more than was first forecast. Most of the increase is from the budget of the city's day-care agency, which was integrated into the children's agency.
But city financing for the Human Resources Administration would decline. Mr. Giuliani said he planned to spend $3.059 billion in 1998, a $587 million decrease from 1996. About 21 percent of that was the day-care budget that moved to the new children's services agency.
Already, day care seems to lack the necessary money. Mr. Giuliani plans to spend $4.4 million for 8,700 more day care slots in 1998 and $13.3 million in 1999 for 13,000 more children.
The city now helps pay for day care for about 75,000 children.
But the city estimates that about 15,000 single parents will enter the workfare and work-related programs in 1998, and many will need child care.
 
Police
The Police Department, long a sacred cow, will have less in 1998. The proposed budget has $89 million less than the last fiscal year, bringing the operating budget to $2.399 billion. When anticipated Federal money and private grants are included, officials said, the department faces a $29 million cut from last year.
Police Commissioner Howard Safir said there would be savings from such efficiencies as expanding new technologies, speeding arrests and cutting overtime. He also plans cheaper paint jobs and decals for police cars. The police also plan to stop patrolling the five city-owned tow pounds, and to award a contract to a private security company.
"We are not skimping in any way with officers on the street or operational equipment," Mr. Safir said.
In some areas, spending will go up: $1.3 million for the Intelligence Division, which will maintain an up-to-date crime data base and share information with state and Federal law enforcement agencies. And the police will open a new crime laboratory in January 1998.
 
Sanitation
The city's on-again, off-again recycling program appears to be on again, but not at levels desired by some private environmental groups.
The proposal noted that "the frequency of residential waste collection services has not been reduced," but critics of the administration said that this simply leaves the collection schedule almost everywhere in the city at every other week -- leaving residents to deal with 14-day accumulations of newspapers and other recyclable material.
In the 1998 fiscal year, programs for collecting metal and mixed paper like junk mail are scheduled to be expanded to the last boroughs without them: Brooklyn and Queens.
The budget calls for the first significant expenses related to closing the Fresh Kills Landfill in 2001. The city will begin sending some residential garbage, from the Bronx, to disposal sites outside city limits.
 
Cultural Affairs
For the second year in a row, the 33 city-owned cultural institutions financed by the Department of Cultural Affairs are facing a large cut.
Mayor Giuliani's budget for the 1997-98 fiscal year calls for aid to the department to be cut by $15 million, to $79.5 million. Of that, $63.8 million would be allocated to the 33 institutions, a 15 percent decrease from last year. Those that focus on children's programs would face smaller cuts than most others. The news came as a surprise and a disappointment to the Cultural Institutions Group, an informal organization of the 33 groups.
"There have been these two years of real cuts, but because of inflation we never recovered from the cuts in 1990," said Rochelle Slovin, the director of the American Museum of the Moving Image. The group plans to lobby for a restoration to the 1990 level, she said. "This Mayor really is a mayor who completely understands cultural life and cultural institutions," she said, "So it's very disappointing."

HEADLINE: A Budget Fit for Fantasyland

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While a balanced budget for the year 2002 has been created with fairy dust, our President and Congress expect us to be elated (front page, May 3).
Kudos to you for bringing us back to reality by noting in your news analysis that the 2002 forecast assumes a longer recovery than the nation has ever experienced -- and that even a small, unexpected economic slowdown could spell disaster for budget balancing. 
 Using Congressional Budget Office data, I calculate that a downturn similar in magnitude to the United States' two most recent recessions would generate a deficit of between $100 billion and $150 billion in 2002.
The budget spectacle is entertaining, to be sure. But Washington should leave the fantasy worlds to Disney.

If Puppets Step Offscreen, They'll Get Torn Apart

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
It is rehearsal time for Spain's most irreverent television show and, in one studio, 10 bullfighters are lining up to debate the state of the nation. The toreros are on two rival teams, representing the country's two main political parties.
On another set, Bill Clinton is taken off the shelf and dressed in a gray business suit and baseball cap to get ready for action. For a third skit, the Prime Minister's wife gets a black party dress and heavy jewelry because she is preparing to go to Washington. 
 These characters will be part of "The Puppet News," which through cheerful caricature and burlesque has become the most talked about program in Spain. Using latex puppets, the show, which is on five nights a week, pokes fun at local politicians, sports heroes, journalists and foreign figures, including Pope John Paul II and Woody Allen.
Its favorite targets are the austere Prime Minister, Jose Maria Aznar, and his chief opponent, former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, the voluble Socialist leader.
Many viewers believe that the puppets, which first appeared 18 months ago, are lightening up Spain's vengeful political scene, where old ideological battles of left and right and personal rivalries are fought out with unrelenting passion. But now the puppets themselves are under attack. It appears that they have been bruising a number of official toes.
Two leaders of the governing Popular Party have recently complained that their conservative group is being singled out for abuse. The party's secretary general, Angel Acebes, said darkly in April that "the worst part is that the program is made for purposes other than humor," serving rather to promote "certain political opinions."
Then, in a scene that has reminded some of a famous episode in which Don Quixote draws his sword and smashes the puppets he takes for real people, the conservative newspaper ABC struck out against the puppet program with an attack that covered its entire front page.
In an editorial ABC said the show was an example of Socialist propaganda, in which all right-wing politicians are depicted as "fools and illiterates." The time has come, the editorial said, to respond with "counter-puppets" that are "objective."
Channel Plus, the commercial network that broadcasts "The Puppet News," denies it is biased.
"We try to treat the daily headlines with humor," said Rafael Garcia Mediano, the station's programing director. "It's meant to be a news program, and Aznar and his Cabinet by definition are more in the limelight. Felipe Gonzalez is now of less interest and, of course, former Socialist ministers are not news."
A recent opinion poll found that viewers saw no prejudice. In fact, Mr. Garcia Mediano said, some viewers said they found several of the characters more lovable and charming as puppets than as people. "We want to be affectionate rather than cruel, and this translates into public affection for the show," he said.
Still, the puppet-masters have welcomed the publicity generated by the recent attacks because, in April, they lifted the puppets' ratings to a peak of almost half a million viewers.
Critics of the Aznar Government see the controversy as further evidence of its sensitivity to criticism and lack of confidence. Some see this reaction as part of the growing pains of Spain's relatively young democracy, where, after almost four decades of dictatorship, politicians are still unaccustomed to the seesaw of power and the barbs of a free press.
Several Cabinet ministers were quick to say they found it amusing. Among them was Finance Minister Rodrigo Rato, who has been much in the news of late, praising Spain's economic upturn, the declining inflation and a continuing privatization program. The other night his rubber version appeared with an "economic package," a box that opened and let out only thick smoke. Anyone buying this package, the Rato puppet said, would get a special gift. The gift was a cuckoo clock with Mr. Aznar popping out.
For all the ado, the show's satire is less caustic than that of Les Guignols in France and "Spitting Image" in Britain, both of which served as inspiration. While "Spitting Image" used the British royal family as a mainstay, the Spanish show does not even have a puppet of King Juan Carlos among its 45 characters.
"Well, the King does not generate much news," said Antonio Martinez, one of the show's two writers.
Mr. Gonzalez has been getting off easier since leaving office, although an aide recalled some "wicked" skits in which the leader appeared as a glib Mafia boss plotting to liquidate a close associate or posturing in a Superman costume.
Jordi Pujol, the Catalan nationalist leader and power broker, appears regularly. Because the Aznar Government does not have a parliamentary majority, it negotiated a shaky pact with the Catalans. In one skit, Mr. Pujol appeared as circus ringmaster, ordering people to jump through hoops and to perform astonishing tricks. In another that caused great hilarity, he and Mr. Aznar were locked in a deep, long kiss.
The butt of many jokes is no doubt Mr. Aznar, whose thick-witted puppet obsessively repeats the phrase "Spain is doing well." On a recent night before Mr. Aznar left for Washington, the show had the Prime Minister practicing for his meeting with President Clinton. He started off by telling a children's joke. As his wife shrieked in horror, Mr. Aznar explained that his script told him to use a little humor to break the ice.
Such is the show's impact that some of its signature language has caught on. For example, the puppet-anchorman often repeats words and syllables as in "Catalan, talan" and "buenas noches, noches," which have crept into daily conversations.
It is said that even Mr. Aznar's children now say, before going to bed, "Buenas noches, noches, Papa."

News From America

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
The mail brings a sad letter from an angry man who wants to know how he can join one of those agin-the-government outfits whose members thirst for war with Uncle Sam.
Until now he has never understood how any American -- surely the most privileged species on earth, except for their lousy health-care system -- could hate the government enough to appear in public wearing a camouflage suit. 
 Now he knows. A few weeks ago he mailed his state income tax forms and tax payment to the collector right on deadline. Last week the envelope, unopened, was returned by the post office.
The message read, "Insufficient Postage." He was short by 23 cents.
The prospect of paying a late-filing fine because some postal functionary thought it wiser to collect 23 cents than to speed a large sum of money to the state capital -- well, he is fit to be tied. Even to walk around town in camouflage.
A Manhattan woman sounds almost as overwrought about those water towers that sit on top of high buildings all over town. She hears that these distinctive features of the skyline are going to be covered with advertisements.
This woman has apparently missed the news about the comeback of laissez-faire economics all over the land, and all over the sky too. She resents having everything in New York turned into advertising and wants me to stop it.
My first impulse is to advise her to join one of those agin-the-government outfits and start walking around Manhattan in a camouflage suit. But it is not the government, the accursed government with its rubber "Insufficient Postage" stamps, that puts ads in the clouds. It is American business obeying the commands of a free market.
Business is acting in obedience to the commands of the free market. Should one suit up in camouflage to scare the free market, without which America would not be incomparably superb, except for its lousy health-care system?
My advice, Madam, is to stop grousing, thank Heaven for a free market and start doing something that will keep the Dow Jones flying.
Fighting preservation, for instance. Found a Desecration Society. Imagine all four faces of the Washington Monument covered, ground to peak, with ads; the Capitol Dome ringed with neon of many colors urging the purchase of beer, automobiles, anti-perspirants, toothpaste.
Across the White House I see an ever-changing assortment of house ads flashing in electric lights: "For the very best in camouflage suits, call the Pentagon"; "Why take the chance of having your tax return sent back for Insufficient Postage? Buy another 23-cent stamp and feel safe," et cetera.
Here is a Washington woman writing to ask what the world is coming to when a country's health-care system is so lousy that a person can't even go to the dentist anymore without getting a mouth full of Krazy Glue.
She is referring to the man in Silver Spring, Md., who was directed to a woman dentist famous for charging low prices. When the patient complained about a tooth that felt too big for his mouth, the dentist extracted it, filed it down for a more comfortable fit, then cemented it back in his jaw with Krazy Glue.
The patient's dissatisfaction brought government's usual trouble-making officials into action, and when last observed by The Washington Post the dentist had been hauled in for practicing dentistry without a license, among other things.
The burden of this woman's complaint seems to be that any country with a half-decent health-care system would provide people suffering from ill-fitting teeth with competent dentistry, thus eliminating the danger of ending up with your tongue glued to your back molars.
I have spent several days agonizing about what advice to give this woman. On one hand, I am tempted to tell her to start wearing a camouflage suit and picketing the Capitol with a sign saying, "Fix our lousy health-care system, you clods."
Other times I am tempted to advise her to quit whining and get down on her knees to show she is grateful for a free-market system that encourages even the unskilled to succeed through imagination, daring and Krazy Glue. Even if the health-care system really is lousy.

HEADLINE: Bond Rally and Dollar Drop Send Market Indexes Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks ended the week higher, as a rally yesterday in bonds lifted bank shares and a sharp drop in the dollar bolstered exporters.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 32.91 points, to 7,169.53, and was up 1.4 percent for the week. The Dow swung in a 100-point range on the day, rising 59 points early and sinking about 40 points around noon before recovering. 
 Caterpillar Inc. led the Dow higher, while Nationsbank led regional banks, the top-performing industry group in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 4.52, to 824.78, a one-week gain of 1.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.22, to 1,335.05, and 2.3 percent on the week.
Stocks and bonds rose early yesterday after investors interpreted comments made Thursday night by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to mean that the Fed would leave interest rates unchanged at its next policy meeting on May 20.
Still, some investors were not convinced that Mr. Greenspan had tipped his hand.
"His comments were pretty innocuous," said Gene Grandone, director of investment counseling at Northern Investment Counselors, which oversees $7 billion. "It sounds like a 50-50 chance" the Fed would raise rates, Mr. Grandone said. Either way, the instability in stock prices "is symptomatic of a market that's reached a high valuation relative to profits," he said.
The dollar, meanwhile, suffered its biggest one-day fall against the yen yesterday since September 1995, dropping to 120.35 yen.
A declining dollar "would help the earnings of a company like Caterpillar that does a lot of exporting, particularly to Japan," said Robert Brody, who runs the American Growth fund, with $100 million in assets.
Caterpillar, which makes about half its sales outside the United States, rose 2 3/8, to 96 5/8.
Financial stocks were helped by the decline in interest rates and by optimism that the Fed would leave rates unchanged. Nationsbank climbed 1, to 60 1/4, while First Union rose 1 1/2, to 85 5/8. Citicorp rose 2, to 117, and Chase Manhattan gained 2, to 97 7/8.
Cephalon Inc. shares plunged 7, to 13, after its drug for treating Lou Gehrig's disease failed to win the backing of a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. Chiron, a research partner, fell 7/8, to 19 1/8.
Premier Laser Systems, a maker of dental lasers that remove tooth decay and prepare teeth for fillings, jumped for a third day after the F.D.A. approved its treatment for use. Shares rose 3, to 14, and were the second-most active in trading.
McDonald's slid 1 1/8, to 53 1/8, after the world's largest restaurant chain said a new low-priced menu doubled sales of its Big Mac, though only "incremental" profit gains were expected.
Chrysler workers ended a four-week walkout at a Detroit engine plant, pushing shares up 3/4, to 31 1/4. Auto makers are seen as beneficiaries of a weaker dollar, because their cars would cost less compared with Japanese rivals. Ford Motor rose 1, to 36 5/8, and General Motors rose 1 1/8, to 57 7/8.
American depository receipts of Lucas Varity P.L.C. rose 3/4, to 31 5/8, after Goldman, Sachs & Company added the stock to its recommend list. Each A.D.R. represents 10 shares of the British car parts maker.

HEADLINE: Dollar Plunges Against Yen In Big Setback

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The dollar plunged yesterday against the Japanese yen, ending the week with a 5 percent loss in value, its biggest setback to date in its rally from a record low just over two years ago.
The decline of the American currency against the yen also sapped its strength against the German mark and other European currencies. For the week the dollar was off 2.5 percent against the mark. 
 The immediate cause of the fall against the yen was comments from Japanese officials who hinted that the Government was ready to intervene in the markets to bring down the value of the dollar.
These comments had special resonance because of the agreement in February between the United States and its key industrial allies that the dollar had strengthened enough from the record lows it reached against the yen and mark in April 1995. That accord was affirmed last month when representatives of the Group of Seven countries -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- met again in Washington.
If the dollar's slide continues, especially against the yen, it could help American automobile manufacturers, which have seen their Japanese competitors cut into American market share this year, when the stronger dollar made their prices more competitive. In April, the Big Three's share of American sales dropped 2.1 percentage points, to 73.3 percent.
Conversely, a weaker dollar would make imports more expensive, adding to inflationary pressure here. And American tourists expecting bargains overseas this summer would be disappointed.
But whether this week's decline represents an end to the dollar's two-year climb, which lifted it 58 percent against the yen and 28 percent against the mark, is open to debate. Analysts are split over the yen, with some arguing that the dollar may have reached its peak. But they agreed that the dollar could rebound against the mark.
There has not been a dollar plunge like this since the end of May 1995, when the dollar was just above its record lows against the yen and the mark. The 5 percent drop of the dollar against the yen is the biggest weekly decline in the 1990's.
The dollar settled in New York at 120.35 yen yesterday, off 2.8 percent for the day, and it is now weaker than it was in February, when the United States and the other nations first indicated it was too strong. While not back to its February level against the mark, the dollar is at its weakest since early April. It settled at 1.6869 yesterday, down 1.3 percent on the day.
If the dollar has indeed reached its top against the yen and retreated, then it will mean that the United States and its allies have been able to brake the dollar's rise without having to intervene in currency markets.
In an appearance on CNBC before a meeting of the Business Council in Williamsburg, Va., yesterday, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin would not comment on the dollar's plunge, saying only that the Administration's policy "has been right."
But some analysts make the case that the dollar will rebound against the yen and the mark on its own. They point out that the American economy is growing faster than either Japan's or Germany's and that some expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again to slow American growth. Interest rate increases in Europe or Japan, if there are any, are not expected until much later in the year, and they presumably would not be big enough to dent the dollar's strength.
This means that "the interest rate differentials will shift in the favor of the dollar in the near term," said Kermit Schoenholtz, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers in London. And the higher rates here should keep the dollar attractive.
"If you characterize the economy as growing at a challenging pace that will force the Fed to raise interest rates, then it is unlikely that the dollar has seen its highs for the year," added John Lipsky, chief economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
Mr. Lipsky also said the flow of investment from Japan to the United States was still strong, providing another support for the dollar.
But Jim O'Neill, the chief currency economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company in London, disagreed. "It's very tricky," he said of the outlook, but "there is a pretty strong case to make that the dollar has reached its high against the yen."
His argument is threefold. One, Goldman, Sachs is now forecasting that Japan's trade surplus with the United States is going to grow much faster than expected, meaning that Japanese companies will have more dollars to exchange into yen, which will push the American currency lower. Goldman just raised its estimate of Japan's current account surplus for the fiscal year that began April 1 to 1.8 percent of Japan's gross domestic product from 1.3 percent.
His second argument is that currency traders are "starting to think that the Bank of Japan will tighten this year." He said that the speculation had gotten so intense that there was a rumor yesterday that the Bank of Japan would raise official interest rates this weekend.
Last, Mr. O'Neill argues that the United States and its chief industrial allies still want to rein in the dollar, a goal that was re-emphasized in the statement issued after the April meeting of the Group of Seven.
That statement emphasized concern that a strong dollar could lead to a surge in Japan's trade surplus with the United States. A big surplus has led to dollar weakness and Japan bashing in the past.
But Mr. O'Neill predicts the dollar will rally against the mark, both because the interest rate and economic growth differentials favoring the dollar should remain intact and because the uncertainty about the European move to a single currency is still lifting the dollar.
A combination of events caused the dollar's slide this week, with the fall against the yen infecting the dollar generally. Before this decline, over the last 12 months the dollar had risen 21 percent against the yen to a four-year high of 127.10 on April 30 and almost 14 percent against the mark to 1.7329 on May 5.
A rally in the Japanese stock market pushed the dollar lower on Tuesday as did a sharp rise in Japanese interest rates as the bond market fell. Comments by Japanese officials then accelerated the dollar's tumble. First, the director general of the Ministry of Finance's International Finance Bureau suggested that the dollar could fall as low as 103 yen.
Then the Finance Minister, Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, suggested that the Bank of Japan might intervene to support the yen by selling dollars. This threat, when the dollar was already declining, carried extra weight.
Finally, there appeared to be selling because many traders interpreted a speech on Thursday night by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, to mean that the central bank would not raise interest rates at its next policy-making meeting, May 20.
That interpretation is open to debate, and, in any case, analysts who see the dollar rebounding expect the economy's strength to force the Fed to raise its short-term interest rate target later this year, even if it does not move on May 20.

HEADLINE: Less of a Grinch: Some Softening For the Image Of Greenspan

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
In nearly 10 years as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan has developed a reputation as the Grinch, an economic killjoy railing against "irrational exuberance," willing to sacrifice jobs and the nation's full growth potential to spare Wall Street millionaires from the merest whiff of inflation.
Mr. Greenspan's image has been softened only slightly by the widespread acknowledgment that his quest for price stability has provided the foundation for more than six years of steady expansion and a current unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, the lowest in 23 years. 
 But now economists and other students of the central bank are starting to offer a revisionist view of Mr. Greenspan, one that paints him as far more flexible in his approach to fighting inflation than his reputation -- and his own public statements over the years -- may suggest.
Over the last year in particular, Mr. Greenspan has prodded the Fed to consider whether sweeping changes like the huge investments by businesses in technology might have given the economy greater capacity for noninflationary growth than conventional theories might hold. And as growth surged, ebbed and surged again over the last year, he held off against considerable pressure from colleagues within the Fed to raise rates earlier and more sharply than the Fed ultimately did when it increased rates a quarter of a point, to 5.5 percent, on March 25.
"The image of Alan Greenspan as a chairman who cares only about beating down inflation no matter what the cost in terms of growth and employment is wildly at variance with the actions of the Federal Reserve under his leadership," said Alan S. Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman who is now an economics professor at Princeton University.
No one is arguing that Mr. Greenspan has gone soft on inflation, and the long series of rate increases he engineered in 1994 and early 1995 are evidence of his willingness to take unpopular action to squelch any threat from rising prices. Indeed, Mr. Greenspan can probably afford to be open minded about the nation's capacity to grow without inflation only because he has built such inflation-fighting credibility in the financial markets.
And the limits of Mr. Greenspan's pragmatic approach may be disclosed on May 20, when the central bank must decide whether growth remains so strong that it justifies another rate increase, even though, as Mr. Greenspan himself put it in a speech on Thursday night, "There is scant evidence of any imminent resurgence of inflation."
But some economists consider it a telling sign of Mr. Greenspan's pragmatism that the Fed would even be debating whether another rate increase is necessary, given that unemployment is so low and that growth was 5.6 percent in the first quarter and 3.8 percent in the preceding quarter, well above what most economists see as the economy's "speed limit" of around 2.25 percent.
"He's not a monetary theoretician, he's a detail man, and that's what makes him open to this kind of shift," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, an investment firm. "My sense is that he's willing to continue this experiment and perhaps be more moderate in any tightening steps he takes and to spread them over a longer period of time."
As he has surveyed the economy over the last few years, Mr. Greenspan has expressed doubts about the widely held notion that there is a fixed rate of employment below which inflation will inevitably begin rising. He has asked whether official statistics might be understating improvements in productivity, a critical component in measuring the economy's capacity to grow without igniting inflation. And he has frequently argued that the primary inflation gauge, the Consumer Price Index, significantly overstates increases in the cost of living, meaning that price pressures could be even more quiescent than they appear.
"Greenspan to his credit is trying to deal with a world that may have changed," said Mickey D. Levy, the chief economist at Nationsbank Capital Markets in New York.
Even Mr. Greenspan's well-known unwillingness to speak in plain English is giving way to new clarity. Although Mr. Greenspan still hedges his bets in publicly assessing the likelihood of interest rate changes, he has responded to Congressional criticism that the Fed is too secretive by more frequently laying out in relatively unambiguous terms his view of the economy and his rationale for policy shifts.
One constant theme in Mr. Greenspan's thinking has been how to explain the low growth in productivity -- output per hour of work -- in light of the huge investments that companies have made in computers and other technology to make themselves more efficient. Although economists have measured significant improvements in manufacturing productivity, there has been no corresponding improvement in service-sector productivity, at least in macro-economic statistics.
Yet narrower indicators of improving productivity, like a continued rise in corporate profit margins six years into the business cycle, suggest that companies are becoming more efficient, enabling them to hold down costs and therefore to avoid inflationary price increases.
"This cyclical pattern is contrary to our experience and it suggests there may be an undetected delayed bonus from technical and managerial efficiencies coming from massive advances in computer and telecommunications technology applications over the last two decades," Mr. Greenspan said in his speech on Thursday.
Although most of his colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board subscribe, to one degree or another, to the theory that there is an unemployment rate below which strong growth will inevitably ignite inflation, Mr. Greenspan has emerged as a doubter. Mr. Greenspan's position probably helped keep the Fed from tightening monetary policy last year as the unemployment rate fell steadily, analysts said.
"He's been unwavering in his pursuit of low inflation, but the research he's directed, the statements he's made and the decisions he's made have reflected understanding and flexibility about very difficult issues of potential growth and productivity and unemployment," Mr. Levy said.

HEADLINE: Once Again, A Landmark Faces a Suit To Foreclose

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
A Japanese bank filed a lawsuit today charging the owner of the Chrysler Building, one of New York's most famous landmarks, with failing to maintain its mortgage payments, and said it would try to foreclose on the property.
The suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan by Fuji Bank Ltd., charges that the building's owner, Jack Kent Cooke Inc., which also owns the Washington Redskins football team and The Los Angeles Daily News, missed about $5 million in payments for debt and service fees that were due on April 30 and May 1. 
 The Cooke company, which purchased the 77-story building and the adjacent Kent Building at 42d Street and Lexington Avenue in 1979, said in a one-paragraph statement that its Chrysler Properties subsidiary intended to "restructure its debt arrangement with Fuji Bank, notwithstanding Fuji's institution of foreclosure proceedings."
Calls to the company for elaboration were not returned. People who answered the telephone at the Chrysler Properties office in New York also declined to comment, as did a lawyer at the firm representing the bank, Shearman & Sterling. Officials at Fuji Bank could not be reached.
The lawsuit also asked the court to bar a separate foreclosure move by any other entity with an interest in the building. It named, among others, the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, which owns the land beneath the building, and New York City and State. The lawsuit said the building's owner may owe taxes.
Officials at Cooper Union declined to comment.
Jack Kent Cooke, who was better known for his role as the Redskins' owner, died last month at the age of 84. The company's statement made no allusion to Mr. Cooke's death, but it did say that other possessions in his financial empire would not be affected by the debt restructuring.
The Chrysler Building, with its Art Deco silver spire, has been one of the city's most prominent skyscrapers since its construction in 1929. But as a commercial real estate property, its history has been far less lofty. Mr. Cooke bought the building after the previous lenders, the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, foreclosed on the property, taking it from its previous owners, Sol Goldman and Alex DiLorenzo.
Mr. Cooke's company later refinanced the $250 million mortgage in 1987, or, as the company's statement today described it, "the height of the New York real estate market."
Many companies that refinanced commercial mortgages at that time got into trouble later, as real estate values plummeted during the recession of the late 1980's and early 90's. But foreclosures have become much less common as the city's property markets have come back and as the amount of vacant commercial space has declined.
Many Japanese banks, including Fuji, have also stumbled in the 1990's, as a recession has hit the Japanese economy and its real estate market.

HEADLINE: V.I.P.'s Aplenty Flock to Bill Gates's 'Summit'

BYLINE: By CAREY GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, May 9

 BODY:
Forget Davos. Forget the Bohemian Grove Retreat. Bill Gates, the richest man in America and considered by some the most important man in the world, has put in his opening bid to become the host with the most -- the most ability to pack the most chief executives and political heavyweights into one party of his creation, that is.
The Microsoft "C.E.O. Summit," held here on Thursday and today, drew Vice President Al Gore, Steve Forbes and Reed E. Hundt, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, as well as more than 100 other V.I.P.'s representing 25 countries and a constellation of businesses and industries. 
 The digital-era do featured a dinner on Thursday night at Mr. Gates's futuristic mansion-in-progress on Lake Washington -- the first high-profile entertaining he has done there -- that brought a buzzing pack of maritime onlookers in boats and on Jet Skis. Guests arrived by cruise boat.
The formal purpose of the conference, Microsoft officials say, was to explore how technology is changing the world of business and to share Mr. Gates's vision of the future.
"There was a common search for just what should be the dimension of the C.E.O.'s competence in knowing enough about technology to deal with how to integrate technology into the organization," said Paul Hazen, chief executive of Wells Fargo & Company.
But in practice the conference, which was almost entirely closed to the news media, provided participants and distant observers alike a new glimpse at a subject of endless fascination: every aspect of the world according to Bill Gates.
Guests toured the offices of the Microsoft Corporation, the company that Mr. Gates co-founded in 1975 and that earned more than $2 billion in 1996. Even better, they got a rare inside look at the Gates techno-mansion, designed in many ways as the house of the future.
One guest said Mr. Gates had given a tour of his library, which includes a famous notebook of Leonardo and voluminous papers of Napoleon. The library, the guest said, is a room with a rotunda, and around the rotunda is stenciled an inscription from "The Great Gatsby." Mr. Gates's wife, Melinda, joked that the couple were such fans of F. Scott Fitzgerald that they might install a green light on the end of their dock, as in "Gatsby," the guest said.
The house, said another guest, Mr. Hazen, is so full of beautiful wood and detail that those touches seemed to upstage high-tech features like the huge video screen that took up a full wall in the dining room. Among the futuristic treats Mr. Gates has said the house will include are other giant screens, which will display changeable digitized images, and climate control that follows a guest from room to room.
In his speech to the gathering, Mr. Gates largely covered ground already set forth in his best-selling book, "The Road Ahead" (Viking, 1995). He warned that people tend to focus too much on how technology will change in two years and not enough on how it will change in ten, and he spoke of a need for companies to create systems that transmit information so quickly that they are like "digital nervous systems."
"Fulfill your wildest dreams," he told the executives in a Willy Wonka moment, declaring that computing power would continue to increase at a pace allowing them to do so.
If there was one particularly intriguing aspect to the Gates gathering, it was the guest list, which was supposed to be secret but was posted by Hotwired, the on-line offshoot of Wired magazine. The list included no one from I.B.M., for example; it included Wells Fargo but not Citibank or the Bank of America; there was Ford but no General Motors or Chrysler.
Many of the omissions or inclusions could be explained by enmities and alliances of Microsoft, but the guests did appear somewhat less comprehensively chosen than the ranks of those who attend the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, each year, or the close-knit Old Guard that goes on retreat with the Bohemian Club of San Francisco, invitees who have included Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
Technology companies were heavily represented, but it was nonetheless somewhat surprising when Vice President Gore welcomed the presence of Gen. Kenneth Minihan, the head of the National Security Agency, the supersecret Government eavesdropping service.
Mr. Gore, in his own speech to the conference, discussed how "two changes, globalization and the revolution in information technology, have combined to create a new age with an entirely new business reality."
Both he and Mr. Gates struck a powerfully positive chord: that among the effects of changing technology was a great new value placed on workers themselves, the human capital without which the technology is worthless.
"Knowledge workers," Mr. Gates said, "are not like factory equipment."

HEADLINE: Varied Reasons Found for Welfare Rolls' Drop

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Armed with a complex mathematical model, the Council of Economic Advisers today tried to shed light on the perplexing question being asked in welfare offices across the country: why are the rolls falling so fast?
They answered with statistical precision. 
 In the view of the President's economists, 44.1 percent of the sharp decline stems from the nation's recent economic growth, and 30.9 percent comes from the variety of state welfare experiments approved during President Clinton's first four years.
The remaining 25 percent were lumped together in the economists' catch-all category: other.
For all its precision, the advisers' report essentially ratified the conventional view that the unprecedented welfare decline stems from a combination of both good times and tough laws.
The report was silent on the question of what has happened to the former recipients. Are they keeping jobs and climbing an economic ladder? Or losing benefits and falling deeper into poverty? "We have no way of knowing in the data we looked at what happened to the women who left the rolls," said Janet Yellen, the council's chairwoman.
From January 1993 to January 1996 the welfare rolls fell by 20 percent and an unprecedented 2.75 million people left the rosters of public aid. That reduction followed an equally explosive growth in the previous four years, when the welfare rolls shot up by 25 percent.
The report covers the decline that had already occurred before last year's landmark welfare law. That law, which establishes new work requirements and time limits, is still being phased in.
But in the preceding four years, the Administration had approved 43 waivers that allowed states to conduct a variety of welfare experiments. Some imposed new work rules or time limits. Others offered more generous incentives to welfare recipients who took jobs. Still others increased the financial penalties on welfare recipients who failed to seek work or training.
In attributing 31 percent of the decline of the rolls to changes in welfare policy, those were the programs the report had in mind.
Bruce Reed, the President's domestic policy adviser, pointed toward the numbers as vindication of the increasingly strict laws being enforced around the country. "I think this is further proof that welfare reform works," he said. "We see that what's behind the welfare reduction isn't just 'the economy stupid' -- it's welfare reform as well."
But Wendell Primus, a former Federal welfare official who resigned last year to protest the new Federal law, offered a different interpretation. Pointing to an appendix in the economists' report, Mr. Primus noted they had produced a range of estimates of the welfare waivers' effects -- from as little as 13 percent (in what the council said was a less sophisticated model) to as much as 31 percent (in a more sophisticated model).
In either event, he said, the economy was more important. "Other reasonable people could look at this and say the economy was the dominant factor, and downplay the waivers," he said. Mr. Primus also said that welfare recipients were being lured from the rolls by the recent expansion in wage subsidies and medical insurance, which make entry-level jobs more attractive.
Asked about the caseload reductions in a January news conference, President Clinton said: "About half of this decline comes from an improved economy, and about half of it comes from intensified efforts to move people from welfare to work."
Noting the President's words, Mr. Primus added: "When the President said it was 50-50, there are some limitations on the C.E.A.'s ability to find something different than that."

HEADLINE: Prices of Treasury Securities Gain After Greenspan Remarks

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities gained ground yesterday as some investors interpreted comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, as a hint that the Fed would not raise interest rates this month.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 7/32, to 96 23/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.89 percent, from 6.93 percent on Thursday, but off its early low of 6.88 percent. 
 Mr. Greenspan, in a speech at a dinner on Thursday night in Manhattan, defended the Fed's rate increase in March. He did not say whether he would push for another rate increase when the Fed policy makers next meet on May 20. Still, analysts said that Mr. Greenspan's speech suggested that the Fed saw an economic slowdown this year, which could forestall any additional rate increases.
"Although the view of an immediate rise in short-term rates is not universal, it appears that the momentum generated by the bulls clearly overpowered" those who expect the Fed to raise rates on May 20, said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
Mr. Chan said some investors were impressed with the amount of time the Fed chairman spent justifying the previous rate increase and that they said someone on the defensive was less likely to raise rates soon.
Early gains, however, were pared, as some investors sold on the belief that the market had overreacted to Mr. Greenspan's comments.
For the week the yield is up a basis point, coming off a disappointing quarterly debt refunding by the Treasury that drove the yield up to 6.96 percent.
Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank, Bank of Boston, said he saw the Fed chairman's comments as more aggressive and leaning toward a rate increase.
"We're still in the camp that there is a better than 50 percent chance they will tighten in May," Mr. Ablin said, "even though we see no reason they need to."
April retail sales due next Tuesday, Mr. Ablin said, are expected to show a tapering off, with the wild cards for the market obviously the inflation numbers, the Producer Price Index on Wednesday and the Consumer Price Index on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Internet Commerce Pioneer Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
A pioneering company in the field of Internet commerce led by Jim P. Manzi, the former chairman of the Lotus Development Corporation, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday.
Mr. Manzi's company, Nets Inc., ran an on-line shopping mall for manufacturers selling basic industrial goods from ball bearings to glue guns. Mr. Manzi, 45, joined the company in January 1996, six months after Lotus was acquired by the International Business Machines Corporation for $3.5 billion. Mr. Manzi pocketed an estimated $78 million from the I.B.M. deal. 
 Business-to-business commerce on the Internet is expected to grow to $66 billion by 2000 from $600 million last year, estimates Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. But the early growth has come mainly from big companies selling directly to their industrial customers on line.
The Internet middleman role assumed by Mr. Manzi's Industry.Net service, analysts say, is developing more slowly. The company has had thousands of mostly small and medium-sized manufacturers and distributors sign onto Industry.Net. But the transaction business that was to generate most of the company's revenues has come along far more slowly than Mr. Manzi and his staff had hoped.
Nets, analysts say, made a mistake in trying to be a broad-based industrial mall rather than trying to nurture on-line business communities in a few selected fields.
"It was a mile wide and an inch deep," said Stan Dolberg, an analyst with Forrester. "To work, an on-line marketplace has to be targeted and run by people who really understand the industries they are in. Manzi didn't."
Nets is a private company that does not publicly report its financial results. Yet the company, one analyst estimated, had revenues of less than $20 million a year -- well below its once-ambitious business plan -- and losses of nearly $10 million.
Nets filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code shortly after 4 P.M. yesterday in a Federal court in Boston.
All but about 15 of the company's 200 employees in Cambridge and Pittsburgh were laid off. The remaining employees will stay to maintain the company's Industry.Net site on the World Wide Web, while Mr. Manzi tries to put together a reorganization plan and decide whether the company can be revived.
In an E-mail message to employees, Mr. Manzi portrayed the company's problems as mainly a financial pinch. "As I said on the day I made my initial investment in this company, there is a great business concept here with great potential," Mr. Manzi wrote. "However, on that first day, I also said the company needed much stronger financial support than it had received in the years prior to my joining it."
Industry.Net was founded in 1990 by Donald H. Jones, a Pittsburgh entrepreneur and lecturer at Carnegie Mellon University.
In his E-mail missive, Mr. Manzi explained that Wall Street's recent disillusion with Internet stocks meant that new venture capital money was difficult to attract. He had managed, he said, to get "substantial commitments from some long-term investors in Japan," but that was simply not enough.
Recently, Mr. Manzi added, "I alone had been funding the company for the past few weeks at a cost of some $500,000 a week."
Still, analysts say Mr. Manzi has not put a large share of his personal wealth into the company, estimating his investment at $5 million or less.
"This is still a great business idea," Mr. Manzi added, "and over the next several days we will evaluate how much of the dream we can continue to pursue."

Bosnian Federation to Get Heavy Artillery Pieces
The United States said it would provide the Bosnian Federation with 116 heavy artillery pieces. The move is meant to strengthen the Muslim-Croat Federation so American forces can withdraw from Bosnia within a year. The arms shipment would still leave the Serbs with far greater numbers of heavy guns, though the precise military balance is impossible to determine. 1
 
Iraqis May Be Deported
At least 13 Iraqis seeking political asylum in the United States have been jailed in California because they are suspected of being Iraqi spies or potential terrorists, and they may be expelled from the country. The men collaborated with the Central Intelligence Agency after the gulf war in a failed attempt to undermine Saddam Hussein. 1 
 
U.S. Envoy in Vietnam
Pete Peterson, a former prisoner of war, arrived in Hanoi to become the first United States Ambassador to Vietnam in 22 years. Mr. Peterson said he hoped that a trade agreement would be signed soon but that he would also push for the fullest possible accounting of the 2,124 Americans still listed as missing in Indochina. 1
 
Clinton Praises Costa Rica 
President Clinton stood in the rain at a rain forest to praise Costa Rica's innovative environmental practices. He said that he would lead the American delegation to a United Nations environmental summit meeting this summer in New York in an effort to raise the meeting's international profile. 6
 
Venetian Rebels Arrested
The police arrested eight Italian separatists who had raised the flag of the republic of Venice over the Campanile after storming St. Mark's Square. The separatists, wearing ski masks, bore automatic weapons and were escorted by a tractor clad in sheet metal. No shots were fired. 5
 
Mobutu Delays His Return
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire stayed in Gabon and did not return home. Laurent Kabila, the rebel leader whose forces control more than three-quarters of the country, was reported to have agreed to another meeting with Mr. Mobutu. But in Geneva, the United Nations accused the rebels of blocking an investigation into reports that they have killed thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern Zaire. 3
 
Israel Is Criticized
A United Nations committee in Geneva condemned Israel for using interrogation techniques the panel described as state-sanctioned torture. The committee rejected Israel's contention that physical coercion was necessary to elicit information about future terrorist acts, and it demanded that such practices "cease immediately." Israel rejected the conclusion. 6

Filling In Budget Blanks Proves a Formidable Task
A week after President Clinton and the Republicans announced an agreement to balance the budget by 2002, some wondered whether the deal was unraveling. In their eagerness to get a deal, the two sides made their announcement before critical loose ends were tied up, leaving confusion about details. 1
 
Gates Draws a Crowd
The Microsoft "CEO Summit" was held in Seattle at Bill Gates's futuristic mansion-in-progress on Lake Washington -- the first high-profile entertaining he has done there. The formal purpose of the conference was to explore how technology is changing the world of business. 7

An Answer to Welfare Puzzle
The Council of Economic Advisers said welfare rolls were shrinking because of good economic times and tough laws. The council, which advises the President, said that 44.1 percent of the sharp decline stemmed from the nation's recent economic growth and that 30.9 percent came from state welfare experiments. 26

Looking at McVeigh's Steps
Prosecutors in the trial of Timothy J. McVeigh, accused of the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City, tried to show jurors how Mr. McVeigh had spent his time in the days before the attack. They put on the stand the owners of a taxi company, a fast food restaurant and a truck rental shop. 7
 
Berrigan Chooses to Stay in Jail
 Philip F. Berrigan, the former priest and longtime peace advocate, is remaining in jail in Portland, Me., in part because he will not promise to stay away from the Bath Iron Works shipyard in Bath, Me., where he and five colleagues vandalized a Navy destroyer. 26
 
No Millions for Paint Flaws
The Alabama Supreme Court reduced a $2 million award against BMW to $50,000, in a case that had become a rallying cry for critics of big jury awards. The award was won by a Birmingham doctor who had not been told that his new BMW sedan had been partly repainted to touch up damage. (AP)

A Suburban Hunt Nabs a Pesky Bear
A dragnet involving at least three suburban police departments in Westchester County snared a wandering bear on the 15th hole of the Ridgeway Country Club's golf course, a short walk from Bloomingdale's on the edge of downtown White Plains. 1
 
2 Guards Shot in Holdup
Masked robbers ambushed and wounded the two guards of a payroll shipment in Flushing. The guards, a retired police officer and an off-duty detective, had more than a dozen bullet wounds, the authorities said. The robbers got least $50,000 in cash, then fled in a van, which blew a tire. They hopped a bus and are still at large, the authorities said. 21
 
Dispute Over Chrysler Building
 A Japanese bank is seeking to foreclose on the Chrysler Building, one of New York's most famous landmarks. The lawsuit says thebuilding's owner, Jack Kent Cooke Inc., which also owns the Washington Redskins football team, missed about $5 million in payments. In a statement, the company said its Chrysler Properties subsidiary intended to "restructure its debt arrangement with Fuji Bank." The company purchased the 77-story building in 1979. 22
 
Acquittal in Officer's Death
A man charged in the death of a police officer who was investigating a domestic dispute was acquitted last night of those charges. A Bronx jury found the man, Anthony Richard Rivers, 33, guilty of attempted assault in the domestic dispute last May. In that incident, Officer Vincent Guidice, 27, fell on a mirror and bled to death. 23
 
A Time of Reckoning
Today's competition is crucial for the chess champion Garry Kasparov in his match against Deep Blue, the I.B.M. computer. After four games -- a win for each side followed by two grueling draws -- the score is 2-2 with two games to play, and the uncertainty about the outcome is profound. The champion has clearly been shaken and, at times, been irritated by his opponent, and Game 5 today appears to be his best chance for a breakthrough. 21

Dollar Shows Decline
The dollar ended the week with a 5 percent loss in value against the Japanese yen, its biggest setback to date in its rally from a record low just over two years ago. The fall followed comments from Japanese officials who hinted that the Government was ready to intervene in the currency markets to bring down the value of the dollar. The dollar also declined against the German mark and other European currencies. 33
 
A Reappraisal for Greenspan
The limits of the pragmatic approach of the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, may be revealed on May 20, when the central bank must decide whether growth remains so strong that it justifies another interest rate increase. But Mr. Greenspan is increasingly being seen as flexible in his approach to inflation. 33

Dow Average Up for Week, Bolstered by Bond Rally
Stocks ended a seesaw week on the up side, as a rally in bonds lifted bank shares and a sharp drop in the dollar bolstered exporters. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 32.91 points, to 7,169.53, and was up 1.4 percent for the week. The Standard & Poor's 500 index jumped 4.52, to 824.78, for a one-week gain of 1.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.22, to 1,335.05, and was up 2.3 percent on the week. [Page 34.]
 
Greenspan's Remarks Buoy Bonds
Prices of Treasury securities advanced as some investors took comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, on Thursday night to be a hint that the Fed would not raise interest rates this month. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 17/32, to 96 23/32, pushing its yield down to 6.89 percent, from 6.93 percent on Thursday. [34.]
 
Hong Kong Telecom Stake Sold
A company controlled by China's central Government, China Everbright Holdings, has bought a 7.74 percent stake in Hong Kong Telecommunications, one of the world's most sophisticated telecommunications companies and a major subsidiary of Cable and Wireless of Britain. It paid $8.6 billion (Hong Kong), or $1.11 billion (United States). [35.]
 
Questions on Budget Agreement
Was there, in fact, a budget agreement between President Clinton and Congressional Republicans on May 2, and what did it contain? Those questions have reverberated around Capitol Hill this week as one problem after another has hampered the process of translating the oral agreement into writing. It was clear that, eager for a deal, the two sides made their announcement before critical loose ends were tied up. News Analysis. [1.]
 
Sallie Mae Dissidents Cite Gains
Dissident shareholders of the Student Loan Marketing Association said that they were making gains but were still short of votes in an effort to keep Sallie Mae's focus solely on the student loan business. Under a plan approved by Congress, Sallie Mae, a Government-sponsored corporation with $47 billion in assets, will be privatized by next spring. The dissidents oppose the company's proposal to branch into other businesses like consulting, software development and insurance. [36.]
 
Judge Rejects Barney's Request
A Federal bankruptcy judge, as expected, rejected a request by Barney's Inc. to offer $10 million in breakup fees to attract a new potential bidder. The judge also said that he would appoint a mediator to oversee the bidding, possibly as early as Monday. The upscale retailer has received a $240 million bid from Dickson Concepts, a Hong Kong retailer, and a $290 million bid from Saks Holdings, which operates Saks Fifth Avenue. The Neiman Marcus Group and several other international retail concerns have also expressed interest. [35.]
 
Bill Gates in Role as Host
Bill Gates, the richest man in America, has put in his bid to become the host with the most -- the most ability to pack the most chief executives and political heavyweights into one gathering. The Microsoft "C.E.O. Summit" in Seattle included Vice President Al Gore; Steve Forbes, the former Presidential candidate, Reed E. Hundt, the F.C.C. chairman, and more than 100 V.I.P.'s from 25 countries and a constellation of businesses and industries. Microsoft's formal purpose was to explore how technology is changing the world of business and to share Mr. Gates's vision of the future. [7.]
 
Wheat Prices Rise on Lack of Rain
Grain prices rose on the Chicago Board of Trade as persistent dry weather in the western Plains threatened to reduce wheat yields needed to replenish lean inventories. Wheat for July delivery rose 4.75 cents, to $4.1375 a bushel. Soybeans also rose. On other markets, gold and platinum surged. [36.]
 
Seagate Loses in English Court
Seagate Technology said that the High Court of Justice in England had awarded Amstrad P.L.C. $93 million in a lawsuit over reportedly faulty disk drives sold by Seagate. Interest and other costs could increase the award by $60 million, resulting in a charge of a like amount to Seagate's current quarter. Seagate said it planned to appeal the decision. [35.]

HEADLINE: The Tax Pipeline to Albany: Does It Flow North or South?

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 9

 BODY:
The Mayor bitterly protested that the people of New York City, the state's great economic engine, sent more to Albany in taxes than they got back in services. The city, he said, was always shortchanged, forced to subsidize upstate regions.
The Mayor was Fernando Wood, and the year was 1861. But the speaker could just as easily have been Fiorello H. La Guardia, Edward I. Koch, David N. Dinkins or, of course, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani resurrected the debate when he presented his budget on Thursday, all but calling state leaders an upstate cabal trying to rob the city of its due. 
 But just as the Mayor's refrain is treated as conventional wisdom in the city, the opposite is an article of faith in much of the rest of the state: that New York City is as much Gomorrah as Gotham, a pit of welfare, corruption, socialism and crime, bleeding the state dry.
So, does the city get robbed of its fair share? The answer, according to several authorities, is . . . sort of. It is clear that the metropolitan area -- meaning New York City and its suburbs -- contributes far more to the state than it gets back. But whether that is true of the city alone is less clear.
A 1992 study by the Center for Governmental Research, a nonprofit group in Rochester, found that the metropolitan region sent far more money to Albany than it received in services. New York City just about breaks even, the center found, but its suburbs pay much more than they receive.
The study, which several experts said was the most recent good look at the issue, found that New York City, with 41 percent of the state's population, paid 39 percent of the state's taxes and got 39 percent of the services.
Mr. Giuliani calculates that the city contributes 45 percent of state taxes, not 39 percent.
The difference lies in how commuters are counted. How should credit be assigned for the income taxes paid by people who live in the suburbs but work in the city? The Center for Governmental Research study, like most previous studies, said commuters' taxes count where they live. Mr. Giuliani says they count where they work, so when calculating the total of tax revenue New York City sends to Albany, the Mayor factors in the state income taxes many commuters pay on salaries earned in his city.
"That is the question it all hinges on," said Abraham Lackman, finance director for the State Senate and Mr. Giuliani's first budget director. "There are other uncertainties involved, but they are much smaller." However the question is answered, he said, that answer is open to attack. Mr. Lackman, by the way, will not say which method he prefers.
Advocates for the city have long argued that suburban and rural politicians tilt things against the city, and some elements of their case are indisputable: New York City schools have 37 percent of the students, but get 34 percent of state education aid. And East River bridge and tunnel tolls, paid mostly by New York City residents, are divided between the city transit system and the suburban railroads, under a 1969 formula that favors the suburbs more with each passing year.
But other parts of the dispute are fuzzier, and some, like welfare and Medicaid, cut both ways. New York City's huge share of the welfare and Medicaid caseloads means that the state spends an enormous amount on city residents who participate in those programs. On the other hand, New York is one of the few states that requires local governments to contribute to those programs: localities in New York have to match state spending on Medicaid and welfare, which creates a huge financial burden for the city.
Mr. Giuliani has raised a number of specific grievances, including the school aid disparity. He contendsthat the city would get little of the benefit from Gov. George E. Pataki's relief plan on the property tax, and that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency, heavily favors the suburbs. He notes that in recent years there have been budget cuts and sharp fare increases at the Transit Authority but spending increases and more modest fare rises at the commuter railroads.
The Governor said during an appearance at the New York Sheraton today that he had proposed correcting the imbalance in school aid for New York City, albeit over a period of several years. He called his proposal "a fair and balanced approach."
The 1992 study said that the relatively affluent suburbs of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties, with 21 percent of the state's population, paid 29 percent of the taxes and received just 16 percent of the benefits. All told, it concluded, the metropolitan region subsidized upstate New York by $3.3 billion a year.
Mr. Giuliani's argument is, if anything, stronger now than when the 1992 study was conducted. Personal income tax collections are up sharply, mostly driven by the bull market on Wall Street; the city's welfare caseload has declined steeply, at a great savings to the state, and the Pataki administration has shifted some spending, in areas like transportation, from the city to other parts of the state.
Nearly everyone who has taken a serious look at the balance of payments between the city and the state says it is difficult, at best, to define the question, much less answer it. That may be why serious attempts are rare. The Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that closely monitors the city and state budgets, last analyzed the issue in 1988, and before that, in 1969.
"It's not a straightforward task," Cindy Green, vice president of the commission and co-author of the 1988 study, said. "Any answer you get is going to be badly flawed and easily criticized."
That 1988 Citizens Budget Commission analysis, using 1985 data, found that the city came out significantly ahead in its balance of payments with Albany, but that report did not look at the suburbs.
"We don't even try to answer this question," said Dennis Tompkins, spokesman for the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall. "Any way you look at it is right and it's wrong at the same time."
Some elements of the calculation are simply matters of judgment. State prisons provide thousands of jobs in upstate towns, a benefit to that region, but if most of the inmates come from the city, are the prisons also a service to the city? Does state support for the Long Island Rail Road count solely as aid to Nassau and Suffolk Counties, or as a benefit to the city as well?
The debate does not always address the limiting political realities. The animosity toward New York City around much of the state, and the Republicans' reliance on votes from outside the city, have always limited what the city could receive from Albany. The tug-of-war moves only very slowly, as Mayor Wood's 1861 lament attests.
Analysts say that the wealthier areas of a state inevitably subsidize the poorer ones, and that metropolitan areas -- unless they are badly depressed -- always end up supporting rural regions. New York City is unusual in having such extreme concentrations of both wealth and poverty. But it is still the primary generator of jobs and income in the state.
The Republicans who control the State Senate argue that the city does just fine, getting back in welfare and Medicaid what it might not get in transportation and education.
Ms. Green asserts that the debate itself is wrongheaded. "A region should get services based on what it needs, not because of what it puts in," she said. "New York City should get more school aid, not because of the taxes it pays, but because it gets less per student and it has more students who are low income, who do not speak English at home."

HEADLINE: The Contest Is Toe-to-Toe and Pawn-to-Pawn

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
After the I.B.M. computer, Deep Blue, won Game 2 against Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion told friends he had been stopped on the street by a Baptist minister who told him to buck up, that help was on the way.
"Really?" Mr. Kasparov said. "From who?" 
 "From our Lord."
"Well," Mr. Kasparov replied, "Currently He seems to be helping my opponent."
Three days later, Mr. Kasparov probably needs all the help he can get. For him, today is D-Day, and maybe for everyone else as well.
After four games -- a victory for each side followed by two grueling draws -- the score is 2-2 with two games to play, and the uncertainty about the outcome is profound. The champion has clearly been shaken and at times irritated by his opponent.
"I think he's still angry that he didn't have any of Deep Blue's games to study," said Owen Williams, Mr. Kasparov's manager. "He's got to sit there at the table figuring out how the computer thinks as the game is going on."
On the other hand, the Deep Blue side is showing great confidence, though not necessarily during the games. In fact, to watch the programmers and their chess advisers hovering over a chess board and analyzing the moves that are being made without them is more or less to witness Dr. Frankenstein at the mercy of his monster. Asked during the fourth game how Deep Blue was faring, Joel Benjamin, a grandmaster who assisted in the programming, shrugged.
"The proof of the pudding is in the eating," he said. "If we win, we'll know it played well."
Meanwhile, as the chess world waits for the decisive weekend, it is bracing for a comeuppance.
"There's a tragic sense here; it's the dying of an age," said Bruce Pandolfini, a chess teacher and the author of dozens of chess books. "Man may no longer be the king of this universe. That's clear, and this is really the last stand."
The drama is especially high because Game 5, which begins at 3 P.M. today at the Equitable Center in Manhattan, is Mr. Kasparov's best chance for a breakthrough. Not only will he have the advantage of playing White and moving first, he will also have had two days to formulate his attack. If he wins, then he will only have to draw in Sunday's final game to win the match.
Most experts, familiar with Mr. Kasparov's brilliance and his history of responding heroically to desperate straits, believe he will prevail today. But the pressure is certainly on. If he draws, then he will be staring down heavy odds on Sunday, having to win as Black against a formidable foe, a task on the order of having to break serve against Pete Sampras.
"It's completely stunning," said Yasser Seirawan, a grandmaster. "Garry needs Game Five if he's to win the match. If Deep Blue can hold him to a draw, the advantage slips into its favor."
Even if the match itself ends in a draw, Mr. Seirawan said, "that would be extraordinary."
Even those who believe Mr. Kasparov has fared well thus far sense that danger is nigh and that Deep Blue has done what few, if any men, have -- reduced the world chess champion to the stature of a mere mortal. The strength of the computer is such that it has turned Mr. Kasparov's chief advantages -- his will, his emotions, his psychological wherewithal -- against him. He has admitted it is wearing him down.
"I think Garry is dominating the match," said Ken Thompson, a computer chess expert. "He was close to winning the last two games, but he is freaked out. If he loses or draws as White, the pressure will be on him in the last round, and he may have to attack when there just aren't attacking chances. And he could lose pushing something that isn't there."
Is Mr. Kasparov really holding the human race on his shoulders? In a sense, he is. Chess players have taken to lamenting that they have been singled out for obsolescence. Already, all the classically forceful chess openings -- out to 10, 15 or even more moves -- have been programmed into Deep Blue, and a database exists that can tell a computer how to play perfectly in every possible endgame with six pieces left on the board. (That's about three billion possibilities.)
"What we're seeing is chess getting squeezed," Mr. Seirawan said, "so that more and more the original moves are all occurring in a window of opportunity called the middle game."
Anyone other than a chess player might say, so what? After all, no one thinks the computer is intelligent, at least according to the conventional definitions of intelligence, which encompasses creativity and learning from experience, things that humans use to play chess. But Deep Blue's behavior has been intelligent; that is, it has been achieving results by calculations that are similar to what a human might do by thinking.
"What we are seeing in this match is a real experiment that is illustrating the evolution of computing power," said Monty Newborn, the chairman of the chess committee for the Association for Computing, and the author of a book about the first Kasparov-Deep Blue match. "Chess has been chosen to raise the issue of whether complex problems are issues of intelligence."
The next step is to ask: If chess expertise can be replicated by a machine, what else can? If you calculate long enough, are abstractions reducible to pure numbers?
"That's a good question," Mr. Newborn said.
Indeed, many people have suggested that after chess, other fields of endeavor -- architecture? economics? (gasp) newspaper reporting? -- are sure to follow.
"Composing symphonies, for example," said Frederick Friedel, who is Mr. Kasparov's computer adviser.
Computers already compose in a rudimentary fashion, he said, "but what if you've got every single piece of music by every composer mapped out in little chunks and the computer is putting them together in different ways, and what if you couldn't tell these from the works of Beethoven or Mozart?"
Would it matter? Beautiful music is beautiful music, and people will not stop composing it because a computer can, any more than chess players are going to stop playing chess.
"The point is," said Mr. Friedel, who has a degree in philosophy, "in the future, we're going to have computers performing like the best human beings in all sorts of ways. We're going to know they're doing something incredibly primitive to achieve this result. But we're going to have to deal with it."
Dealing with it is what the Deep Blue team does in the war room, a cramped television control booth with a couple of video screens and the detritus of a never-ending lunch scattered around. During every game, the programmers, along with Mr. Benjamin and Miguel Illescas, another grandmaster, mostly spend their time trying out the moves that Deep Blue tells them it is mulling over.
The computer itself is in an adjoining room, but its thought processes are being reproduced on a screen in the corner, lines and lines of minute, coded numbers incessantly scrolling upward. The process it follows is to look ahead in the game three or four moves, analyze all the possibilities numerically, and select the one with the highest score. And though this is only an initial suggestion, it tends to send the programmers into nervous, hand-wringing action, moving pieces around the chessboard, often accompanied by head scratching and mumbling.
Meanwhile, Deep Blue has begun to look further into the game along the trees of possibility suggested by the selected move. And sometimes, the initially selected move shrinks in appeal as the search proceeds deeper. In that case, it will return to the beginning and look for a move that will yield a better result. This can take up to a few minutes, but the computer is programmed not to take more than a third of its remaining time for any one move.
So if initially, taking a Kasparov pawn with a rook yields a rating of say, 50, and that number shrinks to 27 by the time Deep Blue has examined its consequences 10 moves hence, it would try other possibilities.
(A pawn advantage for Deep Blue would register as 100, so a score of 50 would indicate Deep Blue's advantage is the equivalent of half a pawn.)
In any case, the trying of various moves and the resulting scores appearing on screen naturally heats up the human activity in the room.
"I don't like that," Mr. Illescas said, at one point, to himself. "Garry has chances." A few moments later, he reversed himself.
"We have better chances," he said.
All of this lends the match a palpable eerieness, which is perhaps most evident watching the champion himself in the match room. During each game, Mr. Kasparov has engaged in his customary brow-furrowing, chin-clenching, eyebrow-raising, jaw muscle-bunching and occasional nervous pacing that has unnerved many a human opponent.
The discombobulating element is that against Deep Blue, his fierce combativeness has no target. Across the board sits someone with a placid expression, a calmness that has to be infuriating. He is not a chess expert; he is just doing what he's told, a robot's robot.
Joe Hoane, one of the three I.B.M. researchers who have been the arms of Deep Blue in this match, said the three hours he spent sitting across from Mr. Kasparov on Tuesday gave him the first chance he had had in months to think about chess, and not computers.
"I don't play well," Mr. Hoane said, "but this was a real chance to observe the beauty of what was going on."
And how did he feel out there, not only across from the legendary champion in the champion's milieu, but, in some sense, on the frontier?
"For some reason," Mr. Hoane said, "I was terrified."

HEADLINE: Ex-Leaders of Harlem Agency Defend Development Record

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Former officials of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, responding to criticism from the Pataki administration that their organization was rife with mismanagement and did little in 23 years, are mounting a defense of their record and have dismissed the attacks as politically motivated.
Donald J. Cogsville, the former president of the defunct Harlem corporation, which for a generation was the prime hope of redevelopment in Harlem, called the criticism from a Pataki administration official a "hostile, even careless, screed" and said he was proud of his corporation's record. 
 Mr. Cogsville was reacting to a series of audits of the Harlem corporation released 10 days ago by the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's main public development organization. The audits raised questions about financial controls in the Harlem corporation and some of the findings are now under investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office and by the State Commission on Investigation.
On a tour of Harlem this week, Mr. Cogsville pointed to new and renovated housing along 110th Street, rehabilitated housing along Frederick Douglass Boulevard and commercial development on 125th Street, including the Apollo Theater and Mart 125, an indoor market. He said those were among the projects his agency helped bring to fruition.
Mr. Cogsville bitterly rejected the analysis of Empire State officials that the Harlem corporation had little to show for the $100 million in state money it spent over more than two decades. He said his group's role was to help private developers with design and planning and to grant seed money.
"I never said I had a construction crew out there," Mr. Cogsville said.
The former Harlem corporation officials also said they helped to create more than 4,000 new residences and to rehabilitate an additional 2,400.
Mr. Cogsville's 12-page response was issued this week by the office of Representative Charles B. Rangel, who was the most influential member of the Harlem corporation's board before it was dissolved by the Pataki administration in 1995. The corporation was replaced by the Harlem Community Development Corporation.
Mr. Cogsville said the release of the audits by the Empire State officials was intended to "discredit the elected leadership of Harlem," particularly Mr. Rangel.
Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, dismissed Mr. Cogsville's response as "a pathetic attempt at revisionist history by a former H.U.D.C. official who is trying to claim credit for the success spearheaded by others in Harlem."
Mr. Cogsville and other former agency officials disputed the allegation by Empire State officials that 20 to 30 percent of the agency's expenditures were not properly documented and that three-quarters of the money was spent on overhead, personnel and consultants.
Although some of the annual audits of the agency revealed problems with internal financial controls within the Harlem corporation, they did not expose the extreme levels of mismanagement that the Pataki administration is now alleging.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Dry Weather in Plains States Brings Surge in Grain Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Grain prices rose yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade as persistent dry weather in the western Plains threatened to reduce wheat yields needed to replenish lean inventories.
Soybeans also rose. On other markets, gold and platinum surged. 
 Farmers, traders and Government officials touring western Kansas have indicated that crops will suffer if Kansas, the nation's top wheat-producing state, does not get rain within 10 days. Yields could also be reduced in parts of Colorado and Nebraska that are dry.
As it stands now, crop scouts on the annual Wheat Quality Council tour predict that Kansas will harvest 336.2 million bushels this year, 31 percent more than last year's relatively poor crop.
The estimate was below most trade expectations, and could fall further if forecasts for dry weather through the end of the month hold true.
A robust crop is needed because United States wheat reserves are expected to fall to half their normal levels by the end of May.
Wheat for July delivery rose 4.75 cents, to $4.1375 a bushel.
Corn and soybean futures prices rose on forecasts for cool Midwestern weather early next week that could delay planting.
July corn rose 3.5 cents, to $2.88 a bushel, and July soybeans rose 5 cents, to $8.89 a bushel.
Precious metals futures prices advanced on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Gold futures posted their largest one-day jump since Feb. 27 as the Japanese yen strengthened against the dollar, making gold cheaper for Asian purchasers, said Tim Porter, an analyst with Refco Inc.
Platinum and palladium futures rose on worries that shipments of Russian supplies will be delayed for a fifth month.
Russia's huge Norilsk nickel mine is the world's largest producer of palladium, but virtually none of the mine's output has reached international customers since the end of last year because of persistent labor troubles and economic problems in Russia.
June gold rose $4.60, to $349.40 an ounce. June palladium was up the $6 limit, to $163.90 an ounce; July platinum rose $9.70, to $389.20 an ounce.

HEADLINE: Designing a War Against Crime

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
The corner of Armstrong Avenue and Martin Luther King Drive is conspicuous these days, mainly because of what is absent.
On the sidewalk, where clusters of drug dealers once did business, there is only a sturdy brown trash can. Down the street, burned-out buildings have been razed, some replaced with bright prefabricated town houses. Boom boxes for the most part no longer boom. And nighttime shootings, when they occur, usually occur at least a couple of blocks away. 
 "Now my kids can come out and play," said Carolyn Young, who lives across from a fenced-in lot that once was a crack house. "The bums aren't hanging out and it's quiet at night."
"Before, there was drug activity everywhere," she said, scooting her boys, aged 5 and 12, down the street.
Like many other areas of the city, this section, part of what the police designate as the southern district, was far more forbidding before the decade began. Gang members ruled the corners, drunks took up park benches and thieves preyed on commuters and old ladies walking home from the bank. Typical of police methods of the time, officers remained sealed in their cars waiting for crime to happen, and they seldom got to know anyone in the community except the people they repeatedly arrested.
But in 1990, motivated by overwhelming drug crime and with a chance to get Federal grants to combat it, the Jersey City Police Department decided it was time for a fresh approach. The police force bought its first computer system and hired researchers in an experiment to literally create a map of crime in selected parts of the city. The result has been a dramatic drop-off in criminal activity in the targeted neighborhoods, and a new sense that the streets are safer and the bad guys are on the run.
Once, crime fighting was based on educated assumptions, not empirical evidence, knowledge that was carried in the minds of individual officers.
That had to change, the department concluded, and with it the mindset of a traditional police force whose members had long been accustomed to responding to crimes after the fact.
As the researchers gauged the moves of criminals and the countermoves of the police, officers slowly began to emerge from their cars and onto the streets, quantifying who was doing what to whom and why. The result was a flowing picture of crime -- captured on computer spread sheets. It is called problem-oriented policing -- tailoring specific responses to each type of crime and location.
Drug dealers watched as city workers fenced in their favorite hangout or tore down the abandoned building where they stashed their drugs. Panhandlers and public drinkers began showing up at their preferred meeting sites to find that the police had removed the benches. And husbands who repeatedly beat their wives found that 911 brought not only officers but also counselors.
The results were extraordinary, the police say. According to a 14-month study that ended in August 1995, the new techniques decreased overall crime in target areas by 16 percent while crime jumped 42 percent in comparable spots left to traditional patrols.
A snapshot of the entire city showed nearly 700 fewer violent crimes in 1996 than in 1993, and more than a thousand fewer nonviolent crimes, the police said.
"For 100 years we have been using police methods that have never really been studied," said Deputy Chief Frank Gajewski. "And essentially, we were making arrests but no gains."
"Now we are trying to treat the causes behind the crime and study what works and what doesn't," he added, noting that the city had overcome the notoriety, gained in 1989, of being No 2, behind Oakland, Calif., on the list of large cities with major drug problems. At the time, Jersey City recorded 2,754 drug arrests per 100,000 residents (the population was then about 220,000). Last year, Chief Gajewski said, the number was 1,621. "This philosophy is new for us and something a lot of the country is still ignoring. But, so far, it has worked wonders here."

THE PLAN
'X' Marks the Spot
Jersey City, once a gritty but thriving railway and waterfront town, has seen its tax base diminish as manufacturing jobs disappeared in the last 25 years. But there have been signs of hope for the 235,000 residents who make up a multi-ethnic mix of immigrants, old-timers and young professionals. Pockets of gentrification have reclaimed old row houses and a new waterfront financial center has brought 10,000 jobs to the city. Still, the very poor southern and western sections of town account for roughly half of all crime, as well as the majority of drug activity and violence.
The mapping program has allowed the police to direct their response more precisely, with a few computer keystrokes pinpointing centers of car theft, drug selling, robbery, burglary and arson, among others crimes, as well as differentiating between variations of the same crimes. Most communities don't have this ability and even New York City's own mapping system postdates that in Jersey City, according to Anthony A. Braga, a research associate at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who has studied Jersey City's experiment. He said the Jersey City system is so advanced that the police can pinpoint "hot spots" down to a single corner.
Since research has shown that 6 percent of the city's streets are home to 30 percent of its crime, being able to focus on these areas with tailored solutions can greatly increase overall quality of life through redeployment of officers rather than with the huge expense of new hiring, he said.
The idea was first proposed in 1979 by Herman Goldstein, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin, who wrote in the journal Crime and Delinquency that communities would be better served if police departments stopped merely reacting to crime calls and began looking at the underlying reasons why crime was drawn to certain areas.
He called this problem-oriented policing, a philosophy that later underwent fine-tuning in studies conducted in Minneapolis and Kansas City during the 1980's and then was applied more broadly in New York City and Jersey City.
Jersey City became involved after criminologists at Rutgers University offered to help the Police Department compete for several experimental grants being administered by the National Institute of Justice, a branch of the Justice Department that has helped to finance policing studies.
The city was successful, getting a $837,423 grant to develop a drug-market analysis program in 1990. This computer database is now used to map all types of crimes throughout the city. Several other grants followed from a variety of agencies. While some helped to pay for more officers, many furthered the change of philosophy in the department, allowing studies in preventing crime in housing projects, targeting violent places and reducing domestic violence.
Though the department has yet to train its entire force in problem-oriented policing and the use of computer mapping, Chief Gajewski said he believed that in a few years all 859 officers in the city's four precincts and three substations would be trained to study and identify the root causes of crime in their districts, then take steps to battle it.
Crime continues to be a boilerplate issue around the country, and is at the heart of an increasingly shrill mayoral campaign here. Jerramiah T. Healy, a Democrat and former judge, who is trying to unseat Mayor Bret Schundler, a Republican, in Tuesday's election, has taken out full-page ads in The Jersey Journal asserting that crime is the worst it has been in years. The Mayor has counterattacked, calling the allegations baseless and misleading.
Chief Gajewski said he was hopeful that his policing model would not fall victim to politics. He added that it has already survived one mayoral change and several police chiefs.
The structure of the department is being altered to respond to the new model, with specific officers assigned to neighborhoods and linked with city workers (from departments like housing or sanitation, for example) and community representatives to tackle not just criminals but the trash or dilapidation that often attract them. At the same time, radio cars are freed to respond to emergencies. And lesser burdens, like calls to report accidents for insurance forms, which have tended to take hours of police time, will soon be taken over by civilians hired by the department.
In the end, Chief Gajewski said, the department's new philosophy and assignment of officers to specific locales and tasks will save not only time but money. He also hopes that more areas will see the changes that the side streets off Armstrong and Martin Luther King have come to expect.

A CORNER
Trash, Drugs, Ruins
One of 12 violent-crime "hot spots" in the south district to benefit from problem-oriented policing is the area around Armstrong Avenue and Martin Luther King Drive. In the policing experiment, underwritten by the National Institute of Justice, the intersection has become an island of relative tranquillity in a general sea of decay, where crumbling facades and iron-barred stores are separated by vacant lots, and aimless young men rule the night.
Managing it turned out to be relatively simple.
Officers assigned there began videotaping the area, making a record of where trash had built up, what buildings were abandoned and where the men congregated. They also left business cards in residents' mailboxes so people could not only complain but also offer information without being seen by the drug dealers and loiterers who had taken over the intersection.
The residents called, pointing out their major concerns, telling where drug dealers were stashing their drugs and which buildings were attracting crime.
Officers began arresting the dealers, as well as searching out the people who owned the abandoned buildings and warning local liquor stores not to sell to obviously intoxicated people. Signs were pasted on corners telling drug dealers that the area was under constant video surveillance -- although it often wasn't -- and officers would sometimes ride past drug spots holding video cameras, usually without any film.
Young children, who were blamed for setting up basketball hoops in the middle of the street and playing loud music until early in the morning were offered a deal: Keep the street clean and keep it quiet after dark, and the hoops won't be confiscated. Some drug dealers also began keeping brooms nearby to sweep up, a thin hope that the police would walk on by if their corner stayed tidy.
Discussing the way the department sought to control the drug problem, Lieut. William Costigan explained that each dealer usually has a set location, often for years. They have regular customers, regular hours and regular hiding places. When you disrupt their corner and tear down their operating centers, both clients and dealers get confused and unsettled, and doing business becomes a highly speculative proposition.
"If you have a favorite restaurant, you go there," Lieutenant Costigan said. "And it's the same way with dealers. If you get good drugs one place you come back," he said, warning off a loitering user with the advice that "this corner's been shut down, homey."
"We didn't just arrest the dealers here, we hounded them," Lieutenant Costigan said with a smile. "People would call in and say, 'He just stashed his stuff here or money here,' and we'd pick it up. We'd arrest his subordinates and pull out a camera whenever we saw him on the street. When you're losing hundreds of dollars a day to us, you get discouraged."
By the end of the program last year, three of the six abandoned buildings near the corner had been knocked down and the property fenced, while the others were placed on a list to be razed. Code enforcement officers were sent to one particularly trouble-prone apartment building and the owner was given three months to correct 32 violations. Eighty-nine drug arrests were also made and the roughly 30 loiterers who once made the four-corner intersection their base were reduced to about 5.
Tapping the garbage can that now holds a permanent spot on this corner, Lieutenant Costigan counted the number of loiterers in the area with a smile. "It used to be that you never saw a mother with her children come by here," he said, moving out of the way so several groups could pass. "There were too many people hanging out drinking and selling even to get by, and there was always a loud radio and bottles in the street. Now people can get to the store and the nearest drug corner is four blocks away.
"I'm not saying that we solved the problem here," he said, "but we've certainly disrupted it. And with their favorite places torn down, I don't think it will ever be as popular as it was."
Residents tend to agree, though they fear the police may one day let up or become lax about the outreach or the patrols that have made their block suddenly safe. "The police cracked down a lot but if they let up, those people will be right back," said Tyia Smith, a 25-year-old postal worker, as she lugged a bag of groceries from Sister and Brother, a corner grocery store where workers once seldom ventured out from behind a huge Plexiglas shield.
"I feel safe inside," added Lillian Tillman, 54, who was new to the neighborhood. "It's quiet but I don't know."

THE COPS
Overcoming Doubt
Officers were once as skeptical of the program's effectiveness as residents are now of its future. Persuading young officers that the old ways must give way to the new continues to be an obstacle.
"It's gotten better but I remember when we started this thing in 1990 that many officers had this attitude of 'whatever you're going to try, it ain't gonna work'," explained Chief Gajewski. "They didn't even know what we were going to try but there was a lot of resistance to change."
Lieutenant Costigan was one of those resisting. A 16-year law enforcement veteran, he had become a firm believer that the only way to manage a tide of crime was by increasing arrests and he had little interest in taking time out for anything else. "I was against it, mainly because it was new," he said sheepishly. "I just didn't see anything changing."
Then he began hearing from residents, and the words weren't the usual complaints, but praise. Some days, he said, they would thank him for arranging to fence-in a vacant lot or tear down an abandoned building that served as a drug hangout. Other times it was just for coming to their community meeting or walking on their street instead of riding through in his car.
They didn't know anything about crime mapping or police philosophy but it became clear things were beginning to change in their neighborhood. And for once, for the better.
"Some of it didn't have a direct effect on crime but really increased the quality of life in an area," Lieutenant Costigan said. "I changed when I figured out that I was going home knowing I had done something concrete for these people, that I was making a difference."
"Every time I got a crack house razed or made an apartment building put up security lights, I was putting rent money back in the hands of an old lady who used to get robbed on the way to the bank," he said. "I wasn't just locking people up anymore, I was protecting and serving. It was a good feeling a lot of us had lost on the street."
The criminals also began to look at the police a different way, said Officer James Waiters, who has been living and working as a neighborhood policeman in south Jersey City for the past three years.
"When I first became a policeman, it was horrible," he said. "They would sell drugs right in front of you and just run away when you told them to halt."
"I'm not a big man," said the wiry 34-year-old officer. "But now the bad guys give respect because they know they can't hide. You get a real pump keeping them down."
That was just what Officer Waiters was doing on April 25, the night he and other neighborhood police officers led a posse of his fellow officers, county prosecutors and Federal drug enforcement agents through what was said to be the largest drug raid in the city's history. Called Operation Joint Venture, it resulted in 450 arrests and $69,000 in confiscated drugs and money.
While this was old-style policing, Officer Waiters credited its success to problem-oriented policing in the south district -- where the idea began and where the raid was conducted -- the new cooperation of residents in offering information and the wealth of data on the dealers that had been dutifully collected, then fed into the department's computer.
Officer Waiters lived among some of those who were arrested, less than a block from one, on speaking terms with most. Some felt betrayed later under the moonlight when he showed up at their doors, a slew of fellow officers cutting off their exits, a warrant for their arrest curled in his hand.
"I know nearly all these guys because I went to high school here," said Officer Waiters, writing up some paperwork on a dealer known as Fat Cat, as he talked of the importance of sweeping things clean before the summer drug-selling season began and Fat Cat complained that Officer Waiters should have told him what was up.
To stay effective, the officer said, he would have to be back out grooming the streets the next morning, even as Fat Cat and others cooled their heels in jail. There would be crack houses to raze, phone calls from neighbors to return, blocks to walk and advice to give.
"We've got good families out here but then we also got whole families who deal," he said. "It's the easy money, the fast money, making more in a day than a working man does in a week. You can't change that overnight, but things are getting better. And every day I'm out there with the people, it's making that money come a little harder and the good people's lives a little easier. I've never been so popular in my life."

New Signs of Wear at a Nuclear Plant That's For Sale

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
The sale of the Oyster Creek nuclear plant, a possibility floated by its owners last month, could be complicated by reports of unexpected signs of wear in a key safety component of the reactor, industry analysts say.
Reports sent to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January, detailing the company's inspection of the plant last September, say that small vertical cracks have developed in the core reactor shroud. 
 The shroud, a cylinder of welded stainless steel plates stacked on top of one another, helps to keep the core aligned and provides a floodable container to circulate coolant. Cracking can interfere with the reactor cooling process and fool other safety devices that track the core's health, according to nuclear energy experts.
This is not the first time that cracks have been found in the shroud. After horizontal cracks were discovered in 1994, they were repaired by tie-rods to compress the shroud, a procedure that sandwiches the plates together; however, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has never approved a procedure for fixing vertical cracks.
That fact, combined with the reactor's small size, high running costs and age, could leave few bidders in the year 2000, when General Public Utilities said it would probably either sell or close the plant. Oyster Creek, which opened in 1969, is the third oldest reactor in the country.
"These vertical cracks hasten its demise," said Edward J. Tirello, a utility analyst with NatWest Markets, a New York-based brokerage firm. "The company has already decided that they can't make money with this plant once the energy market is deregulated and with nuclear already having a bad stigma in America it seems unlikely any American companies would buy it."
Without a buyer, G.P.U. would be left with the choice of continuing to run the plant at a loss until its license expires in 2009 or closing it. Closing the plant would require approval from the state Board of Public Utilities, which would take into account how the shutdown would affect the company, its 200,000 customers and the economy of Forked River, where the plant is situated.
Opponents of the use of nuclear power said the discovery of the cracks in the shroud raised questions about the overall safety of the reactor; they say this is particularly troubling because plant officials have not provided a conclusive accounting of how many welds were checked for cracks. Ron Eaton, the N.R.C. project manager, said he knew of only two.(The Ocean County reactor went back on line Monday after being closed for 12 days for repairs to its control rods.)
Paul Gunter, the director of the Washington-based Nuclear Information and Resource Service, said he was concerned that the push to keep the plant operating was hampering the ability of inspectors to check all safety components.
"The cracking of the core shroud is just one indication of a general deterioration in safety components," he said, noting that dozens of such items are made of the same material as the shroud.

In West Windsor, Toll Wins a Mt. Laurel Wrangle

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
IN the wake of an earlier decision that linked a town's zoning with market conditions in fulfilling the town's obligations under the state's Mount Laurel housing doctrines, a developer has won subsequent court approval to build 1,165 residences at a site in West Windsor. Subject to an expected appeal by the town, the project would rise on 300 acres of farmland at the corner of Bear Brook and Meadow Roads in the Mercer County township.
The decision last month by Superior Court Judge Philip S. Carchman -- who also made the linkage ruling in October -- settled for now a four-year legal battle between the town and the developer, Toll Brothers of Huntingdon Valley, Pa. 
 The plan calls for 400 detached homes, 130 town houses and 635 rentals -- up to 175 of them for families with low and moderate incomes. The plan still must be approved by West Windsor's planning board.
The latest decision stems from an earlier ruling by Judge Carchman that Toll had proved that the township's zoning did not present a "realistic opportunity" under the state's Mount Laurel doctrines to provide sufficient residences for people who earn 50 to 80 percent of the area's median income of $57,690 for a family of four.
Such disputes are not new. But the Toll case represents the first time that a court has come back to see whether an approved plan works. It also is the first time that a court has used market conditions as a factor in determining the constitutionality of a town's Mount Laurel plans.
"It's a winner of a ruling that forces towns to be realistic," said Douglas C. Yearley Jr., a Toll vice president. He said his company stayed the course because the land, close to Route 1 and an N.J. Transit train station, was a "terrific site." Mr. Yearley said Toll expected to start building the $100 million project next winter.
The West Windsor Mayor, Thomas P. Frascella, called the ruling "unworkable." He said linking zoning to market conditions "leaves developing towns like us exposed to real estate cycles and developers' whims." Mr. Frascella, who is running for re-election, said the township intended to appeal.
But Judge Carchman called for expediting the approval process. "The objective," he wrote, "is to bring West Windsor into compliance with the Mount Laurel doctrines and from a practical standpoint to do all within the power of the court to insure low- and moderate-income housing will be in the ground in West Windsor in the foreseeable future."
To that end, the court has appointed a "master" to monitor the pace of the approval process. The Mount Laurel doctrines say that each of the state's 566 municipalities has an obligation to provide its share of affordable housing. While West Windsor's zoning did provide an opportunity it was not sufficient to meet the township's obligation for 929 Mount Laurel units, the court said. It noted that from 1982 to 1992 the number of houses in the township more than doubled to 6,115, and of the 3,208 new homes only 139 were affordable to families with low or moderate incomes.
West Windsor must submit a township-wide plan to provide the mandated units, which it is in the process of doing. Only after the court approves the plan can the township appeal.
Mayor Frascella said he was optimistic that the overall plan would be approved. And in it he sees a silver lining. He said it allowed the township to meet its Mount Laurel obligation in a way that produces fewer market-rate housing units, which in terms of population is "a huge opportunity for us to manage our growth."
To date some 230 towns have had or are in the process of having their plans approved by the courts or the Council on Affordable Housing, created in 1985 as an alternative to the courts in monitoring compliance. Of the 86,000 low- and moderate-income Mount Laurel units the state says it will need through 1999, 17,676 have been built, according to the council. An additional 4,676 units have been renovated and towns have rezoned land for 12,000 more, the council says.
Toll bought the West Windsor site in 1993 from a group of lenders that took control of it in lieu of foreclosure in 1990 from the Lanid Corporation. Lanid, in a settlement of a Mount Laurel suit filed 7 years earlier, was to build 1,500 multifamily units. Delays in approvals and the recession derailed that project and Lanid filed for bankruptcy.
AS the new owner, Toll originally sought to build 650 detached houses and 115 rentals affordable to families with low or moderate incomes. It offered this plan because it felt that one where condominium apartment houses predominated was not marketable. But West Windsor maintained that the Toll project did not comply with its zoning and would have forced it to rezone another site to make up the 200 Mount Laurel units that would have been built under the Lanid plan.
Toll sued. After three and a half years of legal maneuvering, Judge Carchman agreed with Toll that the rezoning for its site and some of the 11 others in the 80's violated the Mount Laurel doctrines.
The developer successfully argued that the rezoning was unrealistic because it overstated the potential housing density of the sites, many of which had wetlands. Moreover, the court said, the town's open space and sewer ordinances made the sites economically unfeasible for development.
The court also broke new ground when it said market factors must be dealt with in judging whether a town's zoning is adequate to provide affordable housing.
It is not clear how many other Mount Laurel zoning disputes the ruling will affect. But it "opens up a viable course of action" against towns that fail to adjust their zoning to meet market conditions, said Henry Hill, a Princeton lawyer who argued on behalf of Toll and has long represented developers in Mount Laurel cases. He said cases would be decided town by town and would be dependent on existing zoning.
But Robert Burchell, a professor at the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said:
"The essence of zoning in a community, which already to a degree reflects market conditions, should be based on the way residents want to see their town developed, not a market test."
That multifamily housing is again marketable in central New Jersey shows the folly of "making zoning contingent on market analysis," he said.
Others said there was no doubt about the ruling's import. It insures that communities will review whether the zoning on Mount Laurel sites is realistic and take measures "to expedite rather than retard the production of affordable housing," said Art Bernard. He is a partner at THP Inc., a housing consulting firm in East Brunswick and a former executive director of the Council on Affordable Housing.
Along with approving Toll's current plan, which Mr. Yearley said made it economically feasible to build the 175 Mount Laurel units he feels the plan will generate, the court also resolved other issues in the case. Among them are the type of sewage system that will be used at the site and the amount of land to be left open.
Beyond objecting to the linkage between market conditions, which Mr. Frascella said "flies in the face of good planning," the Mayor said several issues remained unsettled. For instance, he said, it is unclear if the 1988 agreement for 1,500 units is still valid and if the 1,165 units the court just approved would fit on the site.
Despite a possible appeal, Mr. Yearley said his company would "seriously consider moving ahead with the development because we feel the judge's ruling is correct."
Toll will present its plan to the West Windsor Planning Board for approval within the next few weeks. As now envisioned the detached houses will start at 2,000 square feet in size, sit on 5,000- to 10,000-square-foot lots and cost from about $200,000 to more than $300,000. The town houses will start at 1,700 square feet in size and the "mid-to-high $100,000" range in price. The high end has yet to be determined. Mr. Yearley said the size and leasing rates of the rental apartments have not yet been set.
The court granted Toll 15 years after securing township approval to build the project. Mr. Yearley said he expected it to be completed in five to seven years.

HEADLINE: Traversing the Regulatory Maze

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
THEY weren't the world's worst delays -- 30 to 60 days, maybe. And not all of the 23 two-family homes with the undulating facades along Chester Street in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were mired in what one builder brands "bureaucratic limbo." Only about half.
But families were waiting to move into those spanking new rowhouses with their ornamental pre-cast concrete coping stones and lintels -- evocative of the petticoat-and-parasol era of 1890's Brooklyn. And these were moderate-income people who had never owned their own homes before. 
 A city inspector was insisting that the architect's original sidewalk renderings be redrawn, now that the city had planted tree seedlings by the curb.
"The process is sometimes subjective," said Jeffrey Levine, who as president of Levine Builders had worked with the New York City Housing Partnership to develop that row of subsidized homes near Sutter Avenue. "Very often a Highways Department paving plan is filed, with the work prescribed by the architect. And after construction, his interpretation is subject to modification after site inspection. That can require refiling, reinspection and a loss of valuable time."
Without that final go-ahead last December, certificates of occupancy for those Chester Street homes -- "which is the period at the end of the construction sentence," Mr. Levine said -- could not be granted. With a certificate of occupancy in hand, a developer can usually pay off the construction loan, get permanent financing at a lower rate and start using the property for its intended purpose.
"We had to delay those closings," said Mr. Levine, who has built about 3,000 homes in the city in the last 15 years. "I've had people threaten to back out of deals."
For decades, developers in New York City -- from single-family home builders on Staten Island to the titans of Manhattan tower projects -- have railed against a regulatory system they variously describe as a multilayered labyrinth pocked with pitfalls, a "Minotaurian maze" with lurking bull-headed beasts and a minefield laced with permit requirements imposed by too many agencies protecting their own turf. All of which, they say, runs up costs, exacts hair-extracting delay and creates incentive-chilling uncertainty for builders.
"It could be months of delays," said Jerome Belson, president of Associated Builders and Owners of New York, one of the city's leading developer groups. "Before you can build, you've got to get your financing in line, draw down the money to buy the property, and then you can't move ahead because the Buildings Department doesn't have the electrical and highway approvals. You're in a state of suspended animation."
But in recent years -- as Mr. Belson will concede -- there have been marked improvements in the system, with several innovations commonly called "one-stop shopping," "express permitting" and "self-certification" streamlining specific parts of the process.
At the same time, however, the procedures by which a developer must gain approval for his or her grand strategy -- the use of the land, the "envelope" of the building and the environmental consequences of the project -- remain lengthy and costly.
And so, with a panoply of competing interests exerting influence, each with its own creditable purposes, the path to development is a balancing act with a multitude of steps across a long tightrope.
With the innovations, some steps have become simpler for those negotiating the bureaucracy. "There have been a lot of minor accommodations," Mr. Belson said.
Another developer, Vincent Riso, was more upbeat. The attitudes of the Buildings and Planning commissioners under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani "have gone a long way in convincing their personnel to be more user-friendly," said Mr. Riso, president of the Briarwood Organization, which has built close to 20,000 homes and apartments in the city since 1912. "I can't say everything is worry-free, but for the first time, honestly, I see it going in that direction."
Gaston Silva, the city's Commissioner of Buildings, said his predecessor, Joel A. Miele, "revolutionized the way the department operates." Mr. Silva took over last August when Mr. Miele became Commissioner of Environmental Protection.
"Joel made it possible for architects and engineers to self-certify their plans for compliance with the codes," Mr. Silva said, "so an architect doesn't have to stand in line to have his or her plans reviewed."
"Another thing Joel started was express permitting," Mr. Silva said, explaining that, in addition to lining up for various permits from the Buildings Department, a builder had to go to the Department of Environmental Protection for sewer approvals, to the Transportation Department for pavement approvals, to the Fire Department for alarm approvals. "Now, the staff from those agencies are with the Buildings Department, in our borough offices."
A reform introduced by Mr. Silva allows builders to file forms by computer disk, rather than stacks of paper. And he has decentralized the Bureau of Electrical Control. "When they were centralized in Manhattan, each inspector had a route that took two weeks to cover," Mr. Silva said. "Now, they go out from the borough office, return that night, and the information goes right into the computer." Inspectors will soon be equipped with hand-held computers to further expedite the process.
THE attitude of the Giuliani Administration, said Carole Slater, a city zoning official under four mayors and now a private land-use lawyer, "has been, 'Let's get it built and let's get it occupied.' And that's filtering down to the staff."
Perhaps surprisingly, leaders of groups that frequently contest development plans -- environmentalists, preservationists, community board activists -- express qualified support for the tactical improvements in the permitting process. But they strongly caution that the shift of responsibilities away from government, particularly if it were to seep into those grand-strategy areas of land use and environmental impact, could have grave consequences. And they point out that, cumbersome though the existing checks may seem, they often expedite construction by avoiding problems that could cause lengthy litigation.
"You want to streamline the process, not defang it," said Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society, a private group that seeks to promote and protect architectural standards. "Something that is environmentally wrong or historically insensitive should not go forward."
And yet, Mr. Sexton agrees that "the zoning code is too complex, the land-use review process too lengthy and difficult, and the multiple environmental reviews are more confusing than they have to be, by far."
There are, essentially, two paths to development in New York City, as one land-use lawyer, Sybil H. Pollet, pointed out while offering a truncated version of "Zoning 101."
The first, called "as-of-right," means that a developer consults with a land-use lawyer to determine what size and shape of building is allowed on a particular lot. "Your architect draws a plan," Ms. Pollet said. "You go to the Buildings Department and if the examiners conclude that the building, as drawn, complies with the codes, you get a building permit."
Usually, that is the clearer -- though rarely crystal clear -- path to development.
Far more of an obstacle course is the procedure for receiving "discretionary approval" of a project that does not comply with the city's three-volume 1961 Zoning Resolution, with its block-by-block, lot-by-lot maps and corresponding texts. "That's the Minotaurian maze, where you know there is potentially a beast waiting for you," Ms. Pollet said. Under "as-of-right," she said, the bull-headed beasts are hidden.
Zoning is divided into two basic components: the use to which a property may be put (manufacturing, commercial, residential) and bulk (the size and configuration of a building).
There are 18 "Use Groups" in the zoning code, ranging from Group 1, which includes single-family homes, through Group 18, which would include a sewage plant. Superimposed on the maps are special districts where the city seeks to preserve certain aspects of a community -- for instance, the Special Garment Center District and the Special Lincoln Square District.
The maps refer to portions of the text that describe, among other things, the allowable square footage for the building, height and setback requirements and the angle of the building from street to sky.
Until 1916, the city had no zoning code. But then a behemoth of a building -- the 40-story Equitable at 120 Broadway -- raised an uproar at least as large as the seven-acre shadow that it cast.
In response, the 1916 Zoning Resolution divided the city into residential, business and unlimited districts. "The idea was to keep nuisances away from desirable uses -- the pig out of the parlor," Ms. Pollet said. And it addressed the bulk issue by requiring setbacks in a wedding-cake profile.
The 1961 Zoning Resolution, rather than relying on the wedding-cake format, introduced floor-area requirements to check overly bulky buildings. The framers preferred the International Style, where a tower rises from a plaza. To compensate for the decrease in bulk, the code allowed a builder to increase the height of the tower.
The 1961 Zoning Resolution also allowed for waivers from as-of-right development by requiring "discretionary approvals" through what is now called the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure -- ULURP to insiders.
By way of illustration, Ms. Pollet sketched the plans of a hypothetical company, Dynamic Development, to build a residential building in a commercial district. The zoning allows Dynamic to construct a building with a floor area six times the size of the lot. To make a profit, Dynamic needs more floor space. So it seeks a zoning map amendment to allow 10 times the area of the lot.
In addition, Dynamic ascertains that a landmarked church across the street has unused development rights to an additional 20,000 square feet of floor area. So it seeks a special permit to acquire those development rights, contingent on the company creating a longterm maintenance program for the church. The application is reviewed by the Planning Department and certified as complete by the Planning Commission.
Now, community concerns and political interests get into the mix.
In Ms. Pollet's simplified scenario, the local community board, which has 60 days to review the project, holds a public hearing and votes against Dynamic's application, citing concerns that increased traffic will endanger Little Leaguers who play in the church schoolyard. The community board cannot veto the proposal, only make a recommendation to the Planning Commission.
But its concerns carry weight with local politicians, who bring their influence to bear on the Borough President, who has 30 days to also make a recommendation to the Planning Commission and, perhaps, hold another hearing. The commission then has 60 days to hold its public hearing and to approve, modify or disapprove the application.
If the Planning Commission also disapproves, the project is dead -- unless the Mayor files a Certificate of Necessity with the City Council. If, however, the community board and the Borough President disapprove while the Planning Commission approves, the issue goes to a vote by the City Council, which holds another hearing.
Whatever the Council's decision, the Mayor can veto it within five days; but that veto is subject to a Council override by a two-thirds vote, within 10 days.
"That's an outside total of 215 days, not counting the six months it might have taken for the City Planning staff to certify the application as complete," Ms. Pollet said. "It could be a year or two from the time Dynamic first purchased the land, and it is paying off the mortgage, taxes, soft costs" -- such as legal and architect fees.
If obtaining discretionary approval is a tortuous process, as-of-right can also be fraught with peril.
MS. POLLET cited the case of a warehouse at Third Avenue and 80th Street in Manhattan that Toys "R" Us, along with the developer Ian Bruce Eichner, purchased in 1994 to convert into a store, with a condominium apartment building rising above.
The area had been rezoned from commercial to residential. But the Department of Buildings ruled that, because the previous owner, Morgan & Brother Manhattan Storage, continued to use the building as a warehouse, Toys "R" Us had "grandfathered" rights to retain the loading docks.
Neighborhood residents launched a two-year legal battle. In December, the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, ruled that the grandfathered rights had been forfeited because only a bare amount of goods had been stored in the warehouse. And so, below a luxury apartment tower on a fashionable East Side block, the ground-level commercial space remains boarded up.
"Whoops! You buy a building believing, based on an official opinion or permit, that you can use that property for a toy store, only to find that the proposed development can't be realized," said Ms. Pollet, who represented Chase Manhattan Bank, holder of the underlying mortgage on the old warehouse. "Even though a developer gets an official opinion, it can't always be relied upon."
Ponderous though the land-use process may be, the parallel environmental impact procedure remains to be reckoned with.
Michael Gerrard, an environmental lawyer and co-author of a reference manual, "Environmental Impact Review in New York" (Matthew Bender & Company, 1990), said that, "from start to finish, between first telling the government you want to do a project and getting the final approvals," an Environmental Impact Statement typically takes 18 months to complete.
"A small E.I.S. may cost tens of thousands of dollars for, let's say, a small apartment building," Mr. Gerrard said. "A good-sized E.I.S. will cost several hundred thousand dollars, but it could be more than a million."
To begin with, the developer must fill out an Environmental Assessment, a long form provided by the city, summarizing the potential impacts of the project. The lead city agency designated to review the assessment -- usually the Planning Department -- then decides whether the impacts are sufficient to require a full Environmental Impact Statement. If not, the project may proceed without a full E.I.S.
A full statement, prepared by companies that specialize in the field, will address the project's impact on traffic, air pollution, water consumption, noise, sewage generation, open space, energy and light. It might assess the effects on wetlands and endangered species.
"The classic example, of course, is Westway," Mr. Gerrard said, "and I was involved in that for years. The E.I.S. was misleading about the project's impact on fish in the Hudson River. As a direct result, the project was eventually killed."
Impact statements for the redevelopment of Times Square, Mr. Gerrard said, required the hiring of sociologists to assess whether the sex industry would vanish or be pushed to other parts of the city. "Another obscure one: old burial grounds, like the Revolutionary War-era merchant seamen's cemetery at the Brooklyn Navy Yard."
The completed preliminary draft of the full E.I.S. is submitted to the lead agency. It makes comments and corrections. Several drafts are usually required. The lead agency eventually certifies the full E.I.S. as complete, though that does not mean the project is approved.
Most certified drafts then require a public hearing, after which the lead agency prepares a final E.I.S., including all comments gathered at the hearing and responses from the developer. After publication of the final E.I.S., the lead agency and all the other involved agencies make final decisions on approving or disapproving the project, explaining their reasons. "That's the end of the environmental review process," Mr. Gerrard said, "and frequently the start of the litigation process."
Is all of that necessary? Or, conversely, is there danger in compressing, or privatizing, the process too much? Parties to the debate call for an appropriate balance.
No one contends that a major overhaul of the regulatory system would solve the city's chronic housing shortage. "Without public subsidies, given the cost of construction in New York," said Kathryn Wylde, an expert on affordable housing, "the impact of streamlining is extremely limited." Ms. Wylde, former president of the New York City Housing Partnership, said the costs of land, labor, taxes, transportation of materials and connections to infrastructure are very high for developers in New York City.
And so, whatever costs are saved during the regulatory process, developers argue, could contribute to the city's -- and their -- economic health. "The public can be protected and the development community can get a fair shake," said Mr. Riso. "It's extremely important for the city's economy that money not be wasted during development."
CAUTIOUSLY, some of those who sometimes oppose development projects do not entirely disagree. "There's room for streamlining, coordinating, collapsing or even deleting some steps," Mr. Sexton of the Municipal Art Society said. "So far, the improvements are being accomplished incrementally and intelligently. But, ultimately, we need the ability to stop the commission of terrible errors."
Innovations like self-certification are a good idea, said Ronald Shiffman, director of the Pratt Center for Community and Environmental Development, "but it needs to be audited very carefully."
Citing the case of the Parker Meridien Hotel in midtown Manhattan, which did not comply with its agreement to maintain a public plaza, Mr. Shiffman, a former member of the City Planning Commission, said, "We used to kid that we need a Planning Police Department. To discourage people from staying in the plaza, the hotel actually took out the benches."
Of graver concern, said Mr. Gerrard, the environmental lawyer, contamination from a previous use might be unearthed during construction at an industrial site. "There are responsible developers who will call the government and say, 'Look what I found, let's solve the problem,' " Mr. Gerrard said. "Others will say, 'Bury it, I don't want to know.' "
Commissioner Silva pointed out that a bill allowing developers to self-certify for the certificate of occupancy was introduced in the City Council last year, "but there's resistance to the notion."
Asked if the entire process would some day be privatized, Mr. Silva said: "We will never go there. The question is to find the right balance of regulation by the municipal agency and reliance on the professionals."
In the estimation of Mr. Belson of the Associated Builders and Owners, there are "two words" that sum up problems with the review process: "community boards."
"There's no hard and fast map to follow in terms of what will be accepted by the local board," Mr. Belson said. "They have their own needs. In many instances, unfortunately, their needs are in conflict with the greater good."
But Eric Goldstein, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said community boards view with legitimate concern the efforts to revamp the review process. "Proposals for change usually come from the developers, and the basic worry is that since they have so much clout, neighborhood representatives will be outgunned," he said.
"No one thinks the system is working perfectly now," Mr. Goldstein added, "but the fear is that reopening these issues is like buying a discount plane ticket to a destination selected by the airline."
Mr. Belson was philosophical about the prospects for further change. "We have a participatory democracy," he said. "It's great for us to say, 'I want to go shopping at Office Depot and I want to be able to park my car in a 250-car lot. But it's certainly going to negatively impact on the local hardware store.
"So there are these needs that have to be weighed and counter-balanced," he said. "You need the wisdom of a Solomon."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Passing the Apartment To the Next Generation

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
NOW that he is retired, Robert B. Neuwirth says he would consider moving from his rent-controlled apartment at West End Avenue and 71st Street to a place outside Manhattan where living expenses are lower.
"Some people call this apartment a steal because they think it's cheap," said Mr. Neuwirth, who pays $1,250 a month for a modest-sized two-bedroom on the 16th floor. "But in relation to my income, it isn't." A lawyer who was working in rent administration for the state, Mr. Neuwirth took early retirement two years ago at the age of 55 and pays about a third of his income as rent. 
 His housing history shows how the laws of succession under rent regulation benefit more than one generation in a family. He exemplifies the operation of the succession laws as they were clearly intended to operate -- for the permanent benefit of a family that has continuously occupied a regulated apartment as a primary residence.
At the same time, his situation calls attention to the equity issues inherent in a system that has in effect created an entitlement for a family that chooses to remain in place for a long time in a location that has become more affordable to many outsiders hoping to get in than it is to those who are already there.
When Mr. Neuwirth's parents moved into the apartment in 1941, he was 17 months old. It has been his primary residence ever since. When his mother died at 81 in May 1993 -- a month after the death of his father, who was 86 -- he inherited the apartment. Now his wife, Amada Gonzalez, whom he married four years ago, has the right to inherit it should she outlive him.
He does not feel chained to his apartment, as many long-term regulated renters do. "We could leave the city," he said, "or if rent regulation continues we might be able to get the apartment next door and expand into another three rooms." Brokers say that if vacant and decontrolled his apartment would probably rent as is for at least $2,500 to $3,000 a month.
The succession rules are among the aspects of rent regulation whose future is in question now that that State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, is warning that the entire package of rent laws will expire this year unless a phase-out plan for rent regulation can be negotiated with the Assembly. Owner organizations want the law changed to restrict succession rights drastically, perhaps by allowing only spouses to "inherit the apartment."
But interviews with lawyers for both the tenant and landlord sides suggest that even without this outcome, courts are already interpreting the laws quite strictly, making it difficult for tenants to "inherit the apartment" in the many gray-area situations that arise.
Samuel J. Himmelstein, who has represented tenants in many cases for years, said he takes some recent outcomes in court as a "judicial expression of the backlash against rent regulation."
"I advise tenants that they had better have good documents to back up their claims," Mr. Himmelstein said. "I tell them maybe you'll need the equities on your side as well as the law."
THE very complexity of the rules abet the natural tendency of tenants and owners alike to use the rules to their advantage.
The general rule -- for both rent-controlled and rent-stabilized apartments -- is that a "family member" (as explicitly though broadly defined) who has occupied the apartment with the tenant as a joint primary resident for two or more years prior to the death or departure of the tenant, is entitled to succeed to that tenant's occupancy rights. If the co-occupant is 62 years old or older, or is disabled, the period of joint occupancy only has to be one year.
When the duration of the relationship or tenancy has been less than two years (or one year for the elderly or disabled), the co-occupying family member still can inherit the apartment, provided co-occupancy began at the start of the relationship or the tenancy. That means, for example, that the rent-regulated tenant can marry or remarry and the new spouse will immediately have succession rights.
Inherent in these rules are actually two concepts: The co-occupying tenant must meet a certain test to be entitled to get the apartment, and the tenant must be in a position to give it. If the tenant has "permanently vacated" the apartment, succession rights cannot be passed on. If the co-occupying family member has not been there at least two years (or at least one year if the family member is over 62 or disabled), the co-occupant cannot inherit.
Since a Court of Appeals decision in the case of Braschi v. Stahl Associates in 1989, "family member" is deemed to include "nontraditional" families -- often but not necessarily gay partners. The court gave a specific list of the evidences of close economic and emotional interdependence that would constitute a nontraditional family for succession rights purposes, and the list was made part of the state's rent regulation code.
Families will naturally consider a low-rent apartment an asset and when possible assert their rights to inherit it. But their motivations do not undercut their rights.
At the 165-unit co-op at 85 Barrow Street in Greenwich Village, the late Patrick Sullivan, a tenant since 1940, took ill in the 80's. The family decided that his grandson, Daniel Sullivan, then 23 years old, was the logical choice. Daniel's sister was away at school at the time and his brother was "not interested in the apartment."
"As well as helping my grandfather out, it was a better place than I was in in Brooklyn," Mr. Sullivan said in a deposition before the trial. "It was near where I worked. Both inside and out the neighborhood is safer, the apartment is larger." After Patrick Sullivan died in 1990, the management tried but failed to evict the grandson, whose right to stay on was affirmed in appellate court (Z.H. Control Company v. Sullivan).
On the other hand, lawyers say that the appellate court is taking a strict view of succession rights.
The outcome in the case of Peck v. Sutton last year suggests that people who begin to live much of the year out of town in retirement will have difficulty passing on succession rights even to family members who have lived with them for longer than two years. People cannot have dual residences and expect to keep the apartment in the family, said Sherwin Belkin, the lawyer who represented the owner.
In that case, a renter couple in a 51-unit co-op on West End Avenue and 74th Street had begun to live part of the year in Florida, and subsequently attempted to turn their apartment over to their daughter and son-in-law. They conceded to the court that the apartment was no longer their primary residence.
After Judge Arlene H. Hahn found that their children could not succeed them them as prime tenants, the couple accepted a six-figure settlement to drop their claim and move out in June. Safe from further litigation, the plaintiff -- the sponsor who converted the building to a co-op -- will be free to sell the apartment or rent it out. The couple was paying $2,300 a month; the rental value is said to be about $6,000 a month.
Building managers say that people will often come into an apartment as a sublessee, or perhaps a roommate, and hope to inherit it if the primary tenant turns out not to be returning. The primary tenant, on the other hand, often leaves the apartment not knowing for sure whether the departure is permanent or temporary, but hoping not to lose the right to return.
"They come to us asking to sublet," said Norman Buchbinder, a principal in Buchbinder & Warren, which manages about 100 buildings downtown. "But our policy is not to allow sublets unless we're sure the tenant will be returning." The law is that the right to sublet cannot be "unreasonably withheld."
Laws aside, nagging problems of equity enter the equation when families are endowed by government with the right to control the occupancy of other people's property indefinitely. For Mr. Neuwirth, the former rent administrator living for 56 years in a rent-controlled apartment, the answer lies in social policy -- how should society treat housing.
"It's a social policy to keep the middle class in the city," he said. "Succession rights keep families together. Isn't this an era of family values?"

Twice the Power, In Only Six Years
Despite all the talk about the impact of individual investors on the stock market, the huge shifts in market share among financial companies have been widely underappreciated, argues H. Bradley Perry, a consultant and the former chairman of David L. Babson & Company, investment counsultants in Cambridge, Mass. 
 In six years, the portion of financial assets managed by commercial banks and savings institutions has fallen to 37 percent from 49 percent, and the share controlled by life insurance companies has slipped a bit. The portion managed by mutual funds, meanwhile, has nearly doubled, to 21 percent from 11 percent.
The funds' rise has been fueled by individual investors and the rapid growth of defined-contribution retirement plans, especially 401(k) and 403(b) plans. As a result, mutual funds hold 12 percent of individual investors' financial assets, up from just 6 percent six years ago.
What does this mean? Consolidation among financial services companies will probably gain momentum as banks, insurance companies and investment firms that have focused on institutional money turn their sights to the rapidly growing individual-investor sector, Mr. Perry said. So combinations like that of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter, Discover and that of Bankers Trust and Alex. Brown should proliferate.
 
Advice for Women
The Mutual Fund Education Alliance, a trade group for funds sold directly to the public, is devoting part of its World Wide Web site to women and investing (www.mfea.com).
The site, with direct links to 42 no-load fund companies, covers the basics of fund investing and offers personal commentary from women in the industry, sample investment portfolios and an investor survey.
A two-book education kit with a supplement for women is available from the alliance for $21.50 ($23 for Missouri residents). To order, send a check or money order to Women's Kit, Department 0148, Box 419263, Kansas City, Mo. 64193.
 
Starting Early
Most Americans say the best time to start consulting with a financial adviser is in your mid-20's, even if you have little money, according to a survey on financial preparedness released by Alliance Capital.
About 1,000 Americans were surveyed in early January by Louis Harris & Associates, and more than three-quarters of the respondents said people aged 25 to 30 should see a financial adviser. When asked how much money someone should have to invest before talking to an adviser, the median response was $9,000.
 
New Manager
Robert Amman, former co-manager of Founders Discovery, has become lead manager, replacing David Kern, who left the firm. Mr. Amman relinquished his role on the three-person team managing Founders Special.
 
New Funds
Third Avenue Small-Cap Value seeks capital appreciation by investing in companies with market capitalizations of less than $1 billion. It will be run by Martin J. Whitman, who manages Third Avenue Value, and Curtis Jensen, a research analyst with the firm.
 New York Opportunity Equity will invest in issues in New York State, which the fund sponsor, Pinnacle Investments, calls the world's 10th-largest economy, representing 8 percent of the United States economy. The fund plans to own 35 to 40 companies with headquarters in New York or significant business in the state. The initial portfolio will have 4 percent of its assets in each of these companies: Bank of New York, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Citicorp, Corning, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, I.B.M., Travelers and Xerox, and 3 percent in Texaco. The maximum sales charge is 4.75 percent.
 
In Brief
Ivy International, managed by Hakan Castegren, closed to new investors on April 18, though prospective investors who communicated their interest in buying shares in the preceding 30 days have three months from April 18 to do so. Existing shareholders can add to their positions. The fund sponsor plans to begin a new fund, Ivy International II, under another manager who has not yet been named.
Two Royce funds will disappear. Royce Equity Income will be swallowed up by Royce Total Return, and Pennsylvania Mutual is taking over Royce Value.
T. Rowe Price OTC has been renamed T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock.
Fidelity Investments has lowered the expense cap on four Spartan bond funds to 0.38 percent of assets from 0.65 percent. They are Spartan Ginnie Mae, Spartan Investment Grade Bond, Spartan Limited Maturity Government and Spartan Short-Term Bond.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Some Regulatory Rain On the Managers' Parade?

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
THE mutual fund industry, the guardian of the retirement money of millions of Americans, has enjoyed a remarkable run in the last year.
A law enacted last fall exempted funds from oversight by state securities regulators -- something the industry had long sought. The Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to adopt rules that will make it easier for fund companies to sell shares by allowing them to use streamlined documents on disclosure. And, thanks to a roaring bull market and a continuing shift in how corporations provide for retirement benefits, the amount of money invested in money market, stock and bond funds grew more than 20 percent in the last 12 months, to $3.7 trillion. 
 But patches of clouds are appearing in these blue skies. As the officials of the 600 mutual fund companies that make up the Investment Company Institute, the industry trade group, prepare to convene on Wednesday in Washington for their annual meeting, the industry's chief regulators are circling.
Some of the regulatory attention is an outgrowth of the fund companies' gains in size and influence. Still, increased scrutiny often produces unflattering results -- usually as sanctions against fund companies and their managers.
"In recent years, there has been a marked increase in enforcement activity" by the S.E.C. against the fund business, said Thomas R. Smith Jr., a partner at the New York law firm Brown & Wood who specializes in mutual fund law.
He added, "I would contend that the threshold for action has gone down."
Commission officials say that they are not singling out the fund industry, but that they are simply following the money and individual investors. Nevertheless, the S.E.C. is preparing a report based on a broad examination of how fund companies and others account for and disclose to investors their "soft dollar" arrangements, in which brokerage firms provide indirect compensation to money managers, usually in the form of research, in exchange for transactions and the accompanying commissions. The S.E.C. is expected to take action soon against some specific companies and, after analyzing the information gathered, to consider new regulations on soft-dollar payments .
In recent statements, S.E.C. officials have outlined other mutual fund practices that the agency is studying closely: how management fees are set, how securities are allocated to various funds and how a fund portrays its performance in advertising.
The subject that has drawn the most attention, though, is soft dollars. The S.E.C.'s office of compliance inspections and examinations has just completed a study of 250 investment advisers, including fund managers, and 75 broker-dealers, to determine common industry practices on the use and disclosure of soft-dollar arrangements.
Soft-dollar payments, when made in exchange for investment research that benefits a money manager's client, are legal. But in 1986, the S.E.C. ruled that money managers who accept such payments must inform clients that their commissions might be used to pay for research.
"Research" can be broadly interpreted, to include services other than financial analysis. For instance, a money manager might allow a brokerage firm to pay for the money manager's office equipment or phone bills, if the client benefits. Those arrangements, too, must be disclosed, including specifics about what is provided.
Failure to disclose such arrangements has led to several enforcement actions recently. For example, the S.E.C. settled a case in February with Oakwood Counselors, a Morganville, N.J., firm with $46 million under management, after finding that Oakwood had collected almost $300,000 in soft-dollar arrangements that it had not disclosed. Oakwood, which neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing, agreed to remit a total of $444,763, including fines and interest, to settle the matter.
Gene Gohlke, associate director of the S.E.C. inspections office, said a number of commission reviews had recently been referred to the enforcement division for further investigation. Along with failing to disclose soft-dollar arrangements, some firms may have engaged in outright fraud, Mr. Gohlke said, by converting soft-dollar benefits to their own use or by billing several brokerage firms for the same services.
After compiling its data on soft-dollar trends, the S.E.C. staff will consider whether to recommend changes in its 1986 rules.
Other recent enforcement actions have involved what the S.E.C. judged to be inflated claims about performance, and favoritism in allocating securities to various accounts.
S.E.C. officials also say they have begun to examine whether certain fund companies and their boards are negotiating management fees in ways that are not in the fund shareholders' best interests.
Few topics are more of a hot button in the industry than the management fee, the amount of money a fund company charges shareholders to pick securities for them. The management fee is usually the biggest portion of a fund's expenses, but it is largely arbitrary and subject to approval by the fund's board.
Simple economics suggests that as the amount of money managed by fund companies increases, the incremental cost of managing assets should fall. But in a study released last year, Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund tracking company, found that the fund industry has, over time, raised management fees.
Mutual funds that were begun in the last two years charge an average management fee of 72 cents for every $100 invested, Morningstar found. That number, based on the fund's reported minimum fee, has risen steadily over the last 60 years from about 40 cents for every $100.
Commission officials declined to comment on the specifics of their inquiry into management fees. But one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the agency was particularly interested in funds that had consistently underperformed their peers while maintaining higher-than-average management fees.
With that general criterion in mind, Morningstar generated a list of 12 high-cost, poorly performing equity funds that charge management fees of at least 1 percent of assets and that have a minimum of $100 million under management. Funds were deemed to be poor performers if they ranked in the bottom 10 percent of their peer groups over the last three years.
There is nothing to indicate that these specific funds are the subject of an S.E.C. inquiry. But they should be of interest to investors, since their assets have reached a point where management fees might be expected to start falling.
No fund family dominates the list, though two funds each from American Century and Crabbe Huson show up.
American Century specializes in growth and momentum stocks, which have lagged behind the market in the last year. Its funds also charge a flat 1 percent fee for all expenses, so their total expense ratio is lower than the average fund's.
Crabbe Huson's funds generally use a contrarian investment approach, which recently has fallen out of favor. Also, Crabbe Huson began capping the expense ratio on some funds last year, thereby cutting its management fees to less than 1 percent.
Interestingly, the list contains no funds with management fees of more than 1.1 percent of assets, although Morningstar reports that nearly two dozen general American stock funds carry management fees of 1.5 percent or more.
Presumably, these funds are not at the bottom of their peer groups, which might make some of their high-priced managements rest a lot easier.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Graph: "An Issue on the Horizon: Management Fees" tracks the average minimum management fees for new equity funds, from 1920 through 1996. Chart lists diversified domestic equity funds with more than $100 million in assets whose performance over the three years ended in February was in the bottom 10 percent in their categories and that charge management fees of at least 1 percent of assets.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Trying to Stoke the Campfire Again at Coleman

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

 BODY:
IT'S Jerry W. Levin to the rescue. Again.
Eight years ago Ronald O. Perelman, the takeover artist, recruited Mr. Levin to run a newly acquired prize, the Coleman Company. Coleman was a venerable camping equipment manufacturer that had become an icon of the middle class, illuminating campsites and warming trail dinners for several generations, but had overexpanded and found itself floundering. Mr. Levin sold off nearly a third of the company and refocused on the core businesses. 
 Mr. Levin went on to turn around Revlon for Mr. Perelman, and then, several months ago, took on his latest assignment: refocusing Coleman, which had overexpanded again -- this time on Mr. Perelman's watch.
Attacking quickly, Mr. Levin has shut down a number of plants, cut 700 workers and sold some unneeded businesses. He is also closing down the company's new chalet-style, multimillion-dollar headquarters -- complete with log facing and two fireplaces -- near Denver, in Golden, Colo.
Partly as a result of these measures, the stock is up from about $12 in late December to $17.375 at Friday's close.
Though investors are naturally pleased at these signs of a turnaround, several analysts said there might be little opportunity in the stock because it already reflected expectations of a moderate improvement in profits in coming years. Only a sale of the company, the analysts speculated, will bring investors a price of much more than $20 a share in the near term.
"A lot of things have to come together now to justify this stock price," said Peter Barry, who follows Coleman for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
There is also skepticism over the ultimate plans of Mr. Perelman, who owns 83 percent of Coleman.
"I suspect that the ultimate exit strategy for Perelman is to sell it, and that is what we're thinking about," Mr. Barry said. "But I think they want a higher price than it's selling for now."
There may also be concerns over the fact that another company controlled by Mr. Perelman, Marvel Entertainment, filed for bankruptcy last year -- which some regard as a sign of his wavering interest in managing some of his companies. Some minority shareholders in Marvel have accused Mr. Perelman of putting his own interests ahead of theirs, while he says he has acted fairly, and the dispute is now tied up in court. Worries that serious business troubles and disputes might also arise at Coleman might possibly affect its stock.
"The stock price could be held back by that kind of thinking, although it is hard to quantify," said Beth Burnson, an analyst with the ABN Amro Chicago Corporation. "But at this stage I don't think Coleman is going to go the way of Marvel. It is definitely improving."
In an interview, Mr. Levin was adamant that Coleman was not for sale. He also said that Coleman was financially secure and that the company's new strategy would benefit all shareholders equally.
The company does have a large debt load -- about $570 million in long-term debt -- but it is refinancing nearly $500 million of high-yielding debt with an issue of new securities. Mr. Levin also said that, while he was perceived as a short-term chief executive when he moved over to Coleman in February, he now intends to stay for a couple of years, at least to carry out his longer-term strategy.
"We have a very high level of confidence in Jerry Levin," said Steve Eisenberg, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. "We're more positive because he's there, but we still need a few more quarters of evidence that he's really turning it around."
Last week, the company announced first-quarter results that were slightly better than expected. Revenues rose 8 percent from the year-earlier period, to $295.5 million, while net income, before some special charges, was $3.1 million, compared with $15 million in the first quarter of 1996. Along with the announcement of Mr. Levin's staying on, the earnings news gave the stock a $2 lift last Tuesday.
"They suffered a series of self-inflicted wounds," Mr. Levin said, explaining Coleman's recent troubles. "A number of little things went wrong, some of them out of their control. But growth was their mantra. They never got the infrastructure in place to handle the growth. The administrative expenses were out of control."
Mr. Levin emphasized, as did the analysts, that Coleman's strong suit remained a famous brand name and a loyal middle-class following that still equates the Coleman name with its signature green camp stoves, lanterns and ice chests.
"In the middle market, which they dominate, can you even think of the No. 2 company?" Ms. Burnson asked. "I can't imagine what it is. They are still very, very strong and they can build on that."
In the interview, Mr. Levin described a two-pronged battle plan: emphasizing growth overseas, especially in the fast-growing economies of Asia and Eastern Europe, and relying more on innovative products than on the old camp stoves and the like.
He said that Coleman currently received about 25 percent of its revenues overseas, and that the figure would rise steadily in coming years. The overseas push is already being helped by Coleman's acquisition last year of Camping Gaz, a French company that is strong in Europe.
Coleman is also benefiting from another acquisition, the Eastpak backpack company. Although Mr. Levin said that, in general, Coleman was going to reduce its number of products, the backpack line was expanding well both domestically and overseas.
Mr. Levin said that one of the first things he did when he rejoined Coleman was to look for innovative products that could help lead the company into the future. He said he found three.
They are a 22-pound, gas-powered electrical generator that is about one-third the weight of competitive products, a lightweight camping stove that uses a new technology for feeding the liquid fuel to the burner and a catalytic converter developed by Camping Gaz that burns fuel without a flame. Coleman is trying to turn the burner, which is currently very expensive to make, into a mass-produced consumer product.
"These things will drive the rest of our business," Mr. Levin said of the new technologies. "If we're going to succeed we're going to have to get innovation back into the equation."
And, not least, a consistent management focus.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
It's My Party and I'll Spend if I Want To, Spend if I Want To . . .

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
BABY boomers are breaking into their 50's at the rate of one every seven seconds, but few are likely to celebrate with as much elan as Josie Natori, the diminutive sleepwear designer. On Tuesday, May 20, at 7 P.M., Ms. Natori will raise her hands above the ebony and ivory at Carnegie Hall in Manhattan, where Churchill once thundered, Tchaikovsky once wept and Frank Sinatra once crooned, and plunk out Schumann's Piano Concerto in A Minor for 2,800 of her closest friends.
"I have chutzpah," giggled the Philippine-born entrepreneur, whose birthday was actually on Friday but who chose May 20 because that is the 25th anniversary of her marriage to Ken Natori, who is also her business partner. 
 "I can't believe it myself," she said.
As she talked about the event over lunch in her office at the company's headquarters on East 34th Street, she fiddled endlessly with a yellow wool scarf wrapped casually around her neck -- the only visible sign that she might be nervous.
On her big day, Ms. Natori will don a long silk dress of her own design and take center stage at Carnegie with the 85-member Orchestra of St. Luke's, which she has hired to perform for an array of guests including family, friends, customers, investment bankers and the news media.
Ms. Natori has a lot of company among the rich and famous who, in middle age, suddenly decide to enact a fantasy. Maybe the events that were supposed to be milestones in their younger days -- their Sweet 16 parties, senior proms, even weddings -- lacked pizazz. Or maybe they just want a rocking good time, and now they can afford it.
Consider Frank Marshall, the producer of Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and Back to the Future films and an amateur magician and guitarist. For his 50th birthday party last October, he invited 500 friends to U.C.L.A.'s 10,000-seat basketball arena to watch him perform.
The extravaganza -- the guest list included Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Michael Ovitz and other Hollywood heavies -- centered around music and magic. There were jugglers, fortune tellers, palm readers and even the actor Mark Harmon's celebrity baseball team. Bert Fields, the Hollywood lawyer, backed by the U.C.L.A. marching band, serenaded the birthday boy with a round of "Happy Birthday."
Mr. Marshall even got his buddy Jimmy Buffett to join him in warbling Mr. Buffett's trademark tune, "Margueritaville." But the high point of the gala for Mr. Marshall was a particular magic trick: "You haven't lived till you have sawed someone in half," he said.
Make that you haven't lived till you have sawed your better half in half. Mr. Marshall's wife and business partner, Kathleen Kennedy, was the one who succumbed to the blade.
After the job was done, somebody in the crowd shouted out, "Don't put her back together," he recalled.
Some people just can't wait until they hit 50 to celebrate themselves. Ethan Penner, who earned $23 million in 1995 from Nomura Securities, where he oversees real-estate loans, has a weakness for celebrities and has hired Elton John (whose own recent 50th birthday costume ball was festive, to say the least) and the Eagles rock group to entertain clients at business conferences.
So, on his 35th birthday, Mr. Penner's wife and friends gave him the thrill of his life: they paid Wilt Chamberlain and Julius Erving, two of the greatest professional basketball players of all time, in the neighborhood of $35,000 to join Mr. Penner and his pals for a game at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. They played for four hours, and "I really had a great time," he said.
OTHER people celebrate later in life, and in a more sedate fashion. To mark his 60th birthday in January 1994, James Wolfensohn, who then headed his own investment banking boutique and is now president of the World Bank, took over Carnegie Hall, where he entertained about 500 friends by playing the cello with pals including the violinists Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman. At that time, Mr. Wolfensohn had already stepped down as chairman of Carnegie Hall.
Certainly, no one undertakes such an effort for business reasons alone. But it doesn't hurt. Ms. Natori's guest list will include notables of the fashion world like Allen I. Questrom, outgoing chairman of of Federated Department Stores; Philip B. Miller, chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue; Michael Gould, chief executive of Bloomingdale's, and James E. Preston, chairman of Avon, which handles Ms. Natori's perfumes. And, of course, there will be a clutch of other designers, including Adrienne Vittadini, Pauline Trigere and Vera Wang.
Though Ms. Natori is associated with her ultra-feminine sleepwear and lingerie, she was a piano prodigy in the Philippines, where she had performed before 800 people twice by the time she was 19.
"But I grew up knowing I wanted to be in business," she said. "I never considered music for a minute. I didn't have the temperament."
She also had no qualms about wanting to be self-sufficient.
"My father was an entrepreneur in the real estate business," she recalled. "My mother and my grandmother both encouraged me to be independent. The Philippines is a very matriarchal and very entrepreneurial society."
NOR did her family mind sending her to New York in 1964, when she was only 17, to study. She enrolled at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., graduating with honors in economics. From there, she went to Wall Street, opening an office in Manila for Bache & Company before switching to Merrill Lynch and rising there to become the first woman vice president in investment banking.
Nine years of high finance would be enough. By 1977, she had married Ken Natori, a director at Shearson Lehman, and she longed for both the autonomy and the opportunity for self-expression that she believed she could find as an entrepreneur.
"Wall Street lacked an artistic element," she said. "Some people say deals are creative, but I don't know if that's true."
So she visited her native land, looking for products that might be a hit in the United States.
First, and bought a bunch of hand-woven baskets, figuring that she could sell them to big American retail chains. She couldn't. Next she went into Philippine-made blouses, only to be told by a buyer from Bloomingdale's that she ought to make them into nightshirts.
She did, and her business took off. In 1986, Ken Natori quit Wall Street to join her as chairman, focusing on the financial side. Today, they share an office in their Manhattan headquarters.
From nightshirts, the business expanded into undergarments for women -- and her very inexperience in the garment trade gave her an edge, she believes. "When I first came into this business, lingerie was still considered one of two things -- kinky or something your grandmother wears," Ms. Natori once said. She sought to change that. "I treated lingerie like clothes because I didn't know any differently," she recalled. "I wasn't brought up in the fashion business."
For all her success on Wall Street and on Seventh Avenue, Ms. Natori never forgot music. She continued to play it at parties and attended concerts. Then, in 1994, she became serious about giving a concert as part of her 50th birthday party.
With help from her teacher, Robert DeGaetano, she has been practicing about five or six hours a day on the weekends.
"I really try to concentrate, but last week, I had a very bad week, and Robert had to be on my case. He called all the time to make sure I am practicing," Ms. Natori conceded ruefully. She said she chose the Schumann A minor concerto because it was "romantic and also something I could handle."
When she first got the idea to give a concert, she figured she would invite about 500 people.
But "me and my big mouth, when I saw people, I kept saying, 'Come to the concert,' " she said. Her husband did the same. The list grew.
"I see my life passing in front of my eyes," she said. "All our worlds will be at the concert: Wall Street, fashion" and about 100 family members from the Philippines, Seattle and Japan. (Mr. Natori is Japanese-American.)
"My father doesn't know much about music," she said. "He once began to applaud before the concert was over, but he wants to sit in the front row, and so he will."
LUCKILY, Ms. Natori can handily afford the event. The Natori Company, which now includes fragrances, generated about $80 million in sales last year. The price tag for the evening is about $500,000 -- including the hall, the orchestra, the airplane tickets and all the extras. And, as long as the guest list brims with enough clients and business acquaintances, a good chunk of it may well be tax deductible.
Mr. Marshall, the movie producer, did not even want to know how much his party cost. His business manager paid the bills.
"You're only 50 once," he said cheerfully. "I just wanted to have a great event."
"The party sort of started small and then mushroomed into a 50th birthday party reunion. It turned into a celebration of turning 50 for a lot of people," he said. "When I started going through the guest list, I thought, 'I can't invite this person without inviting that person.' Pretty soon the numbers were swelling. It ended up being about 500."
Ms. Natori hit a much higher number, in part because she will be celebrating two events -- her birthday and her 1972 wedding, which, with only 70 people attending, was a relatively tiny affair. The night after the concert, the Natoris will renew their vows and hold a dinner for the family.
That will be the icing on the cake, so to speak. In the meantime, Ms. Natori had butterflies last week about the concert. "I can't believe I am doing it myself," she said. "Now it is too late to back out."
And however friendly the audience may be, she will still be playing to a tough crowd. At a time when a lot of women her age are reaching for the concealing cream to hide their wrinkles, she is flaunting her age before a crowd of fashionphiles.
"I think it is terrific," said Mr. Questrom of Federated. "She is not afraid of being 50. She is celebrating it. She is giving it a new spin."

HEADLINE: HEALTH CARE'S GIANT -- When Hospitals Play Hardball;
A Hospital Chain's Brass Knuckles, and the Backlash

BYLINE: By MARTIN GOTTLIEB and KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
MOTORISTS in West Palm Beach, Fla., were recently confronted by a billboard 100 yards from the Wellington Regional Medical Center. "Why Stop Here?" it asked.
The sign advertised a nearby rival, the Columbia Palms West Hospital, owned by the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation. The billboard was a literal sign of the times from Columbia, the world's largest health care company. 
 No other operator of hospitals has become so successful or so big so fast in the increasingly cost-conscious system of American medicine. At the heart of that achievement is an aggressively competitive vision of medical care, one that applies the practices of corporate America to an industry still dominated by not-for-profit institutions.
These practices include not only in-your-face marketing, but hospital takeovers, cost-cutting and layoffs, volume purchasing, complex pricing strategies and large monetary incentives for managers who meet financial targets.
The formula has helped the company grow in a decade from nothing to $20 billion in revenues, with roughly 350 hospitals, 550 home-health-care offices and scores of other medical businesses in 38 states. Columbia says it is a model for efficient, high-quality health care. And indeed, the company is widely admired for driving a long-wasteful industry to change, and its strategies are often copied.
But now some of the very things that propelled Columbia are troubling people inside and outside the company, in some cases producing a backlash:
* The company intensely pressures managers to raise profits by cutting costs and increasing patient revenues. Administrators have been able to almost double their salaries through bonuses based almost entirely on meeting financial targets. By contrast, about half of the industry does not offer bonuses, and hospitals that do usually tie them more closely to standards like mortality rates and programs that benefit the community. Some doctors, nurses and administrators, angered by rapid staff cuts that raise profits, are questioning whether care is being compromised -- an accusation that the company sharply disputes.
* Columbia markets itself with assertions that its prices are lower and its quality higher than its competitors'. Yet a computer analysis for The New York Times shows that the median price paid for patients in Columbia hospitals is 8 percent higher than the norm. And there is no conclusive evidence that Columbia's care is better than that provided elsewhere.
* Columbia has used bare-knuckled competitive tactics once rarely seen in the hospital industry. Critics say the company can be unnecessarily ruthless and even petty when it does not get its way, from suing communities that reject its efforts to acquire hospitals to maintaining a skeletal hospital with only two inpatient beds, in order to avoid surrendering a valued operating license. From San Diego to Providence, communities wary of Columbia's hardball tactics have recently resisted its attempts to buy local hospitals.
On top of this, the company is the subject of several Federal inquiries. Criminal investigators raided its operations in El Paso two months ago and scores of Federal agents have been interviewing doctors and others familiar with the company's practices around the country.
The Federal agency that runs Medicare is also investigating whether certain Columbia hospitals have systematically overbilled the Government by overstating the severity of the illnesses they treat. It is also studying whether doctors who invest in Columbia hospitals and regional health systems violate the law by referring patients to outpatient services, like home care, in which they have investments.
Columbia executives dismiss criticism as anecdotal misinformation from disgruntled employees or others who do not understand the company. They say that while Columbia is aggressive, it plays fair.
Richard L. Scott, chief executive of Columbia, said his company was only responding to demands to curb runaway medical costs. "There's no way, as taxpayers, as employers, as employees, as individuals, people are going to pay what they paid in the past for health care," he said. "So if you say, 'O.K., that's true,' then we've got to change."
A result, the company proclaims in advertisements, is health care that "has never worked like this before."
 
The Beginnings
The Entrepreneur As a Maverick
 Mr. Scott, 44, is lean and driven, almost a personal model for his company. He typically begins his days with 5 A.M. workouts. He neither smokes nor drinks.
"I've never heard him use a four-letter word," said David Colby, a former chief financial officer with the company.
Mr. Scott grew up in Kansas City, Mo., where his father was a truck driver and his mother worked, among other jobs, as a clerk at J. C. Penney. While in college, he made his first foray into business with his mother and brother, buying and reviving two Kansas City doughnut shops.
After graduating from Southern Methodist University Law School, he did legal work for hospital companies. But he had other goals. In 1987, he created the Columbia Hospital Corporation with Richard E. Rainwater, a Texas financier. Each invested $125,000 and sought money on Wall Street. Mr. Scott was the operations man, although he had never run a hospital.
In 1988, the company spent $48 million, most of it borrowed, on its first purchase, two down-at-the-mouth hospitals in El Paso. Over the next few years, Columbia scooped up hospitals one by one, mainly in Texas and Florida. But its big steps came in 1993 and 1994, when it absorbed the more than 160 hospitals of the industry's earlier leaders, the Humana Corporation and the Hospital Corporation of America, known as HCA, both of which were faltering. Humana and HCA had prospered since the 1960's, but stalled in the 80's when Medicare and private insurers began limiting reimbursements. Struggling, Humana had spun off its 75 hospitals into a new company, Galen Health Care, which Columbia later purchased.
That Columbia, with 25 hospitals, could swallow Galen and HCA was a testament to the attractiveness of its stock. In each case, the company offered some of its rapidly appreciating shares in exchange for the lackluster stock of its target.
The company renamed itself Columbia/ HCA. In 1995, Columbia absorbed another large chain, Healthtrust, which had 117 hospitals, also by offering Columbia shares.
Today, Columbia is the largest health care provider in dozens of American towns and cities, including Atlanta, Denver, Houston, Miami and Nashville, where it is based. Since going public in 1990 Columbia's shares have more than quadrupled in value, to a high this year of $44.875. In just the last five years, the company's market capitalization has ballooned from a low in 1992 of about $2 billion to more than $25 billion today. The company's shares closed Friday at $36.625.
This notwithstanding, Mr. Scott portrays Columbia as a maverick challenging the medical establishment. Columbia may run roughly half of America's 700 for-profit hospitals, he notes, but most of the nation's 5,200 hospitals are not-for-profit institutions.
However wary they may be of Columbia, rivals from this sphere often acknowledge Mr. Scott's business acumen. "Here's a fellow with a law degree who has not spent one day in the traditional administration of a hospital who has outsmarted people with years more experience," said Peter Young, a consultant for nonprofit hospitals.

Formula for Success
Record of Reviving Troubled Hospitals
Cedars Medical Center in Miami was struggling when Columbia assumed control in 1993. Today the company holds Cedars up as an example of how to turn a hospital around.
Columbia poured money into the emergency room and the radiology suites and purchased a battery of high-technology medical machinery. Doctors were offered investments in the hospital, allowing them to share in its profits.
Columbia sliced costs by closing a nearby hospital and cutting Cedars's staff. Today the 1,600 Cedars employees care for roughly the same number of patients as 2,300 workers once did at both hospitals. Cedars also benefits from Columbia's size, which allows it to demand discounts on everything from soft drinks to surgical supplies.
Cedars became part of a Columbia regional network that includes not only hospitals but outpatient surgery centers, home care agencies and other facilities. Such services attract insurers because they cost less than hospitalization. Columbia also benefits because Medicare payments for such services can be far more lucrative than those for hospital care. Columbia also began to bill Medicare far more aggressively for inpatient care at Cedars.
Today, admissions at Cedars are booming. Outpatient procedures have doubled. Profits have ballooned more than 15-fold, to $30 million last year. "Columbia saved this institution," Dr. Arthur Katzman, a vascular surgeon, said.
"Has Columbia built a better mousetrap in the competitive world of health care?" said Joe Swedish, a Columbia executive who spent more than 20 years working for not-for-profit hospitals. "I believe it has."
That belief is hardly universal.

Pressure for Profits
Managers Answer To Wall St. Investors
Mark E. Singer will attest to the pressure Columbia managers feel to meet profit goals.
Last August, executives from Columbia's Midwest division ordered Mr. Singer and 14 other department heads at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago into the hospital board room to lambaste them, one by one, for failing to cut costs aggressively enough, recalled Mr. Singer, administrative director for medicine at the time. (His job has since been eliminated.)
Mr. Singer was stunned by his treatment. "My father owned and operated a millinery factory in the garment district, and I never witnessed such an extent of demeaning, debasing and devaluing behavior in the tough street environment as I personally experienced on 29 August," he wrote to the hospital's chief operating officer.
In his case, Mr. Singer recalled, the team's ire focused first on the admission of three patients with no insurance to a special heart unit. In an interview, he said he had previously been instructed by the chief operating officer of the hospital not to admit "self pays" to the unit, and indeed the medical director of the unit, Dr. Earl Silber, confirmed that Mr. Singer had informed him of this policy in 1995. Columbia denies having such a policy and Dr. Silber said the unit always found a way to accept such patients regardless of the instructions he received from Mr. Singer.
Columbia administrators who meet their profit goals win big bonuses. Those who don't, forgo their bonuses -- and sometimes lose their jobs.
In 1995, 25 percent of Columbia's administrators won bonuses of at least 80 percent of their salaries, according to the Advisory Board, a consulting company. Thirty percent received none.
Company records show that at least 90 percent of the 1995 bonuses were based on financial performance. Where hospitals operate in regional networks, for example, 40 percent of their bonuses was based on reaching a pretax profit target at the hospital and 50 percent on profits in the network or division.
Ten percent of the bonus was discretionary. But the company suggested that this be based on revenue-producing yardsticks like "growth in admissions and surgery cases."
A company spokeswoman said that beginning next year bonuses would be paid based partly on the results of patient satisfaction surveys at hospitals, but she declined to say how much those results would affect bonuses. She said the company had also suggested that managers could use doctor and employee satisfaction surveys in determining bonuses.
Other hospital operators use annual bonuses, but Columbia is among the most aggressive. Every Columbia hospital has such programs, compared with about 57 percent for the industry as a whole, according to the Hay Group, a consulting firm. Among government-operated and not-for-profit hospitals, 47 percent use financial incentives.
And the average amount paid in bonuses at not-for-profit hospitals is far lower than that paid at for-profits. According to Hay, not-for-profits pay an average of 19.7 percent of salary to top administrators as an incentive bonus; for-profit hospitals pay an average of 41.5 percent.
Moreover, while executives in the not-for-profit sector are rewarded for financial performance, monetary incentives are heavily weighted toward other achievements like low death rates and programs to benefit local communities, said Dr. William Liccione, a senior consultant at Hay.
Then there is the threat of losing one's job. In 1995, 100 of about 350 Columbia hospital administrators were replaced, according to the Advisory Board, and while many were promoted or left voluntarily, the consulting company found, large numbers were "moved out" of the organization.
The company makes no apologies for setting hard goals. "Do I believe that people feel like there's high expectations?" Mr. Scott said in an interview. "Sure. But I'm not uncomfortable with that."
Pressure to meet profit targets, the head of one Columbia hospital explained, comes from Wall Street, especially because the company has paid for acquisitions with stock. Mr. Colby, the former chief financial officer, described how Wall Street's expectations make their way to the local hospital. Columbia sets targets for yearly profit growth -- typically about 15 percent. Each of the company's regional managers must deliver his or her prescribed portion. Regional executives, in turn, give hospital administrators targets to meet.
When a hospital lags behind, administrators can be called to task, more than a dozen past and present company executives said. "The message was very clear that either you would achieve these goals or they would find someone who would achieve those goals," one former hospital administrator said.
Samuel Greco, a vice president for operations, said he was disturbed by accounts of harsh treatment, which he said were remnants from companies Columbia absorbed. "Treating people with anything less than dignity and professionalism is absolutely unacceptable in any way," he said.
Few of the administrators critical of the company were willing to speak for attribution for fear of reprisal. One, John Leifer, a former senior vice president, said such fear was understandable. Last month, he wrote in an industry publication that he had resigned in part because of conflicts with company policies. He said that he had since been contacted by a senior Columbia executive who indicated "that I would be hearing from their legal department in short order."
Mr. Leifer added: "When I signed up for the organization, I believed in the gospel of Rick Scott. Suffice it to say, I've lost my faith."

Treatment Concerns
Of Financial Health And Patient Care
 The pressure to meet financial targets concerns some nurses, doctors and other professionals at Columbia.
"You have a highly decentralized system that grants a lot of autonomy to local and regional officers, and those officers have very significant monetary incentives tied to the net profitability of their markets," Mr. Leifer said. "I feel that this could be a prescription for disaster, because it can create tremendous temptation to make budget at times by inappropriate action."
There is no definitive evidence that the care at Columbia is better or worse than that provided elsewhere. Company executives said they monitored how patients fared to insure a high level of medical care. And some doctors and nurses said that care at hospitals acquired by Columbia had remained the same or improved even after personnel were cut. At Columbia Medical City Hospital in Dallas, for example, Dr. Winfred Parnell, the former chief of staff, said that standards had not slipped since the hospital was owned by Humana. "The quality of care had always been very high and we have not noticed any change," he said.
But others around the country expressed concern about their hospitals. In 1995, Columbia Women's Hospital in Indianapolis shrank its nursing staff and cut some nurses' pay. The result was an acute nursing shortage, with more responsibilities turned over to lesser-trained technicians.
Problems quickly arose. In July 1995, Dr. Bonnie Miller found herself caring for a newborn with breathing problems without the help of a qualified nurse. The baby pulled through, but Dr. Miller was disturbed.
In a letter to the hospital administrator, she wrote, "I hope that our quality of care at the Women's Hospital of Indianapolis would not be jeopardized by your endeavor to save money."
Despite the complaint, no changes were made. In January 1996, Kathryn Calahan, a nursing technician, who is qualified to handle certain nursing duties, arrived for work in the neonatal intensive-care unit. She was paired with a nurse who also had little training in the critical care of infants.
Ms. Calahan expressed her concerns to her superiors. The response was quick, according to state records and interviews. Ms. Calahan was told that if she was unwilling to accept the assignment, she could find employment elsewhere, according to nurses and state records. Columbia said it does not comment on personnel matters.
Nurses and doctors had begun contacting the state health department. And a state inspection soon found widespread problems.
Nursing levels were short around the hospital, according to the inspection report. The neonatal intensive-care unit was in particular disarray. Investigators found technicians -- without appropriate supervision from registered nurses -- handling complex tasks like inserting feeding tubes in premature newborns. Babies were attended as infrequently as every three hours. Once, the only nurse caring for seven ill infants was so busy she failed to hear an alarm when a baby stopped breathing. A parent dashed to the baby and stimulated breathing, the state report said.
The findings led to a $25,000 fine. Columbia settled the Indianapolis case without admitting wrongdoing, paying $12,500. A Columbia spokeswoman said the company worked closely with the state, adding that the state had since found the hospital in compliance.
But concerns about the adequacy of nursing care and the competence of support staff emerged in interviews with doctors, nurses, patients and volunteers at Columbia hospitals.
At Columbia Orange Park Medical Center outside Jacksonville, Fla., Cheryl Lorenzo, a nurse for 13 years who was highly regarded by the hospital, was part of an exodus last year after a reorganization. "With the current patient load of a minimum of 15 patients, you are sacrificing safety and care," Ms. Lorenzo wrote in her resignation letter last April. "I lie awake at night going over and over in my mind the events of the day. Did I do what needed to be done?"
Doctors express similar concerns. "Somebody's going to get hurt; we've come close to that," said Dr. Jamal Modir, a general surgeon at Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose, Calif., who last year, a few months after Columbia took over, bemoaned nursing cuts and shake-ups that led to the replacement of many of the hospital's experienced nurses. He said he was striving to work with the hospital's chief executive to correct many of the problems. "Many times we don't know the nurses," he said. "When I get a call at night, should I depend on what she says? I don't know."
At Columbia Audubon Hospital in Louisville, Ky., Dr. Alan Lansing, a leading heart surgeon, recalled his distress last year when his cadre of nurses began to disperse through a staff reorganization. Many were transferred to other units; other nurses quit. He complained to administrators, who assured him that quality had not been compromised.
"I think the people who decided it didn't know much about how hospitals run or how staffs function," Dr. Lansing said. "These people don't understand about quality of care. And they don't want to listen to those of us who do."
Columbia executives dispute that there are any quality shortfalls at their hospitals, and say that much of the concern stems from doctors and nurses facing a world of medicine that is being forced to change for economic reasons.
Moreover, they said that the company was working to make patients fare even better. At Audubon, for example, Dr. Stephen Newman, president of Columbia's Louisville operations, said that the hospital closely examined such patient data to insure that it maintained the highest quality.
He also acknowledged that communications between administrators and doctors had been "suboptimal" in the past, but said that the company had begun efforts to improve that through regular meetings with doctors, task forces and other initiatives.
Reorganizations have created upheaval at for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals alike, and Columbia is by no means alone in generating criticism. Beyond savings, the theory behind the practice is that even with fewer workers, patients will receive better care because duties will be better organized.
But advocates of this practice say that to minimize disruption, administrators must extensively consult employees while introducing the procedures over as long as a year.
Columbia's time frame is much shorter, several former administrators say.
One former administrator who works for a not-for-profit hospital said a training process that is taking six months at his current employer had to be done in as little as two weeks at Columbia.
Columbia executives acknowledged pushing to conclude the training quickly, but said this could be positive. "The speed at which we ask folks to evaluate and implement re-engineering I'm sure is much quicker than what the industry has been used to," Mr. Greco, the senior vice president for operations, said. "If you study good companies and great companies over time, it would seem that when they've made changes, they've made changes swiftly."

Raising Revenues
When Costs Are Cut But Prices Are Not
"We can provide a better product at a better price," Mr. Scott proclaimed in an interview in 1994. And over the years, in its advertising and presentations in communities, Columbia has repeated that.
Columbia would have trouble convincing Nancy Brown.
In September 1995, Ms. Brown, an aerobics instructor, wrenched her knee. Four months later, she underwent surgery at Columbia Palms West Hospital in West Palm Beach. As she recalls, the surgery lasted about 20 minutes, her stay about four hours.
There were no complications -- until the bill arrived. Columbia charged Ms. Brown $32 for an ice pack, $34.50 for a sterile Ace bandage and $12.50 for a pair of surgical gloves. Two milligrams of Versed, a sedative that sells for roughly $4 wholesale, was billed at $29.03. A solution of the sedative Diprivan, about $12 wholesale, was billed at $102.18.
The total bill: $5,921.
"I was in shock," said Ms. Brown, whose insurance covered less than half the cost. "This digs into college funds."
While Columbia lowers prices for health maintenance organizations and employers that can provide many patients, many others are not so lucky. Ms. Brown lost out because she and her husband are self-employed and buy their insurance individually rather than as part of a large group, said her lawyer, Scott R. Shepherd, who has filed a class action that accuses Columbia of systematic overbilling.
Of course, many hospital bills include high charges for seemingly small items. But for many customers, Columbia bills higher and collects more than competitors. An analysis performed for The New York Times using the most recent data available, from 1995, shows that the median charge for a hospital stay at Columbia, before any discounts, was $2,300, or 35 percent higher per patient than the industry norm, when differences in regional wages for employees and the mix of cases are considered.
These days, most insurers negotiate discounts, and full prices are rarely paid. Yet the analysis shows that even when discounts and managed-care contracts are considered, Columbia's prices for in-the-hospital services are higher than average. In 1995, the last year for which complete data are available, the amount paid for the median-priced stay in a Columbia hospital was $4,370 -- 8 percent higher than that at other hospitals after accounting for differences in regional wages and the mix of cases.
The data also showed that Columbia's median cost for providing care to a patient was 1.5 percent less than other hospitals'. In other words, while cost-cutting saved the company money, many patients did not see the savings.
The study was performed by the Center for Health Care Industry Performance Studies at Ohio State University, which publishes an authoritative annual compendium of hospital data.
"Columbia has much higher prices and slightly lower costs," said William O. Cleverly, a professor of finance who runs the center. "The reason they make more money, the majority of it, is related to prices, not cost."
Professor Cleverly said one reason Columbia could charge more is that many of its hospitals are in affluent areas where most residents are well-insured. He said Columbia also benefited from its high prices because many insurance plans negotiate to pay a percentage of the full price; if the full price is higher, they pay more.
David Manning, a Columbia vice president, disputed the findings and said the company's success proved that its prices were competitive: "In today's competitive health-care system, it is inconceivable that hospitals can be successful if their pricing is out of line with the market."
Mr. Manning took issue with the way the Ohio State research group analyzed Columbia's price data. "Of the available measures, you have selected the one that puts Columbia in the least favorable light," he said. Columbia itself has bought raw data from the Ohio State unit, but chose not to analyze it in the manner used by those researchers and by many consulting organizations. Instead, the company used three other methods based on averages instead of medians. Using two of those, Columbia found its prices to be roughly 5 percent higher than the norm. Only one method showed Columbia with better prices, at 7 percent below the average for all other hospitals. But that method did not exclude hospitals with the most extreme high and low prices, as is generally done to avoid skewing the outcomes.
Beyond its charges to patients, Columbia has come under Government scrutiny for its bills to Medicare. The agency that runs the program is investigating whether, to reap higher reimbursements, certain Columbia hospitals overstated the seriousness of illnesses they treated.
In a statement, Columbia said it expected employees to follow the law and that if mistakes were made it would correct them.

The Rating Game
Varied Definitions Of Hospital Quality
 As evidence of the quality of care at their hospitals, Columbia executives cite accolades from the chief hospital accreditation group and an industry consultant's study, and say that their hospitals receive high marks on patient-satisfaction surveys the company commissions. But measuring quality is an imprecise science. And awards for quality often reflect factors that do not directly affect care, like financial performance and hiring procedures.
For example, Columbia advertises that 17 of its hospitals were named to a list assembled by Mercer Health Care Provider Consulting of the nation's top 100 hospitals. Last year, one of them was the Florida hospital with the billboard, Palms West, and in fact the billboard advertised "Top 100 in the U.S.A." While some of the study's standards deal with patient care, the majority measure financial performance. Moreover, the list is based on how hospitals compared with others of similar size and nature. The result is that a small hospital like Columbia's Horizon Medical Center in Dickson, Tenn., can make the list, while nationally acclaimed centers like the Mayo Clinic and Massachusetts General do not.
Another achievement cited by Columbia comes from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the main hospital accreditation group. Nearly 30 percent of the company's hospitals have been awarded the commission's highest honors, compared with about 4 percent of all hospitals.
Commission officials say their survey measures the quality of care, but many experts question whether it adequately measures what is happening at the bedside. For example, the commission studies how hospitals monitor whether nurses are licensed. But it does not look at the ratio of nurses to patients or the appropriateness of many treatments they deliver.
The result, these critics say, is that a hospital with its paperwork in order can pass the commission's reviews with flying colors, even as the hospital's medical staff is decrying poor- care.
"We spend a lot of time doing paper trails for the J.C.A.H.O.," said one doctor on the quality-assurance committee at Columbia's Orange Park Medical Center, who insisted on anonymity. "There is very little time spent any more on actual quality."

Hanging Tough
A Company's Wrath When It Is Scorned
 For all its size, Columbia portrays itself as a collection of locally run hospitals that provide free community and charitable services. "Our facilities are locally managed by hometown people who share the values and interests of their communities," the company says on its Internet site.
But in many communities, the company has earned a reputation as an outsider willing to throw its weight around to get what it wants..
Federal investigators have interviewed at least five hospital executives in Florida who said the company offered jobs and perquisites to them or to their associates while negotiating with them about taking over their hospitals. Federal bribery laws prohibit such enticements, but the investigators recommended against prosecution in these cases because of the small value of the enticements and because the evidence involved conversations difficult to corroborate.
A few other pages from the Columbia scrapbook:
* When Lawrence Hospital, a community-owned facility in Lawrence, Kan., refused three buyout offers from Columbia, the company took an option on property nearby and sought to build a competing hospital. "We like to say here that they approached us in a very aggressive manner to marry them," said Ray Davis, chairman of the hospital board. "And when we said no, they decided they were going to kill us."
Earlier this year, at a meeting where hundreds of local residents showed up to oppose Columbia's efforts, the city commission unanimously voted to block construction. Columbia is suing the city.
* In 1994, Columbia announced its desire to close a money-losing 52-bed hospital in Destin, Fla., but it did not want to relinquish what was perhaps the hospital's most valuable asset -- its hard-to-come-by state operating license. So Columbia continued to run the facility as America's tiniest hospital, with two inpatient beds, the smallest number permissible. State inspectors later found that the company was not even maintaining those beds properly.
* As nurses at Audubon Medical Center in Louisville were preparing to vote on whether to join a union, David Vandewater, Columbia's chief operating officer, warned them that if the vote to approve the union succeeded, the company would refuse to negotiate, according to a legal complaint brought by the National Labor Relations Board. Last month, an administrative law judge ruled that the hospital had violated Federal labor laws through a series of actions and ordered it to negotiate with the nurses immediately.
"I do think there's a pattern here, and it's really tragic," said John Cusack, a lawyer who has locked horns with Columbia on behalf of several not-for-profit hospitals.
Many of these stories have another side, Columbia officials said. In Lawrence, Jamie Hopping, president of Columbia's western operations, said that the company was proceeding with its efforts to build a hospital despite the opposition because it believed the facility was needed and because it had the support of numerous community leaders.
In Destin, company officials said the hospital simply wasn't financially viable, but that they had worked hard to come up with other medical uses for it.
Mr. Vandewater said that at Audubon he was misunderstood about the company's willingness to negotiate with a union, and had only intended to tell nurses that he personally would not be among the negotiators. As for the administrative law judge's finding, the company said it planned to appeal.

Recent Setbacks
Some New Projects Stall at Roadblocks
Columbia last year set its sights west and north, from California to Rhode Island. Suddenly it began to taste defeat with unaccustomed regularity.
Its experience in Rhode Island was typical. Columbia struck a deal to buy the Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence. The state had no for-profit hospitals, and Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, a Democrat, said he began to look into Columbia. "It didn't take me long to know what common sense already told me: that this wasn't the kind of hospital I wanted for my community," he said.
Soon, Mr. Kennedy arranged forums that became rallying points for opponents Columbia had collected as it rose to prominence. Nurses who had battled Columbia's staff cuts testified; state attorneys general who had fought the company sent in statements.
Finally, last month the state Health Commissioner put the deal on hold while she undertook an extensive review.
Columbia's failure to move forward in Rhode Island was not isolated. The attorneys general of Michigan and California rejected major Columbia hospital deals in Lansing and San Diego. The Ohio Insurance Department rejected the company's agreement to take over the assets of Ohio Blue Cross. In many communities, groups have rallied against hospital takeovers by Columbia, sometimes under the slogan of "ABC," or "anyone but Columbia."
The aggressive business tactics that worked so well for the fledgling company have not played as well now. Most frequently cited are concerns that Columbia is buying hospitals on the cheap without enough assurances that it will continue to offer the same level of charity care or clinical services.
The resistance comes as Columbia counts on expanding comprehensive networks of hospitals and other medical services. And with its stock price down almost 20 percent in recent months during the Government investigations and collapsed deals, Columbia stock has not been as attractive to the shareholders of target companies.
The company is trying several new tactics to keep growing. For one, it is giving fresh attention to overseas acquisitions. And it is building 12 hospitals around the United States.
As for criticism, Mr. Scott has always expected it in his effort to transform the hospital industry. That was his message in a letter sent to tens of thousands of Columbia doctors in December 1994.
"I am reminded of an old passage about change that was recently sent to me," he wrote. " 'There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who profit by the new order.' "
Perhaps most telling was the passage's unidentified source. As he reflected on an industry in which thousands of institutions are named for saints and samaritans, Mr. Scott was quoting Machiavelli, the master analyst of political cunning.

GRAPHIC: Photos: A Sign of Change In Patient Care -- Although he has never run a hospital, Richard L. Scott, chief executive of Columbia/HCA Healthcare, built the world's largest health care company with a policy of aggressively acquiring hospitals, strictly controlling costs and fiercely competing with established rivals, many of which are not-for-profit operations. Its forceful tactics have included the billboard at left, outside the Wellington Regional Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., promoting a Columbia hospital nearby. The "top 100" rating refers to a list assembled by a consulting company that was based on standards that dealt largely with financial health rather than the quality of patient care. (Palm Beach Post); Critics Turn Up The Volume -- Protesters including members of the Gray Panthers gathered last week at the statehouse in Rhode Island, where Columbia/HCA has been trying to buy the Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence and turn it into the state's first for-profit hospital. The Rhode Island Health Commissioner has put that deal on hold, pending a detailed review. As Columbia has encountered opposition around the nation to its expansion, its hot-performing stock has cooled. (Kirsten Elstner for The New York Times); Cheryl Lorenzo, a nurse for 13 years, complained of an increased patient load in her resignation letter to a hospital owned by Columbia/HCA near Jacksonville, Fla.; Nancy Brown, an aerobics instructor, said she was shocked by a $5,921 bill, including $32 for an ice pack, for her outpatient knee surgery at Columbia Palms West Hospital.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ROOSEVELT ISLAND;
Residents Want Answers on State Money

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Ever since Gov. George E. Pataki eliminated millions of dollars in state subsidies for Roosevelt Island last year, the Governor's administrator for the island, Jerome H. Blue, has found himself the lightning rod for residents angry over the cuts.
Now, however, the level of hostility has escalated, with residents and elected officials accusing Mr. Blue of failing to provide information on how he is spending the money allocated. The officials, led by Assemblyman Alexander B. Pete Grannis, threaten to subpoena Mr. Blue and hold him in contempt if he does not provide details by Friday. 
 The president of the island's tenants association, Patrick Stewart, said that Mr. Blue had given only partial answers to budget questions and that the group had had to resort to nearly a dozen requests under the Federal Freedom of Information Act. "These are obstructionist tactics," he said, "and a lot of people over here are just mad as hell."
"I need information," Mr. Grannis said. "If he doesn't ask for the money, I can't fight for it. If he says we're O.K., we won't spend the money, I'm stymied." If Mr. Blue does not comply, Mr. Grannis said he will convene a public forum and subpoena Mr. Blue. A recent letter sent by Mr. Grannis and others to Mr. Blue said his earlier response to inquiries was "not acceptable."
The letter was signed by three Democrats: Mr. Grannis; Councilman A. Gifford Miller, and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, as well as a Republican, State Senator Olga A. Mendez.
Mr. Pataki has criticized Roosevelt Island for "over-reliance upon state funds." For two decades, the state has subsidized the operating budget for the difference between what it costs to manage the island and what the island collects in rent and other revenue, which last year totaled $8.8 million. The state provides all the money for its long-term capital construction budget.
In the 1997 fiscal year, the State Legislature provided $600,000 for day-to-day operations and nothing for capital expenses; in 1996, it provided $1 million for daily costs and $5.2 million for capital costs. The officials want to know how Mr. Blue will finance what they contend is $7 million worth of continuing construction projects, including nearly $3 million in seawall construction.
In a statement, Mr. Blue said: "If Grannis and company were truly interested, why didn't they stand up when millions of dollars were being wasted? Where were they when the mess at this agency was created, when there was poor management and poor foresight?" ANTHONY RAMIREZ

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Natural Allies? Guess Again.

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
ON paper, Councilmen Thomas K. Duane and Antonio Pagan look like natural allies. The two men, both Democrats, represent adjacent districts in lower Manhattan and are the city's first and only openly gay Council members. But here the similarities end.
Since their victories in 1991, Mr. Pagan and Mr. Duane have been locked in a bitter rivalry that has polarized the Council, cleaved the city's gay community and confounded even the most seasoned political observers. "I've been around a long time and I've never seen something this acrimonious," said Norman Adler, a Democratic political consultant. "You can't support one without making an enemy out of the other." 
 The two have not spoken in years; their names rarely appear on the same piece of legislation and the last time they showed up at a Manhattan caucus session together, Mr. Pagan slathered his nemesis with a string of expletives that stunned even battle-hardened politicians. "It's dreadful when they're in the same room," said Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge of the Upper West Side. "The tension is just horrible."
Now the two elected officials are engaged in a tug of war over competing bills that has exposed their mutual animosities -- once largely confined to the Council chambers -- to full public view. Both men have introduced legislation to bolster the rights of "domestic partners," unmarried couples, both homosexual and heterosexual, who share bank accounts, apartments and a "close and committed personal relationship." Mr. Pagan's bill would codify the city's existing domestic partner registry, which allows unmarried couples to declare their union before the City Clerk. The registry, which was established by former Mayor David N. Dinkins through an executive order that must be renewed by each incoming Mayor, gives partners standing for a variety of rights, from hospital and prison visitation privileges to the ability to inherit rent-stabilized apartments.
Mr. Duane, who calls the bill "a step backwards," is championing his own measure, which would solidify and slightly expand the benefits that the domestic partners of city workers currently enjoy. As a result of a 1993 settlement between the city and the Gay Teachers Association, unmarried partners of municipal employees receive health benefits. Mr. Duane's bill would extend other union perks, like death benefits and disability payments, to domestic partners and guarantee them future benefits as well.
Mr. Pagan's bill, which has already had a public hearing and is supported by Mayor Guiliani and Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, stands a better chance of becoming law than Mr. Duane's bill, which has never had a public hearing in the six years since it was introduced. "We think Antonio's bill is a good one," said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Mr. Vallone. "But that doesn't mean the Council can't take up Tom's measure at a later time."
To be sure, Mr. Pagan and Mr. Duane's fight over domestic partnership has more to do with politics and personality than principle, say those familiar with both men and their frequent clashes. "This fight is really a tempest in a teapot," said Andrew S. Eristoff, a Republican who represents Manhattan's East Side. "The enmity between Tom and Antonio goes back much further than these two bills."
The origins of their ill will are murky. Even the two protagonists say they can't recall the exact moment their relationship went from cordial to combative. "There was a time when we were fairly civil to one another," said Mr. Duane, who represents Greenwich Village, Chelsea and Clinton. "I wish I could remember what went wrong."
Mr. Pagan, whose district extends from the Lower East Side to Gramercy Park, says Mr. Duane and his supporters demonized him shortly after he took office. "The problem is that Tom wants to be the Council's gay guru," said Mr. Pagan, who is running for borough president in a crowded race that includes Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, a lesbian and close ally of Mr. Duane. "He feels threatened by anyone who tries take away his spotlight."
Even if one were to undo the years of perceived slights, Mr. Duane and Mr. Pagan would still be ideological opposites. Mr. Duane, 41, one of the Council's more liberal members, is a tenants' rights and gay rights advocate who has been arrested more than a dozen times for civil disobedience. Mr. Pagan, 38, is more conservative, especially on economic and development issues. He has never claimed to be a leader of the gay community. "Tom bills himself as a gay standard bearer, whereas Antonio is a politician who just happens to be gay," said Councilwoman Katherine E. Freed.
But the underlying antipathy has less to do with ideology than the peculiar brand of politics that divides Greenwich Village Democrats into two camps: those belonging to the left-leaning Village Independent Democrats and those who swear allegiance to the more conservative Village Reform Democratic Club. That split is mirrored in two gay political clubs, the Stonewall Democratic Club, which supports Mr. Pagan, and the Gay and Lesbian Independent Democrats, which backs Mr. Duane.
"Even if Tom wanted to make peace with Antonio, the people surrounding him would never let that happen," said Robert Bailey, an associate professor of public policy at Rutgers University who specializes in gay urban politics. "So many people have invested such intense emotions in their rivalry."
The hostility that many gay rights advocates feel toward Mr. Pagan has been fortified by some of the positions he has taken in the Council. Two years ago, he infuriated many by backing the reappointment of the Rev. Ruben Diaz to the Civilian Complaint Review Board, even after the minister made a series of antigay remarks. Last year, he earned a few more enemies by opposing a permit for Wigstock, the annual drag festival, in his district.
Mr. Duane's detractors feel he monopolizes gay-related issues in the Council. "Tom is a real hero in the community, and no one wants to take that away from him, but the days are gone when only one person speaks for gay New Yorkers," said Sterling Zinsmeyer, president of the Stonewall Democratic Club. "He has to realize that the gay community is not monolithic."
Neither Mr. Duane nor Mr. Pagan hold out much hope for a reconciliation. "It's irrelevant at this point," Mr. Pagan said of the prospect of making peace with his adversary. Mr. Duane, in contrast, said he would be willing to make amends if Mr. Pagan reached out to him first. "I don't like this strife," he said. "In fact I wish him well. Though of course I don't wish he wins the borough president's race."

HEADLINE: Barring Russia From NATO Would Be Mistake

 BODY:

To the Editor:
William Safire (column, May 7) argues that the real reason for NATO expansion is to protect the nations of Eastern Europe from Russia, which "with its resources and educated population, will rise again" and "will threaten again." 
 Russia in 1997 presents no threat to anyone. Mr. Safire quotes President Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania in emotional, historical references to aggressive rulers of Russia's past, yet such ancient history is irrelevant to today's political realities.
Russia has removed its troops from Eastern and Central Europe. It participates in peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia. A painful economic and political transition is going relatively smoothly. Russia successfully held parliamentary and presidential elections.
President Boris N. Yeltsin has just appointed the most liberal, reform-oriented Government since 1992. Russia has no record that would indicate its imperialist intentions, with the exception of the war in Chechnya, which was a horrible mistake.
Russia's nervous reaction to NATO expansion is understandable: remember American reaction in a similar situation during the Cuban crisis in 1962? According to recent polls, from 70 percent to 85 percent of Russians consider NATO expansion a direct threat to Russia's national security. This near-unanimity is a rare example of consensus among the Russian people and the Government.
After World War I the United States, French and British policy of alienating a defeated enemy hastened the development of a fascist Germany. After World War II the efforts of Western allies to engage West Germany and Japan in building democratic societies became a success, insuring peace for decades.
Isolating Russia from the civilized world at this critical juncture can only jeopardize the success of democratic reforms there. If NATO really wants to "provide the collective defense and foster democracy," the only logical step is to invite Russia to join.

Racetrack Plan Stirs Uproar

BYLINE: By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
A 1994 magazine ad for the Staten Island Homeport Redevelopment Project boasts an aerial photo of 36 waterfront acres with a 1,400-foot pier bisecting the Verrazano-Narrows like the mullion in a window pane, and the text extols the land's "expansive vistas of lower Manhattan, up to 1,000 parking spaces and easy access to New York City."
Three years later, the only proposal officially on the table is a bid by Ianto Roberts, a British entrepreneur, to build a 1.6 mile Formula One racetrack with a 65,000-seat grandstand. But that idea leaves Toni Grossi, president of Residents Opposed to the Auto Racetrack, or ROAR, fuming. She says her problem with the New York City Economic Development Corporation's search for proposals is symbolized by a detail of the ad: Stapleton, the neighborhood next to the homeport, is cropped from the photo. 
 Ms. Grossi contends that residents feel similarly excluded from the corporation's effort to redevelop the homeport, and that its "clandestine" search for a tenant has ignored ROAR's concerns about an autodrome's noise and the potential for local gridlock. Councilman Jerome O'Donovan, who represents the district, agreed that the corporation has not been forthcoming on the racetrack, a circumstance that his chief of staff, Tom LaManna, ascribed to Borough President Guy Molinari's jealous control of the site.
"He and his daughter, Congresswoman Susan Molinari, see it as their own fiefdom," he said.
Mr. Molinari replied, "I have not taken a side on the issue." But he indicated his leanings, perhaps, in a letter to ROAR last month saying that the racetrack proposal has not been ruled out. "In my view," he wrote, "waterfront property represents an ideal opportunity for providing Staten Island with a badly needed asset: jobs."
To which Elizabeth Egbert, a member of ROAR, replied, "Politicians think that in communities perceived as economically deprived, like ours, they can just wave jobs at us and we'll lie down and slaver like drug addicts."
Mr. Roberts estimated that four three-day Formula 1 races a year -- a total of 60 "noise hours" -- could earn $10 million for each day of use. "Big-time racing is very profitable and very good for the city," he said. "And some in Staten Island think it'll reduce the value of their homes. I can't understand that."
Nick Gnazzo, a resident, said he and his wife, Susan Roecker, who is running for City Council on a pro-racetrack platform, were opposed but changed their minds when they traveled to a Nascar track in Nazareth, Pa. "We found the whole place was clean and well-policed," Mr. Gnazzo said. "And the economic development was unbelievable."
Yet ROAR claims local support for its anti-racetrack campaign, citing the 250 people who turned out recently at a meeting of Community Board 1, at which board members voted 36 to 2 against the plan.
A commission spokeswoman, Bernadette O'Leary, said a floating casino, an earlier controversial proposal, is still a possibility. JIM O'GRADY

HEADLINE: The Nation;
In Washington, It's Never Farewell to Arms

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Government bureaucracy that manages the sale of American weapons overseas would by itself be a respectable-sized military contractor: 6,500 employees, a $500 million operating budget and sales of about $12 billion a year.
And even though the global arms market has shrunk dramatically since the cold war, the size of the sales operation has changed little. As exports by Russia and other former Communist countries declined, the United States increased its market share and now is firmly established as the world's premier arms supplier. Nearly half of all arms sold worldwide originate in the United States -- with the Government's approval and, in most cases, encouragement and support. 
 In the past four years, American weapons makers have delivered 1,625 tanks, 2,091 armored personnel carriers, 318 combat aircraft, 203 helicopters and 1,443 surface-to-air missiles around the world, the great majority through official government-to-government sales. Just last month, the Clinton Administration decided to let Lockheed Martin bid to sell F-16 fighter jets to Chile.
Those sales generate tons of paper, beginning with preliminary assessments of whether they are in America's strategic interest (the final decisions rest with the President and Congress) and continuing through the monitoring of compliance with American and foreign laws, contract reviews, payment schedules, service agreements and loan documents. Moving that paper takes regiments of bureaucrats.
The arms-sales apparatus -- chiefly the Pentagon's Defense Security Assistance Agency, plus the State Department's Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs and the Commerce Department's Office of Strategic Industries -- also includes several hundred military attaches and security assistance officers overseas. They are charged with assuring that foreign buyers adhere to the terms of sale agreements. They are also instructed to be alert to opportunities to sell American weaponry -- and they are rewarded for bringing in potential clients.
Critics call the Government operation a taxpayer-subsidized marketing unit of the nation's arms industry. Why, asked William D. Hartung of the World Policy Institute at the New School for Social Research, do manufacturers need the help of thousands of Government employees to sell their wares to the third world? He warned that the proposed F-16 sale to Chile, which he called a case of multibillion-dollar "corporate welfare" for contractors, could touch off a South American arms race.
 
Strategic Interests
 Defenders of the system respond that the Government effort serves American interests both by helping to control the sale of sophisticated weaponry and by keeping assembly lines in production. "Most of these people are processing paper and reports," said Daniel Goure, a military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington research institute. "A good portion are there not to sell, but to impede sales, quite deliberately." Most of their salaries are paid by a 3.5 percent surcharge on overseas sales, he added, so foreign governments are paying much of the cost.
For all the concerns about who uses American warplanes and attack helicopters against whom, some analysts say that most of the killing that results from the global weapons business has been done lately with assault rifles, grenades, primitive land mines, shoulder-launched missiles and the like. And while the United States dominates the high end of military hardware sales, small arms are "economically trivial" to it, said Joel L. Johnson, vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association.
Small arms are more than adequately supplied by China, North Korea, Belgium, Israel, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, India and other countries. "There are so many competitors at the low end and their stuff is cheaper and more than adequate," Mr. Johnson said. "The AK-47 has never been bettered and they're easy to find."
Over the last 10 years, American commercial exports have totaled $300 million to $2.5 billion a year. Like the much larger government-to-government sales, they must be reviewed by Government lawyers, intelligence analysts and policy experts. The review process is intended to assure that weapons will be used to assist allies in their self-defense and to enhance regional stability. But the financial health of American contractors may also be considered.
Foreign sales are often used to keep open production lines of weapons that the Pentagon needs only in small numbers. "The Air Force knows it's going to need a few F-15's and F-16's a year over the next few years to make up for the planes that crash in training," Mr. Johnson said. "But the cost of keeping those lines open just for those few aircraft would be exorbitant.
"If we can keep selling those planes to Saudi Arabia and Taiwan," he continued, "it brings unit prices way down and serves our strategic goals in the Middle East and Asia."
Where the United States has contributed to the proliferation of arms, some experts say, is in the sale of so-called "dual use" technology, which can be used for peaceful purposes and to make weapons. Last month, for example, Federal investigators revealed that a state-owned company in China had diverted machine tools ostensibly purchased to make civilian aircraft to a plant that makes missiles and fighter jets.
The Commerce Department has 350 employees monitoring those sales. The Government, military analysts say, needs more monitors, not fewer, citing the lesson learned from the Persian Gulf War, when Iraq was found to have pieced together an elaborate military machine from parts sold to it by the West.
"That's where the real problem is," said Stephen Bryen, a former Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for trade security policy. "In the long term, that's worse than selling arms. If you give countries the infrastructure, then they can develop things in secret. If you sell arms directly, you at least know what you sold."

HEADLINE: Orphanages, Inc.;
The High Cost of No Intentions

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
THE orphanage has come back to haunt the welfare debate. Freud might have called it the return of the repressed.
Shortly before Christmas of 1994, Speaker Newt Gingrich provoked a national uproar by championing a bill that would have let states use Federal welfare money for orphanages. The critics invoked Charles Dickens. Mr. Gingrich countered with "Boys Town," the 1938 movie starring Spencer Tracy. Political cartoonists had a field day, and by the time President Clinton denounced the plan as "dead wrong," Mr. Gingrich was protesting that he had been misunderstood. 
 If that was the Great Orphanage Debate, orphanages, it seemed, had lost. But the underlying question was unresolved: What would happen to children whose parents lost welfare and couldn't support a family?
Now it turns out that a multibillion-dollar answer lurks in the details of the sweeping welfare law signed last year: Modern day orphanages, run for profit at Government expense.
That this took place without a murmur illustrates a rarely acknowledged truth about national policy: much of it happens while Congress is busy making other plans. Often it is the sum of incremental changes won by interested parties without fanfare, but with huge consequences.
 
Care for Sale
 In this case, through the quiet efforts of a small company with a troubled history, the word "nonprofit" was deleted from an old section of child welfare law. Because of that tiny change, companies selling institutional care for profit, like managed mental health care corporations and youth care chains traded on Wall Street, can now compete for unlimited Federal child welfare payments. Before the change -- ultimately made in an amendment sponsored by Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat -- only foster families or nonprofit child care institutions could get the money, which is to support poor children who are removed from homes judged unfit.
During the first orphanage brouhaha, about the only mention of profit-making orphanages was in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" strip, and child welfare experts like the conservative scholar Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute dismissed the whole orphanage issue as a red herring.
"Agencies already have trouble caring for the 450,000 children now in their custody," Mr. Besharov wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed article. "Add over a million new 'orphans' and we'll have a new social crisis." He estimated that if only a tenth of the children on welfare went into group care, Federal spending would reach $70 billion within 20 years, and that surely "a new Republican Congress would recoil at spending so much to create a new Government bureaucracy."
But those legislators who noticed the one-word change did not recoil. In the midst of historic debates over a bill that dismantled six decades of poverty policy, this small alteration passed without comment. It had been presented by companies that stood to benefit as a minor step on the privatization highway, rather than as the expansion of an open-ended Federal aid program -- one already growing five times faster than Aid to Families with Dependent Children and costing the Government 11 times more for each child.
Given the notorious failures of the current foster care system, it is not hard to understand the allure of businesses that promise efficiency, economies of scale and rising stock prices, too. But in the scandal-ridden rise of other publicly financed, for-profit industries, like nursing homes and psychiatric hospital chains, the for-profit advantage has often proved illusory.
In nonprofit and for-profit care alike, the sole buyer and evaluator of care for public wards is government, and by all accounts, its record of oversight is poor. At least 21 states, including New York and California, have been sued for failing to enforce minimal standards in the residential care they purchase for children in their custody.
"Poor children are so totally helpless that everything about them can be determined by the marketplace, without any regard to their best interest," said Marcia Lowry, director of Children's Rights Inc., a national nonprofit legal and advocacy organization. "They are a wonderful commodity for business, government, people who want to push them in any direction to serve their own interest."
There is an 85-year-old national consensus that children should not be taken from their families because of poverty alone, but the balance of Federal policy keeps shifting in the other direction. In an effort to speed adoptions, for example, two new bills in Congress would make it easier to terminate parental rights.
Children living with a parent, no matter how poor, can no longer count on government help. But the same children, if placed in an institution or foster home, carry with them an open-ended stream of Federal revenue covering up to 75 percent of the cost of food, shelter, clothing, supervision, administration and case management. This year's appropriation for such support is $3.8 billion.
Opening the money to for-profit child care institutions guarantees a rapid increase in supply, says Mark E. Courtney, a scholar at the University of Wisconsin's Institute for Research on Poverty. Yet research documents the detrimental effects of institutions on young children -- those most affected by the end of A.F.D.C.
In the zeal to end adult welfare dependency, Mr. Courtney said, Americans prefer to forget that A.F.D.C. originated as a child well-being program.
"Children who are put in harm's way by program changes or program sanctions will not spontaneously appear at the doors of 'orphanages' or other out-of-home care settings," Mr. Courtney said. "Many if not most poor parents will attempt to raise their children by any means necessary," and before any one intervenes, "many children may suffer considerable harm."

Un-American Ugly Americans

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: MANDALAY, Myanmar

 BODY:
ON the outskirts of Mandalay, the heart of Burmese religious and cultural life, a kind of California suburb is taking shape, with expensive detached houses in landscaped gardens walled off from the city's less prosperous reality. A shopping mall can't be far behind.
Another sign of the Americanization of Asia? Not so, say the neighbors. The big white mansions of concrete and glass are neo-Thai in their inspiration, built with Burmese and Chinese money, at least some of it garnered from narcotics and the smuggling of Burmese gems and timber. Everything about this phenomenon is Asian. So are the construction companies clawing up virgin rain forests to build golf courses in Malaysia and the studios in Hong Kong and Bombay that make films violent enough to startle Hollywood -- and to provoke a burgeoning Asian backlash against perceived threats to family values and decency.
 
Source of Evil
 
 It used to be that when things started to unravel in almost any Asian country it was easy to finger the culprit: Americanization. Are families falling apart? Dig out the American divorce rates. Kids joining gangs? Talk about Los Angeles and American movies. Rock groups replacing the gamelan? Must be the imported TV programs. The environment in ruins? Blame New York's air conditioners. AIDS? That's a Western disease, the Thais once said confidently as more and more warehouse-sized "massage parlors" opened.
Now in cities, towns and satellite-dished villages across Asia -- and in other parts of the world where rising incomes and greater access to goods and information are breeding consumerism and speeding modernization -- it is getting much harder to hold the West, particularly the United States, responsible for assaults on local cultures
Worldwide communications -- especially satellite television, the fax machine and the Internet -- hasten the narrowing of cultural differences. Not everything novel comes from the West, even if most of these now-universal fashions were first popularized in richer Western countries. If trends are set by Japan, this is because the Japanese were the first to break into the top ranks of technology and trade, not only in the region but also worldwide. Others will follow in other regions.
An American diplomat said he was struck by this trend when a Korean radical wearing jeans and smoking an American cigarette lectured him on the perverse effects of American influence. Many Southeast Asians have abandoned traditional costumes for business suits not because Western business people dress that way but because the Japanese and Taiwanese do.
 
And Karaoke, Too
 Take a walk in Phnom Penh almost any time of day, and there will be children sitting on the high stools of video-game parlors where the bloodthirsty fare is Japanese-produced. Express boats on Borneo's rivers show Asian-made films in which heroes kick around the faces of bad guys without even smudging their Italian shoes. In the remote Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, where television receivers are not allowed, the police blamed videotapes from Hong Kong, with their very slick and sociopathic violence, when a Buddhist abbot was murdered a few years ago by local criminals who planned to steal an unlocked temple's treasures.
All over South Asia, middle-class parents worry about the hugely prolific Indian popular film industry with its debased or caricatured women and those silk-shirted toughs living glamorous lives. As for karaoke and what it has done to traditional forms of local entertainment, the less said the better.
"I do believe that mindless imitation of Western patterns of development is an exceedingly serious problem, but you have to accept the responsibility for the fact that this can't happen unless the elite wants it," said Palagummi Sainath, author of "Everybody Loves a Good Drought," a sharp critique of government and the establishment in India, based on his reporting from some of the poorest villages in the country.
"It's a simplification to reduce everything to the word 'Westernization,' and a bit foolish to make the argument that anything and everything that comes from the West is bad," said Mr. Sainath, who added that his most influential and respected teachers in Madras were European Jesuits. "Millions of things have moved both ways over the centuries which we all live with and are comfortable with.
"What I see is something different," said Mr. Sainath. "The super-rich are seceding from their nations. So what you have is not a Western or East Asian or Southeast Asian or Chinese model. We are building enclaves of super-privilege. What you're having is not a global village but a series of global ghettoes. The Western elite is not the sole villain."
But the myth of "Americanization" dies hard, says Francis Seow, a former Solicitor General of Singapore who has been at the Harvard Law School ever since he had a falling out with the country's leader, Lee Kuan Yew, and with his conservative "Asian values." Mr. Seow went to jail for his outspokenness. Politicians, and a range of activists struggling to keep alive old third-world causes, continue to demonize the West. The Burmese military junta, now under an investment embargo by the Clinton Administration, is waging a strong anti-Western campaign in the Government-controlled media.
"Singapore leaders tend to speak smugly of family values as if they are an exclusive preserve of Asian countries," Mr. Seow said. "I have personally seen American children who love and are respectful of their parents and elders, and I am told that in the heartland of America -- the real America -- these values are the norm rather than the exception."
Many Asian-Americans resent Asian leaders talking about Asian values as much as they object to Americans stereotyping Asians as invulnerable overachievers. "The Lee Kuan Yews talk as if there were an Asia that is homogeneous," said Sumit Ganguly, a political scientist at Hunter College of the City University of New York. "As if the steppes of Central Asia were the same as the plains of Bengal and the plains of Bengal the same as the forests of Sarawak."
In the culturally diverse United States, a politician, however attuned to anti-immigration or even anti-Asian sentiment, would not be likely to reach for the words "Easternization" or "Asianization" when immigrant Thais (some of them in the country illegally) are found running a slave-labor operation in southern California or Chinese and Vietnamese gang executions take place in lower Manhattan.
There is a new catchword in the developing world, however, to cover cultural wounds not believed to be strictly Western, Eastern or self-inflicted; the word is globalization. It wraps up all the fears of somehow losing control to foreigners, felt as much by Americans who hate the United Nations and immigrants as it is by Indians or Filipinos who feel threatened by the International Monetary Fund, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Joe Camel or Time Warner. That shrinking world everyone was so proud of a decade or so ago has become a cultural strangler.
 
India's Elite
 Francine Frankel, director of the Center for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania, thinks that fears of globalization are setting the stage for a new anti-Americanism among some elite groups in India, which will be the world's most populous nation sometime early in the next century, because satellite television connects the poor not only to the advertising of goods and life styles (for better or worse) but also to ideas (realistic or not) of self-advancement.
"This is at the center of India's political conflict, this challenge of the disadvantaged classes," Ms. Frankel said. "Unrestricted globalization and the penetration of American culture exacerbates this kind of change. Consumerism is really an expression of egalitarianism. The upper castes see that as an imported alien value."

HEADLINE: The World;
In the Biggest, Booming Cities, A Car Population Problem

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
THE markets that most excite the world's auto makers these days are not in the United States, Japan or Germany, but in cities like this.
It is impossible to find a parking space here, and the daily traffic jams last for hours. Ambulances with lights flashing and sirens wailing sit motionless in the gridlock, the drivers around them neither disturbed nor surprised. Nobody moves. Nobody can. 
 So what are auto makers doing about the problem? They are racing to build more cars here as quickly as possible.
There are already 4.5 million cars in Sao Paulo, more than twice the 2.1 million in New York City, which has about as many people. The number here is rising by about 1,000 a day. Local auto factories operate up to 23 hours a day, and most of the world's major auto makers are scrambling to build additional factories in Brazil and next door in Argentina.
Sao Paulo's experience is becoming the rule among sprawling third world cities. In Cairo, pollution from endless traffic jams is threatening the Sphinx. In Bangkok, it takes three to six hours to drive to the airport, and entrepreneurs sell tiny personal toilets for use in cars. And in these and other large cities in the developing world, the widespread use of leaded gasoline is said to stunt the average child's mental development by several I.Q. points.
 
Moving to Town
 Traffic problems have become much worse in developing countries for several reasons. They tend to have fast-growing populations combined with heavy migration from rural areas into cities. The result is vast metropolises like Sao Paulo, which has tripled in population in the last 20 years without building many new roads.
At the same time, many more people are becoming able to afford cars, even though, because of heavy taxes, they cost slightly more here than identical models in the United States. Economies in Latin America have grown twice as fast in the 1990's as in the 1980's, while growth has also accelerated in East Asia. Here and elsewhere, millions of commuters are abandoning overcrowded subways and buses to sit in traffic.
All this enthusiasm for new cars has produced an extraordinary boom in auto factory construction, not only here but in India, China and other developing countries. Over the next three years, three-quarters of the new auto factories being completed around the world will be in emerging markets. The new factories will have the capacity to produce as many cars and trucks each year as Germany does now.
Auto makers do have a solution for the traffic problems of developing countries, and it does not involve car pools or public transportation. They want more highways. Sao Paulo sprawls like Los Angeles but has very few highways, partly because old neighborhoods have had the political muscle to avoid being bulldozed. With the main avenues usually clogged with cars, residents travel many miles across town by barreling through an endless maze of back streets.
 
Demand for Highways
 But as ever more people buy cars, the pressure to build highways is rising. "The taxpayer will force the state to do something," predicted Andre Beer, the executive vice president of General Motors of Brazil.
A few more affluent cities in developing countries have adopted the latest traffic management technology. Buenos Aires, the world's 12th largest city, has just installed fully automatic toll booths along the Pan American Highway. Drivers buy magnetic debit cards and glue them to their front windows; when they drive through the booths, slowing to about 10 miles an hour but not actually stopping, sensors detect the cards and automatically deduct the toll from the driver's account.
Yet the fastest-growing cities in the developing world are in the countries least able to afford such wizardry. The United Nations forecasts that Buenos Aires will drop out of its list of the world's 15 biggest metropolitan areas in a few years. Even Sao Paulo, roughly tied with New York now in the U.N. listings as the world's second largest after Tokyo, will probably be overtaken in the next two decades by four impoverished cities growing even more rapidly: Bombay, Lagos, Shanghai and Jakarta. All four already have terrible traffic problems.
As auto makers expand their operations in the third world, even their executives are not immune to the traffic problem. Ivan Silva, the president of Ford Brazil, beats the traffic by arriving at work by 7:10 every morning. In the evening, he waits until 7:30 to go home. And each year, the traffic gets worse.

HEADLINE: Notes From the Underground on Another Balkan Rift

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 4

 BODY:
An Albanian immigrant, wearing a pair of black jeans, a gray jacket and purple T-shirt, sat late one afternoon in the cafe of a Geneva train station.
The crowds that walked to and from the platforms took little notice of the man, seeing in him, most probably, just another of the 180,000 Kosovo Albanians who have washed up in Switzerland in recent years. 
 But to the Serbian police, whose prisons the man has frequented in the last two decades, he is one of the most wanted terrorists in Yugoslavia, which now includes only Serbia and Montenegro. To many of the 2.2 million ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, a part of Serbia, he is a hero, one of the handful of leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army, a shadowy group that has begun an armed campaign for an independent Kosovo.
An interview with him was arranged by several prominent Albanian opposition leaders on condition that their identity be kept confidential.
"We are not a terrorist organization," said the man, who gave his nom de guerre as Alban. "We are not like the Irish Republican Army or the Basque separatists. These groups represent minority populations and carry out random attacks against civilians. We have the support of nearly all Albanians. The only attacks we carry out are against the representatives of Serbian regime."
Backed by contributions from the 700,000 Kosovo Albanians living overseas, the Kosovo Liberation Army is working hard to become a major player in the twisted and bloody Balkan arena. The Serb-ruled area of Kosovo, where over 90 percent of the inhabitants are ethnic Albanians, now appears on the verge of a costly guerrilla war.
The outside world has heard little of this militant group, and it was not possible to confirm some of the claims advanced by Alban. A senior United States official who has read the intelligence reports on the organization said the information was sparse and inadequate. Nonetheless, American officials take the organization seriously and believe it has the potential for serious disruption of the Serbs' control over Kosovo.
The Serbian police have acknowledged that in the last year the group has staged at least five armed attacks. While the authorities have declined to release casualty figures, they said the last attack, on Jan. 31, left three Serbian police officers wounded. Alban said several dozen Serbs were wounded or killed.
Alban, who travels clandestinely in and out of Kosovo, drew small diagrams on a piece of paper to illustrate the guerrilla movement's strategy. He portrayed Serbian authority in Kosovo as an empty box, and predicted it would be dismantled within three years.
In the rebel movement's first contact with the Western press, he said the insurrection is led by ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and Macedonia who fought as volunteers against the Serbs in Bosnia.
"To be honest, we do not know how many police and soldiers we have killed and wounded," Alban said. "But the Serb authorities are anxious and worried."
Kosovo, a barren and impoverished corner of Europe, was once part of Albania, but it was handed over to the kingdom of Yugoslavia after World War I. The Albanians in Kosovo have, however, long looked to Albania for guidance and support in their efforts during this century to break free from Serbia.
"The Kosovo Liberation Army will probably soon become a major political force in Kosovo," said Sami Korteshi, a political scientist who fled Kosovo after being badly beaten by Serbian police last year and who now lives in Bern. "This is the movement people support now. But an armed movement will bring great difficulties to Kosovo. Because of Albania's political and economic poverty it won't be able to help us. We will be alone."
When Yugoslavia disintegrated six years ago, the Albanians in Kosovo announced they were forming their own country.
But the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, swiftly annulled Kosovo's autonomous status within Yugoslavia and sent army units to protect what Serbs view as part of their country.
The ethnic Albanians, in reaction, withdrew from all participation in the state. The men dodged the draft. All institutions, including schools, were boycotted and the underground government set up parallel Albanian schools, clinics and social services.
But the 1995 Bosnian peace agreement marked the end to the nonviolent independence movement for Kosovo Albanians and the birth of an armed struggle. While they had opted for a peaceful, nonviolent resistance to the Serbs, and had hoped to gather the support of the international community, their aspirations were ignored at the peace conference in Dayton, Ohio.
"The dream of all Albanians is the independence of Kosovo," said Xhafer Shatri, who lives in Geneva and is the information spokesman for the Kosovo government-in-exile. "And the majority of Albanians are capable and ready to die for this independence."
"Albanians saw at Dayton that the international community only respects and reacts to the law of the jungle," he said. "This had a terrible impact, especially on the new generation that for six years has had little work, little schooling and lived under brutal Serb occupation. We have gone beyond frustration. We speak now of revolt."
Since the Dayton agreement, the self-styled government in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, which still calls for nonviolent resistance against the Serbs, has had a harder time raising money.
By contrast, Albanian leaders living overseas assert that the Kosovo Liberation Army's coffers are fat and growing. Expatriate Albanian newspapers like The Voice of Kosovo, which is published in Zurich, print the communiques of the guerrilla group and run calls for donations.
Swiss police officials have concluded that an Albanian mafia now dominates the heroin trade in Switzerland. They have no evidence that the proceeds are going to the guerrilla group, as they do in the case of the Kurdistan Workers Party's war against Turkey. The Swiss police also say they have noted increasing signs of an illegal arms trade by the Kosovo Albanians.
"The quantities we find are small, usually just enough to be packed in a car," Valentin Roschacher, a senior Swiss federal police official, said in an interview in Bern. "But we know it is going on. The weapons are high quality."
Kadri Osmani, one of the most militant and energetic leaders in the Kosovo independence movement for decades arrived in Switzerland four months ago, his health broken by 18 years in Serbian prisons, dozens of beatings that left him unable to walk and the stress of a life of resistance.
Interviewed in a Bern hospital, he said he had sold nearly all his possessions, including his house in Kosovo, before he left to help finance the movement.
"It is the Kosovo Liberation Army that will bring us one, unified country where all Albanians can live together in freedom," he said, sitting cross-legged on the bed. "The peaceful route is futile. No one wanted to help us. This period of our struggle is over. It is time for war."

HEADLINE: America's Role in Hong Kong

 BODY:
The coming transfer of Hong Kong from Britain to China is a case study in the limits of American power. Customary levers of diplomacy and military pressure are ill suited to defending Hong Hong's freedoms, and the most severe economic penalty -- revoking all Chinese trade privileges -- seems mismatched to the problems ahead. A mix of strong Presidential pressure, quiet diplomacy and carefully targeted trade sanctions imposed jointly with other countries offers the best hope of influencing Chinese conduct.
Hong Kong is an intricate and inherited problem. Britain has long encouraged free markets, an unfettered press and rule of law in Hong Kong, but only in recent years has it permitted steps toward democratic governance, including a freely elected legislature. This, to some extent, was a cynical British move to cover its exit with glory after 150 years of often rigid colonial rule. 
 Unfortunately, the political climate in China today is more repressive than in 1984, when terms were set for the return of Hong Kong this July 1, and London's agreements with Beijing offer little real protection for Hong Kong's 6.5 million citizens. To prevent a relatively free society from being crushed, Washington has to take the lead in defending democracy in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong transfer is part of the larger issue of China's emergence as a great power, perhaps the most difficult international challenge of the day. China is neither America's ally nor enemy, and a cold war policy of confrontation and containment does not fit. But with 1.2 billion people, one of the world's fastest growing economies and ambitions to be a military power, China will one day be America's rival. As long as it remains a Communist state with no political liberty, China will never enjoy an easy relationship with the United States.
Hong Kong is soon to be the prime testing ground of Chinese tolerance and intentions. But the political and economic complexities of Hong Kong make it a hard place to get unambiguous results. Many of Hong Kong's successful businessmen seem quite content to see democracy attenuated as long as China does not threaten their freewheeling financial markets. Local media, especially the Chinese-language press, have already muted criticism of China without being asked. Transition to a Singapore-style autocracy may come slowly and subtly.
The United States and other democratic nations must be unequivocal in telling China that the destruction of Hong Kong liberties and the rule of law will gravely damage China's standing in the world. President Clinton has been strangely hesitant to speak plainly on this point.
Washington should let Beijing know that Chinese tyranny in Hong Kong will result in the suspension of developing exchanges between the Pentagon and the Chinese military. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright can quietly suggest that a planned exchange of presidential visits will be jeopardized if Hong Kong is trampled.
The elimination of trade privileges for China, due for a Congressional vote in June, is an extreme approach. It would severely damage Hong Kong and punish low-income Americans who buy inexpensive consumer goods made in China. Some American companies like Boeing that do business in China would also be hurt. But as useful leverage the threat of such across-the-board tariff increases should not be discarded, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich's proposal to revisit the issue every six months may not be a bad idea.
More selective trade sanctions would be appropriate, especially if other industrialized nations cooperated. China could find alternative markets for many goods if American tariffs were increased, but a common effort with Europe and Japan would have serious consequences for Chinese trade.
American silence or neglect on Hong Kong would be unconscionable. But as the countdown to China's takeover proceeds, Washington will have to be not only determined but creative in its defense of Hong Kong's freedoms.

HEADLINE: Penatagon Used-Jet Sales Lot Helps Keep World Supplied

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TUCSON, Ariz.

 BODY:
With row upon row of mothballed warplanes on the desert floor near here, the Air Force's "Boneyard" has become the largest concentration of military aircraft in the world.
If Arizona were to secede and seize the four-square-mile storage center, the desert republic would become an instant air superpower, endowed with 139 patrol planes, 426 cargo planes, 562 helicopters, 570 trainers, 1,142 ground attack jets and 2,087 fighter jets -- about 750 more planes than the Air Force has in service. 
 As the Pentagon prepares to submit to Congress on Thursday the most sweeping strategic review since the end of the cold war, some critics of military spending argue that the country's air-defense needs can be satisfied by dipping into the stocks on this patch of the Sonora Desert about 10 miles east of Tucson.
"We could have air superiority with what we have in the Boneyard," said Caleb Rossiter, director of Demilitarization for Democracy, a group in Washington.
Air Force officials respond that the Boneyard is largely useful as a reservoir of spare parts and planes and that it cannot substitute for two high-profile Air Force programs, $45 billion for a new generation of bombers, the B-2, and $80 billion for a new generation of jet fighters, the F-22.
"Most of those planes have essentially outlived their service lives," Brig. Gen. Bruce Carlson, who works on acquisition for the Air Force, said from Washington. "If you look in the junkyards of America, there are probably 50 million junked cars that you could get running, too.
"It would have been absurd to fight World War II with biplanes. It would have been absurd to fight MIG-15's in Korea with P-47's. By the time we buy the first F-22, in 2004, the average age of our F-15's will be 25 years."
Fighters and bombers that flew in the Nixon and Carter Administrations will not guarantee American air superiority in the 21st century, said Kathryn Hayden, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin, manufacturer of the F-22. "Russia is still developing tactical aircraft. China is starting to develop aircraft," she said.
But Jordana Friedman, who studies international security for the Council on Economic Priorities in New York, said the United States was outstripping Russia, 15 to 1, in military spending.
"The existence of 5,200 unused planes sitting in the desert, while we go spend $80 billion on the F-22, shows how much the Pentagon is in the pockets of the defense industries," Ms. Friedman said.
Created at the end of World War II, the Boneyard, which the Air Force officially calls the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center, or Amarc, has historically expanded in times of peace and contracted in times of war.
"Amarc is on the opposite cycle of the military," said Ralph Schoneman, executive director of the Boneyard. "Our valleys are in times of conflict. Our peaks have been after World War II, after the Korean War and after the Vietnam War."
The inventory today ranges from planes built in the 1950's to a few planes built in the early 1990's. The Air Force owns about 60 percent of the planes; the rest belong to other branches of the military.
"A lot of those birds are attrition aircraft," said Joel Johnson, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association, a Washington trade group. Noting the frequency of fighter crashes, he added: "In the F-16 world, about 20 go down a year. That doesn't sound like a lot, until you multiply by 10 years."
Over the last decade, the Air Force has cut its fighter wings almost in half, to 20 from 37. Each wing has about 72 aircraft, including F-15 and F-16 fighters, currently considered by military experts as the best in the world. But industry officials argue that an era of fewer planes dictates an era of better planes.
"People tend to focus on who has got a plane that is better," Mr. Johnson said. "It's not just that, it's also who's got a missile that is better." Endowed with a radar-defying stealth design and the capacity to cruise at supersonic speeds, the first flyable F-22 is to be unveiled by Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems in Marietta, Ga., on May 29.
Critics like Ms. Friedman say that Lockheed Martin has justified the F-22 by pointing out the proliferation of F-15 and F-16 fighters in use by countries around the world, some of them purchased at the Boneyard. With the growing frequency of buying trips here by foreign officials, the Boneyard sometimes takes on the air of an international used-jet sale.
"We already have sitting in the desert a larger air force than can be found anywhere else in the world," said Lora Lumpe, an arms sales expert for the Federation of American Scientists. "Now we have to spend $80 billion to produce the F-22 because we already have sold F-15's and F-16's to other countries."
A Lockheed Martin brochure on the F-22 says there are F-16's in the air forces of Bahrain, Egypt, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, Morocco, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey and Venezuela. In March, the White House allowed Lockheed Martin to submit technical bids for F-16 sales to Chile, a move that could break an informal, 20-year ban on sales of high-performance war jets to Latin America. If a sale goes through, some of the jets could come from the 393 F-16's parked in the Boneyard; in that case, the Government would be compensated.
Under a cloudless blue dome of desert sky, employees go about the technical chores of mothballing the new arrivals, draining the fuel systems and spraying the planes with a white vinyl plastic compound.
"Most people think this is the Boneyard, or the graveyard, but that's not the case," said Mr. Schoneman, who oversees an overwhelmingly civilian work force of 740 people at the storage center, part of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. "Our primary mission is to store aircraft for times of need."
About 75 percent of the planes stored here will one day fly away, said Staff Sgt. Thomas Gerke, who recently chaperoned a group of tourists in a school bus.
Half a century ago, the Pentagon chose the table-flat land for its surplus planes because the dry desert climate allows for virtually rust-free storage and heavy airplanes can stand for years on the hard soil without sinking. Some planes are kept in flying condition; others are put in long-term storage. Some are cannibalized for parts, old F-4 fighters are used as drones for target practice, and about 300 planes are junked every year. In compliance with international arms control treaties, a six-ton steel guillotine is slicing up a fleet of 365 B-52's here.
Last year, the Boneyard took in $800 million by selling parts and by returning 125 planes to service, in the United States or abroad.
The Air Force calculates that the Government spent $27 billion on the aircraft in the Boneyard, slightly more than half the value of the gold in Fort Knox.

The Pentagon contends that the aircraft at the Boneyard are mostly obsolete and are best used for spare parts, but critics say the planes and helicopters should be put back into active use.

HEADLINE: Show of Titanic Items Is Attacked

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
The largest American showing of artifacts from the Titanic, now on display in Memphis, is being denounced by the International Congress of Maritime Museums.
The organization, which has more than 300 members in 50 nations, says the company that mounted the exhibition of 300 Titanic objects has paid only lip service to conservation and has failed to deal with the decaying wreckage of the ocean liner and its artifacts in a responsible way. 
 Kevin J. Fewster, who is the organization's president and the director of the Australian National Maritime Museum, in Sydney, said the organization condemned the current display and opposed "any efforts to show this exhibition" unless the salvage company improved its preservation efforts.
"It is only a matter of time and money before the problems of Titanic arise with other sites," Dr. Fewster said in an interview, adding that leadership was needed to develop ethical guidelines of deep-sea recovery.
The museum organization, whose base moves with its presidency, has never before censured a display. It did so, Dr. Fewster said in a news release that was given to The New York Times, only after working quietly with the salvage company for three years in a failed effort to raise standards.
George Tulloch, the president of the company, RMS Titanic of New York City, denied that artifact conservation was inept or superficial and said that his company was simply working in stages as it acquired more money for the effort. Public display of the best pieces is coming before the study, analysis and publication of other information saved from the deep sea, he said.
"Our No. 1 priority has been to conserve these objects and share them with the public," Mr. Tulloch said in an interview. "After that comes the sharing of the data with scholars. We're very proud of the work we have done to preserve the memory and objects of the Titanic. "What we've accomplished should speak for itself."
Beyond the Titanic, the museum organization is worried that a priceless record of the human past will quietly disappear as salvors focus on hundreds of vanished ships, paying scant attention to science and archaeology in a rush for quick profits from lost gold and silver, as well as famous artifacts.
"The Titanic is the world's best-known wreck site," Dr. Fewster wrote in the May-June issue of Museum News, a magazine of the American Association of Museums. "So whatever happens with this site will undoubtedly set a precedent for the future direction of cultural heritage management and recovery in deep water sites across the world's oceans."
A team of American and French scientists hunting the North Atlantic found the rusting hulk of the Titanic in 1985 about two and a half miles down. The New York salvage company financed recovery voyages in 1987, 1993, 1994 and 1996.
It has retrieved about 4,000 objects, stimulating the recent production of movies, cookbooks and exhibitions about the Titanic, which sank after it struck an iceberg in April 1912, killing more than 1,500 people.
The Memphis display, which is part of the "Wonders" exhibition series, opened last month in the basement of the city's largest indoor sports arena and is to run through September. The show has been organized by the city, which hopes to turn a profit or at least invigorate the local economy with tourism. Sponsors include Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines and Federal Express, which is based in Memphis.
Admission is $12 for adults, $11 for seniors and $6 for children 5 to 16 years old. On display are objects like gold coins, fine china, a steward's jacket, a bronze cherub and a jar of olives. Also displayed are delicate paper objects, including stock certificates, playing cards and love letters.
The criticism by the museum organization is directed not at the show itself but at the underlying work, or rather its perceived shortcomings.
Thousands of Titanic artifacts in various states of repair, in addition to data about the recovery, lie "scattered across at least eight cities on both sides of the Atlantic," Dr. Fewster said, adding that the company had shown no commitment to "unifying the mass of dive data."
RMS Titanic has so far spent about $20 million on various kinds of Titanic ventures and recoveries.
The museum organization estimates that it might cost $150,000 to record, collate and write up the current data -- a job requiring perhaps two maritime experts, an assistant and a computer. But the salvage company has taken few or no steps to do so, and the museum organization worries that the passage of time will make the job increasingly difficult, if not impossible.
"It's frustrating," said James P. Delgado, the director of the Vancouver Maritime Museum, in Canada, and a director of the International Congress of Maritime Museums. "The company claims to have good intentions. But these issues remain unresolved after three years of discussions."
Mr. Tulloch of RMS Titanic said his company was still committed to analyzing the data "as soon as we can pay for it -- can afford to do it to the standards that we hold ourselves to."
In decades past, maritime and other museums gladly bought and proudly displayed artifacts from treasure hunters working shallow wrecks. But enthusiasm waned by the 1980's as museums awoke to the vast damage being done to lost ships from looting and explosive mining. Marine archaeologists increasingly spoke out about such losses of history.
In 1987, seeking to prevent the undermining of science and the feeding of a commercial market, the Council of American Maritime Museums adopted a policy that forbade dealings with commercial salvors, a move that was followed by the International Congress of Maritime Museums in 1993.
Today, tensions are rising because only companies and entrepreneurs can afford to work on wrecks miles under the surface, leaving most academic archeologists on the sidelines.
Despite the new rules, the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, a member of the International Congress of Maritime Museums, began working with the RMS Titanic salvage company in 1994 to develop displays of artifacts from the Titanic, arguing that changing times called for new approaches. The British maritime museum held a Titanic show in 1994 and 1995 that drew record crowds.
The international museum organization grudgingly agreed to monitor the cooperation quietly to see whether a melding of goals was possible. The monitoring work included a field trip this February to Toulon, France, where the company holds much of the Titanic material for processing by experts. The findings of that trip became the last straw, with the museum organization deciding to go public with its objections and condemnation after seeing that none that the promised organization had been done.
Stephen Deuchar, the director of gallery development at the British maritime museum, who works closely with RMS Titanic, said he was surprised by the museum organization's combative tone and called the censure premature. RMS Titanic, Mr. Deuchar said, is "the first to admit that there are improvements that could be made" and seems sincere about achieving them.
"The company is doing all it can to improve the organization of the data it has collected," he said, adding that such work was hindered by a lack of money. Rather than issuing blanket condemnations, Dr. Deuchar said, "We all need to work together to agree on appropriate standards for the new circumstance of deep water archaeology."

Even as Siege Tightens, Mobutu Flies Back to Zaire
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire flew back to Kinshasa, the capital, from neighboring Gabon, confounding those who had expected that his flight out of the country on Wednesday for a meeting with regional leaders was his final departure. Officially, Mr. Mobutu has returned for one final meeting with the man who aims to topple him, the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila, which is scheduled for Wednesday. 14
 
Powerful Quake Shakes Iran
A powerful earthquake jolted a remote mountain region in northeastern Iran, killing at least 1,000 people and injuring at least 5,000, the official news agency reported. The country's second major earthquake in 10 weeks caused severe damage to 80 of 150 villages in the region in Khurasan province, about 310 miles east of the capital, Teheran, the Islamic Republic News Agency said. 1 

Debating Death in Japan
Japan is locked in a furious and agonized debate over how define the boundaries of death and whether to allow organ transplants. The issue is now before the Parliament, but it is so sensitive that lawmakers have decided -- for the first time in years -- to vote their consciences and not party positions. 1
 
Turmoil for De Klerk's Party
South Africa's former President, F. W. de Klerk, has abruptly disbanded a special task force set up only months ago to chart new directions for his party, South Africa's largest white political party. Mr. de Klerk said he would take over those responsibilities himself. But his decision to disband the task force was widely seen as a victory for the hard-liners within the National Party. 13

After an Upbeat Start, F.B.I. Chief Is Under Fire
Louis J. Freeh was getting good reviews when he first took over the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but lately he has been under fire. A series of high-profile embarrassments, like the handling of White House personnel files, a botched interview with a suspect in the Olympic Park bombing and a scathing report on the bureau's crime laboratory, have prompted a few lawmakers to express misgivings about Mr. Freeh's stewardship. 1
 
In New Hampshire, Already
It is still a long way to 2000, but Presidential hopefuls from both parties are already making forays to New Hampshire. The semi-campaigning is occurring far earlier than in the past, for a number of reasons. 19
 
Dispute Over Titanic Exhibit
The largest American showing of artifacts from the Titanic, now on display in Memphis, is being denounced by the International Congress of Maritime Museums. The organization says the company that mounted the exhibition has paid only lip service to conservation and has failed to deal with the decaying wreckage of the ocean liner and its artifacts in a responsible way. 16

High Water in Baltimore
Dozens of Baltimore residents were evacuated yesterday after a ruptured water main flooded their neighborhood up to five feet deep, and firefighters had to rescue some people by boat. At least seven row houses were condemned by the city because of water damage, and part of one street collapsed and swallowed a car. No injuries were reported. The break occurred in a neighborhood east of downtown. (AP)

Prosperity Seen From a Distance Upstate
From the perspective of many upstate New York residents, the nation's economic expansion in the mid-1990's has been a fiction -- a tale of other places and other people's lives. The state's broad top has become an island of desperation, sandwiched between generally thriving New England and booming Midwestern states, and losing its skilled, ambitious residents and young people. 1
 
Delay Endangers AIDS Suits
Many hemophiliacs are rethinking their feelings about a product they once cherished, a clotting protein distilled from other people's blood that almost certainly infected them with the AIDS virus. Possible lawsuits, based on evidence of drug companies' inadequate screening techniques, face a legal catch: New York State law requires people to file product-liability suits within three years of discovering an illness. 25

War on Ice
Of the various fronts of the war between New York and New Jersey -- claims to Ellis Island, the revenue from the Port Authority, the rights to baseball's origins and Walt Whitman's legacy -- one stands out. It centers on hockey and has pitted the extremist fans of two neighboring teams against one another. 25

Acquittal in Officer's Death
A Bronx jury acquitted a man of homicide and assault charges last night in the death of a police officer who fell on the shards of a broken mirror while trying to handcuff the man after a domestic dispute nearly a year ago, the Bronx District Attorney's office said. Mayor Giuliani yesterday assailed the acquittal, saying that prosecutors and judges in the Bronx had mishandled the case. 27
 
Wizzy's Summer, Part Three
Eight-year-old Rodney Farrell, better known as Wizzy, is getting ready for his third summer with a family on Fishers Island, a 40-minute ferry ride from New London, Conn. As of last week, about 2,800 families had signed up for the Fresh Air Fund's Friendly Town Program for the summer of 1997. 27

HEADLINE: Clinton In Caribbean: No Bananas Today

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, May 10

 BODY:
President Clinton met today on this island nation with the leaders of 15 Caribbean countries, promising freer trade and receiving assurances of more help in fighting illegal drugs.
But Mr. Clinton did not win support for a proposed American solution to a dispute over bananas that has pitted him against what he called his "fellow Caribbean leaders." 
 Although they signed a polite joint statement to continue negotiations over bananas, the Caribbean leaders indicated that they would continue resisting a United States effort to eliminate a trade preference that Caribbean bananas have in Europe.
At a two-hour meeting at a conference center near here, the leaders came to terms on a series of joint steps, embodied in a 30-page document that they signed at a ceremony on the windswept, emerald lawn of the Prime Minister's residence.
Mr. Clinton, who is here on the last stop of his three-country tour, called the agreement "a broad and ambitious plan of action."
More than in Mexico or Costa Rica, the President's previous stops, Administration officials expected pointed criticism of United States policies here, on issues from trade to immigration to Cuba and illegal drugs. They were not disappointed.
The Caribbean leaders expressed satisfaction with the meeting, and praised Mr. Clinton as the first American President to attend such a conference here. But in contrast to the solidarity shown at Mr. Clinton's two other news conferences in the last week, disagreements -- over bananas, immigration and Cuba -- were evident.
Prime Minister P. J. Patterson of Jamaica, the chairman of the Caribbean Community, referred to those differences, saying, "In the closest of families, difficulties are bound to arise from time to time in their relationships." He praised the opportunity "to meet within the bosom of the family and to sort out whatever difficulties may have arisen."
The leaders did not resolve their disagreement over what Mr. Patterson called "the issue of bananas."
Caribbean nations are alarmed over United States efforts, through the World Trade Organization, to overturn an agreement guaranteeing Caribbean banana farmers a share of the European Union market and imposing quotas on bananas from Central and South America. A preliminary judgment by the trade organization in March largely supported Washington's view that the preference unfairly restricts American companies' access.
Without the preference, the independent growers who undergird many island economies fear they will not be able to compete with giant companies like Chiquita Brands.
Mr. Patterson quoted one of his fellow leaders as saying, "For many of our countries, bananas are to us what cars are to Detroit."
Mr. Clinton proposed today that the European Union drop the preference and instead impose tariffs on bananas that do not come from the Caribbean, a duty that could raise their prices. Mr. Clinton argued that the Europeans could use the proceeds from the tariffs to help diversify the Caribbean's exports.
But apparently preferring to preserve their negotiating position with the European Union against the United States, the Caribbean countries did not agree to Mr. Clinton's proposal today. Instead, Mr. Clinton and the other leaders agreed on a mild statement pledging further discussions and recognizing "the critical importance to Caribbean countries of the continued access of Caribbean bananas to the traditional markets of the European Union."
The overall document agreed on today provides for the United States to lower tariffs on Caribbean textile and leather goods.
The document does not grant the Caribbean nations their wish for the same commercial relationship with the United States that Mexico and Canada have under the North American Free Trade Agreement. But it commits the United States to talks toward that goal.
On illegal drugs, the United States does not gain one tool it had hoped for, which is the right to engage in "hot pursuit" of drug smugglers into the waters or air space of Caribbean nations. Instead, the United States is striking deals with each nation.
Mr. Clinton also met for half an hour today with President Rene Preval of Haiti, where the United States helped restore democracy in 1994. He offered Mr. Preval $10 million in agricultural aid.

HEADLINE: CULTURE ZONE;
Adolescence Rules!

BYLINE: By Michiko Kakutani 

 BODY:
When did we become a nation of 12-year-olds? People used to joke that show business was high school with money; these days, it seems that all of America has entered seventh grade.
Jim Carrey performed his "Ace Ventura" talking-buttocks routine on the Academy Awards show this spring and used similarly juvenile stunts to turn "Liar, Liar" into one of this year's first blockbusters. Howard Stern and Dennis Rodman have parlayed grossness and outrage into lucrative careers. And bathroom humor, personal-hygiene insults and stupid sex jokes are no longer confined to "Beavis and Butt-head" and "Married With Children" but have become touchstones for more and more movies and sitcoms. "I am perpetually a 9-year-old child," Howard Stern said on a recent Larry King show. "That is probably why I am still successful." 
 Instead of Johnny Carson, we've got David Letterman and Jay Leno, who have made adolescent high jinks -- throwing things out windows, squishing things under cars -- regular stints on their late-night shows. Instead of "thirtysomething," we've got "Relativity." Instead of "Cheers," we've got "Friends." We've got a Vice President who describes himself as a Deadhead and a Speaker of the House who says he's really "a happy 4-year-old who gets up every morning hoping to find a cookie." As for the Internet, what was once touted as a resource for scholars is rapidly becoming a playground for sophomoric nerds, a place to exchange dirty pictures, sick jokes and narcissistic pleas for attention.
The teen-aging of America is partly a result of demographics and simple market demands -- as everyone knows, teen-agers and 20-somethings like to part with their disposable income, and they're a perfect, highly suggestible target audience for merchandizers of movies, sneakers and just about anything else. In a country that has always valued novelty over tradition, youth is equated with hipness, and hipness with sales and success. The lingo, fashions and obsessions of young people shape music, television and movies, and those cultural artifacts -- from MTV to "Clueless" to David Spade and Chris Farley movies -- help shape the national Zeitgeist.
So what do teen-agers want? According to the market-research firm Teenage Research Unlimited, many boys 12 to 19 spend almost twice as much time watching MTV (never mind other TV shows) as reading for pleasure. In their opinion, Beavis and Butt-head and Jenny McCarthy are definitely in, while playing chess, watching the news and wearing velour shirts are definitely out. They rank being funny as the personality trait they value most and being athletic as their most prized skill.
In the future, kids are liable to become more influential rather than less: by 2010, there will be 30 million teen-agers in America, up from 24.6 million in 1990.
Even as teen-agers are molding the cultural landscape -- shortening attention spans, fragmenting narratives and turning baggy clothes into a fashion statement -- their Gen X and baby-boom elders have embarked on an extended bout of nostalgia. Recycling the movies and TV shows of their youth, they have become captives of what Cyril Connolly once called a "permanent adolescence" -- as reluctant to grow up as the denizens of "Beverly Hills 90210." No wonder that in "Romy and Michele's High School Reunion" (one of two highly publicized films about high-school reunions to appear in the last month) the heroines don't age between high school and their 10th reunion: they still talk the same, dress the same, worry about all the same stuff.
According to the child psychiatrist and author Robert Coles, there are growing signs that America has entered a second adolescence, our proverbial fascination with newness and new starts warped into a willful juvenility. Consider, for instance, some of the characteristics of adolescence that Coles cites:
1. Grandiosity and a sense of invulnerability.
2. Heightened self-centeredness and self-absorption.
3. Ironic detachment and defensiveness.
4. A preoccupation with appearance, weight control and sex.
Sound familiar? Take a look out the window or at TV. Sexual and emotional exhibitionism and rebellious posturing have become marketing tools in our memoir- and talk-show-obsessed culture, and narcissistic infantilism -- delivered with a snide, ironic spin -- is increasingly the order of the day. Pundits are paid to throw weekly tantrums on "The McLaughlin Group" and "Capitol Gang," and in the premier issue of Icon Thoughtstyle magazine, Roberto Alomar -- the baseball player who made waves last year for spitting on an umpire -- is featured as . . . well, an icon.
Nose-picking and masturbation have been the subjects of "Seinfeld" episodes, flatulence turned up in "The Nutty Professor" and "Third Rock From the Sun" and breast jokes and underwear gags are staples of "Men Behaving Badly." Jenny McCarthy posed on a toilet in a Candie's shoes ad, and Cindy Crawford discussed her pimple-picking habits with Conan O'Brien.
As Coles sees it, the current reluctance to assume adult responsibilities may be a reflection of the complacency that has come with economic prosperity and the end of the cold war. "Maybe we're going into a big regression in the service of self-indulgence," he says. "The world turned to us in World War I and World War II, and then we beat the enemy in the cold war. Having done that, maybe we now don't really want to engage ourselves with moral issues here or abroad." All this, he adds, "might explain some of this childlike, if not childish, behavior."
Steven D. Stark, a commentator for National Public Radio, has another take. In his new book, "Glued to the Set," he argues that "the defiant, oppositional anger that often characterizes the early adolescent" meshes perfectly with America's current mood: "Witness the tearing down of public figures with the ready help of the tabloid press, and the flocking to antiestablishment talk radio."
With no end in sight to America's age of adolescence, with more and more grown-ups acting like kids, what is an actual teen-ager to do? Well, the answer seems to be: act like a 5-year-old. The hip new accessories at clubs today are stuffed-animal backpacks, T-shirts emblazoned with cartoon characters and "Hello Kitty" lunch boxes.

MORTAL PERIL
 Our Inalienable Right
 to Health Care?
 By Richard A. Epstein.
 503 pp. Reading, Mass.:
 Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $27.50. 
 Richard A. Epstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago, is one of the stars in the firmament of conservative intellectuals. He knows more about economics than most lawyers, doctors and health policy analysts. And health policy desperately needs the insights to be gleaned through economists' and lawyers' intellectual discipline. Mr. Epstein would seem ideally suited to the task of analyzing the nation's health care system -- and in some ways he is. But "Mortal Peril" is a curiously uneven book, combining flashes of brilliant insight with commentary that may strike many readers as morally obtuse.
He is best as a critic. His critique of President Clinton's ill-fated plan for universal health insurance, which embodied, he writes, an "egalitarian impulse," is skillful: "Congress was told all or nothing, and nothing was the response." But like many conservatives, Mr. Epstein has a hard time constructing a coherent set of health care proposals to replace the conventional wisdom in this field.
His thesis, in short, centers on "the mortal peril of beneficent regulation," the "unintended consequences" of high-minded schemes to guarantee access to health care. "Taken together," he says, "the full range of reforms poses a mortal peril to the very ends they are supposed to advance: the health and prosperity of society." The effort to transform charitable impulses and "moral intuition" into legal rights, like a right to health care, is, for Mr. Epstein, futile. He is a purist, and he does not want the Government to dabble in health care because, he says, "noble intentions quickly lead to an endless tangle of hidden subsidies, perverse incentives and administrative nightmares."
Thus, Mr. Epstein is skeptical of Medicare for the same reason he scorned Mr. Clinton's health plan. Medicare, the health program for the elderly and disabled, establishes, he says, "a single-payer monopoly for large parts of the health care market -- a perfect microcosm of a command and control economy." He recalls that his father, a radiologist, railed against Medicare with the admonition that "he who pays the piper calls the tune."
Mr. Epstein's aversion to Government intervention is so strong that he disapproves of a 1986 Federal law requiring hospitals to examine and stabilize patients with "emergency medical conditions." The law was prompted by reports of patients who died or were sent to public hospitals after being denied care at private hospitals. Mr. Epstein describes the law as "an institutional mistake," whose "hidden costs" have forced some trauma centers to shut down because they are not assured of payment for the care they must provide. "As far as government is concerned, any hospital should be able to 'just say no' to any patient," he writes. He would let hospitals deny care to people who persist in abusing drugs or alcohol.
Mr. Epstein's analysis is more subtle and useful when he explores the frontiers of medicine, ethics and the law, grappling with issues like organ transplants and physician-assisted suicide. But it seems odd that after arguing that people have no right to health care, he insists that the terminally ill should be able to hasten death with a doctor's help. "Why balk at active euthanasia if it is honestly invoked to avoid the pain and suffering that would otherwise follow?" he asks. Nor is "public support for children in a permanent vegetative state" high on his list of priorities. "We should suck in our gut and say no when asked to provide life support devices for those without hope of recovery," he writes.
The system of individual rights and duties enshrined in English common law "does a far better job of providing health care than the endless set of legislative and judicial innovations of our day," Mr. Epstein says. But it is a bit late in the day to sweep away those innovations and erect a new health care system on the old foundations. A more pressing task is to repair the internal defects and contradictions that Mr. Epstein cogently catalogues.

NORTH COUNTRY
 A Personal Journey
 Through the Borderland.
 By Howard Frank Mosher.
 259 pp. Boston:
 Houghton Mifflin Company. $23. 
 The borderlands between the United States and Canada harbor lost souls galore -- exiles, burnouts, neo-Nazis, poachers with machine guns -- embedded like raisins, or flies, in a great white pudding of unaccountable good cheer. Seeking joy in such a recipe is the chosen work of the unfashionably cheerful novelist Howard Frank Mosher.
To celebrate his 50th birthday, Mr. Mosher spent six weeks weaving back and forth across the border from the Atlantic to the Pacific in search of "exuberance and affirmation." Much of what he found would seem to most of us poor makings for joy -- "gutted schoolhouses and overgrown farms and collapsing railway stations and empty ore docks" -- but even in the grimmest settings Mr. Mosher will discern something worth a smile, however rueful.
He charges into town after weather-beaten town in sunny delight and soon has ferreted out of its shadows some garrulous eccentric with a strange tale to tell. From a customs agent he learns about the evil genius with a secret compound in the backwoods of Vermont who shipped howitzers via Antigua to South Africa, served six months in prison, then sold his 100-foot germ-warhead-hurling supercannon to Saddam Hussein. A Sioux "mini-Las Vegas in Michigan's remote Upper Peninsula" turns out to have been the tribe's salvation -- 1,200 people off welfare, a neon sign shop, a brewery, a finance company, a surgical instrument factory. A crafty farmer tricks the Federal Bureau of Investigation "into moving her 20-year-old manure pile" on the assumption that $40,000 from a bank heist "was buried at its bottom." In a cheap motel in Montana, Mr. Mosher lies awake as the newlyweds next door rage and reconcile all night, and freight cars clang together. And, at an inn elsewhere in Montana: "A hard-looking young woman in brief red shorts and a halter top, sitting at a nearby table with two guys who look more like carnival roustabouts than cowboys, starts shouting. 'Look, I told you worthless sons of bitches I'd buy you a meal if you gave me a ride. So here's your goddamn meal. Anything on the menu. Order it and eat it and then get the hell out of here.' "
The North Country, it seems, is a haven for the hard-bitten; the soft folks do not last. "The overwhelming majority of homesteaders, ranchers, trappers, outlaws, farmers, teachers, doctors, ministers and entrepreneurs who came to this harsh country along the Montana-Canada border within the last century sooner or later departed." Those who stayed disdain the easy life.
From coast to coast, the people depicted in "North Country" share a certain bleak outlook, squinting at the complexities of government, trade and culture through a lens of nonprescription, one-size-fits-all distrust. "Inherent in their endless battles with the weather, the sea, the rivers, the forests and outside regulations and markets and bureaucratic decisions is an ongoing dramatic conflict that seems to have characterized life in the North Country for the past two centuries," Mr. Mosher writes. "What's more, it seems to me that most of the North Country natives I've met enjoy, even relish, this conflict."
At times Mr. Mosher's infelicity with language is painful: "A sojourner in a strange land must go with the flow." Occasionally it leads the reader to doubt the accuracy of a quotation. I suppose a Quebecois bush pilot could have said, "So, now that we have such great cultural and linguistic and yes, political, autonomy, it may not be wise to cut our last economic ties with the rest of Canada," and "Our farms are alive and healthy, our social programs among the best in the world," but to me those phrases savor more of plastic keyboard than of silver tongue.
Never mind. When Mr. Mosher's interlocutors tell their stories -- often of loss, of the past or of something that happened to somebody else -- the faraway otherness of North Country life snaps into vivid, up-close focus. John Little Raven, a Chippewa who harvests wild rice from a homemade canoe in the marshes of northern Wisconsin, could be making real money in a steel mill in Milwaukee, but, he says, "I'm where my heart is."
So is Howard Frank Mosher when he returns to his own home in the North Country. "On the day of my 50th birthday, I thought that for me this life in the Kingdom had been the right life, that its simple, continuous satisfactions -- walking the mountain each day of the year, visiting with friends, fishing for brook trout, watching a pickup baseball game on the village green, sitting quietly in the evening with the person I've loved for 30 years and more, reading a good old or new book, writing a new story -- were enough."
"North Country" shows how a little can be enough. Lost souls, lonely places and small pleasures alike have their particular dignity when Mr. Mosher shines the light of his sympathy on them.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
A Palace for a New Magic Kingdom, 42d St.

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
THE AGE OF DISCOVERY may be past, but the Age of Rediscovery is still young. One of the most important treasures unearthed by today's intrepid explorers is the Great American Street. The opening next Sunday of the New Amsterdam Theater, the magnificently restored 1903 show palace on West 42d Street, is above all an occasion to celebrate one of the most spectacular of these treasures.
Renovated with breathtaking skill by Hugh Hardy of the New York firm Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer, the New Amsterdam instantly becomes the keystone of a street that is also a major feat of urban reclamation. Forty-second Street itself has become a piece of theater, a metropolitan melodrama one might call the Boulevard of Broken Nightmares. After decades of futile cleanup campaigns, the place is no longer gripped by crime, vice and decay. Instead, there are shops, theme restaurants, two restored theaters, mammoth flashing signs, amusement arcades. Above all, there are people, milling around, gazing in amazement at other people milling around, as if it were the first warm day of spring. 
 And there is much more to come. A multiplex movie house holding as many as 25 auditoriums. The Roundabout Theater, which is scheduled to relocate to the Selwyn Theater. The Ford Center for the Performing Arts rising on the site of the Lyric and the Apollo theaters. A new 10-story building that will house rehearsal studios for theater and dance companies. And that's not even to mention the four office towers that will eventually rise on all four corners of this legendary Crossroads of the World.
But what will it all add up to? That is the question to ask, now that this renewal project has reached a state of critical mass. How will the plot turn out?
This street has the potential to become one of the most culturally important in urban America. It could do much more than revitalize one street. It could also redefine the relationship between the center city and American popular culture. Or it could simply be a bright but chuckleheaded exercise in consumerism.
The New Amsterdam's opening adds to the suspense. A triumph of the art and ideology of preservation, the renovation shows how far urbanism has progressed since the days of postwar urban renewal, when few planners would think twice about consigning architectural gems to the junk heap. The project is also a measure of what can be accomplished by partnerships between the public and private sectors -- in this case, between the Walt Disney Company and the city and state agencies that sponsored the renovation.
At the same time, the project raises questions about the impact of these partnerships on the cultural vitality of New York. The New Amsterdam is a glorious container, but as yet no more than that. It is the most recent chapter in the phenomenon the French theorist Guy Debord once termed "the society of the spectacle," a society eager to drug itself with endless images of desire.
It is hard to imagine that hard-bitten, gold-digging Ziegfeld girls and oily Adolphe Menjou types ever felt at home at the New Amsterdam Theater, for the place is an architectural version of an American Eden, the unsullied natural paradise in which European explorers cast the New World.
Laurel leaves, branches, vines, wreaths, bouquets, roses, heliotrope, grapes, apples, figs, berries, nuts, parrots, peacocks, mice, squirrels: there is scarcely an inch in the theater's interior not encrusted by some plaster specimen of flora or fauna, tumbling out in profusion. In this Arcadian setting, you would expect to see Isadora Duncan in a Greek tunic rather than a chorus girl in ostrich plumes.
Henry Beaumont Herts and Hugh Tallant, the architects, also designed the Opera House at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and the New Amsterdam's auditorium is quite similar to it in its curved, egg-shaped interior, with a domed ceiling and oval boxes. But the New Amsterdam goes well beyond the Opera House in terms of ornament. A late-blooming American version of Art Nouveau, somewhere between Louis Sullivan and Victor Horta, the design tames the style's sinuous, hothouse eroticism but magnifies its opulence.
Instead of the red and gold theme of the European opera house, the colors here are green, rose and sand. The proscenium arcs overhead like a spreading crown of trees. The boxes and balconies ascend toward the ceiling like the slope of a hill. At the top of the dome, four classically draped women hang rigidly from the treetops: angels on swings.
Too much is not enough here. In the basement's New Amsterdam Room, formerly the men's smoking lounge, wings sprout from an angel's torso as well as his shoulders. Clouds, stars, electric bulbs and a golden halo wreathe his head. In short, this is a theater where people are not likely to start stamping their feet over a late curtain.
Rather than recreate the New Amsterdam as it appeared when new, the architects have attempted what they call an "interpretive restoration," retaining later additions like the Art Deco marquee. They have reconstructed the boxes, which were torn from the walls when the theater was converted to a movie house in 1947, and have virtually recreated from scratch the interior architectural ornament, which was almost obliterated by water damage in the 1980's.
It is hard to imagine a better patron than the Walt Disney Company for this Cinderella transformation. But Disney's arrival in New York has evoked powerfully ambivalent responses. As the brand name of family entertainment, Disney offers assurance not only to parents but to others who grasp that New York's future depends in no small measure on its capacity to accommodate the middle class. At the same time, those mouse ears terrify some people who see the aspirations of the urban middle class swiftly sinking beneath the values that govern suburban malls.
In the last four years, as the project has taken shape, Times Square has been the focus of complaints about the replacement of raunchy authenticity by a synthetic theme park atmosphere. Some critics believe that in the name of saving the city, the government agencies sponsoring this venture may actually be killing it. They envision the emergence of a city where the only culture is corporate culture, where entertainment has stifled art and demands for security have muffled the claims of difference and dissent.
As Michael Sorkin put it in his 1992 book, "Variations on a Theme Park," "The struggle to reclaim the city is the struggle for democracy itself."
I count myself a watchful supporter of the redevelopment of Times Square. The expulsion of porn doesn't strike me as a major threat to free speech. Maybe I'm a 1950's person. I smoke, eat steak, drink martinis, and if people want to look at dirty pictures, I think they ought to go to Paris, ooh-la-la.
Besides that, as someone who has been following this story for more than 30 years, I regard in wonder that things have turned out so well. It may be natural to view this state- and city-sponsored project as the work of some monolithic political-commercial complex. This opinion could not be farther from the truth. Forty-second Street now reflects the determination of some energetic and enlightened public servants who fought hard to prevent the street from turning into a granite corporate canyon.
If this street had stars in the sidewalk, some of them should be inscribed with the names of Rebecca Robertson, Cora Cahan, Gretchen Dykstra, Robert A. M. Stern, Tibor Kalman and Hugh Hardy -- the group of public officials and design professionals responsible for guiding the street's redevelopment. The public response to their efforts has insured that at the very least, the development of this street will be incremental. It will evolve over time.
Already, the street has become the infrastructure for the nation's media central, a public space that brings together the producers and consumers of popular culture. The Conde Nast building, now going up on 42d Street and Broadway, will reinforce a concentration already represented by the Bertelsmann Building at 45th Street, site of the Virgin Megastore, and the 43d Street headquarters of this newspaper. One block east along 42d Street is HBO headquarters and, across the street in Bryant Park, the seasonal tents for the "Seventh on Sixth" fashion shows.
BUT SOMETHING IS MISSING FROM THIS picture, an ingredient that could lift the whole enterprise into the cultural stratosphere: art. What is needed here, specifically, in this project sponsored by the public, is a forum for artists whose work is animated by the tensions between high culture and popular entertainment.
Those tensions have been driving the culture throughout the last half century, sparking an entire literature and inspiring several generations of artists. Writers like John Kouwenhoven, Marshall McLuhan, Guy Debord, Susan Sontag, Umberto Eco, Jean Beaudrillard and George W. S. Trow. Artists like Andy Warhol, Twyla Tharp, Barbara Kruger, Laurie Anderson, Cindy Sherman. What is glaringly absent from the new Times Square is the awareness and creativity that these artists represent.
It is not a minor omission. Mass media, popular entertainment -- these phenomena represent the most powerful economic forces at work in the modern world. The 42d Street project is the most important opportunity we now have to connect these forces to the contemporary urban condition. Artists are the most qualified people to make that connection.
Twyla Tharp is entirely correct when she insists that her dances deal with "major community problems" -- questions of leadership, hierarchy, cooperation, estrangement and courage. Laurie Anderson's multimedia performances explore the coercive influence of the homogenized global monoculture and the capacity of Americans to resist or even transform its overpowering advance.
These artists, and many others, have chosen to work in established forms of popular entertainment: pop music, movies, television, Broadway musicals. They have used these media to reflect critically on the media themselves, exploiting their power not simply to seduce and entertain but to enlighten and inspire.
Pop culture is alienating as well as binding. We all love Lucy. But it's not just gangsta rap and daytime talk shows that are socially corrosive. Popular culture is inherently a major force for estrangement. Think about Joe Camel. Cigarettes, once representative of urban sophistication, now have people in a most unsophisticated uproar.
Think about cars: how this national emblem of personal autonomy later became a cage on wheels, a rolling threat not only to the environment it sought to conquer but to the conquerers, the drivers who became the driven, charioteers in a race against the obsolescence of the industrial age.
The whole point of a city is to work these things out in public. That's the meaning of Sorkin's observation. Strike, scream at people, light up in public, make a fool of yourself, fall in the gutter, pick yourself up, move on.
I doubt that anyone seriously denies the importance of family entertainment in the contemporary city. On the contrary, those who care about the city's future should applaud efforts to accommodate the urban middle class. What raises skepticism is the use of culture to mask a latent hostility toward culture in all its messy, anxious vitality.
The point is this: the street is itself a form of popular culture, a medium as powerful as television, newsprint or the World Wide Web. No form of "interactivity" yet devised is more potently democratic. The American street is sacred space, for all its saturation in secular, materialistic values. Any great street turns each step into a stride toward freedom.
IN 1903, THE NEW AMSTERDAM WAS shamelessly escapist: in the industrial city, a theater might well want to resemble a park; it performed a similar function. The context of the New Amsterdam has changed. New York is no longer an industrial city. It is an informational city, driven largely by images. It is folly to think that the meaning of the restoration is the same as the meaning of the original design. The New Amsterdam was, essentially, an escape from business. The restored New Amsterdam is business itself, a building integral to the economy of tourism and mass media on which New York's economy now largely depends.
Some of us can remember seeing movies in the New Amsterdam as recently as the early 1970's. Cheap double bills. The lights were so dark that we didn't notice that the boxes had been torn from the walls. We were movie-generation people who could take in four films in one evening and didn't care if the surroundings were grungy. If anything, the battered surrounding added to the experience. Rundown places ripen the imagination. That is a basic New York story.
Decay, estrangement: these are not concepts with which civic boosters are ordinarily comfortable. Yet they are major aspects of urban beauty. Edward Hopper captured this beauty. So have James Baldwin, Joan Didion, George Tooker, Paul Cadmus, Jerome Robbins, Savion Glover, David Byrne. There are artists waiting now in the wings to interpret not only the community of the street but also the solitude of the street. Their vision is imperative to New York's enduring capacity to strengthen modernity's connective tissue.
The Glorification of the American Girl: Wasn't that a Ziegfeld slogan, when the New Amsterdam was young? How about the Glorification of the American Misfit? That's one of the things a great city strives for. It offers an Arcadia of opportunity where misfits get to make something creative from the experience of not fitting in. It sometimes happens that the weird niches misfits carve out for themselves turn out to be shape of things to come.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Face in the Crowd From Ireland, Via Outer Space

BYLINE: By MARGY ROCHLIN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
IN THE MID-1980'S, THE IRISH character actor Colm Meaney bought a shiny gray Hugo Boss suit that he couldn't afford. "Casting directors can smell fear and desperation," said Mr. Meaney, who strolled into every audition wearing the flashy garment and exuding confidence. "My suit put me in the position of saying, 'We're not starving here.' "
On this spring afternoon, Mr. Meaney's not starving at all. He was sitting in blue shorts and a white T-shirt near his swimming pool in the backyard of his San Fernando Valley home, chain-smoking Camel Light cigarettes and describing how he came to appear in two movies that will be opening shortly: the small British film "The Van" and the big American one called "Con Air." 
 The 43-year-old Mr. Meaney no longer needs to wear his designer good luck charm. For the last four years, for instance, he has appeared as Chief Engineer Miles O'Brien on television in "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine." Outside the Alpha Quadrant, Mr. Meaney is best known for the pink-cheeked working-class fathers he has portrayed in the movies based on Roddy Doyle's prize-winning Barrytown trilogy: "The Commitments" and "The Snapper."
On Friday, the final Barrytown episode will unfold in "The Van," directed by Stephen Frears. In it, Mr. Meaney plays Larry, an unemployed father of two who joins with his best pal, Bimbo (Donal O'Kelly), to sell fish and chips from a fast-food wagon. Though money pours in, the two men discover that working elbow to elbow alongside your matey in a narrow, greasy kitchen is certain to put a strain on any friendship.
In the Barrytown series, Mr. Meaney brings to life members of the blue-collar world often ignored by the American cinema; his lower-income patriarchs would never seek family counseling and solve perhaps too many problems with a couple of pints at the local pub, but are always searching for new ways to understand the wife and children.
"Colm can really play working-class figures and transcend class in a very good way," said Mr. Frears, who outlined Mr. Meaney's theatrical credits before devoting the rest of a telephone conversation to getting laughs at his good friend's expense.
"He looks like he's been in jail half his life, doesn't he?" he said in a confidential whisper. "And he's lazy too. I mean, given half a chance, he'll be off for a drink, gossiping or talking to his agent. He's very, very reluctant to come to work."
In truth, Mr. Meaney has been gainfully employed since adolescence. He did a brief stint as an apprentice fisherman on the Irish Sea, but mostly his jobs have involved reciting dialogue. The third of four sons, Mr. Meaney was 17 when he was accepted at the prestigious Abbey Theater in his hometown, Dublin. For two years, his mother, a housewife, worried that he would end up penniless. ("Her line was, 'You'll be going without a sole on your boot,' " he said.) Upon graduation, Mr. Meaney proved her wrong by becoming one of two students to be given a contract by the Irish National Theater.
For 15 years, he spent most of his time on stage, making his Broadway debut in 1981 in "Nicholas Nickleby." In 1986, hoping to try his hand at film and television, he moved to Los Angeles with his wife, Bairbre Dowling, and their infant daughter, Brenda. (Mr. Meaney and Ms. Dowling separated in 1994 after 12 years of marriage.) As it turns out, Hollywood was indeed interested in the formally trained emigre with a lilting Celtic accent and easy comic timing.
Over the years, Mr. Meaney has built a reputation for being believable in roles of varying size, though in small parts he is likely to vanish midway and in "Dick Tracy" his character didn't even have a name. Often, Mr. Meaney will do a bit as a cop, a priest or a doctor without sharing a frame with the project's star. "I've been in films with an awful lot of people I've never met," he said.
In fact, show business is a profession that supports not just top-billed headliners but also skilled ensemble players like Mr. Meaney, who has become so in demand that he, too, can make film makers scrape and bow. What Simon West, who directed "Con Air," knew about Mr. Meaney was that he could pull off playing a Corvette-driving American Drug Enforcement Agency agent whom a Federal marshal (John Cusack) must talk out of blowing up an airplane filled with criminals. (The $75 million movie opens next month.)
What he didn't know was whether he could work around Mr. Meaney's complicated schedule. "But Colm's such a versatile, technical actor that he makes your life much easier," Mr. West said.
Recently, Mr. Meaney, who is still a cast member in "Deep Space Nine," returned from New York, where he did a turn as a menacing pimp in a psychological thriller being directed by Lodge Kerrigan. In the next couple of weeks, he will be flying to the Isle of Man where he'll appear as a sweet-natured landlord in "Owd Bob." After that, he'll jet to Boston, where he'll show up as a street thug in "Noose," written by and also starring Denis Leary.
Much like anyone who logs so much time at 30,000 feet, Mr. Meaney has developed his own in-flight ritual. First, he kicks off his shoes. Then he consumes a large bottle of spring water to ward off dehydration. After that, he closes his twinkly blue eyes and slips on the courtesy sleep mask provided to first-class passengers.
"I used to always laugh at them," admits Mr. Meaney. "But now I'm like Zsa Zsa Gabor -- if I got my eye patch on and my hot curlers plugged in beside me, then I'm set."

Unlikely Tales Told by the Homely Woven Basket

BYLINE: By MITCHELL OWENS

 BODY:
BASKETS TODAY ARE A largely rustic conceit: quaint receptacles for magazines or bathroom bouquets of dried statice and cornflowers. Not so long ago, however, a hand-woven basket was one of life's necessities, a tool, not a trifle.
Farmers used them to store bushels of apples, housewives piled them high with sun-dried laundry, and at the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan, merchants once displayed their briny wares in woven wood baskets with carved hickory handles. 
 Many of the baskets used at the Fulton Fish Market -- as well as by the textile mills of Norwalk, the cobblers of New Canaan and the commercial fisheries along Long Island Sound -- were manufactured in and around Pound Ridge, N.Y., a bucolic town in northern Westchester County.
Though today it is known for attracting celebrity householders like Christopher Reeve, Eartha Kitt and Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, from its founding in the 18th century until the early 1920's, Pound Ridge was pure Tobacco Road. Located far from economic stimulants like railroads, Pound Ridge was rough, rugged and isolated, a confederation of impoverished hamlets populated by farmers scratching an uncertain living from the half-rocky, half-boggy soil.
A certain amount of financial stability, however, could be found in a career in basketry. Between April 1864 and March 1865, for instance, Dann & Curtis, a local basket factory, sold an astonishing 22,848 baskets. More than 4,000 of these were one-bushel oyster baskets, a Pound Ridge specialty that is among the dozen or so styles represented in "Baskets: Woven in History," a pocket-size exhibition at the Pound Ridge Museum that runs through Aug. 3.
Given its literally lightweight subject matter -- and the limited size of the museum, which is a one-room former meeting house -- the exhibition is suitably modest. C. Jennifer Lawton, the curator, has assembled a total of 19 Pound Ridge baskets, most dating from 1880 to 1910 and all woven of hand-split strips of oak, ash or hickory that had been softened by soaking in ponds or troughs of water. Wicker was rare.
She has also clarified the method of construction by setting them alongside construction diagrams and contemporary photographs of local basket makers in action.
One-quarter of the exhibition space is devoted to the furnishings shown in several 1920's photographs of Sivori Selleck, a local basket maker, in his studio. Selleck descendants donated two ladder-back chairs, their ancestor's saw and razor-edge shaving knives, as well as his shaving horse, a teeter-totter-like contraption that was a combination chair and work surface.
The basket maker's spiffy sartorial ensemble -- the aged Selleck, grizzled and mustachioed, wears a band-collar striped shirt, pressed black trousers and polished leather boots -- is not part of the display, however. And it would not have been included anyway, had it managed to survive the intervening years.
"He looks like he's going to church," Ms. Lawton said, looking at a photograph of Selleck deftly weaving an oyster basket. "I'm sure he dressed like that just for the camera. For one, there isn't any wood chips or sawdust on him, which is a little suspicious."
Thanks to a boom in oyster consumption at the end of the 19th century that was fueled by the discovery that oyster beds could be replenished and expanded by stocking them with imported baby oysters, Pound Ridge baskets became a standard item between the 1860's and 1900. One community created baskets so fine that they were nicknamed Dantown crockery, while another Pound Ridge hamlet, Scotts Corners, produced enough to be informally called Baskettown.
Unfortunately, that 30-year-period was the extent of the basketry heyday. A typhoid outbreak in 1902 traced to infected oysters caused oystering and oyster baskets to take a beating. Finally, health regulations demanding improved methods of harvesting rendered the porous, hard-to-clean oyster basket passe.
"They are rugged, not beautiful by any means," Ms. Lawton said, pointing at a pair of oyster baskets that she recently discovered in nearby Rowayton, Conn. "But the way they were designed, for a particular purpose, is a kind of beauty."
The weave of oyster and clam baskets, Ms. Lawton explained, was "loose and open," distinguished by coin-size holes that were large enough to allow water to drain away but small enough to keep the shellfish securely packed.
Breadbaskets, on the other hand, were tightly woven to keep insects at bay and spare the bread from drying breezes. Shape was important, too. One of the baskets on display is a trug: its flat platterlike form allowed fresh-cut flowers to be gathered gently, resting at full length, before being transferred to vases.
Rounding out the exhibition are examples of American Indian basketry from the northeastern United States, dating primarily from the 1960's to the 1990's. Unfortunately, they fit awkwardly into the Pound Ridge Museum show, and their souvenir-stand decorative fillips are vacuous, even somewhat tacky. However, they do, unexpectedly to be sure, provide a poignant counterpoint: they underscore the sad devolution of a once noble craft.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: Dr. Richard Horn;
Easing the Flow of People and Products

BYLINE: By LINDA TAGLIAFERRO 

 BODY:
LAST September, Dr. Richard Horn was apppointed executive director of the Nafta Intermodal Transportation Institute, a component of the National Aviation and Transportation Center at Dowling College.
The federally financed institute, at Brookhaven Calabro Airport, was established to address issues of trade flow among the United States, Canada and Mexico and to facilitate the movement of people and products throughout North America It also .strives to improve the productivity and competition of economies. 
 Dr. Horn was born in Wisconsin. He received a B.B.A. and M.B.A. from the University of Wisconsin and a Ph.D. in economics from Iowa State University.
For 17 years, he served as chief of the Motor Vehicle Project Office at the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center in Cambridge, Mass.
Dr. Horn lives with his wife in Oakdale.
Q. What is the significance of Nafta to Long Island businesses?
A. We have in New York a major presence both in Canada and Mexico. Our border crossings handle about 30 percent of all the trade traffic going to Canada. Nobody comes close to that except for Michigan.
Much of the activity is in some basic commodities, and we have a great deal of raw materials that come into New York from Canada, such as wood pulp and paper products. We have some commodities that are produced here that could have a market in Canada.
Long Island is a little different than other portions of the state. We have a high-tech industry and manufacturing here. The firms on Long Island have a tendency to be small to medium-sized, and one of the reasons why the NAT Center is interested in approaching this is that we believe these are the firms that need support in entering into the Nafta markets.
If you're a small to mid-sized firm, you know your market quite well, and if you're comfortable in that market, there's a tendency to view international trade as something that may be far more difficult to get into.
Under Nafta, it's far easier to find partners outside the country who can supply you with components for a product which you could then sell domestically or even internationally.
Q. How is the institute assessing the transportation needs of companies on Long Island?
A. We have been working with organizations such as the Hauppauge Industrial Association, the Long Island Association, the Long Island Import Export Association and others to help us assess the needs of Long Island businesses. We are using their expertise and connections in the community to give us a better understanding of what needs are strongest in Long Island.
Q. Do you think Long Island businesses could best import or export with the Nafta countries?
A. Actually, we're talking both imports and exports. If we can address the transportation costs effectively, then the additional distance between, say, Mexico and Long Island is not that much more of a barrier. We should be looking at both of those countries as trade partners.
Q. Commuters on the Long Island Expressway have a hard enough time getting home during rush hour. How can Long Island companies expect to import and export to Canada and Mexico with such traffic constraints?
A. There are discussions under way to provide additional access to the Island and I believe these have been going on for many years. Ferry service or a bridge link to Connecticut are all basically infrastructure approaches to some of the issues, but those are typically very expensive.
This question goes to the heart of I.T.S., or Intelligent Transportation Systems, which is basically finding ways to use the infrastructure that you have more effectively. Can you do it by better planning? Can you understand the routes and what you're shipping and when you are shipping so that you can take advantage of periods of time in which there is less congestion? Can you use this information to speed up some of the interchanges that will take place? Can you develop intermodal facilities that can consolidate some of the shipments and manage those more effectively?
Q. What are Intelligent Transportation Systems?
A. Intelligent Transportation Systems is the program within the Federal Department of Transportation and the various State Departments of Transportation that attempt to introduce technology into transportation activities using transponders, information systems, electronic communications and the like to expedite the transportation process.
Q. How does this improve the flow of commerce?
A. One of the things that we can provide through the effective use of I.T.S. systems and the exchange of information associated with the movement of commodities is the ability to know when something is going to arrive.
This is very important for North American trade because if you're concerned about the reliability of movement, then any time you have bottlenecks in the system, it's throwing a monkey wrench into your schedule.
In North America, those bottlenecks are often at the borders, and what we're going to try to do is to address some of those issues with better information and the use of I.T.S. as we approach and go through the border crossings.
Q. Are there any significant innovations in border-crossing technologies?
A. Right now, in the Buffalo area, there is a Federal Highway Administration field operation test to begin deploying some new I.T.S. equipment at the border.
In this case, the equipment is predominantly readers installed in Buffalo which will identify a truck as it comes up to the crossing. It's actually a small machine. It requires that the truck has a tag, a transponder, which is something like an electric license plate, and it's not unlike the E-Z Pass system that we have throughout much of the area.
Q. Once a truck has a transponder, how and what information is passed to the electronic reader at the border?
A. Once the truck has a transponder, without that truck having to stop, the officials at the border will know who the truck is. That's half of the process. The other half is officials will also want to know what's on the truck. This requires that information about the commodities being carried be sent to the border officials ahead of time electronically so that it will be in their systems as the truck approaches the border. Then officials would know if the truck had all of its appropriate credentials and permits for operating in Canada and in the United States.
Q. Would the cost of such equipment be prohibitive for small to mid-sized companies on Long Island?
A. The equipment itself is not terribly expensive for the transponders. In fact, the opportunity for carriers to manage their fleets more effectively has led many of the major trucking firms to equip their trucks with this already.
The cost actually depends upon the level of sophistication that they would need in the transponder. There are those that have relatively low information. They're basically an electronic license plate.
Then there is another level of equipment which allows you to use this tag, to plug it into an onboard computer, so that you can actually communicate with the driver to advise about road conditions and other information.
Q. There is a Continuous Flow Intersection at the entrance to the NAT Center. How does this expedite traffic flow?
A. It's a way of permitting traffic to turn earlier than at the actual intersection. As the traffic approaches an intersection where it would be turning left, it turns left before that actual intersection to go into a queuing lane that is left of the oncoming traffic.
The concept is very flexible because this system was originally designed with built-in sensors which would adjust the signal timing in real time. If the queues are very long, it would then permit left-hand turns more frequently.
Q. What are some of your future plans for the institute?
A.We plan to develop courses and seminars that we can take into the Long Island community and New York in general. These would teach firms how to get the kinds of information that they need, how to make good decisions about transportation and to understand a full range of issues that fall under the term "logistics."
We want to demonstrate to the small and mid-sized firms on Long Island and the State of New York in general that it isn't much more difficult to enter into the Canadian market. This may lead them to think that if Canada isn't so hard, then maybe Mexico is a possibility, too.
Although our focus is on the Nafta countries as trading partners, we truly believe that once a firm sees the advantages of participating in international trade in North America, they will generalize and also see Europe, Latin America, Asia and other countries as possibilities.

HEADLINE: O'Rourke Reflects on a 15-Year Adventure

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WHAT he always pined for was not the County Executive's post, which he has held for 15 years. Nor was it a judgeship, as has often been rumored of late. What Andrew P. O'Rourke truly wanted, he revealed recently, was to be the Green Hornet.
With the characteristic blend of easygoing wit and geniality that has marked his career -- a style that only thinly veils his more serious side -- the 63-year-old Mr. O'Rourke reflected recently on his years as one of the county's most powerful elected officials. 
 And like many of the politician's other quips, the Green Hornet metaphor bore a message.
"He was an adventurous person who carried a gas gun and could knock you out," the County Executive said of the former Saturday night radio hero, "but the Green Hornet's job was to do good."
Mr. O'Rourke, who prides himself on doing good in government -- he is an admitted "sucker for a sad story" who has often championed the needs of women, children, the poor and the afflicted -- announced on Feb. 4 that he would not seek re-election. Leaving fellow Republicans scurrying to find a replacement for the county's top job, he ended months of speculation about his decision and said he would leave his $119,085-a-year position on Jan. 1.
"So today is bittersweet, as I bring this chapter of public service to a close," he told a crowded news conference that winter day.
Three months later, on a bright spring morning, the bittersweet tone was still present as he discussed his years in office.
"It was like a great ocean voyage, and I was the captain," he said. "If I pride myself on anything, it is that I took a great ship and steered it for 15 years and never hit rocks. It's still on course."
He talked about his journey to the County Executive's office and the problems he encountered once there -- like Westchester's economic depressions and recessions, the growing threat of AIDS and other diseases, commissioners who came and went, allegations of favoritism in office and his battles with the 17-member County Board of Legislators.
As an occasional child actor on stage and in television, Mr. O'Rourke grew up with four older sisters during the 1940's and 50's in the Hell's Kitchen area of Manhattan near Ninth Avenue, in a heavily Jewish, German and Irish neighborhood. His father, a doctor, died of tuberculosis when his son was less than 2; his mother, an active New York City Democrat, went blind eight years later and became a welfare recipient.
Mr. O'Rourke made his way up through the ranks of Westchester Republican politics, beginning in 1963 when he concluded a stint as a captain in the Air Force, moved to Yonkers and enrolled in law school at New York University at night.
Although he voted for John Fitzgerald Kennedy that year, he said he "never discovered where the Democrats in the city met" and so turned to the other camp.
Three years later as a Republican, he won a seat on the Yonkers City Council, where many Westchester politicians have cut their political teeth.
"If you can survive in Yonkers, you can survive anywhere," Mr. O'Rourke said. "It's a fairly Byzantine city. There used to be a story that after a political battle, the victors went out and found the wounded and killed them. I think it's still the same there."
It was during that early period that he first struck up his friendship with Alfred B. Del Bello, a Democrat who later became the Mayor of Yonkers, Westchester County Executive and Lieutenant Governor. Mr. Del Bello said recently that although he and Mr. O'Rourke were always on opposite sides of the aisles, they often voted together on social-programming issues.
When Mr. Del Bello was Mayor of Yonkers, Mr. O'Rourke was the majority leader of the City Council. When the Democrat ascended to the County Executive post, Mr. O'Rourke became a County Legislator and then Chairman of the Board of Legislators.
"Sometimes there was a lot of blunderbuss and conservative posturing, but when push came to shove, and money was needed for people programs, he would support it," Mr. Del Bello said.
He described his colleague as soft-hearted at the core.
And while Mr. O'Rourke does not deny that, he prefers to describe himself as a realist. For example, while he has supported a wide array of social programs, his Administration has also been notable for its efforts to reduce welfare rolls.
Fiscally, too, he has taken a tough stance, protecting Westchester's AAA bond rating, fighting to keep taxes down and tax revenues stable and privatizing some county jobs to cut costs -- even though that decision, he said, was painful.
He counts among his successes construction of a new terminal at the County Airport, a new jail and a recycling plant.
But he and his political allies have also been dogged by allegations of patronage. In 1989 an investigation by the State Government Integrity Commission criticized the influence of Anthony J. Colavita, who was then the county's Republican boss, describing an overly close relationship between political parties and government, and focusing on the awarding of franchises at the county-owned Playland Amusement Park.
In 1993, Mr. O'Rourke faced charges of reportedly using his position to help family members and friends. He acknowledged that a daughter worked for a law firm receiving county contracts, that he recommended his female companion for a job with a company that was seeking a county contract, that the county awarded a contract to a company employing his companion's son and that he asked New York Medical College, which is under contract with the county, to admit a daughter as a student and, at a later date, to hire a son-in-law.
An investigation by the District Attorney's office found that Mr. O'Rourke had not violated any laws.
"I've been investigated more than anyone else and never been convicted," he said last week. "I feel safe in saying that everything I've done has been on the right side of the law."
But he said that the real thorn in his side during his time as County Executive has been the sometimes stormy relationship with the legislative branch of county government.
"I feel that they have tried to encroach on the powers of this office," Mr. O'Rourke said. "It has been a problem of who's in charge of what."
His relationship with the current Chairman of the Board of Legislators, George Oros, has been cordial only of late.
"We didn't get off to the best start," said Mr. Oros, a Republican who won the post through a coalition of Democrats and Republicans and was not the Republican Party's choice.
"Despite our differences, the County Executive has always put Westchester first, and that deep-seated love comes through," Mr. Oros said.
Mr. O'Rourke's relationship with the previous chairman of the Board of Legislators, Stephen P. Tenore, was less friendly.
"It was difficult for him to deal with the Board's growing sense of independence at that time," Mr. Tenore observed recently.
The question on many observers' minds has been: Why, with a career that has been basically so successful, is the County Executive now stepping down, especially when informal polls taken by Westchester's Republican party showed he could win again?
Mr. O'Rourke said that, for a variety of reasons, it was time to move on.
One reason is that he is tired of running for re-election, even though he campaigned unsuccessfully only once, in a 1986 run against Mario M. Cuomo for Governor.
"I hate feeling like a nun in front of the subway station asking for money," he said, explaining that his efforts to reform campaign financing have borne little fruit.
Mostly, he said, he is stepping down because he has longed to be a judge, and there are reports that the State Legislature may create a new Supreme Court judgeship for him. He admitted last week that he "wouldn't mind that."
In 1991 Mr. O'Rourke was nominated by President Bush for a seat in Federal District Court in Manhattan, but the nomination stalled in the United States Senate as Democrats sensed a Presidential victory by Bill Clinton. In 1993 the County Executive wistfully turned down the offer once again even though the nomination for judgeship was revived by Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato and Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He said he would run once again for County Executive.
If for some reason, however, the Supreme Court judgeship does not materialize now, Mr. O'Rourke said, he might take up his part-time literary career full time. He is the author of two published adventure novels.
Or he could teach history on the college level -- "if they still teach history," he said.
He could also return to being a lawyer.
"It will all take some getting used to," Mr. O'Rourke conceded. "I'm an old warhorse. Politics is deeply in my blood."

HEADLINE: Potential Power Woes Now a Regional Worry

BYLINE: By MAURA CASEY 

 BODY:
MAYBE it is true that misery loves company. Consider: The potential power shortage Connecticut faced last summer will be shared this year by all of New England. Last year three out of four Connecticut plants were shut down, but at least the Connecticut Yankee nuclear power plant at Haddam Neck operated through July. Then last fall, its operator, Northeast Utilities, closed the Connecticut Yankee permanently after officials determined it made no economic sense to continue running the unit. Now, with all four of the state's nuclear plans shut down, the region as well as the state faces possible power shortages.
The three Millstone nuclear units have been shut down since March of 1996, two months after they were placed on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's watch list of unsafe nuclear plants. Northeast Utilities is working hard to reopen one of its Millstone units, but does not expect to do so until the end of the year at the earliest. 
 Elsewhere in New England, the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant, which was placed on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's watch list six months ago, is shut down. "Five of the New England states' eight nuclear power plants are now out of operation," said William P. Sheperdson, spokesman for the New England Power Pool, which regulates the region's distribution of power.
The five closed nuclear plants were capable of providing about 4,000 megawatts of electricity, said Myra Humphries, spokeswoman for Northeast Utilities, about enough to supply 1.2 million homes.
The nuclear-powered wattage now on hold is just shy of one-fifth of the expected peak demand of 21,400 megawatts that the power pool expects the New England states to need this summer, and more than two-thirds of Connecticut's expected peak demand of 5,800 megawatts, according to Ms. Humphries.
The power pool has become so concerned about potential power shortages that it requested that Northeast Utilities schedule maintenance weeks early for its nuclear plant at Seabrook, N.H. -- in May instead of July, Mr. Sheperdson said.
The plant, shut down yesterday, will be closed for five weeks. If all goes as scheduled, it will be producing power again in mid-June, Ms. Humphries said.
"The first time people get really hot weather in May or June, it's a relief, especially after the kind of cool spring we've had," Mr. Sheperdson said. "They go out to buy air conditioners, or put them in," but tend not to turn them on, he said. It's the second and third occasions when temperatures soar -- especially if they do so for long periods -- that people begin running the cooling apparatus at high. That is why the power pool sought an earlier maintenance plan for Seabrook, to get things in place before summer heat really sets in.
If Connecticut gets through this summer without power shortages, one major reason could be equipment that Northeast Utilities personnel spent much of the winter scrambling to install on major transmission lines that cross the state lines from New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
Capacitors, electrical equipment attached to major utility poles, will significantly increase the voltage of electricity the state will be able to import, increasing voltage capacity from 2,100 megawatts of power last summer to 2,520 megawatts this year, according to Ms. Humphries.
Northeast Utilities is also keeping nonnuclear plants in reserve, plants that it reactivated last year. These include Middletown 1, Norwalk Harbor 10 and four gas turbine jet engines in Milford that themselves are capable of producing 160 megawatts of power. The United Illuminating Company, which provides electricity to 17 cities and towns including Bridgeport and New Haven, last year also reactivated its Bridgeport Harbor Unit 1, said Fran Mayko, a spokeswoman. "We're running the plant at minimum power in case it is needed," she explained.
Even the Navy submarine base in Groton was ready last year in case its help was necessary and the base intends to stand by again this year, said Chief Petty Officer William Polson, a base spokesman.
Last year, the Navy Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme, Calif., flew in 21 generators capable of producing 24 megawatts of electricity. "Not only would it have made us self-sufficient in case of a problem, it would have helped the community, too," Chief Polson said. The generators were never needed, but this year, the base has retained eight generators capable of producing 13.5 megawatts of power.
Ms. Mayko said that United Illuminating gave 350 commercial and industrial customers pagers last year in order to notify them in the event that a voltage reduction was about to occur. The company never had to call.
Utilities have also identified customers whose power is not to be interrupted -- hospitals, sewage treatment plants and downtown urban areas among them.
Both United and Northeast have granted rate reductions to customers who are willing to have their power interrupted in case a heat wave forces cutbacks, the companies said. In a worst-case scenario, the utilities would resort to rolling blackouts, cutting electricity to neighborhoods during the day on a rotating basis for one or two hours at a time.
But the utilities hope such steps will not be necessary. "We're cautiously optimistic that, if everything works well, we'll be in reasonably good shape during a heat wave," Ms. Humphries said.
Because potential power problems face the entire region, the New England Power Pool has put in place a series of warnings to alert the public that conservation is needed, especially if the weather is warm. It also has arranged with other regional power pools, in New York State and Canada, to purchase more electricity if it is needed.
Potential power shortages aren't unheard-of in New England, said Mr. Sheperdson. He pointed to the experience in 1984, when the New England economy was beginning to boom and several of the region's power plants -- including Seabrook and Millstone 3 -- were not yet completed. "New England managed then, and it might well make it through the summer without much of a problem," Mr. Sheperdson said.
Still, the best ally the region could have is another cool summer, like last year's.
"My gut feeling? It isn't likely that we'll get two such cool summers in a row," said Ms. Mayko, a sentiment that was echoed by other utility employees.

HEADLINE: Creating a Bond Beyond U.S. Borders

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
TEACHERS and carpenters, students and union members, artists and medical professionals from Connecticut have been going to Nicaragua since 1984 as part of the New Haven/Leon Sister City Project. The project is an unconventional program run from a small office on Whitney Avenue in New Haven.
Lee Cruz, director of the program, now considers Nicaragua his home and offers one answer for the continuing interest of Connecticut residents in the fate of Nicaragua: "Hope, the hope that always comes after the overthrow of a dictator." 
 Patty L. Nuelsen who runs the New Haven office (newhavenleon@igc.apc.org), adds: "I think people are frustrated by what's going on in the world. I think they see injustice. When opportunity for concrete action that will impact real peoples' lives, they become very motivated."
At first the New Haven Sister Cites Inc. organization resisted the Nicaraguan group's desire to join. "I think they perceived us to be political rather than economic and cultural," Ms. Nuelsen explained. "People's attitudes have changed and now we are full partners." Other Sister Cities in the umbrella organization include Avignon, France; Amalfi, Italy; Freetown, Sierra Leone; Hue, Vietnam, and Afula-Gilboa, Israel.
Local volunteers first went to help and see for themselves what was happening after the fall of the dictator Anastasio Somoza at the hands of the Sandinistas in 1979. Many built personal relationships and have returned often. "They see an opportunity to make a difference," Ms. Nuelson said. Furthermore, she added, "It is not uncommon for people to go down and say 'I leaned much more than I brought down there.' "
The Rev. Alice Perry, a pastoral counselor from New Haven, has visited the Leon area six times, pursuing an interest in liberation theology, picking cotton, delivering medical and school supplies and clothing as well as living with Nicaraguan families. Her visits led to a sister church arrangement between an evangelical church in an impoverished part of Leon and the United Church on the Green in New Haven where she was then employed.
"For me the most powerful experience was to appreciate the post-revolution developments in health care and literacy," she said. "In terms of the liberation theology perspective, it was the notion of a preferential option for the poor."
Ms. Perry, very disturbed by the land mine death of a Swiss agronomist at the hands of the Contras, learned that the mine involved was made in America. Upon her return she went to Washington to lobby against funding the Contras. "We urged legislators not to fuel and fund a war," she explained.
By the time of her most recent visit, in 1993, her Spanish was strong enough to take to the pulpit of the sister church and preach. She also helped revive a weaving cooperative that began with the support of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. Sister Cities offered technical, financial and marketing advice. Now colored yarn is shipped to Nicaragua from New Haven, woven and shipped back for sale. American weavers are sent from Connecticut to work with the cooperative.
"It is very humbling to be in Nicaragua, seeing the effects of U.S. policy," Ms. Perry said. "I have learned that one of the freedoms in the United States is the freedom to exploit." She opposes such practices as using cultivatable land to raise exportable items like cotton when the people need the land to feed themselves.
Dr. Jose R. Santana, who grew up in the Bronx and Puerto Rico, has been to Nicaragua four times. As chief medical resident at the Hospital of St. Rafael in New Haven, he specializes in infectious diseases and tropical medicine.
He first went to Leon in 1995 when the area was hit with a mysterious epidemic. "It was leptospirosis, a rodent-borne bacteria that is common in the tropics," explained Dr. Santana. Eventually more than 5,000 people contracted the disease and an unknown number died of massive pulmonary hemorrhaging.
He spent his days helping the Centers for Disease Control collect mosquito eggs and blood samples from cattle. At night he cared for patients at a teaching hospital in Leon. His next visit was devoted to research. He characterized his visits as "very much a two-way exchange."
"I have tons to learn about the kinds of care they provide without relying heavily on extensive tests that we do over here," he said. In return, he has provided information about Yale's medical curriculum, to help revise their medical education program.
Susan A. Bramhall, a computer software engineer, decided to go to Nicaragua because "My political instincts had been buried. I was disappointed things weren't changing in the United States and had become cynical about people and their ability to want to do something good," she recalled.
Ms. Bramhall, who has made five visits since 1990, is now president of the Sister Cities Board.
The organization operates on a budget ranging from $100,000 to $150,000 annually. For Leon, that represents an enormous resource. "I was very emotionally connected from the beginning, very invested in making this organization robust and stable enough to handle the natural and political crises that regularly afflict Nicaragua," Ms. Bramhall said.
One of the most visible ways of helping is to deliver material aid. Vast amounts of donated summer-weight clothing, school and medical supplies, tools, sewing machines and bicycles are stuffed into a large container by volunteers. The 36th such container will be packed in New Haven on June 7.
The clothing is not distributed free. Mr. Cruz explained, "We donate the clothing to one of five communities," he explained. "They in turn sell the clothing and through the sale we help develop leadership. We help them learn business skills and accounting. They may raise $300 or 400."
The money is put toward construction projects. A volunteer American architect, a Nicaraguan contractor and community volunteers are slowly building a health center, a school and a pre-school. In a country where teachers earn $65 a month, small amounts of money can be stretched quite far. As Mr. Cruz explains it, the project's real importance is "not the building, it is what people learn in the process."
There is also a modest two-way exchange between New Haven and Nicaraguan artists and musicians. At Casa Otonal, a housing complex for elderly Spanish-speaking tenants, Daniel Pulido, a Leon muralist, painted a history of Latino culture.
In June a display of paintings from Solentiname, Nicaragua, will be on display at Casa Cultural Julia Burgos, the Puerto Rican Community Center at Yale.

HEADLINE: LEFT BEHIND -- A special report;
As U.S. Economy Races Along, Upstate New York Is Sputtering

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SYRACUSE

 BODY:
Sunshine, a scarce commodity through the long upstate winter, has returned, bearing hope. Nature bursts with promise.
Mike McConnell is unmoved. 
 "It's spring and you're dead broke again," said Mr. McConnell, who works for his father's small 30-year-old concrete contracting company here. "After a while, you just say enough is enough."
That is what McConnell & Sons Contracting did in April. The firm placed its first bid for construction work out of state, a job in Raleigh, N.C. If the bid is accepted, the 35-year-old Mr. McConnell said, he and his wife and four children -- along with three employees and their families -- will head south, perhaps for good.
From the perspective of upstate New York residents like the McConnells, the nation's economic expansion in the mid-1990's has been a fiction -- a tale of other places and other people's lives. The state's broad top has become an island of glacial growth, sandwiched between generally thriving New England and booming Midwestern states.
In the four years since the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's ended in the Northeast, New York City and its suburbs have made substantial gains, but much of the upstate economy barely budged. The growing national economy has lured away skilled, ambitious residents and young people.
More alarming still, the region's already tepid expansion in employment stalled completely in 1996, even as the pace accelerated in New York City and elsewhere.
The region's plight has been made all the more glaring by a reversal of fortunes within the state. New York City, long derided by upstaters as a sinkhole of waste and economic decline, has become the state's economic leader, fired by Wall Street, tourism and international finance -- all sectors of the economy that are smaller or absent upstate.
Of the 41,000 net new jobs created in the state in 1996, 31,000 were in New York City, according to the State Labor Department, and 9,000 more were in the city's suburbs on Long Island and in Westchester and Rockland Counties. Although there were areas of modest strength upstate, notably in Rochester, job losses elsewhere canceled them, leaving the region with zero net job growth -- its worst year since 1992.
The job numbers improved somewhat in the first three months of this year, but the basic pattern persisted: very slow growth, with pockets of outright contraction. Syracuse, for example, has lost 700 more jobs just since February, according to the State Labor Department.
Paradoxically, economists say that the upstate region's weakness grew in part from its past strength. Although major employers like Kodak shed thousands of jobs in the 1980's and 1990's, the region's industrial base, heavily reliant on manufacturing durable goods like air-conditioners and medical equipment, remained for the most part intact. It did not collapse entirely, as the military-based economy did on Long Island, for example. As a result of its relative stability, the area was not forced to modernize or seek out the sort of new industries that are now fueling growth elsewhere.
Although some of the troubled areas upstate are rural, like Hamilton County south of the Adirondacks, where the unemployment rate was 15.8 percent in March, economists say that the larger structural weaknesses upstate are urban -- concentrated in the string of metropolitan areas that stretches from Lake Erie to the Massachusetts and Vermont borders.
"Upstate New York right now has one of the weakest, if not the weakest, economies of any significant region of the country," said Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist at Regional Financial Associates, an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
Mr. Zandi said that except for small communities like some mining towns in the West that are in economic distress, he puts upstate New York alongside Hawaii, which has been battered by a drop in investment from Japan, and Washington, D.C., which has been hurt by Federal Government spending cuts, in a bleak triumvirate that are not sharing the nation's economic success.
Some politicians, especially opponents of Gov. George E. Pataki, say that if low numbers persist into 1998, the economy of the heavily Republican upstate areas on which the Governor depended for his election in 1994 could complicate his hopes for re-election.
Pataki aides point out that the total number of jobs in the region has increased slightly since 1992, and contend that there are signs of better things to come. Employers announced plans in 1996 to create more than 28,000 jobs upstate, according to the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development arm.
But the shoots of growth that are here now, like Barilla, an Italian company that brought 70 jobs to the Syracuse area in 1996 to package bulk imported pasta, are mostly small and can be easily overwhelmed by new cutbacks. In late April, Bausch & Lomb, Rochester's third-largest employer after Eastman Kodak and Xerox, said it would eliminate 1,900 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, on top of the 950 jobs cut since early in 1996.
Smaller firms like Mr. McConnell's, or the Wheatstone Corporation in nearby Cicero, which will take 80 electronics manufacturing jobs to North Carolina this fall, are leaving more quietly. Wheatstone has offered financial assistance to any worker who wants to move with the company.
Mr. McConnell said he knew 30 small contractors from the tightly knit construction community in the Syracuse area who have made the leap south already, searching for work. The local building industry, he said, has all but collapsed.
The prospects for the region's economy are made even more perilous by the fact that the rest of the nation is so far ahead in the business cycle, having expanded continuously now for six years. A slowing of the broader economy, which some economists expect later this year, would make a local recovery much harder. And an accelerating national economy could be just as bad, if concerns over inflation prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates further.
Upstate New York is not one monolithic place, of course, and each city and town has its own distinctive tale. Albany has suffered from the downsizing of state government. Buffalo has been hurt by the weak dollar in Canada, to which the city economy is closely tied. Rochester, though somewhat better off, has been hit by repeated job cuts at Kodak, and now again by the layoffs announced at Bausch & Lomb. Syracuse, where hospitals are the biggest employer after government, has been especially hurt by cutbacks in the health care industry.
The stagnant economy is causing young people to leave in search of opportunity. Since 1995, departures have exceeded arrivals in upstate New York by nearly 169,000 people, according to the United States Census Bureau. The metropolitan Syracuse area, with a population of 660,000, has had a net loss of about 17,000. When births and deaths are added in, upstate's population declined by about one-half of 1 percent.
Gregory Hotaling, 21, an engineering major at Syracuse University whose family has lived in the Syracuse area since Dutch colonial days, counts on his fingers the places he thinks he may find a job. His hometown is not among them. "Yes to Atlanta, yes to San Diego, yes to Houston," he said.
Mr. Hotaling said that of the 40 engineering majors who have passed through his fraternity house since 1993, only 3 are still in the area. The others regularly send back newspapers full of job tips for posting on the fraternity house bulletin board.

The Region
Losing Pace With Its Neighbors
Upstate New York used to look much like the rest of America in its economic performance, its mix of jobs and its income levels. But the appearances were misleading. Economists say that the region has been a different, distinct island of the economy for many years, moving on its own track.
For a long period, through the 1970's and much of the 1980's, that was good. The region specialized in a kind of durable manufacturing that seemed able to ride out bad times. Chilly Syracuse, for example, specialized in building air-conditioners for the growth of the Sunbelt. Kodak seemed to have a lock on a major part of the photography industry.
The industrial base upstate did not collapse in the early 1980's like the steel and automobile empires of the Midwest. And the region was spared the worst of the late 1980's and early 1990's recession, which was concentrated in financial services in New York City and in military manufacturing in places like Long Island and New England.
But now that appears to have been something of a curse. The pain and dislocation of the earlier downturns eventually led to the emergence of new, highly productive computer-driven manufacturing in the Midwest, and to a high-tech resurgence in places like Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The upstate economy did not crumble; it eroded. And it has absorbed more blows in the mid-1990's even as its neighbors moved on.
"Our problem is that a lot of our changes and restructurings have been going on more recently," said Paul Blackley, a professor of economics at LeMoyne College in Syracuse.
General Motors gradually closed its Syracuse parts manufacturing plant beginning in 1993, eliminating 1,200 jobs. Miller Brewing, about 25 miles north in the town of Volney, closed in late 1994, eliminating 1,000 more jobs. Kodak is racing to keep ahead of the technologies of electronic photography. Insurance, another major upstate industry, has also cut jobs in the last few years. Since 1994, employment among private businesses has risen only 1.19 percent upstate -- about a fourth of the 4 percent to 5 percent growth rates in the Midwest and most of New England, and about half the 2.19 percent growth rate in New York City, state figures show.
There are reasons to believe that the hard times may work to the advantage of the region, however. Since labor shortages loom in Sunbelt and Midwest markets, some economists think that upstate New York could start to seem attractive as an alternative.
The region's costs of doing business are competitive nationally, with Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo and Albany all below the national average, according to an analysis by Regional Financial Associates. And falling house prices, while painful for longtime residents, have made the region affordable.
Transportation is also an advantage in central New York. Syracuse, for example, is at the intersection of Interstate 90, an east-west artery, and Interstate 81, a north-south artery. Barilla pasta chose to put its distribution site in the region partly because of that road network, city officials said (and because the company's research showed that upstate New York has the highest per capita consumption of pasta in the country).

Syracuse
A Distress That Mirrors a Region
Economic statistics do not reveal the struggles of people like Susan DeGraeve-Dupra. She and her husband, Kevin, who live in Syracuse with their two children, both have jobs. She has two of them, in fact. She installs and hangs drapes, and works in a crafts store. He is a mechanic. The problem is not unemployment, she said, but a lack of jobs that pay the bills. "We work like dogs and we can't get ahead or even get even," Ms. DeGraeve-Dupra said. "We constantly have to say, 'Who are we going to pay this month, and who are we going to blow off?' -- it just seems to get tighter."
In Syracuse, some problems are obvious, like the empty stretch of commercial office buildings on James Street, a major thoroughfare leading to the city's downtown. Others are hidden and private and, to some degree, obscured by the statistics, local officials say.
Connie Maute, the research director for the Syracuse Chamber of Commerce, said that the local unemployment rate of 4.9 percent in March, for example -- the same as the national rate, which was at a 23-year low -- is misleading, and the message it sends out, she said, has hurt the local economy.
When potential employers call, she said, they "look at the low unemployment rate and say, well, then you don't have the people to fill the jobs." Her job, she said, is to explain that things are in fact worse than they look because of underemployment, population losses, and uncounted residents who have stopped looking, or have stopped receiving unemployment benefits.
There are other subtle factors that have added to the economic distress. Not too many years ago, for example, Syracuse, a city of 160,000 -- which economists say is representative of many upstate communities in its mix of jobs and the kinds of problems it has faced -- had some big corporations that called it home and cared deeply about its fate. Carrier Corporation, the air-conditioner company, was generous and civic-minded. Lesser-known manufacturers like Crouse-Hinds, a maker of electronics, had major downtown presences.
Now, because of mergers and acquisitions and departures, there is only one corporate headquarters left, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation. Carrier was purchased by United Technologies Corporation, based in Hartford. Crouse-Hinds was bought by a Texas company, Cooper Industries.
City officials say those changes have had an unmeasurable but profound effect on Syracuse's fortunes, and are making its comeback harder. Syracuse's director of development, Vito Sciscioli, said that although other mid-size cities, like Cleveland, could call on cadres of corporate chief executives to attract civic projects like the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame, "We're now down to dealing with wealthy individuals."
For many residents, Syracuse has become a place of waiting -- waiting for a house to sell, waiting for a job, waiting for things to get better.
George Camardella Jr. said part of his weekly routine was making sure he gets to Durston's Cigar Store by Thursday night to pick up The Arizona Republic and The Palm Beach Post for the help-wanted sections, because by Friday, all the copies are gone, even though they are almost a week old.
Mr. Camardella, 42, whose job selling ads for a local shopping guide is largely seasonal and barely makes ends meet, is waiting to sell his family home in East Syracuse. When it finally moves, he and his wife will, too -- maybe Florida, maybe Arizona. He has no job in either place, but he is confident he will. Selling the house is another matter. He has dropped the price twice since Thanksgiving, from $74,000 to $64,900 by late April. He held an open house for brokers, he said, and not a single broker showed up to look at the house he grew up in.
There have been major blows to community pride as well. Until 1994, for example, Syracuse was the state headquarters for Nationwide Insurance Enterprise's entire automobile insurance business in New York. That year, the company consolidated its claims-processing operations into two national centers, and several hundred jobs were pulled out of Syracuse. At the same time, it added an almost equal number elsewhere in New York, resulting in little or no change statewide but another tip of the scale within it: Almost all the new jobs were in New York City and its suburbs.

The Politics
An Important Shift Toward Downstate
Hating New York City is a popular pastime upstate. Residents and politicians have said for years that New York City officials venture north to Albany only to beg for more tax money to help pay for profligate programs and wasteful ways.
That is not happening now. These days, many of the arguments and equations about which part of New York needs or does not need the other have been turned on their heads. New York City's budget is flush. And while its economy is not booming, since late 1995 it has nonetheless been the state's main job-creation engine. Its crime rate is dropping. And the bull market on Wall Street has created a flood of tax revenues for the state.
It is too soon to tell whether the economic problems of upstate New York will be a major issue in the 1998 governor's race. But there have been noises to suggest that they might be. The Assembly majority leader, Michael J. Bragman, a Democrat from Onondaga County, and the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall -- both seen as possible Democratic challengers to Mr. Pataki -- have become frequent critics of the Governor's policies upstate.
Mr. McCall argues that Mr. Pataki has neglected New York's smaller cities and aggravated their problems. Mr. Bragman said that high energy costs upstate, which he calls a major stumbling block to growth, have not been adequately addressed by the administration.
Upstaters, Mr. Bragman said, "are apprehensive because there's no job growth and they continue to see job losses." He said that although Mr. Pataki's popularity is high now, "over the next six to nine months, that could very well change -- jobs and economic growth are the key."
Mr. Pataki's chief spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, called such criticism "ridiculous," saying both Mr. McCall and Mr. Bragman were part of the problem that the Governor was trying to fix.
"Both these politicians are responsible for leaving New York State in the dire straits it was before the Governor took office," she said. "They voted for and supported the policies that drove over half a million jobs out of state." She also pointed to announcements of major upstate investment by companies like Kodak and I.B.M. that she said would create jobs in years to come.
But upstate residents like Mr. Camardella say they are tired of waiting. "At this point I'm not sure I care if it gets better or not -- I'm just tired of it," he said. "I've been sitting here drinking beer too long."

"Five Cities That Have Faltered"
 Upstate New York has missed the steady economic expansion that most of the rest of the country has enjoyed in the last few years. In the five cities that are the spine of the region, job growth is flat, housing construction is down and personal bankruptcies are rising.
 
BUFFALO
 The city's anchor, General Motors, is building its new light-weight car engine here. But other manufactur-ing continues to recede and the weak Canadian dollar has hurt tourism.
 
ROCHESTER
 The story here has been one step forward, one step back. After years of cutbacks, Eastman Kodak, the city's largest employer, is expanding, but Bausch & Lomb will cut 1,900 jobs this year.
 
SYRACUSE
 Restaurants and shops downtown have added 2,000 service jobs in the last few years. But many established employers, like insurance companies, have contracted or left.
 
UTICA
 Population declines and job losses, including layoffs at nearby Griffiss Air Force Base, have battered the city, giving it the country's lowest bond rating from Standard & Poor's.
 
ALBANY
 A shrinking state payroll hit hard in the mid-1990's. In the last year alone, 3,200 state jobs were eliminated, the effects of which have rippled through the retailing and housing markets.

The Time Bind
 When Work Becomes Home
 and Home Becomes Work.
 By Arlie Russell Hochschild.
 Illustrated. 316 pp. New York:
 Metropolitan Books/
 Henry Holt & Company. $22.50. 
 The photograph accompanying the 1953 Fortune article that William H. Whyte expanded into "The Organization Man" showed a tide of humanity (to the extent that guys in fedoras qualify as a tide of humanity) flowing across a train platform in Park Forest, Ill., over this caption: "5:57, back from the Loop."
The unmistakable message was that ominous big corporations were turning us into a race of work-automatons. Today, however, looking at the picture, you can't help thinking that they would have had to leave the office not much past 5 to make that train, and that their wives had probably been home all day attending to home, community and children. What a leisurely life!
Arlie Russell Hochschild's book "The Time Bind" is based on the same kind of intensive firsthand research into Midwestern corporate life that Whyte did, except that she is a sociologist rather than a journalist, and so doesn't tell us the real name of the town or the company. She spent three summers at the headquarters of "Amerco," an enlightened multinational in the low-key town of "Spotted Deer," and found that in most families both spouses put in much longer hours than just the husbands had back in the 1950's. Ten- to eleven-hour workdays are common (that's 8 A.M. to 6 or 7 P.M.), and family life is brutally squeezed.
Ms. Hochschild writes in a calm, understanding tone that tends to disguise how truly subversive and depressing her message is. Subversive, because although we've already heard, in Juliet Schor's book "The Overworked American" and elsewhere, that our hours are too long, the blame is usually laid at the feet of a demanding new economy. It isn't our fault. Ms. Hochschild says we work too much because we want to -- because we like it better at work than at home. Depressing, because in her account home has changed from a refuge into an arena of stress, and children are the victims.
At Amerco an elaborate series of family-friendly personnel schemes with hilariously earnest names (like the Work-Life Balance program) go mostly unused. Only 53 of 21,000 employees, none of them men, have chosen to work part time in response to the arrival of a new baby. Fewer than 1 percent share a job. And 1 percent of Amerco employees work from home, though the company permits it. Most employees don't even use all their vacation days.
A minor reason for all this office time is that Amerco is "a pretty workaholic place" where employees are judged more on input (that is, hours worked) than on output. "What matters is how much time you put into the job, the volume of work," one of Ms. Hochschild's interviewees is told by her boss. The major reason is volition. No dark satanic mills in Spotted Deer! Over and over Ms. Hochschild conveys Amerco's employees' attitude toward their work by using such sun-dappled terms as "sweet joy," "fun," "carefree," "emotionally supportive" and "more interesting than life at home." One interviewee tells her, "I come to work to relax." Ms. Hochschild has exposed something that feels like an unacknowledged home truth, America's clean little secret: work, not even the substance of it but the buzzy surface feeling of office life, is for many of us a source of intense pleasure.
Amerco has become somewhat homelike -- even, Ms. Hochschild insists, for the hourly workers in its "well-lit, fairly quiet, relatively pleasant" factories. At work people have buddies, they carry on flirtations, their birthdays are celebrated, they even have staged "commitment ceremonies" (to the company, that is). Home, on the other hand, has become "another workplace." The increased presence of women has led to a mild feminization of work, with more emphasis placed on cooperation and support, but also to a pronounced masculinization of home, where efficiency is now the overriding concern.
Parenthood, too, is judged by outputs, not inputs: one mother measures her performance "by how well her children were doing, not how much time she spent with them." Children are subjected to factory-style "speedups," hurried from one place to another all day and made to squeeze all their emotional needs into the hour or less that their parents have to spare in the evening. Home has developed its version of corporate "outsourcing" and "downsizing," with many traditional maternal functions off-loaded to baby sitters and therapists. In one of Ms. Hochschild's most horrifying anecdotes, two parents dash off to give presentations at work on a day when they know their son has to be taken to the hospital because of a medical emergency. Ms. Hochschild notes that Hallmark has introduced a new line of cards "for parents who are too busy to see their children," which say things like "Sorry I can't be there to tuck you in."
A cycle develops. Home, because it is continually shorted, keeps getting messier. Sullen children, resentful spouses, inconvenient stepchildren, elderly parents and manipulative exes lurk there. Relationships at work, which get the nourishment of time, become deeper and richer. One executive, typically of Ms. Hochschild's subjects, finds dealings with his "office children" -- subordinates, that is -- more rewarding than those with his flesh-and-blood children. The reversing of home and work has got to the point that Amerco employees who can't handle their family lives can now turn to the company to teach them how, through free workshops on such subjects as "Dealing With Anger."
Ms. Hochschild's previous book, "The Second Shift," found that in two-career couples, women still do the lion's share of the child care and housework. In "The Time Bind" she identifies a "third shift," consisting of emotional work at home, which nobody does. Many of her subjects have invented a "potential self" who would do all the things they are not doing at home; their garages fill up with recreational equipment, bought for the potential self to use, ignored by the real one. Although Ms. Hochschild's ideal plainly is that men and women would work side by side on all three shifts, she is also unsparing in pointing out that it was women's changing their priorities that produced the net reduction in emotional effort at home. Everybody knows men have never carried their share of the load of family life, she writes: "This isn't news. The news of this book is that growing numbers of working women are leery of spending more time at home, as well."
Several years ago Daniel Yankelovich, the psychologist and management consultant, observed that one of the main changes in American culture since the Second World War has been the emergence of a tendency "to view work as a source of personal satisfaction." When mothers entered the work force en masse, it was partly out of economic necessity and partly a manifestation of this alteration of the culture of work. Reread "The Feminine Mystique" and you'll see that Betty Friedan made her case for women working with a rhetoric not of justice or power, but self-fulfillment. (Ms. Friedan had the temerity to attack Sigmund Freud back when that took real courage, but she was completely under the sway of Abraham Maslow and his glorification of people who can ascend to the satisfaction of "higher-order needs.") Men, less noticeably because they were already working, made roughly the same change at the same time -- that's why "The Organization Man," with its dutiful drones, has become a period piece.
Ms. Hochschild ends "The Time Bind" by calling for a "time movement" whose members would organize to reduce work hours. This used to be a sturdy liberal-labor cause, but it has fallen into disuse since the Depression. Recently writers like Juliet Schor and Jeremy Rifkin (in "The End of Work") have also suggested reviving it. The trouble, judging by Ms. Hochschild's evidence, is that nobody would want to join.

THE WHOLE SHEBANG
 A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report.
 By Timothy Ferris.
 393 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $25. 
 AT one time cosmologists, like ancient anchorites on their pillars, lived on the fringes of science, half admired for the exotic nature of their calling and half scorned for being so disconnected from the real world. Equipped with an esoteric theory (Einstein's general relativity) and a single observational datum (the universe seemed to be exploding), they sat on their towers and spun elaborate scenarios of times past and future: Would the universe go on forever, perhaps renewing itself with new hydrogen atoms created in the interstices of space as space itself expanded? Would it expand to nothingness? Or would it end in an infernal big crunch?
What a different level of credibility surrounds cosmologists now! Armed with new astronomical data and joined by the high priests of particle physics, their new descriptions of the large-scale structure of the universe command attention both from the scientific elite and from the public at large. "Like the universe, cosmology is expanding," Timothy Ferris writes near the start of his comprehensive report "The Whole Shebang." A skilled and experienced popular writer, Mr. Ferris serves as one of the best guides for the curious reader. But the initiation requires careful attention, and despite his felicitous style the trail occasionally rises steeply uphill.
The first dozen pages lead up to Big Bang cosmology, the theory of the birth of our universe; the next dozen introduce us to state-of-the-art concepts like gravitational lensing, the Tully-Fisher method and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect -- all connected with the cosmological distance ladder, the steps that lead to an ever-greater distance scale. All this is leavened with tales of amateurs helping discover supernovas in distant galaxies, implying that, despite the jargon, the quest to find the size of the universe is not all that incomprehensible. At the book's end we learn that Mr. Ferris, an emeritus professor of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, spends moonless nights with his own telescope, searching for supernovas.
"How can anyone learn anything new who does not find it a shock?" The question, from the physicist John Wheeler, typifies the pithy and challenging slogans with which Mr. Ferris opens chapters, in this case one on the shape of space. The shock is not the mind-boggling fact that space is curved, or even that in the presence of sufficiently dense matter space can curl around itself so intensely that it becomes a cocoon cut off from the rest of the universe, a black hole. Is it shocking that there is a place from which light cannot escape? No, the trauma lies in Stephen Hawking's audacious conjecture that matter can, after all, leak out of a black hole. Why? Because of the quantum nature of the universe, in which the positions of particles are subject to enough uncertainty that sometimes they can turn up on the other side of the black-hole boundary. The shock is palpable as Mr. Ferris's arresting account picks up momentum.
Matter is energy, Einstein said, and William Blake had already opined that energy is intense delight. Mr. Ferris remarks, in Blake's words, that we really can see "a world in a grain of sand" -- after all, "sand is largely silicon," and silicon burning in giant stars is a prototype for the evolution of the elements. Well, not quite: sand is mostly oxygen, but why spoil a good poetic connection? That, however, is the end of silicon in this account. Oxygen gets a little more consideration, though not until there is mention of design in the cosmos -- in the last chapter, "Contrarian Theological Afterword," to which I shall return.
Mr. Ferris fares better in describing how matter can aptly be called frozen energy. As the unimaginably hot Big Bang cools down, hydrogen and helium freeze out of the photon broth within the first three minutes. Mr. Ferris populates his report on the origin of the elements with colorful characters like the physicist George Gamow, who remarked, "The elements were cooked in less time than it takes to cook a dish of duck and roast potatoes." That was too seductive to leave out, but it is dead wrong. As Mr. Ferris correctly writes a few pages earlier, Gamow's work on the early universe incorporated a big right idea and a big wrong one. The wrong idea was that all the elements were forged in that initial explosion. Mr. Ferris sketches out the correct scenario: the heavier elements are formed from the initial hydrogen and helium in a long, slow cooking process that begins deep within giant stars. He is an astonishingly knowledgeable journalist, and glitches are relatively rare -- like the inclusion of this quotation, or his assertion that Gustav Kirchhoff in the mid-19th century (rather than Noah; remember the origin of the rainbow?) was the first to obtain a solar spectrum.
The story moves swiftly on, through "The Dark Matter Rap" to the large-scale structure of the universe, and to the evolution of quasars, galaxies and stars. And then a brief chapter on the evolution of the cosmos, with two moving quotations from Charles Darwin.
Now, at a cadence, the book turns from astronomers to quantum physicists. "The Hunting of the Snark," by Lewis Carroll, introduces symmetry, broken symmetry, renormalization and string theory:
You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:
You condense it with locusts and tape:
Still keeping one principal object in view --
To preserve its symmetrical shape.
The inflationary development of the universe follows, with a good dose of the beguiling theory of chaotic inflation proposed by the cosmologist Andrei Linde. In this model our universe is only one of many that bubbled up out of the original quantum vacuum. "The classical Big Bang theory is dead," Mr. Linde says. But because the other parts of this multiverse are forever inaccessible to us, their existence must be taken on faith, so his opinion is far from universally accepted. But Mr. Ferris is sufficiently intrigued by the notion to subtitle his book "A State-of-the-Universe(s) Report."
Cosmology is expanding not only because of exciting new ideas but because of a flow of new data, some of it from the Hubble Space Telescope. Curiously, Mr. Ferris has rather little to say about the grand question of how the universe will end or the fervid battle over its age. Depending on the way the distance scale is read, the universe has been expanding for 10 or 15 billion years (or values scattered around this range). But the younger figure falls short of the age of the globular star clusters, and no one wants a universe younger than its parts. As for possible endings, instead of addressing the cosmological Armageddon, our guide brings us to quantum weirdness and the bewildering question of how a measurement of a particle in one place can instantly affect the state of a particle on the opposite side of the galaxy; "It is as if the quantum world had never heard of space," he writes. That is hardly part of cosmology, but this is a breathtakingly wide canvas, and for a brief description of some of the major conundrums of the quantum universe, Mr. Ferris is admirably lucid.
Finally, because God can scarcely be left out of the whole shebang, he turns to his theological afterword. Why is it contrarian? Admirers of the very moving scene in the Beauvais Cathedral in his PBS television special "The Creation of the Universe" will here miss the theme that science owes a lot to religion, especially the idea that the universe really is a universe; the notion of a single system ruled by a single set of laws came to Western science from Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions. "The deity has been implicated in cosmology since the dawn of human history," he writes. But what can science tell us about God? Nothing, is his contrarian conclusion: "In a creative universe God would betray no trace of his presence, since to do so would rob the creative forces of their independence. . . . All who genuinely seek to learn . . . are united in not having a faith but faith itself. . . . For God's hand may be a human hand, if you reach out in loving kindness, and God's voice your voice, if you but speak the truth." Prophets' voices echo in this provocative finale, and this, rather than science, may indeed be the way God speaks to humankind.

HEADLINE: Harbor to Be Dredged, but Much Tainted Mud Lacks Home

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Sometime this week, after years of delays, a floating dredge is scheduled to begin scooping thousands of tons of accumulated mud from one of the main channels plied by the container ships that carry televisions, orange juice, furniture and almost every other imported or exported product into and out of New York Harbor.
Within weeks other dredges will similarly attack mud that has clogged several other important channels and berths. 
 Last week, a variety of Federal officials and New Jersey politicians, including Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Senator Robert G. Torricelli, made much of the impending dredging, proclaiming an end to a four-year environmental battle over how to clear slightly contaminated mud from the dominant seaport on the East Coast without threatening public health or marine life.
But the problem is far from solved, say representatives of the shipping industry and port officials at the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
A century-old ocean dump site for dredged mud, six miles east of Sandy Hook, N.J., will be closed to any further polluted mud on Sept. 1. After that, more than 3 million annual tons of mud tainted with industrial pollutants will need to be placed on land or in waters close to shore, the officials say.
The new projects will clear less than half a single year's accumulation of tainted mud. They will primarily clear shoals of mud that have been shown to be free of significant contamination, according to the Corps of Engineers, which issues permits for dredging.
The pollutants flow into the harbor from old hazardous waste sites up the Passaic, Hackensack and Hudson Rivers and from sewage plants around the region. Some pollutants, like traces of mercury, are thought by environmental officials to sift directly out of the region's dirty air.
With the impending closing of the old dump off Sandy Hook, the two states that share the harbor and its economic benefits have come up with a few innovative ways to dispose of dredged mud over the next several years.
But largely because of persistent public fears that the material poses a health hazard, the states still have not devised a long-term plan that will accommodate all the tainted mud, which will continue to accumulate each year until upriver pollution is stanched and sewage more thoroughly treated.
Major representatives of port businesses joined Mrs. Whitman and a small army of elected officials on a wharf in Port Elizabeth, N.J., last week to celebrate the new permits and Mrs. Whitman's signing of legislation authorizing a New Jersey bond act that provides up to $200 million for dredging.
But with new generations of oceangoing ships growing larger and deeper, many port officials and businesses connected with the harbor have warned in recent days that even with the new moves, New York Harbor still stands to lose its century-old status as a world-class port.
Sensing indecision here, many shippers have continued to divert goods to deeper ports like Halifax, Nova Scotia, before sending their freighters to New York Harbor.
Chuck Raymond, the chief transportation officer of Sea-Land Corporation, the giant container-shipping company with a major terminal in Elizabeth, said a typical Sea-Land vessel these days unloads about 300 containers in Halifax to lighten the ships so they can slip over New York's mud banks.
"Until the governors get together and come up with a plan that is safe and cost-effective, we don't see this as anything but an interim solution," Mr. Raymond said.
He also said that whatever solution New York and New Jersey choose, it cannot be so expensive that harbor fees become prohibitive. "The real issue here at the end of the day is keeping the U.S. competitive," Mr. Raymond said.
The black mayonnaise-like mud, some of which contains minute traces of toxic metals or other pollutants, poses no threat to people if properly placed on land or in buried pits underwater, according to a variety of environmental experts.
For decades, the contaminated harbor mud had been routinely -- and cheaply -- dumped at sea, but four years ago, stricter Federal environmental standards prevented any ocean dumping of the most tainted material.
After a protracted effort by New Jersey environmental groups and politicians, including Mrs. Whitman, the Federal Government agreed last year to close the mud dump entirely by this September to all but the cleanest dredged material.
Many port officials and businesses are irked that even though lightly contaminated mud dug from the harbors of Seattle, San Francisco, Boston and other ports can still be dumped at sea, that will no longer be the case here.
That fact places New York and New Jersey at a disadvantage, said Brian Maher, the chairman of Maher Terminals, which handles half the containers that flow in and out of New York Harbor each year. But he said: "We've finished fighting over the ocean. Now the thrust has to be to get people on land used to the idea that this is useful material, not a hazard."
One of the first places where harbor mud has been put to use is beneath the foundation and parking lots of a shopping mall being built in Elizabeth by OENJ Corporation of Princeton, a real estate company owned by European investors. The company's chairman, Peter Aagaard, was at Mrs. Whitman's side last week, explaining how the dredged mud, once dried and mixed with other soil, became stable and safe.
With the mall well under way, Mr. Aagaard is now working on using the mixed mud to create a golf course on top of two old closed landfills in Bayonne, across Newark Bay from the docks of Port Elizabeth. The first phase of the project is close to gaining permits, according to New Jersey environmental officials. It could take more than 4 million tons of tainted harbor mud -- more than a year's worth of dredging.
Other sites are being lined up to accept the dredged mud, said Robert C. Shinn Jr., New Jersey's Environmental Protection Commissioner. He cited a project in Pennsylvania where 500,000 tons of dredged mud -- most likely from Delaware Bay, for the test -- would soon be used to seal barren, eroded scars left by strip mining.
"We've got a lot of little pieces out there to this puzzle," Mr. Shinn said. But he added that for the time being, all New Jersey's projects would take mud only from New Jersey's side of the harbor.
But there have been setbacks, as well. A year ago, harbor officials praised a plan to bury up to 14 million tons of the tainted mud in pits beneath Newark Bay, which is already relatively polluted. But recent tests of the bottom showed that existing pollution went so deep that less than a tenth of the original estimate -- perhaps 1.3 million tons of dredged mud -- would find a home there.
Most troubling to many harbor businesses and dredging officials is the continuing public fear that the material is dangerous out of the water. In almost every case, the harbor mud is clean enough to be used to cap landfills, seal old hazardous waste sites or use in construction, Federal environmental scientists say.
But in recent months, almost every disposal option proposed by the Army Corps of Engineers -- which is responsible for keeping major shipping channels open -- has been attacked by one community group or another, said Peter Shugert, a spokesman for the Corps.
When the Corps held a public meeting on Staten Island to explain a proposal to put mud in underwater pits in the lower harbor and then cap them with clean sand, the presenters were shouted down by local residents, Mr. Shugert said.
The Corps was met with similar protests at a meeting 100 miles up the Hudson River, in Kingston, N.Y., where an old quarry has been identified as a suitable disposal site.
Even more vitriolic, Mr. Shugert said, was the reception at a meeting last month in a high school cafeteria in Leonardo, N.J., in Monmouth County. There, the proposal being described was an artificial island in Raritan Bay, similar to an existing island of dredged mud outside Baltimore's harbor. The island in Baltimore now provides bird habitat and a popular bathing beach, Mr. Shugert said. He added that Maryland politicians, eager to deepen Baltimore's harbor for larger ships, strongly supported used tainted dredged mud to rebuild a second island, creating dozens of acres of wetlands for birds and fish. That project was announced last month.
For shipping companies making plans for the next century, Mr Shugert said, the progress in places like Baltimore is more attractive than the piecemeal plans here. "It's mind-boggling," he said. "Baltimore has the same problems as New York. But they view it in a totally different way."
Citing a two-inch-thick report on mud disposal options released by the Corps last year, Mr. Shugert said: "There are 53 choices in there, but there's a 54th. We can think of the Port of New York and New Jersey as something less than it has been. If we don't do anything, that's the choice we'll be left with."

HEADLINE: Battling Teen Pregnancy

 BODY:
According to recent Federal surveys, sexual activity among American teen-agers is down -- the first decline in nearly three decades -- and use of contraceptives is up. That is promising news as the nation with the highest teen pregnancy rate in the industrialized world tries for a 33 percent reduction in teen pregnancies by the year 2005. But no national effort can be successful without a focus on community-based solutions.
Federal efforts to promote abstinence programs would be fine if the Government support did not carry with it a prohibition on the discussion of contraceptives. Abstinence programs can reduce teen pregnancies, but other educational activities are necessary as well. 
 America's mixed messages about sex too often portray it as a desirable activity with few or no consequences. But nationwide, there are 112 pregnancies for every 1,000 young women aged 15 to 19, resulting in 61 births, 36 abortions and 15 miscarriages. The rate of births and abortions among teens has been declining, however, in the last few years. The latest survey by the Department of Health and Human Services suggests that the downward trend may continue. In 1995, 50 percent of young women 15 to 19 engaged in sexual activity, down from 55 percent in 1990. Among boys, the 1995 figure was 55 percent, down from 60 percent in 1988, the last year with a comparable survey.
The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, an independent nonprofit effort launched in 1996, aims to reduce the number of pregnancies per 1,000 young women to 75 by 2005. Operating largely with private funds, the campaign, headed by former Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey and the economist Isabel Sawhill, hopes to avoid debates over abortion and contraception that have hindered several government attempts to address the issue.
A provision of the welfare reform law offers $250 million to states, under a matching formula, for programs that teach only sexual abstinence. Many states are reluctant even to apply for the money, fearing that they would be unable to field questions on condoms or other contraceptives. In addition, a recent study of abstinence-only programs in public schools in California, the state with the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country, found many offered misleading and harmful information.
Preaching abstinence can work, particularly with younger teens, but a variety of approaches are needed to persuade young people to delay sexual activity and to avoid pregnancy. Communities need to try everything from school-based clinics and after-school programs to mentoring and peer counseling. The latest Health and Human Services survey suggests that the best national approach is to encourage as many community-based solutions as possible.

HEADLINE: Jobs, but Few New Skills, for Those on Welfare

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio

 BODY:
Diana Goodrich, 33, has had a hard time finding a steady job since a decade ago, when the nursing home where she worked closed. She had been getting along on temporary jobs and food stamps until she came up against a provision in the new Federal welfare law restricting adults without children at home to just three months of food stamps every three years.
But the law also offers people like Ms. Goodrich a way out: She could keep the benefits if she did "community service." So she became a part-time sorter of second-hand clothes at a Salvation Army warehouse here. 
 "They told me that to get my food stamps, 'You've got to work free for the country,' " she said. Her stint as a sorter is leading to a regular job and a real paycheck at $5.15 an hour.
"She's been working out very well," said Maj. Larry See, administrator of the warehouse. "I think we will end up hiring her."
Federal officials have high hopes for using community service to steer welfare recipients with few skills and little work experience into jobs, the main objective of the welfare legislation that President Clinton signed into law in August. Advocates of this approach say that at the very least, community service imparts a sense of what it is like to hold a job.
At least 100,000 welfare recipients are already doing these jobs because some states, including Ohio, established community service programs well before the new welfare law was passed. As more recipients come up against the law's deadline to go to work, millions more could be taking community service jobs.
Under the new law, single people who are not rearing children, like Ms. Goodrich, lose their one welfare benefit, food stamps, if they are not working. And parents who are rearing children lose their principal benefit, their monthly check, if they are not working within two years.
Working or not, parents also face a five-year limit to their welfare checks, so by then they will need real jobs, for which community service will not qualify.
But the community service approach is controversial, and as states start experimenting with it they are looking to state and local governments with experience in such programs. Among them are Hawaii, Montana and Ohio, and in particular, Montgomery County, Ohio, of which Dayton is the hub.
Starting with a pilot program a decade ago, Montgomery County has moved thousands of welfare recipients into community service jobs; 1,150 of the county's 9,000 recipients now hold them. Views among officials and employers about these jobs without real paychecks are decidedly mixed.
It is not hard to find workers like Ms. Goodrich who profited from a community service assignment, or to find employers like the Salvation Army who consider it a useful way to try out a new worker before making a commitment. But critics say that making welfare recipients work without pay is counterproductive.
One sobering view is that of the man who has supervised the program here for six years. "I have no interest in it," said Stephen A. Rice, director of the Montgomery County Department of Human Services.
Mr. Rice maintains that community service rarely prepares welfare recipients for, or leads them to, the paying jobs they will have to get after five years. "Our goal is getting people into paid employment so they can get out of poverty," he said, adding that community service is useful only when the worker is given schooling and vocational training.
Many people who deal with labor force issues share the ambivalence found in Montgomery County. Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said of people like Ms. Goodrich, "As a citizen, I agree with the general public that it is better that this woman be doing something."
But he added, "It's going to be labor of a very particular type -- the least capable and the least flexible -- because the most flexible will find jobs in the private sector."
In New York and some other major cities, union officials say the community service approach gives public employers, particularly, an incentive to replace union workers with people on welfare. But here in Dayton, there has been little resistance by unions because the community service jobs are generally new and part time, and have been performed in the past by volunteers.
In many cases, the number of hours that community service workers are expected to put in is determined by dividing the $4.75 hourly minimum wage into the amount of their monthly welfare check. So a mother who receives a monthly check of $300, for example, would work 63 hours a month -- far less than the $800 she would earn in a full-time paid job at the minimum wage.
Montgomery County has rock-bottom unemployment, a condition conducive for even the least-skilled workers to find real jobs. Major See of the Salvation Army said that he had four minimum-wage openings in clothes-sorting and thrift shop services, and that after three months the workers would receive health benefits and life insurance.
But in communities where real jobs are not so plentiful, or where many jobs could evaporate the next time the economy takes a downturn, public officials worry that community service workers who are the least qualified even in good times will come up against the five-year limit, lose their benefits and be ill-prepared to compete for real jobs with other unemployed workers.
Like Ms. Goodrich, Tawnya Lambert, a 28-year-old single mother of four, is using community service as a bridge to real work. She is a community college student and a community service cook at St. Paul United Methodist Church in Dayton, which employs about 15 such workers.
"I got pregnant with my first child when I was 18," Ms. Lambert said. "I worked at an ice cream cone factory until the month before I had him. I was going to a medical clinic where someone said, 'You should apply for welfare.' I got all the benefits because I had quit work. It was an easy way to have money -- you didn't have to do anything."
After she had her second child, Ms. Lambert said she started helping out at the church, which provides services that include day care and meals for children like hers. Four years ago, the welfare office told her she would have to work, she said, adding, "It made me think, 'I can get a job and make more money.' "
Joan Johnson, the church administrator, called Ms. Lambert "a very talented person," but added, "I'm scared for these people." Ms. Johnson said that with community service and so many young children, Ms. Lambert could not carry the full load in college that would lead to a degree and a well-paid job before she reached the five-year time limit.
The church has been able to hire a few former community service workers, like William Slade, 45, who became a full-time custodian at $5.25 an hour after his predecessor quit.
Still, Ms. Johnson said, many welfare recipients the county sends her never show up, cannot cope or may never be able to hold a regular job.
"Many cannot work," Ms. Johnson said. "We're a church -- we help people. But there are people with fried brains. I don't want them flipping my hamburgers."
Other charitable organizations here and in other states have refused to hire community service workers, saying they work at dead-end jobs.
For example, Catholic Charities USA in Alexandria, Va., which represents a network of 1,400 private social service agencies, has been reluctant to take in welfare recipients because it also wants Government aid to train them for real work.
"It's kind of a moral dilemma," said Sharon M. Daly, head of social policy for Catholic Charities. "People should be paid, and paid enough to meet their needs. But our attitude has changed because the law has changed, and our clients don't have any choices."

HEADLINE: Growing Latin Market Creates New Battleground of Cable TV

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 11

 BODY:
With more than 450 million potential viewers, Latin America offers a cable television market ripe for the plucking, and with that idea in mind, CNN began giving Latin Americans news around the clock in their own language in mid-March. But there is a complication: CBS already provides such a service, as do networks based in Mexico, Brazil and Spain.
Cable television may have arrived late and only patchily to the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking world. But rising incomes, the introduction of satellite dishes and the proliferation of 24-hour-a-day news services have transformed Latin America into one of the world's most contested pay-television markets, pitting networks based in the United States against indigenous rivals. 
 At stake is dominance of an area that already has almost as many households with television, nearly 90 million, as the United States and is experiencing a dizzying expansion as a growing middle class embraces cable and satellites and the news and entertainment they offer.
With the Latin American pay-television market expected to generate at least $2.5 billion annually in advertising revenue and subscriber fees by the turn of the century, broadcasters say it is imperative to establish a presence now.
"We feel the marketplace has matured to the point that a 24-hour-a-day operation makes sense both journalistically and financially," said Eason Jordan, executive vice president of International CNN, a unit of Time Warner Inc. "Latin America is an awfully big place, where the cable and satellite marketplaces are growing extraordinarily rapidly, advances in technology and systems of distribution have created new opportunities, and most countries, with the notable exception of Brazil, speak the same language."
CNN en Espanol, which went on the air March 17, is the Atlanta-based network's first venture into round-the-clock news programming under its own name in a language other than English. But the field is crowded: CBS, for instance, has been in the market almost a year, having bought Telenoticias in mid-1996 from a consortium that included Reuters, Telemundo and the Antena 3 network of Spain. CBS is owned by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
But the American entrants face competitors who argue they have a longer track record or greater familiarity with the Spanish-language news market. These include Eco, a nine-year-old, all-news subsidiary of Mexico's powerful Televisa group, and TVE, a news, information and entertainment channel operated by the Spanish Government, as well as Canal Sur, which rebroadcasts news programs from every major Latin America country, and Univision, the Miami-based Spanish-language network whose news and magazine programs are widely seen.
In addition, several companies are about to start Portuguese-language services aimed at Brazil, the region's biggest country, with a population upward of 160 million and a cable market that is growing by 60,000 households a month. Both CBS Telenoticias and Eco expect to begin broadcasting sometime this year, which will put them in direct competition with a news channel offered by Rede Globo, Brazil's leading network and a partner with Time Warner in a new Portuguese-language educational network scheduled to go on the air this summer.
Thus far, none of the channels are making money, not even Eco, which has been on the air since September 1988 and says it does not expect to turn a profit until 2000. But in a part of the world where illiteracy is still high and new entrants into the middle class are eager to consume, broadcasters say television offers opportunities other media do not.
According to a study published last month by Audits and Surveys, a New York media research company, the number of households in Latin America with cable or satellite television jumped last year to 14.2 million from 10.9 million in 1995, a 30 percent increase; in Brazil, the increase was elevenfold. In addition, nearly 30 percent of all Latin American subscribers belong to what the study described as "the highest socio-economic level."
CNN executives noted that some of the largest American, Japanese and European advertisers, eager to reach the Latin American audience with a single buy instead of fragmenting their budgets among 20 different countries, have been quick to sign on to the concept. CBS Telenoticias, which says it reaches 10 million households in 18 countries, sees its future lying in the same direction.
"The pie is so huge that we are going to see new budgets created by the big advertisers," Francisco de la Torre, a former Pepsico Foods executive who is now president of CBS Telenoticias, predicted. "Either everyone is crazy or everyone sees a tremendous opportunity that has yet to be exploited."
For CBS in particular, the Latin American market offers a rare second chance to make up for missed opportunity, and at a relatively cheap price. In the United States, CBS moved early into cable, but was soon overtaken by its competitors.
"We recognized right away that with CNN and MSNBC out there, getting into the English-language news business was an invitation to disaster," said Lloyd Werner, executive vice president for sales and marketing for CBS Cable. Latin America, in contrast, he said, was "an untapped market."
By buying Telenoticias in a complicated deal that saw Telemundo buy out Reuters and Antena 3 before selling the network to CBS, "we avoided the start-up costs and stutters" associated with a new operation, Mr. Werner said. According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, CBS acquired Telenoticias for $5 million in cash and a $1.25 million five-year note.
Even without showing a profit, however, the news channels have clearly already transformed the way news is covered and watched in Latin America. In the past, the first thing any would-be dictator did during a coup was to seize control of the local television and radio stations.
"Today, with the proliferation of new technologies and channels, that sort of blockage and censorship of the news is impossible," said Rosental Calmon Alves, a professor of journalism at the University of Texas College of Communications who specializes in Latin America. "In some cases, it is obvious that the coverage of these news channels is more efficient and independent than that of the local channels."
Already, though, the battle to deliver news to Latin America's middle class has claimed a big-name casualty. NBC's Canal de Noticias, based in Charlotte, N.C., ceased broadcasting April 1 after nearly four years of low ratings.
An NBC spokesman, George Jamison, said that while "obviously you always pay close attention to the actions of potential competitors," the decision to shut down Canal de Noticias was "not a direct result" of CNN's entry into the field. Rather, he said, after the opening of the MSNBC English-language news channel last year, "it didn't make any sense for us to operate a much smaller niche service."
But articles in magazines and newspapers throughout Latin America, as well as executives at rival networks, said Canal de Noticias was too American. "Canal de Noticias was nothing more than a translation service that piggybacked onto NBC News, using the same stories and the same set," said Felix Cortes Camarillo, president of Eco.
Mr. Cortes added that he doubted that all of the channels now competing in the Spanish-language news market could survive. But he expressed confidence that his network could hold its own against the two American giants.
"There's no more news than what happens, and we all have access to the same news," he said. "What's different is the angle of vision. We speak the language, and when I say that, I'm not talking about Spanish so much as a point of view."
But CBS Telenoticias, which is based here, bills itself as the one truly regional network, proudly noting that its 12 anchors hail from 8 countries and that it has reporters and producers representing every country in Latin America. "We are the only ones taking a pan-Latin American approach, and being based in the city that is the crossroads of Latin America, we have access to the best talent and all the important newsmakers," said Ricardo Brown, a Cuban-American who is the network's news director.
CNN en Espanol, in turn, appears to be emphasizing the value of its brand name and its franchise as the world's most widely seen provider of news via cable. "We adhere to CNN standards and quality, adding a Latin American focus," said Rolando Santos, a Mexican-American journalist who oversees the channel. "We don't translate. We are a wide-ranging, full-service network."
Its jabs at its American rivals notwithstanding, Eco carries baggage of its own. Televisa, its parent company, is widely regarded throughout Latin America as the television mouthpiece of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, Mexico's ruling party for nearly 70 years, and its newscasts have been criticized as lacking the impartiality that both the American networks are using as a selling point.
"It is true" that in the past there has been "some contamination" of official Mexican Government views, Mr. Cortes acknowledged. That has changed because "the Mexican political system has been altered" in recent years, he said.
The opportunity to reach the rapidly growing Hispanic market in the United States and also 40 million people in Spain only adds to the appeal for all the competitors. About 1 of every 10 Americans, or more than 27 million people, are estimated to be of Hispanic descent.
Already, though, the Hispanic market in the United States has more disposable income than any country in Latin America except Brazil and Mexico, which makes it especially attractive to broadcasters and advertisers alike. CBS Telenoticias began separate programming aimed at the United States on March 17, the same day that CNN en Espanol went on the air.
Although United States cable operators are reluctant to give up a slot to a channel that has no hope of appealing to a majority of viewers, with the prospect of more openings materalizing soon, CNN plans eventually to follow CBS's lead.

HEADLINE: Arizona Governor Facing Trial on Fraud and Extortion

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

DATELINE: PHOENIX, May 11

 BODY:
Barring a last-minute plea-bargaining agreement, Gov. Fife Symington will go on trial here on Tuesday on 22 charges of fraud, lying and extortion, the second of Arizona's chief executives to be accused of felonious wrongdoing in less than a decade.
Mr. Symington, once a fast-rising star in the Republican Party, as well as one of Arizona's highest-flying land developers, is accused of misleading and financially muscling lenders in a desperate effort to shore up a multimillion-dollar real estate empire that went bankrupt in the grinding recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's. 
 If convicted, he could be sent to prison for scores of years.
A blueblooded descendant of a long line of wealthy businessmen and public servants -- his great-grandfather, Henry Clay Frick, made a fabulous fortune in steel, and a cousin, Stuart Symington, was a power in the United States Senate and a Presidential candidate -- the Governor contends that he is the victim of an overzealous Federal investigation.
He insists he is innocent and could never have committed the wrongs of which he is accused, not even in the freewheeling, live-and-let-live world of sunny, booming Arizona.
"I intend to fight," has been his mantra ever since his indictment a year ago after a five-year investigation by Government agents.
On a shelf in his office he has prominently placed a bumper sticker that proclaims: "Never Give Up. Never. Never. Never. Never."
Government lawyers contend that Mr. Symington, in the years leading up to his run for Governor and then in the early years of his first term, lied repeatedly to lenders about his assets and liabilities to persuade them to give him money to keep a string of foundering shopping centers and office parks afloat.
At one point, the prosecutors say, he fraudulently claimed to be worth $12 million when, in fact, he was $24 million in debt. At another point, they say, he threatened to steer tenants, including state government agencies, away from an office development operated by one lender. His intent, as the prosecutors tell it, was to extort from the lender better terms for the repayment of a $10 million loan.
It is a crime under Federal law to make false or misleading statements about a financial deal that involves money passing through a federally insured financial institution. Some of the institutions Mr. Symington dealt with over the years were federally insured.
The Governor says not only that he expects to beat the Government's charges, but also that come 1998 he will run for a third term in the office he won in 1991 after Gov. Evan Mecham was impeached and driven from the job.
Mr. Mecham was accused of accepting an illegal campaign loan. He was eventually acquitted, though not until after he had been forced from office.
Mr. Symington, freed without bond immediately after his arrest, thus far has managed to fend off all impeachment and recall efforts and in the interim has been notably active in pushing through a moderate-to-conservative agenda of tax cuts, social programs and environmental measures. But his standing with voters has nevertheless fallen steadily, to the point that only 1 in 3 now gives him a "good" approval rating, and he still must face his greatest challenge in his 51 years: the jury trial that will begin in Federal District Court here at 9:30 A.M. on Tuesday.
Though both the Governor and prosecutors say they will be in court that morning, rumors of plea bargaining that could head off a trial have been swirling in Phoenix for weeks. Neither side will comment on whether a bargain has ever been broached for discussion.
If a bargain is struck, it presumably would spare scandal-weary Arizonans some of the embarrassment of having their top elected official in the dock. Still, such a bargain might very well include a requirement that Mr. Symington resign, a development that would cause huge political and administrative turmoil in a state that is ever trying to put on its best face to draw in new faces, new business and new money.
Mr. Symington's indictment has already stirred considerable political turmoil, with a fairly large crop of possible gubernatorial candidates gathering in the wings.
And once his trial begins, some administrative turmoil almost certainly will follow because the Governor will be required to spend most of his working days in court rather than in his office a few blocks away.
Prosecutors estimate it could take three months or more to hear the case, given all the paperwork they plan to introduce. They say they and their investigators looked over more than a million documents in preparing for the trial.
"The bottom line is, we're ready," one member of the Government team, David Schindler, declared the other day.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Remains Hostile to Census Sampling

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Republican leaders in Congress have hardened in their opposition to the use of statistical sampling to arrive at final population figures in the next census, setting up a probable showdown with the White House on an issue of huge political and social importance.
A letter this week to Martha Farnsworth Riche, the census director, voiced opposition to "statistical schemes that compromise accuracy for the sake of economy" and questioned the constitutionality of sampling, which the bureau wants to use three years from now. 
 The letter was signed by Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader, Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, majority leader.
"We must physically count each and every American," the letter said, pledging enough money to do that, without specifying an amount.
Dr. Riche replied in writing on Thursday that "it is fruitless to continue trying to count every last person with traditional census methods of physical enumeration." The Census Bureau wants to count 90 percent of the households in a given area, then use that data to calculate what the remaining 10 percent would presumably be like.
The Republicans' hard-line stance against that technique, outlined even as a compromise on the issue was supposedly being reached in the Senate, and Dr. Riche's reply highlighted a fight over constitutional questions, billions of dollars and the political fortunes of parties and individuals.
Many political analysts say that sampling would help Democrats and hurt Republicans, because it would tally members of minority groups and poor people who might otherwise go uncounted.
If that happened, the reasoning goes, legislative districts would be reconfigured to account for the newly counted people, who would almost surely vote Democratic. So Republicans, who waited four decades to regain control of the House, might have practical as well as constitutional reservations about sampling.
Local officials, especially big-city mayors who depend on Federal and state aid based on their communities' populations, also tend to favor statistical sampling.
The census director took issue with the Republican letter writers' assertion that "despite criticism, the 1990 census was the most accurate in history." In fact, she said, the 1990 census was the first to miss more people than the previous census. "It failed to count millions of Americans in urban and rural communities across the country," she said.
Census officials have estimated that the 1990 census undercounted the population by 1.6 percent, versus a 1.2 percent undercount in 1980.
The White House has said that President Clinton would veto any measure that bars the Census Bureau from using sampling. A White House spokesman, Barry Toiv, said on Thursday that there was nothing new in the Administration's stance.
"The Census Bureau and Commerce Department are confident that there will be greater confidence as people gain a greater understanding," Mr. Toiv said. He said the Senate might have cleared the way for "a good public debate."
As the Senate completed work on Thursday on a $5.5 billion disaster-aid bill, meant in part to help victims of flooding in the Middle West, it approved an amendment blocking the Census Bureau from making any "irreversible plans" to use sampling in the year 2000. The House will also vote on the sampling issue.
Although the wording in the Senate amendment was softer than that in a previous measure (the Senate Appropriations Committee had urged that the Census Bureau be forbidden to spend any money even planning for sampling), the Republican leaders who wrote to Dr. Riche seemed more adamant than ever.
If sampling does not work well or is ruled invalid, the Republicans' letter asserted, "the result will be chaos in government, uncertainty for voters, lawsuits lasting for the better part of a decade."
The Constitution refers to an "actual enumeration" of the population, and the Supreme Court has not ruled on whether statistical sampling is constitutional. The Republicans' letter warned that, if the census for 2000 uses sampling and the High Court later declares it unconstitutional, several billion dollars and incalculable work would have gone to waste.
Dr. Riche said that several lower Federal courts had upheld sampling and that the Justice Department had issued three opinions affirming its constitutionality and legality. These were handed down under the Presidencies of Jimmy Carter, George Bush and Bill Clinton, she said.
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York City Democrat, reflected the stakes of her party and her city on Thursday when she called sampling "critically important to New York" and the basis of "a fair, accurate census."
But political considerations do not follow a script. Six years ago, a Southern Congressman wrote to Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, arguing that the 1990 census figures for his state should be adjusted upward to make up for "the admitted undercount." The Congressman was Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia.

The Clintons' Caribbean: TV, a Pool and Time Off

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

DATELINE: BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, May 11

 BODY:
For Bill Clinton, one of his closest aides once explained, "words are actions."
That, as much as his crutches and a sore back, may explain why Mr. Clinton was so exhausted by his talk-filled Latin American tour, before he finally got a day off today with his wife, Hillary, on this prim little island. 
 All the extravagant toasts and polite speeches, all the summit palaver and the pauses for interpretation, and all the joint agreements frosted with sugary items about protecting tiny dolphins and providing advice on electric vehicles, had clearly worn down even this notoriously loquacious President. Twice in recent days he has felt uncharacteristically compelled to say, "Most of what needs to be said has been said" -- and then to say less himself than anyone expected.
Today, the public chatter stopped. The Clintons are staying until Monday in Heron Bay, the borrowed 25-acre estate of British aristocrats, where the trees are labeled ("Breadfruit," "Sago Palm Coconut," "Pride of India") and the pool is guarded by statues of cherubs. As the sunlight glittered on the sapphire sea, President Clinton elected to relax today by watching basketball on television.
 
A Journalism Cease-Fire
For the United States and the countries he has visited, the lingering question, of course, is whether the piles of words President Clinton and his counterparts deposited during his three-nation swing will simply blow away, leaving nothing behind.
As a result, President Clinton was bombarded with skepticism by the American and regional press corps all week.
At a news conference on Thursday in Costa Rica, a Central American journalist asked if Mr. Clinton's summit meetings, apart from discussion of trade issues, "should not be considered as social events with rhetorical results that have nothing to do with reality"
It may not be surprising that President Clinton said they should not. He pointed out that he had promised to help train Central American law enforcement officers, and to help improve education and preserve the environment. "In addition to that, as you know, we still have some modest aid programs," he said.
Then he moved on to the next questioner. The journalist, an American, quoted an unidentified State Department official as saying that when it came to immigration issues, Mr. Clinton was offering only "words and promises and hot air." He wondered if that was so.
Here, in paradise, the press scrutiny has subsided somewhat, though. Outside the camera frame, some network correspondents are wearing shorts with their shirts and ties; during a briefing by high-level Administration officials on Saturday evening, the television sets flanking the podium showed not CNN but "Xena: Warrior Princess."
 
B-Word Makes a Comeback
Some of Mr. Clinton's words have certainly proved enduring in this region, although their precise meaning remains elusive. During the trip, foreign leaders, eagerly seeking a connection with the American President, ventured a suspicious number of metaphors regarding a certain feature of infrastructure.
P. J. Patterson, the Prime Minister of Jamaica and chairman of Caricom, a regional economic association, informed Mr. Clinton on Saturday that "the people of the Caribbean wish to cross that bridge with you."
During a speech welcoming Mr. Clinton in San Jose, President Jose Maria Figueres Olsen of Costa Rica made an even more explicit homage to Mr. Clinton's relentlessly repeated campaign theme.
"We have decided to call this encounter, 'Bridge to the 21st Century,' " he said, as a some members of the White House press corps shuddered.
 
Cheat Sheets Save the Day
Speaking of speaking, listeners sometimes wonder how those American leaders breeze their way through tricky foreign names in their speeches
A clue to the technique was provided by the text prepared for a speech by Hillary Rodham Clinton in San Jose, Costa Rica. The text began by acknowledging the first lady of Costa Rica and others: "Mrs. Figueres [Fee-Gay-Raise], President Iglesias [Ee-glay-see-ahs], Mark Schnieder. . . ."
It may be because Mr. Clinton so rarely refers to his texts that his Spanish pronunciation remained rocky all last week, beginning with the Americanized "Saludos amigos," which brought scattered chuckles at an arrival ceremony in Mexico City on Tuesday.
But the President did not experience the kind of difficulty faced by the Mexican officer who presented troops for his review that day. After dashing across a field to bellow a request to start the parade, the officer got as far as "William J." before apparently forgetting the President's last name. He sputtered and gave up.
"Did you see how hard he had to run?" Mr. Clinton asked later. "I would have forgotten my own name."
 
The Original 'Tough Love'
Despite his exchange student's level of earnestness about the countries he has visited on this trip, Mr. Clinton has not been above poking fun at his own initiatives back home. Touring the anthropology museum in Mexico City on Monday, he considered the impact on childhood development, one of his pet issues, of flattening infants' skulls, a practice of one ancient culture there.
"It depends whether you read to them and sing to them while you're squeezing their heads," he mused.
The museum tour came long before Mr. Clinton was worn down by the week's worth of speechifying. He was still spry enough to concoct some hypothetical words for a mother to say: " 'I'm squeezing your head,' " he suggested. " 'I love you. I'm squeezing your head because I love you.' "

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
As tourism stagnates, Hawaii fights back with a campaign to invigorate its image.

BYLINE: By Daniel M. Gold

 BODY:
THERE is trouble in paradise, at least in getting people to visit.
As a state, Hawaii is not yet 38 years old, but as a tourist magnet it is into a "mature product phase." That dry-eyed assessment comes not from jealous travel officials of other Pacific Rim destinations, but from the research department of the state's very own Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau. 
 The phenomenal popularity Hawaii once took for granted -- until the 1980's, the number of tourist visits was doubling every five years -- has cooled, with growth much slower and, in some segments, stagnant.
According to the bureau, total annual tourist spending tumbled in the years following its peak of $10.63 billion in 1991, dipping as low as $8.67 billion in 1993 before slowly climbing back. Preliminary estimates for 1995, the last year for which data are available, is now $11 billion. But the tepid rise is bad news for an economy in which one in three jobs is directly tied to tourism.
Moreover, while slippage from one market in recent years had been offset by growth in others, last year was different. "A few months ago, we started noticing that either the increase in business was not as strong as it had been, or a decrease," said Roberta Rinker-Ludloff, the bureau's vice president for marketing. "It was a wake-up call."
So, Gov. Ben Cayetano sought and won $10 million from the state Legislature in emergency financing for marketing and advertising. The first results of that call to arms began running last month nationally on cable channels like CNN, Discovery, A & E and Lifetime and on spot broadcasts in such key cities as Chicago and New York. The spots end with a telephone number (1-800-GOHAWAII) and Internet address (http://www.gohawaii.com) where travel planners may be requested.
The campaign, which has also included eight-page inserts in newspapers in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas and Denver, "is a big step forward compared to what we have done in the last few years," Ms. Rinker-Ludloff said.
Until the 1990's, the islands enjoyed almost uninterrupted growth as a tourist destination, but have since stumbled. "We've been in a slump since the Persian Gulf war," said Chuck Y. Gee, the dean of the University of Hawaii's School of Travel Industry Management.
The peaks for Hawaii's tourist trade were mostly set earlier this decade, some as much as seven years ago. Indeed, 1990 holds the record for total arrivals: nearly 7 million, with 4.7 million of those "westbound" tourists -- that is, travelers coming from the United States or other points east. By 1995, the total had fallen to 6.6 million, of whom 3.9 million were westbound. Preliminary estimates for 1996 are slightly higher for total visits, but westbound remains flat.
As the westbound visits have fallen, the good news has come from eastbound tourists. Of 2.7 million eastbound arrivals in 1995, 2 million were from Japan.
Even there, the immediate future is not bright: the state had been projecting up to 6 percent growth in Japanese visits this year. But citing the soft Tokyo stock market and weakness in the yen and Japanese consumer confidence, it recently revised the projection to zero growth.
To reinvigorate the state's image, the "We are Hawaii" campaign, which is produced by the Hawaiian office of Ogilvy & Mather, a unit of the WPP Group, tries to cover a lot in 45-second and 60-second spots.
Over shots from all six of Hawaii's main islands -- Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai and the Big Island -- a female narrator invokes Hawaii's Polynesian culture, recounting the legend of the islands' creation. The spots also mix glimpses of activities like horseback riding and kayaking with more conventional images of Waikiki Beach and luaus. The campaign's tag line is "The Islands of Aloha."
To Dean Gee, the challenge is to keep Hawaii as a top possibility when tourists consider vacation sites. "It's not quite like selling a can of beans, which comes with a certain degree of predictability," he said.
For example, the commercials must appeal to at least two specific segments of visitors: those from the Midwest and East Coast who take longer trips -- an average of 10 days -- because of the length of time it takes to travel there; and those from the West Coast, especially Californians, who have used Hawaii as a getaway for shorter vacations.
The campaign is also trying to pitch to both the first-time visitor -- a segment the bureau found had seen a "dramatic decline" in the last 10 years -- and the repeat customer.
"We are trying to stimulate travel through and to all the islands," said Frank Haas, managing director of Ogilvy & Mather Hawaii. That, he said, was the thought behind the tag line: "The islands suggest the diversity of experiences to be had; aloha tries to convey the hospitality of the people."
"The competitive stakes have been raised," he said. "The people we're trying to reach might also be thinking of taking a cruise, or going to Mexico, the Caribbean or Europe.
"We have to encourage people to take longer trips, explain that they shortchange themselves when they only take five days. Diversity and aloha works for both of those markets: For the East Coast, the diversity and aloha justifies the trip, and for the West Coast consumer who thinks 'I've been there, done that,' we are saying, 'Wait, you haven't.' "
Actually, the North American campaign is just the first of two the bureau is undertaking this year, and the lesser of the two at that. A $6 million campaign for Japan, to be handled by Hakuhodo Inc. in Tokyo, will begin later this month.
That campaign gets more state financing, Ms. Rinker-Ludloff said, because "we need to catch up a bit in Japan."
Most Japanese tourists seldom leave Oahu in their Hawaiian trips, so that campaign will also push the idea of visiting more than one island. "The overall theme will still be on Hawaii," she said, "but we want to start educating them on the uniqueness of each island."
Finally, Ms. Rinker-Ludloff said, the presentations about the campaign served as an education for state legislators, some of whom either were not convinced that the state needed promotion or felt that the job was best left to the private sector. "Our message to the legislature in trying to obtain funding was that we need to look at funding as an investment, not an expense, and that there will be a return for this investment," she said.

HEADLINE: The Internet as Commerce: Who Pays, Under What Rules?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Names and handshakes, it would seem, are simple matters of identification and etiquette. But the digital equivalents of names and handshakes are now subjects of fierce debate, international negotiations and accusations of corporate skulduggery. The bedrock issue is who will determine the commercial rules of the road on the Internet, as the global web of computer networks increasingly becomes a mainstream medium of communication and commerce.
At stake, industry executives and Government officials say, is the future of the Internet, and what role large corporations, governments and international organizations will play. 
 The current arm-wrestling centers on two seemingly arcane subjects: assigning "domain names," or suffixes like ".com" in Internet addresses, and "peering," in which Internet service companies exchange electronic-mail messages with each other free. Proposed changes in both practices have caused an uproar on the Internet in the last few weeks.
Yet the particular disputes, Internet professionals agree, are the beginning of a host of thorny business and public policy issues that lie ahead, affecting not only companies but the price and availability of services in cyberspace.
"How these issues are resolved will determine how we do things and how we live with this new technology," said Don Heath, president of the Internet Society, a nonprofit organization in Reston, Va.
The evolutionary path of the Internet as a whole may be uncertain, but two trends appear inevitable.
First, the Federal Government will become increasingly involved in the affairs of the Internet, even if that role is more as a referee than as a regulator. Second, the business of supplying Internet access is headed for a shakeout, with big, well-financed corporations more and more supplying businesses and households with links to the Internet.
The dispute over "peering" -- the digital handshake and swapping of messages between Internet companies -- illustrates both trends. The issue emerged in the last two weeks after Uunet Technologies Inc., a unit of Worldcom Inc. and a leading supplier of Internet "backbone" connections, informed 13 smaller Internet service providers that it would no longer exchange messages with them free and would start charging them fees. The move by Uunet brought an outcry from the smaller companies, which are typically regional suppliers of cyberspace connections to households and small businesses, and from some analysts, who called the tactic anti-competitive and discriminatory.
One vocal critic, David Holub, lost his job as president of Whole Earth Networks in San Francisco in a disagreement with his company's owner over how to handle the Uunet move. In a posting on an on-line forum for Net professionals last week, Mr. Holub argued that because the Internet is a public network, the backbone carriers, like Uunet, should have the same obligations as telephone common carriers to freely exchange messages.
"I am a proponent of some regulation in the Internet as soon as possible," he wrote. "I think this minimal level of regulation is critical to the Internet's open and unrestricted development."
The Internet service companies are all trying to reach an accommodation with Uunet either by negotiating affordable fees or making the investments in network capacity and equipment so Uunet will treat them as peers, freely exchanging messages at points around the country.
The Internet has spawned a libertarian, free-market ethos. Still, the Uunet experience has some Internet executives talking about an appropriate role for the Government, perhaps having the Federal Communications Commission provide the forum for public hearings to establish industrywide ground rules as it does in telecommunications. "That same kind of thing needs to happen," said Sandy Fitchet, vice president of CAIS Internet of McLean, Va.
In nearby Fairfax, Va., John Sidgmore, president of Uunet, views the change in his company's peer policy as a practical step in response to the growth in the Internet business. The practice with companies of all sizes dates back to the early 1990's when, he said, the Internet was "a smaller, gentler place."
Driving companies out of business, Mr. Sidgmore insists, is not his motive. But it is absurd, he adds, to expect a handful of backbone Internet companies like Uunet, which must invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year to build networks, to carry traffic in general free of charge.
To be treated as a peer, Mr. Sidgmore said, an Internet service company needs to have a high-speed national network and pay for connections with Uunet in four regional locations. "Anybody who wants to spend the money to do that can be a peer," he said.
The other backbone suppliers, analysts say, are likely to follow Uunet's lead. Five companies -- MCI Communications; Sprint; Uunet; BBN, a unit of the GTE Corporation, and ANS, a unit of America Online Inc. -- handle 80 percent of the nation's Internet traffic, estimates Gordon Cook, publisher of the Cook Report, a monthly newsletter. "These players are in a position to declare themselves the Internet, and it could mean the costs of access are going to go up sharply," Mr. Cook said.
And as the costs rise for Internet service companies, their ranks are expected to be winnowed sharply, from an estimated 3,000 today to fewer than 100 within five years. "The question is how much competition will result and what that will mean for consumers," said Mark Anderson, president of Technology Alliance Partners, a consulting firm.
The answer to that question is not clear-cut by any means. But it is clearly the kind of issue that will be watched closely from Washington.
The F.C.C. has so far taken few stands on Internet policy other than espousing general goals like promoting competition and innovation. One exception to that pattern was setting up a Universal Service Fund last week as part of the commission's overhaul of phone rates, with some proceeds going to equip schools and libraries with Internet connections.
Yet the Government's hands-off stance becomes less tenable as the Internet becomes an everyday necessity, a communications utility, for more and more people. And the advance of digital technology into telecommunications -- as voice, data and images are increasingly transmitted in the computer language of bits -- means that Government regulators will probably soon be pulled into the Internet business.
"Our approach has basically been that the Internet should not be regulated," said a senior F.C.C. staff member, who insisted on anonymity. "But that approach increasingly doesn't work in a world of convergence of telecommunications and computer technology."
The current spat over Internet domain names, oddly, is a byproduct of the Government's walking away from involvement with the Internet. The National Science Foundation, which used to run the Internet backbone, awarded a five-year contract in 1993 to a small company, Network Solutions Inc., to administer domain names. The Government contract expires next March, and the foundation has said it is getting out of the Internet business.
Instead, the Government is letting the Internet community -- an increasingly large, diverse and unruly group -- decide who should assign domain names. So far, it has been a bumpy process. A week ago, 57 companies and organizations signed a proposal for a new system of assigning Internet addresses presented by a group called the Internet Ad Hoc Committee, headed by Mr. Heath of the Internet Society. Among other things, the proposal calls for the addition of seven new domain suffixes, like ".store" and ".firm."
The proposal has supporters, but it has not yet been approved by many major high-technology corporations, including I.B.M. and the AT&T Corporation. The United States Government and the European Community have expressed reservations. Critics say the process should be slowed down and opened up to greater public discussion instead of embracing the plan of a self-appointed group of Internet old-timers.
A more authoritative international organization, some observers say, might be needed to serve the role of honest broker -- perhaps a quorum of governments.
Peter Harter, the global public policy counsel for the Netscape Communications Corporation, notes that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been studying the economic impact of domain names, and has been circulating a working document among its members. "The O.E.C.D. is a possible forum," Mr. Harter said.

HEADLINE: O'Connor, Seeing Housing as a Right, Calls for a Panel to Advise Lawmakers

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Calling "dignified affordable housing" a human right and a moral imperative, John Cardinal O'Connor urged state lawmakers yesterday to preserve the current rent regulation laws until a panel could examine changes that would not hurt the poor and middle class.
In a carefully worded sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral, the Cardinal acknowledged that the current system of rent regulations might be less than perfect. But he questioned the wisdom of replacing them "with either no system or an untried system" when they expire next month, especially in the supercharged political climate that surrounds the issue. 
 And while he did not pretend to offer solutions of his own, he said a broadly representative commission -- of landlords, tenants, the poor and the middle class from various racial and ethnic backgrounds -- should be convened to make recommendations to the State Legislature.
"It seems to me that government has a grave moral responsibility to meet the human needs and to help make possible the living out of the human rights of all its people to the best of its ability," said the Cardinal, who has often criticized cuts to welfare benefits.
"Who knows better what their needs really are or how well their human rights are given appropriate support than the people themselves?"
The comments by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York come as the opposing sides in Albany appear no closer to meaningful discussion and as Gov. George E. Pataki begins to promote a compromise plan. Landlord groups and other opponents of rent regulations had feared that a strong statement by the Cardinal in favor of the current system could weaken Senate Republicans, who have vowed to phase out the laws.
Joseph Strasburg, the president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the largest landlord group, indicated through a spokesman that he was more exasperated than worried about the Cardinal's position.
"With all due respect to his eminence, the issue has been studied over and over, and every reputable study has concluded with the need to abolish rent regulations," said the spokesman, Stephen Mangione.
"There are responsible ways to phase out regulations, and that's what we should be doing now. Small-property owners especially, whose expenses already outpace their income, cannot wait for two more years of studies."
But Michael McKee of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, who met with the Cardinal on Friday to make his case for keeping rent regulations, said he thought that the sermon was unequivocal enough that it would provide a boon for rent-regulation proponents.
"It's very clear that his position is that it would be immoral to allow these laws to expire," Mr. McKee said.
He added that tenant advocates would agree to take part in a process to examine the system and replace it as long as affordable housing was maintained.
"We believe rent regulation is the best and cheapest way to provide affordable housing," Mr. McKee said. "But we're very willing to sit down on a commission to look at other ways to do it."
The Cardinal used much of his time in his homily to explain why he had decided to weigh in on what has become the most politically charged debate in the state this year.
Reading from a prepared text of six printed pages, he used quotations from three popes, a Yale political scientist, a noted Catholic economist and the catechism to underscore his assertion that decent housing was a fundamental right. As such, he said, it would be morally wrong if governments did not work to insure it.
"Moral reasoning may not be helpfully separated from reality, particularly, in this case, economic and political reality," the Cardinal said. The question, then, from the church's perspective, was "startlingly simple," he said.
"Does the current system make it possible or impossible for everyone to live in dignified affordable housing?"
Cardinal O'Connor said that though he had pored over rent studies until late at night, he had come to no firm conclusions.
But in an indication that he tended to reject some of the arguments made by property owners, he criticized those who spoke of trade-offs, in which people should be willing to pay much more if they choose to live in certain parts of the city.
"That's morality and economics in a vacuum," he said. "What is to be traded off? Food, education, health care? These are human rights."
Throughout the sermon, he steered carefully away from commenting on the lawmakers involved in the issue, and did not even mention the State Legislature by name.
In the end, though, Cardinal O'Connor seemed acutely aware of the political strategies animating the debate. Calling for the current system to be extended, he added:
"Smarter people than I will know how such delay could be provided without forcing legislators to be seeming to abandon positions which they believe integrity requires them to have taken."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Rose 9.3% in March

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools jumped 9.3 percent in March from February, according to an industry survey released this weekend.
Orders from American companies for domestic and foreign-produced machine tools rose to an estimated $721 million in March from a revised $659 million in February, said a joint report from the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributor's Association. The increase was the third rise in estimated orders in the last four months. 
 Estimated March orders were 4.1 percent higher than the $683 million reported in March 1996.
Orders for the first quarter of 1997 totaled an estimated $1.9 billion, the groups said, up 11.5 percent from the corresponding quarter last year.
Analysts regard orders for machine tools -- used to shape and assemble metal in products ranging from diesel engines to dishwashers -- as a gauge of industrial output, investment and consumer demand.

A Great Wee Place

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland

 BODY:
I just visited Northern Ireland and I have some bad news: The status quo there is too comfortable.
Yes, the cease-fire between the factions broke down in February 1996, after 17 months of peace. But the truth is, the breakdown of the cease-fire has not really affected Northern Ireland much, because the I.R.A. has confined its bombings to England. As for life here in Belfast, well, McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken seem to be everywhere. While I was here, Prince Charles inaugurated the new $40 million Waterfront Hall opera house, where he and 2,500 guests paying $125 each were serenaded by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa. The Europa Hotel, Belfast's most oft-bombed building, recently signaled its optimism by removing from the lunch menu its famous "BLAST" sandwich (Bacon, Lettuce and Some Tomato)! And in recent years the authorities have replaced some of the ugly corrugated steel fences dividing Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods with what the locals call "designer walls" -- the sort of patterned brick wall you'd find around a gated community in Florida. 
 No Toto, this is not the Gaza Strip.
Or as one moderate Catholic professor here remarked to me: "Let's be honest, the middle classes here are doing very well." The dirty little secret of Ulster is that while it has become a metaphor for civil war, that war is actually confined to a few very small areas in Belfast and Derry, and the rest of Northern Ireland is downright beautiful. For those who know the secret, Ulster is now a metaphor for a "great wee place" to retire. Housing prices are cheap, golf is plentiful and public schools, social services, investment subsidies and roads are the best in Britain -- thanks to the money the British and the European Union pour in here. Unemployment is around 8 percent, far better than in France, Germany or Italy. And if per chance the I.R.A. does blow up your shop, the British will rebuild it free.
That's why I wonder whether Northern Ireland's cure and its disease aren't the same thing: the same economic development that produced the cease-fire (and still limits its breakdown) also cushions the factions and reduces the pressure on them to make the tough compromises needed to get beyond the cease-fire and secure a lasting peace. There is an all too tolerable balance here now between violence and affluence.
Lord knows I'm not rooting for Belfast to become Gaza or Soweto, but the fact is Rabin and Arafat, Mandela and de Klerk were produced in pressure cookers exerting great pain on their rank and file -- not by black-tie receptions and one-star Michelin restaurants (there are two in Belfast). In Belfast, political leaders can still afford to indulge their ideological fantasies. Gerry Adams, head of the I.R.A.'s Sinn Fein party, David Trimble, leader of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party, and Tony Blair, Britain's Prime Minister, all did better than ever in the last elections -- without having to promise any courageous initiatives to get peace talks going.
Successful peace talks would require Mr. Adams to take the risk of getting the I.R.A. to declare an open-ended cease-fire, without any guarantees about the timing and outcome of those talks. They would require Mr. Trimble to risk sitting down with Sinn Fein and negotiating a power-sharing arrangement with the Catholics. And they would require Mr. Blair's fracturing the bipartisan British consensus on Northern Ireland and negotiating with the I.R.A. before it turned in every weapon or gave ironclad assurances that the cease-fire wouldn't be broken again. All three would have to take these risks while their opponents denounced them for "selling out."
Maybe they will show such courage. But it won't be easy. The public longing here for peace is very real, but passive. Life here is already 85 percent normal and the political price for getting the last 15 percent is very high. It would require bringing into the peace process the hardest-core elements on both sides, such as the thousands of working-class Catholics and Protestants who still live in the pockets of very high unemployment, and for whom the Irish wars still burn white hot. The brutal murders last week -- a Catholic stomped to death by a Protestant gang in Portadown and a Protestant gunned down by Catholic guerrillas in a Belfast bar -- remind us how the pockets of abnormality here could still blow apart the web of normalcy. And such an explosion would really set back the chances for peace . . . or would it?

HEADLINE: Poor Residents in Louisiana Fight Plan for Chemical Site

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: CONVENT, La.

 BODY:
Emelda J. West said she believed that President Clinton was thinking of her when he signed an executive order on environmental justice in February 1994.
"I don't guess he knew I existed," Mrs. West said. "But he did have people like me in mind." 
 Now Mrs. West, who is 71, and other members of a local group, St. James Citizens for Jobs and the Environment, hope that the Clinton Administration will keep her in mind.
In March, the Tulane Environmental Law Clinic, on behalf of 19 environmental groups in Louisiana, asked the Environmental Protection Agency to use Mr. Clinton's order to reject a permit for a proposed chemical plant here, halfway between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. It was the first time that the environmental agency had been asked to reject a permit on grounds of environmental justice.
[The request by the citizens' group to the environmental agency was bolstered when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced on May 2 that it had denied a license to Louisiana Energy Services, which had sought to build an $855 million uranium-enrichment plant near Homer.
[The commission's action was the first time that a Federal agency had used Mr. Clinton's order on environmental justice to deny a license or permit. The commission also ordered its staff to investigate accusations that Louisiana Energy had purposely chosen to locate the plant in poor black neighborhoods.
["Certainly, the possibility that racial considerations played a part in the site selection cannot be passed off as mere coincidence," the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board said in a 91-page decision.]
The proposed $700 million chemical plant -- sought by Shintech, a subsidiary of the Shin-Etsu Chemical Company of Tokyo -- would produce polyvinyl chloride resin, which is used to make plastic products like pipes. The factory would be built on a 3,700-acre site that is now covered with foot-high rows of sugar cane.
In Houston, the controller of Shintech, Dick Mason, said Convent was the most remote of 30 sites that the company had considered. Mr. Mason said the company had chosen the site in St. James Parish because it is near the Mississippi River, rail lines and gas pipelines.
"We did not look at the racial or socioeconomic makeup of the area," he said.
The proposed project has divided this working-class parish of 21,000 residents. The parish is home to more than 12 plants that produce and ship fertilizers, petrochemicals, grains and metal products. The parish also has the third-highest level of industrial pollution in the state.
The parish president, Dale Hymel Jr., who favors the Shintech plant, said it would help alleviate poverty.
"We need to do something to deal with that," Mr. Hymel said. "And getting people a job is the best way I know."
Shintech, he said, would add 165 jobs in the parish.
An opponent of the plan, Pat Melancon, said the factories in the region had done little to help residents. Driving past dozens of ramshackle homes within miles of the Shintech site, she asked, "If these plants are so good for us, why don't we have more economic development here?"
In an area where per capita income is $7,259, Mrs. Melancon pointed to the 1990 Census, which showed that within five miles of the site, 80 percent of the residents are black and nearly 43 percent have incomes below the poverty level.
Mrs. Melancon said she believed that the E.P.A. would have to deal with the question of environmental justice. On April 3, the opponents received a favorable response from Samuel J. Coleman, a regional director in the compliance assurance division of the agency. In a letter to J. Dale Givens, the Secretary of the State Environmental Quality Department, Mr. Coleman said the issue of environmental justice should "merit your attention prior to permit issuance."
Although the state agency would have to issue the air-quality permit for the plant, the Federal agency can, under the Clean Air Act, overrule the state. But Federal officials conceded that they were unclear about what effect Mr. Clinton's order would have on the Shintech proposal.
"The E.P.A. has not defined what an environmental-justice community is," said a spokeswoman in the agency's Dallas office, Cheryl Hochstetler. "So we are waiting to see what is going to happen with this."
Ms. Hochstetler said the final decision on the Shintech permit, which is due by June 2, would be made by administrators in Washington.
The executive order says each Federal agency "shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission." The order requires agencies to identify and address the health and environmental effects of their policies on "minority and low-income populations."
Paul H. Templet, a professor of environmental studies at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said such vague wording, along with the support of Gov. Mike Foster, a Republican, put Federal officials in a difficult position.
"If they do overrule the state," Professor Templet said, "then they have the Congressmen to deal with, and that's a tough political call."
In any case, Mrs. West of the citizens' group said she believed that Federal officials would deny Shintech the permit it needed to build its plant a few miles north of the blue wooden house where she has lived for 50 years. "They will not locate here, darling," she said. "We have too many problems here already."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Victory, If No Ring, For Wells At Stadium

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Moments of perfection were scattered throughout Yankee Stadium yesterday, and they had little to do with the splendid sunshine, the blue skies or the hot pretzels, all pleasant touches. They had everything to do with David Wells, in a sharp 3-2 victory over the Royals, and with one more flashback to 1996, when the Yankees were more nearly perfect than any other major league team.
Wells enhanced the afternoon for the Yankees with a performance that was both economical and exemplary. He did not waste pitches while holding the Royals without a run until the eighth. And he did not let his empty ring finger or his empty heart deter him on a day when the Yankees were finally given their World Series championship rings and when Wells spent his first Mother's Day without his mom. 
 The zany left-handed pitcher made sure the focus immediately switched from the pre-game ring ceremony to his in-game pitching clinic. Deposit a quarter and watch Wells throw his fastball to get ahead in the count. Watch him stay ahead of the Royals and challenge them. Watch him retire hitters on feeble fly balls or strikeouts. Then watch Joe Torre reach for another roll of quarters.
"He doesn't complicate it for himself, which I think is a big problem with a lot of pitchers," said Torre, the Yankee manager. "They try to do too much. He's a throwback to: 'Here, hit it. I dare you.' It's a nice feeling. I'm very comfortable when I watch him pitch."
Torre was not alone in being comfortable as the Yankees marched to their 16th triumph in 21 games. Bernie Williams homered and slashed three hits, Derek Jeter drove in what amounted to the winning run off Jose Rosado with a double and Mariano Rivera nabbed his 13th save and his 10th in his last 10 chances.
Of course, Wells is always comfortable at the Stadium, where he won his third straight start to elevate his career record in the Bronx to 12-2, tying him with Bob Wickman (18-3) for the best winning percentage there (.857). Wells's pitching philosophy is simple: just throw strikes, which he has done with an astounding 227 strikes in 317 pitches in his winning streak.
"It's no fun pitching behind in the count," said Wells, who struck out six, walked one and allowed two runs in eight and one-third innings. "There's too many good hitters in this league to fall behind. You're going to get blasted out there. It just makes it a long day. The guys on the field are going to be like: 'Let's go. Let's get something going.' I think if you go strike one, strike two, it makes it that much easier."
It was a weird and emotional day for Wells. Weird, because he pitched for the Baltimore Orioles last season and therefore did not receive a World Series ring. Emotional, because it was Mother's Day and Eugenia Ann Wells died of a heart disease related to diabetes on Jan. 4 at the age of 58. Wells has a tattoo of his mother, a single parent who raised him to be independent and be an individual.
"She's in my heart every day," Wells said. "I always say a prayer to her every day when I go out to pitch. That feeling will never go away. My mom has always had faith in me and believed in me. That relaxes me."
Asked how tough yesterday was, Wells said: "Very tough. I got a job to do. You got to think about it. It's hard."
In typical Wells fashion, the pitcher bounced from serious to slapstick in seconds. When he was asked how it felt not to get a ring, he said: "I got a ball game to pitch, so I can't worry about that. When a guy turns his back, I'll steal his ring from him and have my own ring."
Three players who were instrumental in the Yankees' Series victory over the Atlanta Braves were instrumental yesterday. Jeter doubled home Tim Raines in the seventh inning to give Wells a 3-0 cushion, Williams bashed his second homer in two games with a 416-foot shot in the third and Cecil Fielder drove in the first run with a groundout in the first. Although three runs is not perfect, it seemed plenty for Wells.
Even after the Royals nicked Wells for three hits and two runs in the eighth and had the potential tying run on first with two out, he salvaged his masterpiece by striking out Jose Offerman with a sweet 1-2 fastball. After Wells notched the first out in the ninth, Rivera replaced him and allowed two base runners before securing the last two outs. Wells wanted perfection, as in a complete game, so he left grudgingly.
"I'm going to fight to stay in there," Wells said. "Joe was out there trying to pry the ball out of my hand. I wouldn't let it go."
 
INSIDE PITCH
The American League president, GENE BUDIG, who presented the Yankees with their championship rings, is not expected to rule until late next week on New York's two protests of its loss to Kansas City last Friday. . . . PAUL O'NEILL struck out four times for the first time since July 26, 1994.

HEADLINE: ENTERING DEBATE, GOVERNOR OFFERS RENT COMPROMISE

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 11

 BODY:
In his first attempt to broker a compromise on rent regulations, Gov. George E. Pataki today proposed lifting protections for a small number of wealthy tenants immediately and appeared to lay the groundwork for a broader plan to remove controls from apartments as they become vacant.
The proposals set a middle ground between Republicans in the State Senate who want to abolish the current rent regulations and Democrats in the Assembly who want to preserve them. 
 The Governor's decision to shift the debate toward the center by keeping some protections intact and to eliminate some that favor the wealthy offers legislators on each side a way to appease their constituents. The regulations expire at 12:01 A.M. June 16 unless they are extended.
Today's proposal is part of a more detailed Pataki plan that is expected to call for scaling back the regulations now restricting the rent on 1.1 million apartments, most of which are in New York City and its suburbs. Mr. Pataki said he would release the full plan on Monday, and his aides would not provide details beyond what was disclosed in his one-page statement released this afternoon.
In that statement, the Governor indicated that he supported continuing most rent protections. In the most telling sentence of his statement, the Governor broadly hinted at vacancy decontrol without using those words: "My plan to save rent control will ensure that every middle-class tenant has the right to remain in their apartment for the rest of their lives if they choose, protecting rent laws for about 99 percent of New York tenants."
A few hours before the Governor released his statement, John Cardinal O'Connor, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York, called for current laws to be extended until a new panel could recommend ways to maintain affordable housing in the city. [Page B6.]
In the Governor's sneak preview today, Mr. Pataki proposed expanding a policy known as luxury decontrol, which would lift protections for wealthy tenants. Currently, tenants who earn $250,000 or more for two consecutive years and live in apartments with monthly rates of $2,000 or more lose their protection. The Governor's plan would lower the income threshold to $175,000 a year, regardless of the rent.
He said his plan would protect nearly all the 2.7 million tenants living in rent-regulated apartments. "Only the top 1 percent of all tenants in rent-regulated apartments, those individuals making more than $175,000 annually who can afford to pay market rates, will be asked to do so," he said.
In outlining a framework under which the administration might embrace vacancy decontrol, a policy of lifting rent regulations on an apartment when a tenant leaves, the Governor also included penalties for landlords who try to harass tenants into leaving. In doing so, Mr. Pataki seemed to be acknowledging that allowing vacancy decontrol could result in many forced evictions, a fear often cited by tenant advocacy groups.
Mr. Pataki has supported vacancy decontrol in the past but has been silent on the issue in recent months.
Among the questions the Governor left unanswered is how vacancy decontrol might be phased in or whether he will maintain provisions like the so-called succession rule, which allows relatives of occupants to inherit rent-regulated apartments.
Governor Pataki's decision to step into the rent debate comes just two weeks after the state's Democratic Party began an advertisement campaign accusing both Mr. Pataki and his mentor, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, of avoiding the deregulation battle. In response, D'Amato, the state's Republican United States Senator, predicted that any resolution would maintain protections for middle-income and low-income residents.
 Mr. Pataki's plan was immediately criticized by tenant advocates and Democrats in the Assembly, who said that it would recklessly weaken protection for tenants. "The numbers released today in the Governor's nine-paragraph statement are simply unrealistic in today's economy," Sheldon Silver, the Speaker of the Assembly, said in a written statement. The Assembly Democrats, particularly those from New York City, have found themselves with little room to negotiate because so many of their constituents are affected by the rent regulations.
Billy Easton, the executive director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, attacked Mr. Pataki's call for expanding luxury decontrol, saying it was just another step toward the landlords' goal of deregulating all apartments. In noting that the Legislature had established the $250,000 income ceiling just four years ago, Mr. Easton expressed concern that this additional lowering would further weaken high-end protections.
Mr. Easton also said there was an obvious reason that the Governor mentioned penalizing landlords who try to harass tenants into leaving: He intends to support vacancy decontrol.
"The Governor has absolutely no reason to propose anti-harassment laws," Mr. Easton said, unless he also plans a proposal that would encourage harassment. "And that proposal would be some form of vacancy decontrol. I would love to be proven wrong on this tomorrow."
On the other side, landlords, who have the most to gain if the rent-regulation system is dismantled, said Mr. Pataki's plan did not go far enough. They pointed out that his statement suggested that most people living in rent-regulated apartments would continue to be protected so long as they remained there.
"I was a little disappointed that he seemed to be implying that there was no end in sight for rent regulations," said Dan Margulies, the executive director for the Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord group. "According to that statement, he is looking for lifetime rent laws."
One of the key questions left unresolved today was whether Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader who has been the main proponent of abolishing the regulations, would move to a more moderate position now that the Governor has taken a more specific stand. Mr. Bruno has called for phasing out regulations during the next few years for all tenants except the elderly, the poor and the disabled.
The position Mr. Pataki takes could seriously undercut Mr. Bruno, though many Democrats believe that the Senator is merely the Governor's stalking horse and that by taking an extreme position, he enabled the Governor to play the moderate with a proposal to eliminate some rent protections and to take credit for saving all the rest.
Mr. Bruno also issued a statement late this afternoon, commending the Governor for proposing further luxury decontrol. But he did not back away from his demands for an eventual abolition of the current regulations.
"The time is now to make changes that have long been overdue," he said. "We must have a gradual and reasonable transition away from rent regulations to an open, competitive housing market in New York City."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani praised the Governor's intervention, saying: "In the past he was trying to get the Assembly speaker and the majority leader to get this resolved. But by entering it he'll help put pressure on them."
One of the Democratic candidates trying to unseat Mr. Giuliani, Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger, urged today that the state give New York City residents a chance to vote on whether rent regulations should remain in force.

HEADLINE: Turning Intellect Into Influence;
Promoting Its Ideas, the Manhattan Institute Has Nudged New York Rightward

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
Amid the powerful conformist currents of midtown Manhattan, there is something unexpected about Myron Magnet's sideburns -- bushy white whiskers that billow out from his bespectacled face like something out of Dickens.
They began as an accident, he insists. He was studying at Cambridge University, living in a Tudor cottage with an unlighted wash basin in his room. One day, he noticed the overgrowth on his jowls. He says he figured, "What the hell?" 
 But that was 30 years ago, a visitor points out, puzzled.
Mr. Magnet shifts in his high-backed leather chair. Then he answers, slowly: "I value the past very much. I think it has an awful lot to teach the present. So I suppose it is a homage to the past."
Mr. Magnet is a member of the heterogeneous group of conservatives who make up the Manhattan Institute, a think tank that has pulled off the improbable feat of helping change the course of the country's most liberal big city. The institute has done as much as any group in recent years to challenge the rules by which New York was governed, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has done as much as any politician to move its ideas from the margin to the mainstream.
It was an early proponent of shrinking city government; it enabled Charles Murray to publish the 1984 book that many people believe begat welfare reform, and it promoted theories about crime and public disorder that later underlay the work of the former Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton.
It took up the question of the quality of life in New York City in 1990, well before Mr. Giuliani made that a cornerstone of his successful election campaign in 1993. The institute has savaged open admissions at the City University of New York, pushed hospital privatization and aggressively promoted school choice.
Now, its critique of rent control is helping to inform State Senator Joseph L. Bruno's move to phase out rent regulations, and its proposal for charter schools is circulating through legislative offices in Albany.
"It has been fabulously successful as a source of ideas and as a networking structure for conservatives and moderates in some cases," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "And it has had a terrific impact in putting some issues, which were long overdue, on the public agenda."
In a city in which most people strive to make their ideas matter (or, if not, to have their ideas appear as if they do), the 19-year-old public-policy organization has made itself a player in the public debate (and mastered the appearance of influence, too).
The phenomenon has few precedents in living New York memory: a group of eggheads and other lofty, think-tank denizens (of the conservative kind, no less) actually accumulating enough heft to enable politicians and much of the public to agree on a profound shift in direction.
A short-lived New York offshoot of the Rand Corporation worked closely with the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay in the late 1960's and early 70's on issues from rent control to Fire Department efficiency. But the role being played by the Manhattan Institute is something else.
"In New York, it has created a respectable place for people who disagree with the liberal establishment," said William J. Stern, who headed the state's Urban Development Corporation under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and is now a contributing editor of the institute's quarterly magazine, City Journal. "What that does is make it easier for politicians to advance those ideas. I think everybody in New York City politics now, in one way or another, has adopted some of the views of the Manhattan Institute."
Not unlike its ally, Mr. Giuliani, the institute is a conservative force come into some power in a liberal town, somewhat unorthodox, priding itself on pragmatism, fraternizing with the occasional Democrat and dismissing the labels invariably prefixed to its name.
It has become home to a range of species on the right-hand side of the political spectrum: market conservatives, social conservatives, old-style aristocratic conservatives, libertarians, as well as a few registered Democrats and a self-described liberal or two.
City Journal, edited by Mr. Magnet, who wrote a book on the legacy of the 1960's that Newt Gingrich professed to admire, was edited in the early 1990's by Fred Siegel, now a fellow of the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington, who was known to be supporting President Clinton at the time.
Many of the institute's board members, as well as its magazine, have backed the idea of school vouchers. But the institute's 8-year-old Center for Educational Innovation, which consumes one quarter of the $5 million institute budget, is officially opposed to vouchers.
"The institute is more ecumenical than it is often given credit for," said Walter Olson, an author and senior fellow. "There is a range of opinion, all of it dissenting in one way or another from what had been the New York establishment point of view."
The current list of 20 fellows includes Peter D. Salins, interim provost of the State University of New York; David Gelernter, the Yale computer scientist injured in a Unabom attack, and Richard J. Schwartz, a former senior adviser to Mr. Giuliani and the architect of the city's workfare program.
It also includes Diane Ravitch, a former United States Assistant Secretary of Education; Edward N. Costikyan, a former Manhattan Democratic leader who has advised Mr. Giuliani, and a handful of former public school administrators famous for having set up alternative schools in East Harlem in the 1980's. Another person who was affiliated with the institute was Elizabeth McCaughey, who was plucked from obscurity there by George E. Pataki in an ill-fated political alliance.
Currently housed in an unprepossessing warren on the second floor of a building near Grand Central Terminal, the institute was founded as a free-market education and research organization by William Casey, who then went off to head the Central Intelligence Agency in the Reagan Administration.
For 15 years, until 1995, it was run by William M. H. Hammett, widely characterized as a kind of "intellectual entrepreneur" -- brilliant but difficult, with what Mr. Siegel calls "a whim of iron" and a gift for placing smart bets on relatively obscure scholars with seemingly far-fetched ideas.
Its earliest preoccupation was supply-side economics. Then, in 1982, it offered $30,000 to Charles Murray, a little-known social scientist without a job, to write "Losing Ground," the book that contributed to welfare reform. It later sponsored two books, by Mr. Olson and Peter Huber, said by many to have stirred up the issue of liability reform.
The institute's mission is to develop ideas and get them into mainstream circulation -- with the help of "the media food chain," as the current president, Lawrence J. Mone, puts it. It does that by publishing and relentlessly promoting books and articles, and by inviting influential people to lunch.
It is adamant about working only with commercial publishers, instead of publishing its own books, as other policy groups do. The aim is to maximize the books' credibility, make sure they get reviewed and discipline institute-sponsored authors not to speak only to the converted. The institute also pours $700,000 a year into City Journal, filling it with long articles with titles like "Welfare's Next Vietnam" as well as photo essays and articles on culture intended, one former editor said, to make it appeal not just to businessmen but to businessmen's wives.
Ten thousand copies go out, free of charge, to mayors, journalists, academics, libraries and others, Mr. Magnet said. Another 3,000 are sold to subscribers or on newsstands. Not infrequently, articles end up condensed and reprinted in places like The Wall Street Journal.
"We let people have this stuff for free," Mr. Magnet said. "The only thing we want is credit."
Several times a month, the institute holds discreetly lavish public-policy lunches, often at the Harvard Club in midtown Manhattan, to which it invites hundreds of journalists, politicians, bureaucrats, business people and foundation staff members to hear a speaker on a subject the institute likes.
Susan V. Berresford, the president of the Ford Foundation, recently went. Tom Wolfe has been known to go. Late last month, about 150 people turned out beneath a chandelier the size of a small swimming pool in a ballroom of the Grand Hyatt Hotel in midtown to hear Mr. Giuliani speak.
There was Henry J. Stern, the City Parks Commissioner and an institute regular; Dan Biederman, president of the Grand Central Partnership, also a regular, and Joe Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission.
"It became a problem on our editorial page," said David Frum, formerly of The Wall Street Journal and now an institute fellow who does commentary on National Public Radio. So many people were disappearing simultaneously for institute events that the op-ed page editor had to crack down.
Mr. Giuliani and his campaign staff began meeting with institute members in 1992, and since that time have absorbed many of its ideas, particularly on such issues as the city's tax structure, economic development, education policy, policing and quality of life.
In mid-1992, the magazine published an issue on the quality of life -- full of articles on such subjects as "reclaiming public spaces" -- and Mr. Giuliani could be found seated in the audience at an institute-sponsored conference pegged to the issue, scribbling notes.
In a brief interview recently, Mr. Giuliani said he had found City Journal, in particular, "enormously helpful. I've read it for years, since it first came out. It has sparked a lot of the reanalysis, reinvention, reinvigoration of government. It produces provocative and very good ideas."
Alan G. Hevesi, the City Comptroller and a Democrat who has often differed sharply with Mr. Giuliani, recently found himself the speaker at an institute lunch. A former Queens College professor, Mr. Hevesi said later: "I don't agree with a lot of what the Manhattan Institute is all about, but I respect them."
"I think they're serious, they're students of government, they're not knee-jerk ideologues," he said. "I think they're valuable to the debate on policy in New York. These folks are not the moral equivalent of the freshmen in the Gingrich class in Congress. But in New York, they're quite conservative."

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Monday with an article about the influence of the Manhattan Institute misstated the headline of an article published in the institute's magazine last year. It was "Why Catholic Schools Work," not "Why Public Schools Work." A separate chart misidentified the company headed by John M. Hennessy, a trustee of the institute. He is chief executive of CS First Boston, not CS First Bank of Boston.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The Manhattan Institute has turned its conservative agenda into public policy by networking with leaders in several fields, and though its quarterly magazine, City Journal, whick is edited by Myron Magnet.

Chart: "An Example: Shaping Public Policy"
When school overcrowding became a hot topic in political circles last year, the Manhattan Institute sought to influence the debate by suggesting one solution.
 
JULY 1996: In the summer 1996 issue of City Journal, the institute's quarterly magazine, an article by Sol Stern, a senior fellow of the institute, is published entitled "Why Public Schools Work." The article suggests that placing public school children in Roman Catholic schools might be one way to alleviate overcrowding.
 
JULY TO SEPTEMBER 1996: The article is picked up or cited by magazines and newspapers.
 
SEPT. 8, 1996: With severe overcrowding affecting the New York City public school system, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says he is considering an offer from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York to educate 1,000 public school students.
 
FEB. 3, 1997: Bruce Kovner, a member of the institute's board of trustees and chairman of a newly formed foundation, School Choice Scholarships, announces that the foundation had raised $6 million for scholarships to send New York City public school students to schools run by the archdiocese. Mayor Giuliani says the plan has his full support.

Lean, Mean, Love Ya

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Why is it that when gigantic corporations say they are in business to enrich our lives, 250 million Americans do not rise as one and cry out, "Oh, stuff it!"?
The question comes from a friend who owns some AT&T stock and forwards this copy of its annual report for 1996. The passage that galls him in this prose souffle has the top AT&T boss, speaking of the customers, promising that the company will "enrich their personal lives."
 
What insolence! How many people here want AT&T meddling in their personal lives? All I want from AT&T is a clear connection to the party on the other end of the line, or whatever it is that the party on the other end is on these days.
Even a clear connection is unlikely to enrich my personal life. It's likelier to impoverish it since incoming-callers who want to give me money are outnumbered 20 to 1 by those who want me to give them money.
What the telephone is in my personal life is an irritation, like a hangnail on your ear. There's the telemarketing call just as you're dipping into the mashed potatoes. There's the charity moocher calling for money to stamp out some pestilence. There's the answering machine that takes your long-distance call and charges you for saying there's nobody home.
Corporate guff like this about enriching your personal life is dumped on us incessantly while, at the same time, the air is filled with manly boasts about the ruthlessness of corporate America.
The corporate Caesar pounding his chest about his pitiless determination to increase profits, the journalistic explicator of why laissez-faire economics will be good for you one of these days no matter how much it hurts at the moment -- such writings are now commonplace in the media.
They preach the gospel of what used to be called "trickle-down" economics: Let unrestrained business practices produce vast profits for managers and stockholders, and some of the money will trickle down to the bottom of the economy.
The theory suffers ironically from the same weakness that afflicted Communism. Both apply an excessively simple idea to the exceedingly complex business of making vast national economies succeed. Panaceas often turn out to be poisons.
What is curious just now, however, is the contrast between the soft-soap pitch of corporate advertising and the smash-mouth talk from champions of anything-goes economics.
From the boardroom we hear that Coolidge was right all along. The business of America really is business.
It is not personal enrichment of its customers. It is financial enrichment of its stockholders and its executives.
If executives are often enriched far more grandly than the stockholders, it is because their business skills and their hard-nosed, even courageous readiness to make tough, lean, mean decisions produce ever rising profits for stockholders.
And who are those enriched stockholders? They could be you, friend. And you and you, depending on how you have arranged for your financial future, assuming that you have arranged for your financial future.
Ruthlessness is the executive's philosophical duty. His job is to crunch the numbers, increase productivity, reduce or abolish fringe benefits for undownsized employees, export jobs to faraway lands free of unions and child-labor laws and keep America Number One despite intense global competition.
Business spokesmen are commendably frank about this, saying, "It's a jungle out there, and the soft-hearted do not survive."
Their advertising, however, still concentrates on telling us what swell folks they are. AT&T is thinking of our personal lives. The airline industry, which has made flying an extremely disagreeable experience, talks of friendly skies and devoted mechanics making planes safer and safer.
In the new corporate style you might expect the airlines to boast of their overworked crews becoming ever more testy, ever more dictatorial, to brag of loyal mechanics making the seats ever smaller, ever closer together -- and all to enrich their stockholders and keep America Number One, hurrah!
They don't do that. Instead they keep spoofing us about how much they like us. And 250 million do not rise as one and say, "Oh, stuff it!" That's probably because 249 million have become too cynical from being deceived so long that they no longer care about being deceived.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
A Man of Few Words Is Sent Up by a Man of Few Acts

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
With "Mere Mortals and Others," a collection of six fast and ferociously funny comedies, that professional tease of a playwright, David Ives, is back at the top of his game. He has fashioned a madcap evening of one-acts at Primary Stages on West 45th Street that reconfirms his status as a maestro of the short form. By evening's end, your mood may be so improved that you may want to hunt him down and pinch his cheek.
Whether his subject is a mating dance on a miniature golf course, the life cycle of the mayfly or the machismo of David Mamet, Mr. Ives has the gratifying ability to unharness the intoxicating power of language and, at the same time, entertain. In the latter, he is served wonderfully here by a standout creative team and superb cast, who match this playful playwright pound for witty pound. 
 Mr. Ives was bathed in praise for his previous evening of one-acts, "All in the Timing," which had its debut at Primary Stages in 1993 and graduated to a lengthy Off Broadway run. His subsequent full-length plays, including the flat and cryptic "Red Address" at Second Stage earlier this season, failed to show off his skills to best advantage. "Mere Mortals" demonstrates that Mr. Ives's gift may be for riffing rather than ruminating.
Four of the six playlets have been performed before, at benefits and one-act play marathons, but it's probably safe to say none have ever been given so smart and imaginative a presentation. Mr. Ives is a pitcher with a great many tricks up his sleeve. Sliders, breaking balls, fastballs, curves: he throws like an all-star in "Mere Mortals," mixing comedic moods and styles with a dizzying assortment of changeups.
The best of the six is "Speed-the-Play," a virtuosic parody of the work of a playwright known for big thoughts wrapped in short sentences. The playlet is set in the meeting hall of the Joliet, Ill., Men's Club, whose members gather to honor Mr. Mamet, the man's man of contemporary theater. With a portrait of the writer on the wall, the M.C., played by Nancy Opel with the swagger of a lumberjack overdosing on male hormones, attributes Mr. Mamet's audience appeal to the brevity of his plays. "David Mamet knows Americans don't like to pay for parking!" the host declares, to the cheers of the cigar-smoking men at her side.
With that, the cast of six plunges into a zany capsulization of the Mamet oeuvre: four Mamets in seven minutes. It's highbrow "Forbidden Broadway": "American Buffalo," "Oleanna," "Speed-the-Plow" and "Sexual Perversity in Chicago" whiz by in a blur of profane and sputtering arguments. (The funniest condensations are of the sexual harassment case dissection of "Oleanna" and a nearly "Who's on First?"-caliber reductio ad absurdum of "American Buffalo.") "Foreplay or: The Art of the Fugue" is set in the Lilliput Lane miniature golf course, amusingly suggested by a whimsical windmill designed by Russell Metheny. It choreographs American dating rituals to the cadences of suggestive banter. The effect is almost orchestral: starting with one couple on the course and building to three, Mr. Ives composes, in effect, a six-part symphony to spoon by. The climax -- an end-of-the-evening decision on who wins and loses the dating game -- finishes the piece off like a crash of cymbals.
Some of the works, like the title piece "Mere Mortals," exhibit Mr. Ives's impish side. A trio of hardhats, lunching on a girder high above New York City, play a kind of supernatural game of "Can You Top This?" with tales of their grandiose secret and previous lives. One claims to be the grown-up Lindbergh baby; another the surviving son of Czar Nicholas; the third, a reincarnation of Marie Antoinette.
Just when the play veers toward irrelevance, however, your imagination moves it in the other direction. Is "Mere Mortals" an elaborate riddle? Is it a stretch to suggest that the play, set on a skyscraper, is a play on the words: tall stories?
The giddy high of Mr. Ives's entertainments is that he frequently allows your brain a workout, no matter how far afield you wander. And he could not have asked for a more fortuitous crew of playmates. John Rando, who staged the delightful "When Ladies Battle" for the Pearl Theater last season, may have been separated from Mr. Ives at birth, so attuned is this talented director to the dramatist's puckish sense of humor. Mr. Metheny's sets, particularly a post-modern lily pond for "Time Flies" that could double as a downtown apartment, share a joie de vivre with Anita Yavich's ebullient costumes that infects the entire production.
It's a harmonious setting for the versatile cast members, each of whom gets a chance to shine. Danton Stone's sunny turn as an unemployed dreamer enriches "Degas, C'est Moi," the final playlet. Arnie Burton and Anne O'Sullivan are touching as a pair of mayflies burdened with the knowledge of their mortality in "Time Flies." Willis Sparks and Jessalyn Gilsig set the pace for the social combat of "Foreplay." And Ms. Opel is terrific in, well, everything. They have only themselves, and Mr. Ives, to thank.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Further vs. Yen, But Strengthens Against Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar slumped to its lowest level against the yen in almost four months yesterday after a senior Japanese Government official said that last week's substantial yen gains against the dollar were not excessive.
The remarks from Eisuke Sakakibara, the influential director of the Finance Ministry's international finance bureau, sent the dollar to a low of 117.50 yen, its weakest level since mid-January. 
 They also sent the yen sharply higher against a number of European currencies, including the German mark, which fell sharply against the dollar as a result.
"After a few days of selling the dollar across the board, the market has had a chance to rethink and has decided that the selling against the yen is considerably more warranted than the selling against the mark and other European currencies," said Ben Strauss, assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer.
The dollar fell as low as 117.50 yen in trading in Asia, the lowest since Jan. 22. The dollar later recovered to settle in New York trading at 119.30 yen, down from 120.35 yen on Friday. The dollar settled at 1.7064 marks, up from 1.6869 marks. The pound fell to $1.6184 from $1.6205.
Last week, strong gains in Japanese stocks, talk of higher Japanese interest rates and warnings of intervention to curb yen weakness sent the dollar tumbling against the yen. Mr. Sakakibara's remarks, which came on Saturday, added more fuel to the fire.
Yesterday, Mr. Sakakibara sought to limit the impact of his remarks, saying that the dollar was "likely to settle down soon."
In addition, a member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party made comments that cast doubt on prospects for an increase in Japanese interest rates.
As a result, traders began buying yen for marks instead of dollars, allowing the dollar to post gains against the mark and recover somewhat against the yen.
The mark also fell against the British pound, after the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, said he had no plans to take the pound back into Europe's exchange rate mechanism, the system designed to limit currency volatility in the approach to monetary union.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Public Science Is Pillar Of Industry

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
A NEW study has found strong evidence that publicly financed scientific research plays a surprisingly important role in the breakthroughs of industrial innovation in the United States, suggesting that impending cuts in the Federal science budget might eventually hurt the economy.
The study, prepared for the National Science Foundation by a private research group, found that 73 percent of the main science papers cited by American industrial patents in two recent years were based on domestic and foreign research financed by government or nonprofit agencies. Private companies paid for the rest. 
 Such publicly financed science, the study concluded, has turned into a "fundamental pillar" of industrial advance.
Advocates of Federal spending on scientific research are seizing upon the study to bolster their position. The science foundation finances much basic research, and its officials acknowledged that they had questioned the wisdom of cuts in the science budget. But they said the patent study was part of continuing research on science trends that began long before the current push to trim the deficit.
Democrats and Republicans are generally united in earmarking Government financing for science for sizable cuts as part of a plan to reduce the Federal deficit and balance the budget by 2002. This year, the Federal research and development budget is about $65 billion. Budget analysts say the Clinton Administration wants to shrink it 14 percent in the next five years, and Republicans want to reduce it by about 20 percent.
The study, to be published in Research Policy, a bimonthly journal based at the University of Sussex in England, a leading forum for this kind of analysis, is starting to circulate in the United States in manuscript form. Science policy groups say no previous study has addressed the intellectual foundations of American industry in such depth and with such rigor.
"It's a watershed," said Dr. Martin A. Apple, executive director of the Council of Scientific Society Presidents, a policy group in Washington that represents 65 science organizations and lobbies for more money for science. "It's a wake-up call for Federal investment policies."
Charles F. Larson, executive director of the Industrial Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington that represents large companies,said the report would be widely influential. "It's going to make people realize something they should have known all along -- that public investment in academic science through Government-funded programs pays dividends to society," he said. "It pays off handsomely."
On the other hand, budget cutters seem unlikely to find the report so persuasive as to set aside the ax. They argue that much fat can be sliced from the Federal science budget without damaging high-quality work at universities.
Basic science, the kind that pursues fundamental knowledge for its own sake with no clear vision of how it might be practically applied, has long been considered a prime source of military and economic power. Yet the exact relationship between science and innovation has been murky since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
In recent years, as private industry in the United States has grown big and sophisticated enough to surpass the Government in overall spending on research, some conservatives have suggested that public support of basic research is passe. Publicly financed research gave birth to high-technology industry, they say, but it is no longer so important.
The new study sharply contradicts that view. It examined one of the most vivid expressions of industrial creativity: patents, the main way that companies and inventors reap commercial rewards from their bright ideas. Once granted, patents give the holder a monopoly to produce, sell or profit from an invention for a period of years.
Patentable ideas include new kinds of machines, methods, processes and material compositions, including drugs and computer chips. The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that patents could also be granted for genetically engineered forms of life.
The new study, the most thorough examination to date of the scientific foundation of American patents, strongly suggests that public science lies at the heart of most commercial innovation. The study is the culmination of 17 years of patent investigations by CHI Research Inc., a consulting firm in Haddon Heights, N.J., that analyzes contemporary science for industrial and government clients around the world.
Its customer for the most recent round of patent work is the National Science Foundation, a Federal agency. The foundation's budget is up about 1.5 percent this year, to $3.27 billion from $3.22 billion, an increase that almost matches inflation.
CHI Research, starting in 1980, while working for the National Science Foundation and other clients, began examining the role played by research in American patents. The main clues came from the scientific reports that patents cite on their front pages as evidence of their intellectual foundations.
For instance, patent No. 4,565,785, assigned to Harvard University in 1986, lists 52 scientific reports in journals that include Science and Nature. The patent shows how bacteria can be turned into tiny factories for the production of insulin, human growth hormone, interferon and other pharmacologically active agents.
An early CHI Research study examined patents issued from 1975 to 1986 and found that patented inventions were increasingly drawing on pure science, as measured by the growing number of citations of articles in scientific journals.
The new study, by Dr. Francis Narin, Kimberly S. Hamilton and Dominic Olivastro, sharpened this analytic tool by investigating the sources of the scientific reports. It tracked down and analyzed the institutional ties of the authors, which patent citations ignore.
The CHI Research team examined the science references on the front pages of American patents in two recent periods -- 1987 and 1988, as well as 1993 and 1994 -- looking at all the 397,660 patents issued.
It found 242,000 identifiable science references and zeroed in on those published in the preceding 11 years, which turned out to be 80 percent of them. Searches of computer databases allowed the linking of 109,000 of these references to known journals and authors' addresses. After eliminating redundant citations to the same paper, as well as articles with no known American author, the study had a core collection of 45,000 papers. Armies of aides then fanned out to libraries to look up the papers and examine their closing lines, which often say who financed the research. That detective work revealed an extensive reliance on publicly financed science. For instance, biomedical papers cited the National Cancer Institute for financial support 7,970 times, the American Cancer Society 2,131 times and the March of Dimes 293 times. Physics papers cited the National Science Foundation 1,072 times, the Navy 708 times, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 255 times and the Sloan Foundation 22 times. Some research projects were financed by multiple public agencies.
The overall role of public support was impossible to tally because some papers made no mention of their source of funds. That was especially true for reports from industrial laboratories, where the source of funds was often implied but not stated.
Further narrowing its focus, the study set aside patents given to schools and governments and zeroed in on those awarded to industry. For 2,841 patents issued in 1993 and 1994, it examined the peak year of literature references, 1988, and found 5,217 citations to science papers.
Of these, it found that 73.3 percent had been written at public institutions -- universities, government labs and other public agencies, both in the United States and abroad. American institutions represented 43.9 percent of that figure and foreign ones accounted for 29.4 percent.
Over all, only 20.4 percent of the science citations in American industrial patents referred to papers from American industry, and 6.3 percent referred to reports from foreign industry. Even International Business Machines -- famous for its research prowess and numerous patents -- was found to cite its own work only 21 percent of the time.
"Regardless of how the data are arranged," the study said, "it is quite clear that public science plays an overwhelming role in the science base of U.S. industry."
The study found that industry's dependence on all science was soaring. It compared the number of science citations, both public and private, in the two study periods and found that they had almost tripled.
The rise, the study concluded, is "truly remarkable, and indicative of a rapidly increasing dependence of patented technology upon contemporary science."
Expert reaction to the study so far is favorable. David C. Mowery, a business professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies technology policy, said the CHI Research team "has gone further than anybody else" in probing the inspiration behind patents.
Wesley M. Cohen, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who studies American industry, said some experts might question whether the rise in citations was simply based on changing habits of source documentation, for instance, as the advent of electronic databases eased the tracking of journal articles, or actually indicated an increasing reliance.
But, he added, his own research, involving nearly 1,500 interviews with industrial lab managers, suggested the rise was real. "The effects of academic research may be much more pervasive across industries than previously thought," he said.
Mr. Larson of the Industrial Research Institute said, "Industry depends considerably on academic science for new knowledge."
Dr. Narin, the lead author of the patent study, said he hoped his work would help dull the budget ax. "Look at the things that are coming out of the research pipeline," he said. "We'd be fools to close it down."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Chance for Americans

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Beginning May 20, Americans will get a specific opportunity to decide whether they want the U.S. to use at least some part of its political and economic influence to help Christians persecuted for being Christian.
On that day Congressional legislation will be introduced that would put an economic price on the persecution of Christians who try to worship openly and freely. The price tag would certainly get the attention of the persecuting nations, dictatorships all. It might even persuade some of them to give ease to their victims. 
 Six months or more will be needed for the legislation to get through Congressional machinery -- or die in it. If they start early enough Americans will have the time, and responsibility, to declare themselves -- individually or with other members of their religious, political and economic groups.
If Americans in sufficient numbers make it clear to their representatives that they want action for the persecuted, the measure will pass. If not, not.
The legislation will be introduced by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Representative Frank Wolf of Virginia, Republicans, and has co-sponsors from both parties. It designates two other desperate religious groups as coming within its definition of persecution -- the Buddhists of Tibet and the Bahais of Iran.
The bill is the legislative expression of slowly increasing American awareness that in China and other Communist countries and in at least eight Muslim countries Christians are arrested, beaten, tortured or killed for their Christianity.
But generally, among American Christians and Jews the awareness has not overcome decades of silence and abdication or been translated into much action. Still, it does grow.
In New York, the City Council is expected to adopt a resolution tomorrow asking Congress and the President to make ending Christian persecution a diplomatic and economic priority. Then, without waiting for that to happen, Council Speaker Peter Vallone will introduce a measure prohibiting city contracts with companies of the persecuting nations, ending city deposits in their banks and selling off their stocks.
In Congress, Specter-Wolf would create a White House office to monitor religious persecution. Its director would determine where religious persecution was widespread and ongoing -- torture, imprisonment, murder, as of Christians in China, or enslavement, as of Christians in the Sudan, or mass resettlement, as of Tibetan Buddhists by China.
The bill would stop U.S. loans to such countries and mandate Washington's opposition to international loans. It would prohibit export to persecuting nations of products that could be used as instruments of oppression -- like software for tracking dissidents using the Internet or E-mail.
A list of government units assigned to persecution would be created and all exports barred to them. Visas would be denied to officials of the persecution. Logically that should mean no visas for officials of the Chinese puppet churches.
The Sudan would be put in a pariah class of its own. The same tough sanctions would be applied as to South Africa during apartheid.
Deliberately, the bill avoids the question of tariff penalties for China. The Congressional vote on that promise, made and broken by President Clinton, will come first. The legislation against religious persecution would apply, however the tariff vote went.
I would have preferred legislation more muscular -- including prohibition of trade with companies owned by the military. That would have cut nicely into China's military treasury.
But the bill is not just one more resolution for virtue over evil. It has real sanctions aimed at real persecuting nations.
Therefore it will be opposed by U.S. politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen who want the U.S. to do only two things about the victims of religious persecution: look away, walk away.
Americans who want their country to stand up against religious persecution should start supporting the bill now and continue on for as much time as it takes. And they will have to remember that the opponents of help to the persecuted will have just as much time and a lot more money, and fight hard.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Flat Ahead Of New Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended little changed yesterday in thin trading. Bonds were supported by expectations that today's retail sales report would be weak, providing new signs of a slowing economy.
The expectations prompted short- covering by speculators who were betting that the market would go the other way and provided some support for bonds. 
 Short-covering occurs when investors sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back at lower prices, thereby pocketing the difference. But if prices rise, investors have to cover short positions by buying back the securities to limit losses.
A late recovery in the dollar on the currency market also bolstered bond prices. A stronger dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors.
The 30-year bond finished at a price of 96 23/32, to yield 6.89 percent, unchanged from Friday. The seven-year note rose 2/32, to 103 19/32, to yield 6.60 percent, down from 6.61 percent. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.
At the Treasury's regular weekly sale of three- and six-month bills yesterday, rates were mostly in line with expectations, with bidding not nearly as impressive as is was last week. The average rate at auction for the three-month issue was 5.08 percent, down from 5.14 percent last week, while the six-month bill's average rate at auction was 5.30 percent, down from 5.37 percent.
Jack Regan, chief derivatives strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said yesterday's slow trading was not surprising given the economic data to be released this week. In addition to today's retail sales data for April, the Government reports on producer prices tomorrow and consumer prices on Thursday. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia issues its survey of regional business conditions on Friday.
Analysts and traders are expecting the retail sales report to show a decline between three-tenths and four-tenths of 1 percent.
Some market participants say that if there are enough data this week to indicate an economic slowdown, the Federal Reserve may be less likely to raise interest rates when Fed policy makers meet next Tuesday.
Kathleen Camilli, director of economic research for Tucker Anthony Inc., said she expected the bond and stock markets to trade sideways before the Fed's meeting. "There is still downside risk in the front end of the Treasury curve," she said, "but the market is poised for softer economic data. And once that is confirmed, cash should continue to come off the sidelines, propelling both markets even higher."
Market participants continue to be divided on whether the Fed will raise short-term interest rates by a quarter-point next week.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research analysis firm, said that although the Fed chairman in the last two years has begun to acknowledge that the economy may be capable of growing faster than the widely accepted 2.5 percent rate, "he continues to behave as though there is a speed limit on growth."
"Yet if we look at the performance of productivity in the current business cycle," Mr. McCarthy added, "it is unlike anything we have experienced in the past 50 years. The enormous increase in the power of the microprocessor and the huge growth in investment in this technology is taking the economy to new heights of productivity and enabling us to grow faster for a sustained period than we have this century."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Study Questions Cost of Shift To Harsh Cocaine Sentences

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
Meting out harsher prison terms to drug dealers provides fewer benefits per taxpayer dollar than old-fashioned law enforcement or simply treating addicted offenders, according to a new study released today.
The detailed analysis published by the Drug Policy Research Center of the Rand Corporation, a policy analysis institution that has made its reputation doing government studies, seems bound to supply fresh fuel for the contentious national debate over Federal and state laws that require judges to impose automatic minimum sentences for dealing in some illegal drugs. 
 Supporters say mandatory sentencing send a tough message and take criminals out of circulation. Critics contend that the laws impose a draconian punishment out of proportion to the offense, take discretion away from judges, and in the process, lock up many more black and Hispanic offenders for low-level trafficking than white offenders for high-level trafficking.
The 183-page Rand study appears to be the first to examine the cost-effectiveness of mandatory minimum sentences. Addressing cocaine as the nation's "most problematic" drug, the researchers crunched hundreds of numbers, from cocaine's average street price to the cost of a prison cell. They determined that spending an additional $1 million on longer sentences for convicted dealers would reduce the nation's total consumption of cocaine -- estimated to be from 276 to 321 tons a year -- by less than 29 pounds a year.
The same $1 million spent on arresting, prosecuting and sentencing more dealers to discretionary prison terms, as well as seizing their assets, would trim annual cocaine consumption by nearly 60 pounds, or twice as much, the study reported.
But spending $1 million more on treating heavy cocaine users would cut consumption by as much as 220 pounds, it said.
"Mandatory minimum sentences are not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing cocaine consumption or drug-related crime," the researchers concluded, assuming that lower consumption of cocaine leads to fewer drug-related crimes. They attributed this mainly to the high cost of incarceration. Locking up a convicted felon costs $20,000 to $30,000 a year. By comparison, the researchers calculated, a mix of residential and outpatient treatment would cost the government as little as $1,740 a year for a heavy cocaine user. Residential treatment can, however, run from $8,000 to $16,000 a year.
"We don't say mandatory minimums have no effect," Jonathan Caulkins, the principal researcher in the Rand study, explained in an interview. "They do have some effect, but they turn out to be not very cost-effective."
But the researchers, who included C. Peter Rydell, William L. Schwabe and James Chiesa, emphasized that their findings did not support shifting all anti-drug resources to treatment from enforcement.
The issue was raised anew two weeks ago when the United States Sentencing Commission, an advisory body on prison sentences, recommended that Congress reduce, but not eliminate, the 100-to-1 disparity in sentences involving crack, compared with sentences involving powder cocaine. Federal law sets a five-year minimum sentence for possession with the intent to distribute less than one-fifth of an ounce of crack cocaine, compared with eight ounces of powder cocaine .
Crack is made by heating cocaine powder with baking soda and water. It is more addictive than the powder form and has been more often associated with violence.
Two years ago, the Clinton Administration joined Congress in rejecting a recommendation by the Sentencing Commission that the disparity in sentencing between crimes involving powder and crack cocaine be eliminated. Congress has shown no inclination to change the laws.
Many states have their own mandatory minimum sentences. In 1973, New York, under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, passed legislation dictating a sentence of 15 years to life for anyone convicted of selling four ounces of cocaine or possessing four ounces of cocaine. By the end of 1996, 8,760 drug offenders were locked up under the Rockefeller laws at a cost of $260 million a year, according to the Correctional Association of New York, which monitors prison conditions.
"Long sentences for serious crimes have intuitive appeal," the Rand study said. "They respond to deeply held beliefs about punishment for evil actions, and in many cases they insure that, by removing a criminal from the streets, further crimes that would have been committed will not be."
But, it continued, "long sentences are expensive and cocaine-control resources are limited. As we show, if reducing consumption or violence is the goal, more can be achieved by spending additional money arresting, prosecuting and sentencing dealers to standard prison terms than by spending it sentencing (fewer) dealers to longer mandatory terms."

HEADLINE: Dow and S.& P. Index Hit Highs As the Rally in Stocks Surges On

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks both jumped more than 1.5 percent and set closing highs yesterday, continuing the rally that has seen these indexes climb about 14 percent since the spring selloff that ended on April 11.
Other major indexes, including the Nasdaq composite and the Russell index of 2,000 smaller stocks, also rose, but not nearly as much, reflecting the fact that the recoveries in stocks of small companies and technology concerns featured in those indexes remain far behind. 
 The Dow climbed 123.22 points, or 1.72 percent, to 7,292.75, yesterday, while the S.& P. 500 rose 12.88 points, or 1.56 percent, to 837.66. The Nasdaq rose 9.14 points, or 0.68 percent, to 1,344.19, and the Russell index finished at 363.76, up 2.34 points, or 0.64 percent.
Even some fervent stock bulls were surprised at the market's performance. The rally, they said, came just ahead of the release of several important economic reports this week and next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. At that meeting, the central bank could decide to raise its short-term interest rate target again. Investors seem to be betting the data will show economic growth slowing enough to convince the Fed to leave its target for the Federal funds rate -- a key short-term rate -- at 5.50 percent.
"Investors are seeing the glass half-full, not half-empty," said Alfred Goldman, the director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis.
"Even I as a bull am amazed that we added 120 points today onto what we have done," Mr. Goldman added, noting that the Dow has risen more than 900 points since mid-April.
One contributing factor to the stock market's rise, analysts said, is the recent sharp decline of the dollar, which means that American exports could become more competitive abroad. In the currency markets yesterday, the dollar fell again against the Japanese yen but rebounded somewhat against the German mark and other European currencies.
Against the yen, the dollar is now down 5.8 percent since May 2. Against the mark, even after yesterday's rebound, the dollar is still off 1.3 percent.
Hedge-fund operators, who have been major players in the yen market by borrowing at low interest rates in Japan to buy United States Treasuries that offer much higher interest rates, said they had not yet seen funds with big positions bailing out, a move that would push the dollar even lower.
But they agreed that it was still unclear whether the dollar's longer-term rally against the yen, from lows set several years ago, had ended or whether the dollar might resume its recent gains. They noted that the differential between interest rates in the United States and Japan still favored the dollar by giving dollar-denominated securities higher yields.
The Dow was led higher by General Electric, which rose 1 5/8 a share, to 59 7/8; I.B.M., up 6, to 173 1/2, and Hewlett-Packard, up 2 3/4, to 56 7/8. Indeed, just one Dow component stock closed the session lower: Caterpillar, which fell 3/8, to 96 1/4, after a downgrade by an analyst.
Among the monthly economic data due this week are retail sales, which will be reviewed for indications of how much consumers are still spending; the Producer Price Index; the Consumer Price Index; industrial production, and housing starts.
Based on these data, analysts will place bets on what the Fed's Open Market Committee will do when it meets next Tuesday. It now appears that a growing number of forecasters feel that the Fed will not raise interest rates.
Thus, if the Fed does move, it could lead to a market selloff while at the same time giving a lift to the dollar.
But given the current optimism, investors might also decide to put a positive spin on any Fed rate increase, choosing to regard it as possibly the last of this economic cycle -- assuming that the economy continues to slow, as some indicators suggest it already is. Such a positive conclusion could just send stocks higher.

HEADLINE: Guinness and Grand Met in $22 Billion Deal

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: LONDON, May 12

 BODY:
Faced with a steady decline in liquor consumption in their traditional markets, the world's two biggest distillers, Grand Metropolitan P.L.C. and Guinness P.L.C., agreed today to a merger valued at about $22.27 billion, the fifth-biggest deal in history.
Together, the companies own some of the best-known brands of Scotch, vodka and gin, along with the famed Guinness stout, and their top executives said today that they were confident that the efficiencies resulting from a combination, including eliminating 2,000 jobs, would lift sales and profits. But at least one big competitor, the Seagram Company, bitterly objected to the market dominance that the deal would create in Scotch, the liquor category with the highest profits. 
 The driving force behind the surprise announcement today is the generational divide that has plagued the liquor business for years. Basically, distilled spirits are popular with people 60 and older, while younger drinkers tend to prefer wine, wine coolers, beer or nonalcoholic drinks -- a trend that does not bode well for future growth.
In mature markets like the United States and Europe, the liquor industry faces the need to cut costs of advertising, sales and production to build back profits, while in developing markets, the challenge is to try to make inroads quickly and profitably, though some companies have found that difficult.
If approved by shareholders and regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, the merger will create a new company, GMG Brands, that will reign over some 150 internationally known labels including Johnnie Walker and J & B Scotches; Gordon's and Tanqueray gins; Smirnoff, the world's best-selling vodka, and its rival Stolichnaya; Jose Cuervo tequila, and Baileys Original Irish cream.
GMG would also absorb Grand Met's huge food operations including more than 9,000 Burger King restaurants, Green Giant vegetables, Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Pillsbury.
"This is not just a United Kingdom deal, it's a global deal that will create the seventh-largest food and drink group in the world," said John Carnegie, an analyst at BZW, the London merchant bank. "They will have a market share twice as big as the next competitor. It is right up there with McDonald's and bigger than Campbell."
Shares of Guinness and Grand Met soared here this morning. Guinness shares surged 86 pence to close at 602.5 pence ($9.78) while shares of Grand Met jumped 76.5 pence, to 591.5 ($9.60).
"Both sets of shareholders will benefit equally, and both companies are properly rated by the market," said Tony Greener, Guinness's chairman.
He and George Bull, the chairman of Grand Met, said they agreed to explore a merger over dinner in London a month ago. The two men, who said they had known each other for 17 years, will be joint chairmen of GMG Brands until Mr. Bull retires in July 1988. Mr. Greener will then be chairman and chief executive.
"It is a marriage made in heaven," said Dermott Carr, an analyst at Nikko Europe. "They will have a global reach in different parts of the world with a wide range of products and the critical mass to drive the sales in a very competitive market."
Guinness gets 44 percent of its revenues from emerging markets, and GMG Brands would be well placed to take advantage of rising demand in the increasingly affluent economies of Latin America, while Grand Met is poised to expand in Eastern Europe.
Even so, GMG Brands would have only 10 percent of the world liquor market -- far from a dominant position, but certainly a leading one.
Under the terms of the proposal, Grand Met shareholders would wind up with a controlling 52.7 percent of the shares in the new company. Analysts valued the deal at 13.72 billion ($22.27 billion), based on today's closing stock market prices.
Officials said they were confident the merger would pass regulatory scrutiny in Britain as well as in the United States and Europe. Except for Scotch, there is little overlap of products between the two companies. In Scotch, Guinness has Johnnie Walker, the No. 1 brand, and Dewar's and Bell; Grand Met has J & B.
That situation was cited by Robert W. Matschullat, vice chairman and chief financial officer of Seagram, in strongly objecting to the deal. "This proposition assumes the regulators are dozing," he said in a telephone interview from New York. "There are serious antitrust problems because this merger will create one company with well over half of the global Scotch market, which is the most profitable category."
In London, the two companies and several analysts insisted that there was little overlap. "We are entirely confident we will be able to satisfy regulatory requirements," Mr. Bull of Grand Met said. "Our brands fit like hand in glove. There are very few brand markets of real conflict."
The announcement of the deal also affected the big French luxury goods company, LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which owns 14.2 percent of Guinness. Its shares rose 4.9 percent on the Paris bourse, in part because of the higher value attached to its Guinness holding. Analysts were also speculating that the proposed merger might open up wider distribution channels for the Cognacs, Champagnes and other drinks produced by LVMH.
The enthusiasm for the deal apparently was not shared by the chief executive of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, who is a nonexecutive member of the Guinness board. He voted against the merger proposal on Friday, after questioning the rationale of the move. He is understood to have proposed a three-way merger of the liquor businesses of LVMH, Guinness and Grand Met.
"Discussions will continue," Mr. Greener said today of the relations with LVMH; Mr. Arnault was not available for comment.
Besides its hard liquor lines, Guinness owns the Irish black stout with the famous creamy head, Guinness Stout Ale, which sells some 10 million glasses a day produced in a string of breweries stretching from Dublin to Britain to Nigeria, Malaysia, Cameroon and Ghana. The brew, which is synonymous with Ireland's name, has been immortalized in verse and prose for 200 years.
After the merger, the new company will have four divisions: UDV, thespirits unit; Pillsbury; Burger King, and Guinness Brewing Worldwide. Mr. Greener said there were no plans to sell any of the four businesses.
The chiefs of the companies said at the news conference that some 2,000 jobs might be eliminated out of a combined 85,000 jobs worldwide. The companies said they expected substantial savings through integrating sales forces and office functions as well as improved purchasing.
A spokesman for the general labor union at Grand Metropolitan said, "We are seeking urgent talks to establish the reality of the 2,000 job losses."

While the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan unites a famed brewer with the owner of Burger King and Pillsbury, it is driven by a trend in the partners' liquor business: younger drinkers prefer beer, wine and nonalcoholic drinks over distilled spirits -- even those with famous labels.

HEADLINE: Steepest Hikes Are Expected Chiefly in Parts of Manhattan

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Under one scenario, the character of dozens of neighborhoods in New York City would be radically altered within a decade, as gentrification swept the poor and middle-class out of areas with the best schools, the best views and the least crime.
Under another scenario, the fabric of most neighborhoods would remain as stable as it ever has in such a crowded, protean city. Any big changes would take more than a generation, and developers would have more of an incentive to create new housing. 
 As Gov. George E. Pataki presented his plan yesterday to phase out rent regulations by removing price limits when apartments become vacant, such were the extreme visions offered of the city's future under so-called vacancy decontrol.
But economists and urban planners suggested that the effects of Mr. Pataki's plan would probably be much more complex, with rents increasing substantially in only about a dozen neighborhoods around the city -- mainly in Manhattan -- as tenants in rent-regulated apartments move out.
That, however, could have an unpredictable ripple effect on rents in the rest of the city, recent studies indicate, as middle-class and poorer residents eventually get priced out of those neighborhoods and look elsewhere for lower unregulated rents, driving up demand in other neighborhoods. And at some point, the demand and the city's limited stock of affordable housing could collide.
"One thing that vacancy decontrol would most likely do over the long haul, as people move out, is lead to a decrease in housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income households," said Michael Schill, a professor of law and urban planning at New York University, who will release a study on Wednesday that shows which neighborhoods could be most affected by vacancy decontrol.
The study, written with Benjamin P. Scafidi Jr., a research associate at the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University School of Law, identified neighborhoods where rents of regulated apartments were substantially lower than the market rate.
When regulated tenants move out, rents will likely rise in Riverdale, Soundview and Parkchester in the Bronx; Chelsea, Clinton, Greenwich Village and the financial district, Midtown, Stuyvesant Town, Turtle Bay, the Upper East and West Sides, Morningside and Hamilton Heights in Manhattan; and Bayside, Little Neck, Bellerose and Rosedale in Queens.
"You're probably going to have instances where people living in, say, Chelsea, have a family and decide they need to move out," Mr. Schill said. "And they're going to move to other neighborhoods, because they are not going to be able to attain housing at the old rent levels."
But landlords and owners have long contended that opponents of rent deregulation are overlooking an important factor when they present such theories. Phasing out the cumbersome regulations, they say, will spur construction of housing in a city where too few new apartments arebeing built or rehabilitated.
But Michael McKee of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, the largest tenant group, predicted yesterday that vacancy decontrol would force the middle class out of Manhattan and destroy the city's unique character.
"If you want New York City to be a vibrant, diverse community, with artists and writers and creative people, then rent regulation is a very important part of that mix," Mr. McKee said. "Without rent regulation, creative people will be gone."
Ronald Shiffman, director of the Pratt Center for Community and Environmental Development, said, "I think it will hurt New York City in ways that one can't even imagine right now. It's going to have a dramatic affect on the social and economic integration of many of our neighborhoods."
Tenant advocates, relying on statistics from the last time New York City tried vacancy decontrol, believe that changes could occur rapidly, with most apartments reverting to the market within a decade. From 1971 to 1974, about 400,000 apartments became deregulated as tenants moved out. There are about 1.1 million regulated apartments in the city.
But many economists think it would take much longer for apartments to turn over. "The notion that there are millionaires lurking out in the weeds waiting to take our apartment is a little far-fetched," said Frank Braconi, the executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council. "Rents will look much like they do now in many parts of the city for a long time."

HEADLINE: Pataki Urges End of Rent Cap When Apartment Is Vacated

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday proposed eliminating rent protections on apartments once they become vacant, but the Democratic Speaker of the Assembly vowed to fight the plan.
The Governor's proposal, which would eventually end the five-decade old system that limits rent increases on 1.1 million apartments, came a day after he disclosed that his full proposal would call for lifting controls immediately for a small number of wealthy tenants. 
 Taken as a whole, Mr. Pataki's proposal begins a new phase in the debate over the state's rent laws, which are set to expire on June 16. It appeared to establish the Governor as the main bargainer in negotiations with the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, who has called for continuing the laws unchanged, while shifting the spotlight away from the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, the leading proponent of abolishing the laws altogether.
It was far from clear whether the Governor's plan would move either side toward a quick compromise. Tenant advocates, including many Democrats in Albany, reiterated their strong opposition to any plan that would lift rent limits when current tenants leave, a process known as vacancy decontrol. And landlords, who have fought for a quick end to controls, assailed Mr. Pataki's plan as too weak and expressed fear that he might be prepared to soften it even further in talks with Mr. Silver.
The plan Mr. Pataki released yesterday would allow landlords to raise rents to market rates as soon as tenants move or die. Over time, vacancy decontrol would bring an end to the entire rent regulation system as more and more units became vacant. But just how long that process would take has been debated, with tenants' groups saying it could happen in a handful of years and landlords maintaining it would take decades.
To temper his proposal, Mr. Pataki also called for continuing laws that allow blood relatives, in-laws and even domestic partners to inherit rent-protected apartments when tenants die or move away. Landlords contend that such succession rules have allowed families to keep rent-regulated units off the open market for generations and are sure to slow down deregulation significantly.
By releasing his plan over two days, Mr. Pataki seemed intent on focusing public attention on its least controversial element -- ending protections for wealthy tenants -- while playing down yesterday's more contentious, and far more sweeping, proposal for vacancy decontrol.
Repeatedly using the words "fair" and "balanced" to describe his plan, Mr. Pataki proudly suggested at a news conference yesterday in Manhattan that he had found a way to split the difference between Republicans and Democrats.
"We must insure that every tenant who needs rent protections has those protections for as long as they live," the Governor said. "This proposal will insure a smooth transition over the course of the next few decades to a market system."
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has supported extending the rent laws, welcomed Mr. Pataki's entry into the debate, even though he disagrees with major portions of the Governor's plan. The Mayor also called on Mr. Silver, his ally on this issue, to begin negotiating with the Governor, suggesting that Mr. Giuliani is prepared to accept a compromise that would end some rent protections.
"I've talked to the Governor about it and he indicated to me that he's willing to be flexible," Mr. Giuliani said. "So, he's willing to move if other people will sit down with him and start negotiating with him."
But Mr. Silver and tenants' groups accused the Governor of being a front man for landlords, who they say secretly consider vacancy decontrol their ultimate goal.
"This is not a compromise by any stretch of the imagination, but rather the Governor has chosen to take the side of vacancy decontrol and the side of the landlords and abandon the middle class of this state," said Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
Billy Easton, executive director of New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, the state's largest tenants' advocacy group, said Mr. Pataki's political handlers had "artfully packaged an assault on tenants' rights to look as if they were providing new tenant protections." Vacancy decontrol, he added, "is the major prize landlords have wanted all along."
But groups representing landlords expressed disappointment with the Governor's plan, contending that it would prolong for decades a system they consider rife with abuses.
"We're extremely disappointed that the Governor wants to maintain rent regulations after 50 years of failure and economic devastation," said Jack Freund, executive vice president for the Rent Stabilization Association, a group representing 25,000 landlords. "We believe there needs to be a date certain to end rent regulations in New York, as Senator Bruno has suggested."
Mr. Bruno, who has called for ending most rent protections in two to four years, praised Mr. Pataki for trying to broker a compromise. But he called the current succession laws "ludicrous" and said he would continue to push Mr. Pataki to agree to a specific deadline for the rent laws.
"Frankly, I just don't agree with his position that in decades you'll be out of rent control and rent regulations," said Mr. Bruno, of Rensselaer County. "If it's wrong, it's wrong. If you're going to correct it, you should do it in a timely way."
It is not clear, however, what Mr. Bruno can do to move Mr. Pataki off his position. Several of his fellow Republicans in the Senate oppose his plan for ending rent regulations, giving him the barest of majorities to pass a bill.
The Governor's plan "takes the ball away from Senator Bruno, who had a more extreme position," said Senator Roy Goodman, a Manhattan Republican who supports continuing the rent laws. "It's now up to Mr. Silver to come to the table and do some serious negotiating."
On Sunday, the Governor called for immediately lifting rent protections for tenants who earn more than $175,000 for two consecutive years, a policy known as luxury decontrol. Disabled tenants and people older than 62 would be exempt. The proposed change would extend luxury decontrol to about 10,000 additional households, Mr. Pataki's aides said.
Under current law, tenants who earn more than $250,000 a year for two consecutive years and who pay rent of $2,000 a month or more lose their rent protections. The Governor's threshhold of $175,000 would apply, regardless of the rent.
Mr. Pataki also called on Sunday for tougher civil and criminal penalties for landlords who harass tenants to make them vacate apartments. Tenants' groups say such harassment is sure to increase if vacancy decontrol is enacted.
And yesterday, Mr. Pataki said he supported continuing the law requiring landlords to offer lease renewals automatically. He also endorsed legislation that would require tenants to deposit rent in an escrow account during disputes with landlords, a policy long sought by apartment owners.

HEADLINE: Another Ancient Innovation: City Planning

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
A CITY that throbbed with vitality in the third millennium B.C. lies buried, forlorn and silent, beneath the wind-blown soil of the Upper Euphrates River Valley in southeastern Turkey. Gone are the din of commerce, the clatter on cobblestones and the cries and murmurs of family life behind mud brick walls. But the ruins speak to archeologists of a time when a revolutionary idea may have shaped the newest cities in antiquity.
Mapping the site of the city, known today as Titris Hoyuk, archeologists are delineating the usual urban remains. At the center once stood a palace and other public buildings on high ground. Out from there, streets ran through residential neighborhoods. Beyond city walls lay a cemetery and scattered suburbs. 
 On closer examination, however, archeologists have found surprises. The streets and terrace walls appear to have been laid out and built before the houses. And the houses seem to follow a master plan, some larger than others but all of the same design.
Archeologists are thus drawn to the conclusion that Titris Hoyuk, population 10,000 in its heyday, represents a striking example of urban planning in antiquity. Built in about 2500 B.C., this was a kind of Levittown-on-the-Euphrates.
"There was a centralized vision of what a city should look like that appears remarkably similar to a typical master-planned community in the United States today," said Dr. Guillermo Algaze of the University of California at San Diego, who is directing the excavations.
Dr. Gil Stein, an archeologist at Northwestern University who has excavated in the same region, called the explorations at Titris "very, very important research, which gives us a whole new look on what urbanism was like in the ancient Middle East."
Scholars had long ago established that the first cities anywhere arose about 5,000 years ago in the lower valley of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, an area known as Mesopotamia that is part of present day Iraq. Cities were presumably an outgrowth of an increasingly productive agriculture. Crop surpluses supported expanding long-distance trade and freed people to specialize in such crafts as textiles and ceramics. As the number of merchants and artisans grew, farm villages evolved into cities.
By the middle of the third millennium B.C., it now appears, the first experiments in city living were such resounding successes that people were flocking to new cities over the entire region, in what is now Syria, northern Iraq and Turkey. This excavation, and similar clues at other sites in northern Mesopotamia, suggest that only well-planned construction projects could satisfy their needs fast enough. Further work at Titris and other sites is expected to reveal some of the changing social and political forces behind this rapid expansion of urban civilization and the innovation of planned cities.
"What we're discovering is that in the third millennium a lot of very exciting and creative things are happening in all areas of the Middle East, not just the southern Mesopotamian heartland," said Dr. Charles L. Redman, an authority on early urban civilization at Arizona State University in Tempe.
Excavations at Titris, begun in 1991, are expected to be especially revealing of the form, structure and organization of these earliest cities. For one thing, Dr. Algaze and his team are concentrating research on the neighborhoods and households where ordinary people lived, not on the palaces and temples most archeologists have focused on.
The vagaries of history also appear to have simplified the task. Titris was ultimately a failure as a city, rising and falling over a 300-year period, never again to be reoccupied. So, in contrast to most ancient cities, the ruins of Titris are not obscured by layer upon layer of debris and they lie less than three feet beneath the surface.
"I'm jealous," Dr. Stein said. "Archeology shouldn't be that easy."
Even so, archeologists working with Dr. Algaze have so far excavated only small sections of two neighborhoods. But they have used hand-held magnetometers to map the buried foundations of more than half of the 125-acre site. Outlines of the city's architecture are readily mapped because the nonmagnetic limestone foundations stand out clearly from the surrounding iron-rich soils.
By analyzing the magnetometry maps in the light of actual excavations of representative areas, the archeologists detected patterns suggesting a planned community that, as Dr. Algaze said, "was built in one go." A study of pottery styles seem to confirm that the houses were built and occupied within the same century.
In a new report on the research, Dr. Algaze and Dr. Timothy Matney of Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., described excavations at the eastern end of the city that exposed at least four large multiroom houses aligned along a central street. The foundations, they said, "showed extensive evidence for urban planning in its regularity, plan and constructional details."
Excavations at another part of the city exposed remains of terraces built behind retaining walls that in turn, serve as major load-bearing walls for the houses. This also suggested planning.
So did street construction. Streets examined by the archeologists were carefully prepared, cut into virgin soil and then paved with cobbles and crushed pot shards. It was clear, the archeologists concluded, that the streets were "laid before the houses at either side because, in places, the foundation trenches for the house walls had cut into the street."
At both excavation sites, archeologists uncovered limestone and fieldstone foundations of several houses that were more or less identical in design. Walls rising from the foundations were made of mud brick, which have now disintegrated. The roofs were of thatch.
One well-defined dwelling consisted of 15 rooms arranged around a central rectangular courtyard. The courtyard seemed to be subdivided with low partition walls defining what appeared to be four separate working areas. People typically entered the houses through a door off the street that led to an antechamber and then to a second small room that opened on the main house.
Such a house plan, the archeologists said, appeared to be characteristic for domestic dwellings of ordinary people, not the elite, though some were smaller variations on the same design. The houses were probably occupied by extended families, for each one contained several cooking areas.
The houses were places of work as well as residence. In the ruins, archeologists found several raised oval basins lined with plaster. High concentrations of tartaric acid in the plaster indicated that the basins were used in wine production, though some of the basins may have served several purposes.
Since some basins drained into the street, Dr. Virginia Badler, an archeologist at the University of Toronto, said they would not have been used for wine but perhaps in washing and processing wool or fleece. Among the artifacts in several houses were stone loom weights, no doubt associated with weaving.
One aspect of Titris was unlike anything associated with a Levittown or other modern tract housing communities. Each house excavated so far had a family crypt, usually in the central courtyard. Though partly subterranean, the tops of the crypts were visible above the floor foundations.
Each of the tombs contain skeletons of seven to nine people, as well as the remains of food, weapons and other artifacts for use in the after life. One of the most poignant finds in the tomb was a perfectly preserved thistle-type flower in a vase.
The grave goods, Dr. Algaze said, promised to help establish the affluence and social status of these families in the community. Burying the dead inside private residences was not thought to be common, he said, and was not well documented in the Middle East Bronze Age until now.
Working with Dr. Algaze and Dr. Matney at Titris have been archeologists from Britain, Italy, Turkey and the Universities of Chicago and Michigan. Dr. Lewis Somers of Geoscan Surveys Inc. conducted the magnetic mapping.
Dr. Harvey Weiss, an archeologist at Yale University, said that similar evidence of planned cities had been showing up at other sites in northern Syria and Iraq. "We don't understand why," he said, "but this sudden urbanization and now this feature of it, urban planning, are becoming a very remarkable story of how civilization spread."
Dr. Stein said the spread of urbanization and city planning probably reflected a high degree of social organization and complexity and more powerful rulers who wanted to expand and strengthen their political bases and had the means to do it. At the time of Titris, the landscape of both southern and northern Mesopotamia was covered with competing city-states, many of which would eventually be consolidated in a single Akkadian empire under Sargon the Great, around 2300 B.C.
The rise of cities, scholars have noted, coincided with such transforming innovations as writing, use of animals for traction, wheeled carts, metallurgy, irrigation and agriculture surpluses and craft specialization.
Dr. Redman suggested a more elemental, less materialistic reason for people's being encouraged to congregate in cities in ancient Mesopotamia and ever since. "We are a gregarious species," he said. "We like to live and work in groups."
In one sense, Dr. Redman noted, the phenomenon of the third millennium B.C. has been repeated in the last half of the 20th century, perhaps for some of the same reasons. "We are in a period of hyper-urbanization, with the Tokyos and Mexico Cities and Lagoses overflowing with humanity," he said, "because cities are the centers of learning and excitement, places for doing things and making your mark."

Dollar Drops for a Sixth Day; Off 6% in Week Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar declined against the yen yesterday for a sixth consecutive day even as Japan's top finance official suggested it had fallen enough.
The dollar was also weaker against the mark and other European currencies, dragged down by its slump versus the yen. 
 In the last week, the dollar has fallen more than 6 percent against the yen, after reaching its highest level in four and a half years earlier this month. Traders sold dollars after weeks of warnings from Japan's central bankers, who said they were prepared to sell the dollar to curb its two-year rally.
The slide slowed yesterday after Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka of Japan told a parliamentary committee that the dollar was stabilizing at an appropriate level.
"It looks like mission accomplished," said Kevin Lawrie, manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank in Boston. Japanese officials "jawboned it down, and now they're saying they're happy with it where it is."
In trading in New York, the dollar closed at 118.50 yen, down from 119.30 yen Monday, and at 1.6959 German marks, down from 1.7064 marks. The British pound rose to $1.6329 from $1.6184.
While Mr. Mitsuzuka's comments did not stop the slide, they slowed it, and many traders say they are confident that the worst is over.
"The dollar had risen too far, too fast, so they were trying to temper it," said Mary Ann Bartels, a portfolio manager at Avatar Associates, a money management firm that oversees $4 billion. "They've back-tailed on those comments and they're now comfortable where it is."
The dollar's decline against the yen contributed to the dollar's slide in Europe.
"If the yen strengthens against the dollar, the dollar sometimes weakens against the mark," said Varick Martin, manager of foreign exchange at Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company.
The dollar fell further against the mark after a report of weak United States retail sales reduced expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates.
Higher interest rates often help the dollar by making dollar-denominated bank deposits and bonds more attractive to global investors.

HEADLINE: Clinton Wreaks Havoc on Research and Policy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Maureen Dowd (column, May 7) characterizes the Clinton Presidency as having become "so becalmed, so shrunken" that it is paralyzed. Would that it were true. Two recent examples illustrate that ill-conceived policies continue to emerge. 
 A final Environmental Protection Agency regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act was published in April that virtually eliminates several industrial sectors of biotechnology research, the most important of which is bioremediation, the use of microorganisms to clean up toxic waste. By capturing for review virtually all field trials of microorganisms crafted with modern biotechnology techniques, the agency insures that researchers will continue to face regulatory roadblocks.
Also in April, the State Department published a policy statement, the theme of which is that environmental issues are of such importance that they are now co-equal with national security and economic issues. Should foreign policy decisions turn on whether France harvests an old-growth forest in Provence or Mexico City decides to build highways instead of a subway system?
Big government is still with us and working overtime against the public interest.

HEADLINE: Winning Friends for Foreign Policy: Albright's First 100 Days

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
When Madeleine K. Albright appears in public or walks along the street, ordinary people rush up to her, as if they know her, and often call her by her first name. She is astonished and pleased, still on a high after 100 days as the first woman to be Secretary of State, and even her security detail is getting used to the attention.
"They don't say Madam Secretary, they call me Madeleine," she said in an interview. "I'm loving it." She has a quick explanation: "People feel that a woman Secretary of State -- this woman -- is approachable, and they are transferring it somehow to demystifying foreign policy. They even say they're reading about it more." 
 But she admits that foreign policy can be a hard sell in a post-Soviet age when the public wants the benefits of peace, not the burdens of global responsibility.
All the adulation does not necessarily mean any important shift or improvement in foreign policy. And Ms. Albright's concentration on public relations has at times meant an oversensitivity among her staff to criticism, some of them admit, especially when it was disclosed that her grandparents had died in the Holocaust and her aides scrambled to find the right balance between openness and privacy.
There is a tendency to react too quickly to problems that get air time, like Ms. Albright's first impulse to propose sending American troops to Albania or the State Department's sudden decision last month to back a particular politician in Zaire, Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, a few days before Parliament ousted him. Her staff blamed another official for the decision. Either way, they acknowledge, the incident was telling.
When Zaire started to collapse, Ms. Albright supported sending her successor at the United Nations, Bill Richardson, to try to persuade President Mobutu Sese Seko to resign in time to forestall a military takeover of the capital and preserve the possibility of elections. But the American effort appeared to be weeks too late.
 
A Tart Tongue Sometimes Cutting
Ms. Albright's first real test will be how she shapes the new atmosphere, in which security seems less urgent, Congress and the President are at odds and her boss, President Clinton, ran most of his first term on the premise that he could afford to be a domestic-policy President because George Bush had been a foreign-policy one.
Having discovered that foreign policy is not just about trade and jobs, Mr. Clinton has found in Ms. Albright not only an adroit politician, but also an articulate defender of the very notion of foreign policy.
So this is not quite Secretary of State as favorite aunt, for Ms. Albright is a workaholic, demands much from her small staff and has a witty, tart and sometimes lashing tongue. But she is still a far cry from the traditionally forbidding image of a distant, stiff man in a dark suit -- Dean Acheson, say -- surrounded by aides.
She revels in her new popularity and sees its political importance. "I'm using that, frankly," she said, to try to restore "a compact between Congress and the American people about doing foreign policy."
But all this attention to public relations and image -- especially while so few senior positions have been filled in the State Department because of more rigorous vetting -- has meant that many areas have been neglected, some senior career officials say.
From Zaire and Albania to China and the Middle East, important aspects of policy have drifted while Ms. Albright has focused on early goals.
At the same time, her popularity and visibility give her more influence in internal Administration battles, particularly with a President made even less bold than usual on foreign policy by the continuing fund-raising scandal. It has helped her with another early goal, to seize back from other Cabinet members pre-eminence for the Secretary of State as the chief voice on foreign policy.
The caressing of the public has been skillful and relentless. After diligent practice, she threw out the first ball at the Baltimore Orioles' opening day. She has appeared on television, worn a variety of hats and been mentioned, to her glee, on National Public Radio's "Car Talk."
 
Hand in Hand With Jesse Helms
Other than a world tour to introduce herself, a quick trip to Moscow and her tag-along with President Clinton to Latin America, she has spent more of her time traveling in the United States than abroad. On several domestic trips, including one to Denver today, in journeys to Capitol Hill and in phone calls to legislators, she has courted public opinion, Congress and Republican leaders.
Ms. Albright says she is trying to establish a popular, bipartisan base for foreign policy -- and its costs -- in a divided Government where the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is the conservative Senator from North Carolina, Jesse Helms, with whom she was photographed walking hand in hand.
After teaching and thinking for years about executive-legislative relations and policy-making, she said, "what I'm trying to do is to connect with the American people in order to get support for foreign policy so we can get money for foreign policy so we can do foreign policy."
Will it work? "Well, we'll have to see," she said, shrugging.
To get the Senate to approve the Chemical Weapons Convention, Ms. Albright urged the White House to give Mr. Helms important concessions, including a State Department reorganization.
But it was also Ms. Albright who went to Michigan to honor former President Gerald R. Ford, and who broke her speech to stare down at Republican critics like Henry A. Kissinger and Dick Cheney, and to say pointedly: "As I look down at my predecessors, I would like to ask you, at a meeting, would you like to sit on the same side as Iraq and Libya, or would you like to sit with all the other countries in the world? I am asking that you do not put the United States and the President and the Secretary of State in that position."
Success brought more relief than rejoicing. But failure to ratify the convention would have been an enormous blow to Mr. Clinton's credibility and endangered more difficult and important tests to come, like NATO expansion, China policy and paying America's bills at the United Nations.
Ms. Albright's essential problem, said Fareed Zakaria, managing editor of the journal Foreign Affairs, is to get Mr. Clinton to be bold. "You take a President ordinarily uninterested in foreign policy and add to it all these scandals, especially the connection between foreign policy and the campaign, and he gets even more gun-shy." On China, for instance, he said, "it's amazing how unable we are to coordinate our policies with the Europeans when our interests are essentially the same."
 
Inner Circle Is a Bit Small
While concentrating on her early priorities, Ms. Albright has been hobbled by the White House's caution in approving the key senior officials she has chosen, recognized heavyweights like Thomas R. Pickering and Stuart E. Eizenstat.
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, has joked: "Madeleine has the strongest team in Government, but unfortunately they're all off the field."
In the meantime, she is making decisions with a small group of close aides who worked with her at the United Nations. They include her chief of staff, Elaine Shocas, and her adviser and future spokesman, James P. Rubin. While extremely bright and protective of their boss, they are more steeped in politics than in global strategy. Wendy Sherman, a friend of Ms. Albright who ran Congressional liaison for Warren Christopher, is to return as "counselor."
Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott has provided much of the coordination, what one official called "less big thinking than how to connect the dots." But his main experience is in Russian affairs and NATO, where Ms. Albright is also strong.
Even on NATO expansion, there is skepticism about the coherence of America's goals. The Romanian Foreign Minister, Adrian Severin, said after meeting State Department officials, "I'm sure the NATO strategy is strong and exists, but we were not able to identify it."
One senior official said: "She needs a couple of people who can say: 'Our overriding strategic objectives need to be here. Let X handle that and you handle this and get the Pentagon to do that. Where do we need to be 12 months from now?' It's too early to say she won't have that, but it's not there now."
Robert B. Zoellick, who played that role for Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in the Bush Administration, is impressed with her fast start. "But everyone knows that will end and people will start to probe into what they're accomplishing," he said, just as bipartisanship will get a harder as mid-term elections approach.
"There's a difference between public relations and a serious public-education strategy," he said. "P.R. is how you get through the day or the meeting and come up with the right quip, and they're very good at that. But how do you use the combination of substance and goals to explain your aims to the Congress and the journalists who cover you regularly?"
 
The Strategy Is Her Game, Too
Asked who will be doing strategy, Ms. Albright said: "With all due respect, I think I'm going to do some of that myself. That's what I do for a living."
When it was suggested that she is too busy to do it, she said, "With this strong team coming on, I will not have to be involved in some of the day-to-day stuff."
Asia policy in particular has drifted, Mr. Zoellick and others say, just when China has become a central issue. One State Department official pointed to Vice President Al Gore's awkward visit to Beijing and his decision to avoid Hong Kong and said, "That trip is a window into the Administration's soul."
The Administration has also decided to play down the Middle East, given the difficulty of dealing with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. In an important speech describing Mr. Clinton's "Foreign Policy Agenda for the Second Term," Mr. Berger did not even mention the Middle East until the middle of page 5 of 7 pages, and only in passing. Privately, she is said to be concerned not to push a policy Mr. Clinton will quickly disavow, and he is reluctant to press Mr. Netanyahu now.
Bosnia, too, seems stalemated. Ms. Albright plans a speech about what can be done before July 1998, when American troops are scheduled to leave. She was also prominent in the imposition of economic sanctions on Myanmar, the former Burma, for rights abuses.
Ms. Albright has reached out for advice. She has talked with Zbigniew Brzezinski; the departing president of the Carnegie Endowment, Morton Abramowitz; the philanthropist George Soros; and Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations.
Working long hours, Ms. Albright says she loves it all. But she has had to order her staff to schedule her day more efficiently, including time for reflection.
She calls her job "a great privilege" and with the remaking of her native central Europe in mind after the cold war, she has put up a portrait of George C. Marshall in her office. She is to give a commencement speech next month at Harvard, where 50 years ago he proposed what became the Marshall Plan.
"We are in one of those phases of history where we are the creators," she said. "So getting it right is really important."

HEADLINE: Switzerland's Debts

 BODY:
Recent disclosures about Switzerland's duplicitous role in World War II and its hoarding of Nazi assets have been wrenching for the Swiss people, many of whom long believed the myth that their country was truly neutral. But the reckoning is not yet over. Switzerland has amends to make, and they must be commensurate with the Nazi wealth Switzerland failed to surrender after the war.
Apportioning responsibility today for misconduct half a century ago is not easy. The United States, which led the Allied battle against Germany, made its own mistakes, including decisions not to accept more Jewish refugees and not to bomb the rail lines leading to Nazi concentration camps. 
 In 1946, in the interests of rebuilding Europe and keeping the Soviet Union at bay, a divided Truman Administration unwisely agreed to let Switzerland return just $58 million of some $400 million in gold the Nazis had looted from conquered governments and transferred to the Swiss National Bank. By today's valuation, the $400 million in gold would be worth roughly $4 billion.
Under the same accord, Switzerland promised to liquidate non-gold German assets worth between $250 million and $750 million ($2.1 billion to $6.1 billion today), and turn over half to the Allies for European reconstruction and assistance to war victims. Switzerland never made good on the commitment, even after the amount it owed was reduced in 1952.
That Switzerland was not alone in its misjudgments does not excuse it from making appropriate restitution today. Switzerland's collaboration with the Nazis was extensive and its moral obtuseness after the war quite remarkable.
Switzerland has no legal obligation to reopen the 1946 agreement, which was a valid though flawed international accord. But moral considerations weigh heavily here. The Nazi gold was stolen by Germany. In some cases, the gold bars were smelted from the jewelry and even dental fillings of slaughtered Jews. Surely full recompense is due now that the history of this gold is clear and the economic and political pressures of the postwar period are just a memory. Swiss responsibility for repaying the non-gold assets seems equally clear.
So far Switzerland has established a $175 million fund for Holocaust victims and proposes to create a $4.7 billion foundation to help people in need around the world, provided Swiss voters approve the project next year. That is far from certain. The Government has also formed an independent commission to review Swiss conduct during the war, and Swiss bankers have belatedly agreed to make a full search for dormant bank accounts left by Jews who were killed in the Holocaust.
None of these steps represent full restitution of Switzerland's unpaid obligations. Should the foundation vote fail, the postwar balance sheet will be largely unchanged. That would be unforgivable.
If Switzerland falls short, the Clinton Administration can freeze an appropriate portion of the $86 billion in public and private funds that Switzerland invests in the United States. It should not come to that. Switzerland has ample resources. The question is whether it has the conviction to act.

HEADLINE: Mr. Ferrer Drops Out

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer may be the first mayoral candidate whose hopes were undone by an empty room. All those televised pictures of vacant tables at Mr. Ferrer's fund-raiser last week, symbolizing his difficulty raising money and winning popular support, could qualify for a list of the top ten signs that your candidacy is in trouble. If Mr. Ferrer did the sensible thing in withdrawing, however, it should also be said that in four months of campaigning he showed an impressive command of city government, a feel for its issues and a personable style. As a strong favorite for re-election as Bronx Borough President, Mr. Ferrer still has an excellent future in city politics.
His decision immediately transforms Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, into the front-runner in the Democratic primary in September. She is way ahead of the other two Democratic challengers, Councilman Sal F. Albanese and the Rev. Al Sharpton, both of whom have had trouble broadening their base of support. Both men see themselves as tribunes for disaffected New Yorkers who have not shared in the economic upturn and have suffered from the cutbacks in city services that were part of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to balance his budget. 
 The thinking among political professionals is that Ms. Messinger must meet the arguments of her Democratic rivals head on even as she moves to the center. Her challenge will be to move beyond her background in Manhattan politics and embrace issues of concern to the middle class in the other four boroughs if she is to have a chance against Mr. Giuliani's re-election bid. Ms. Messinger hopes that her emphasis on preserving families, neighborhoods and schools will do the job.
These are good themes, and New Yorkers deserve a lively debate on all of them. Mr. Giuliani may be tough to beat. Any mayor running for re-election at a time of economic growth and declines in crime, welfare and some taxes would be a formidable opponent. But the city needs a race that focuses on its lingering problems, from collapsing schools to child welfare to economic development strategies. It is not too soon for that debate to begin in earnest.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities' Prices Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday as economic signals were mixed. An initial gain in bond prices caused by a report of slow retail sales quickly gave way to cautious trading as investors waited for more economic data as they try to anticipate whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week.
The 30-year bond slid 13/32, to a price of 96 10/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.92 percent, from 6.89 percent on Monday. 
 Total sales of United States retailers in April fell three-tenths of 1 percent. Even with volatile auto sales excluded, sales were down one-tenth of 1 percent. While the overall decrease was smaller than expected, any decline in sales is generally positive for the bond market, because it indicates that inflation -- which erodes the value of bonds -- is less likely to be a threat. Investors have been concerned that the Fed may raise interest rates again at a policy meeting next week in an effort to slow the economy and head off price increases before they start.
But any positive effect of the retail sales report was quickly snuffed out by a report from the Fed bank of Atlanta indicating surprisingly strong business for manufacturers.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, said: "Clearly, any excitement that was generated by the softer core retail sales figures was quickly extinguished by the explosive outcome of the Atlanta Fed survey.
"With manufacturing continuing to expand at a rapid clip, it is difficult to believe that pockets of softness seen in other sectors of the economy are really going to have an opportunity to slow growth sufficiently."
The only reason that there was not a bigger selloff, he said, is that the market generally follows the retail sales report more closely than the Atlanta Fed survey.
For many investors, yesterday's data did little to alter expectations of another rate increase by the Fed. And while the Producer Price Index, due for release today, and the Consumer Price Index, to be released tomorrow, are expected to be market friendly, traders said they expected only limited gains in bond prices, because favorable reports have already been factored into the current prices.
While the Fed's intentions regarding rates are still the main question for traders, action by the central bank helped buoy prices yesterday. The Fed went into the market to buy $1.485 billion in securities for its own account, in a move known as a coupon pass, which adds cash to the banking system. The Fed bought securities that are maturing between Nov. 15, 1997, and April 30, 1999.
Countering the positive effect of the coupon pass was the continuing weakness in the dollar in currency trading. A strong dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors, not only for the high rate of return but also because of the potential for gains in currency translation.
Elsewhere, a deluge of new corporate debt may make it difficult for Government securities to make headway. Among the corporate paper that is expected to come to market this week is the Norfolk Southern Corporation's $3.5 billion debt offering, whose higher yields are likely to detract from demand for Treasury securities. In addition, the firms managing sales of corporate debt often hedge against possible losses by selling Government securities before the corporate bonds come to market.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Down 0.3% Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
The nation's consumers, after spending at a surprisingly strong pace during the first months of the year, have sharply cut back on shopping, with April posting the first monthly decline in retail sales since the start of the Christmas holiday season.
The Commerce Department estimated today that shoppers spent three-tenths of 1 percent less last month than in March as automotive sales and nearly all other major categories weakened. Moreover, a small March rise vanished through revision. 
 The latest sales figures, which were expected to provide a clue to whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again next Tuesday, were widely seen as confirming that the economy had begun to decelerate from first-quarter growth that was the fastest so far of the 1990's -- a 5.6 percent annual pace.
But in light of several distorting factors this year -- unusual winter weather, income tax season, an early Easter and New York's moratorium on sales taxes -- analysts said they could not clearly distinguish between a new, sustainable trend in retail sales and what might turn out to be simply a breather followed by renewed strong growth. And that left many of them saying that the Fed was still likely to raise interest rates, probably next week but certainly within the next few months, unless clearer signs of a slowdown emerge.
"You can't tell how much is seasonal impact and how much is a genuinely slower pace of demand," said Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Tucker Anthony in New York.
Howard Keen Jr., an economist for Conrail, was similarly skeptical. "It's quite premature to be calling this any kind of a significant downshifting," he said.
Although various other data, including two gauges of inflation, are to be published before the Fed's policy meeting on Tuesday, today's tally of retail sales is probably the last critical figure the Fed will have before the meeting. Retail sales not only account for one-third of economic activity but are one of the most up-to-date indicators available to monetary officials.
Today's soft sales results were in line with expectations and prompted no clear reaction on Wall Street. Interest rates initially edged lower, helping power the Dow Jones industrial average above 7,300 for the first time, but after a report from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank indicated that manufacturing activity in the South had picked up speed, both markets reversed course and ended with losses.
While analysts generally regarded the sales report as one straw in the wind against Fed action, the dominant view seemed to be that the Fed would probably still raise rates, given an unemployment rate below 5 percent and industry running at a robust pace that is using more than 84 percent of capacity.
"It gives them a little more opportunity not to tighten next week but it would take a lot more weakness than we've seen so far to forestall it," said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, warned last week of a need for higher rates unless the economy slowed, but it was unclear whether he was expecting immediate confirmation of a slowdown or was prepared to wait for more solid evidence of the longer-term trend.
William C. Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, dismissed the notion that today's figures represented a significant slowdown in consumer spending. Rather, he contended that the weak sales were merely the "flip side" of early-year strength that owed much to such temporary factors as mild shopping weather and income tax refunds that were bigger than in the past and were received earlier than usual.
Still, Mr. Dudley added, "this does give Chairman Greenspan one more arrow in his quiver to argue for waiting" when the Fed deliberates next week.
James McCormick, an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust, expressed a common view when he said the Fed faced "a close call" but one that "slightly favors" a quarter-point rate increase.
"Supports for consumer spending are still in place," he noted, "including a strong labor market, rising real incomes and increased wealth from financial markets."
The decline in April retail sales, which was the first since November and the biggest since June, included a drop of five-tenths of 1 percent for durable goods. That mainly resulted from automotive sales, which fell nine-tenths of 1 percent. Merchants selling furniture and other home equipment reported receipts were three-tenths of 1 percent below the previous month, while sales were unchanged for those selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes.
Among nondurables, the biggest drop was a fall of nine-tenths of 1 percent at department stores and other general merchandisers. Other declines were six-tenths of 1 percent in apparel; five-tenths of 1 percent in food, and one-tenth of 1 percent for gasoline stations (where prices fell) and for drugstores.
The only sales increase -- five-tenths of 1 percent -- was at restaurants and bars.
In all, retail sales -- unadjusted for inflation -- were 4.9 percent higher than in April 1996, reaching an estimated $212.2 billion.

HEADLINE: Stocks Move a Bit Lower As the Rally Takes a Pause

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks edged lower yesterday, hurt by concerns that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates next week.
The Dow Jones industrial average bobbed above 7,300 for the first time, but ended the day at 7,274.21, down 18.54 points from Monday's record finish. 
 Most broad market measures also retreated after struggling to extend Monday's rally. The Dow rose 123 points Monday, bringing its bounce from April's lows to 900 points.
"You cannot have the market continue to move up at the rate it's been moving," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John Hancock Funds in Boston. "The market is a little overdone on the upside and needs to rest and consolidate."
The Nasdaq market suffered the heaviest damage yesterday as Intel slid sharply on news that it had been sued by Digital Equipment, which accused Intel of patent infringement.
The bond market briefly provided some support for stocks after a report that retail sales fell three-tenths of 1 percent in April, slightly more than expected and the biggest decline in 10 months.
The decline in retail activity bolstered the recent optimism that the economy's vigorous pace is easing enough to keep inflationary pressures under control without another move by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates.
But analysts said the retail sales report, as well as reports today on producer prices and tomorrow on consumer prices could have little impact on next Tuesday's meeting of Fed policy makers.
"Even with good numbers showing no inflation, it doesn't mean the Fed won't raise rates," Mr. Freedman said. "They've said all along that they're trying to stay ahead of the inflation curve."
Stocks gave back their early gains as bonds retreated, increasing long-term interest rates, and the slide steepened after a Federal Reserve official asserted that consumer activity remained strong.
Al Broaddus, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said yesterday that "the time to resist inflation is precisely when there is no inflation."
 Declining issues outnumbered those advancing by about a 13-to-12 margin on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.53 points, to 833.13, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.60 points, to 433.97. Both measures had closed at record highs in Monday's advance.
The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.60 points, to 1,333.59, as Intel tumbled 6 3/4, to 152 3/8, on news of the lawsuit by Digital, which rose 2 1/4, to 35 3/8, on the Big Board.
Among other issues, Wal-Mart Stores rose 1/4, to 30. The company, the nation's largest retailer, reported after the market closed on Monday that its first-quarter earnings had risen 14 percent.
Shares of Owens-Illinois rose 3/8, to 28 7/8. The company sold 14.75 million shares yesterday at an offering price of 28 1/2, raising $420.3 million.
Inbrand surged 10 7/8, to 26 7/8, on news that Tyco International had agreed to acquire the company for stock valued at $320 million, or $27.20 a share. Inbrand makes disposable adult incontinence products.
Boston Chicken shares fell 3/4, to 22 1/16, after the restaurant chain was cut to "market outperform" from "trading buy" by Goldman, Sachs & Company.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
10 Years Later, I.B.M. Sets a New High in a Changed Market

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
This is a tale of how the dominant can fade, and how technology, unlike most other industries, can see huge companies shrink and smaller ones become behemoths.
On a summer day nearly a decade ago, the shares of the International Business Machines Corporation, then the dominant maker of computers and by far the largest company in the country, hit a record high of $175.875. It was the only company in the land with a market value of more than $100 billion. 
 Yesterday, for the first time since that day -- Aug. 21, 1987 -- I.B.M., no longer dominant but once again in favor on Wall Street, rose above its old high, peaking at $177.125 a share in New York Stock Exchange trading, before closing at $173.625.
Yet I.B.M. is now only No. 9 among all American companies, and just No. 3 among technology companies, in market value. It is far behind Intel and Microsoft, companies that at the end of August 1987 were together worth less than a tenth of what I.B.M. was worth.
The No. 1 company now is the General Electric Company, which makes everything from jet engines to refrigerators, but which has seen its biggest growth in financial services. Yesterday, it became the first corporation to be valued at more than $200 billion, compared with just $57 billion in that summer of 1987, when it was the third-largest company.
The fall and recovery of I.B.M. -- which bottomed on Aug. 16, 1993, at $40.625 a share, or 77 percent below its peak -- has come amid one of the great bull markets and amid a changing of the guard atop corporate America. Now there are seven companies worth more than $100 billion, and I.B.M. is worth only $86 billion.
How, one might ask, can the company be worth about 15 percent less than it was in 1987, when the stock price is roughly equal? The answer lies with financial engineering, at which I.B.M. has excelled in recent years even as its share of the computer market has slipped.
From the end of 1994 through March 31, I.B.M. has spent $13.2 billion on share repurchases, as noted in the current issue of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. During the same period, it has spent $9.9 billion on research and development. With fewer shares outstanding, the overall market value is lower, even though the per-share figure is higher.
Comparing the lists of America's highest-valued companies in 1987 and now shows how things have changed. There were then two computer-related companies among the top 10. Now there are three.
But while I.B.M. has fallen from first to ninth, the Digital Equipment Corporation was then the second-largest computer maker and No. 10 over all. As of Monday, it ranked 324th, according to Bloomberg Financial Markets.
The two new computer-related companies are Microsoft and Intel, now ranked fourth and fifth. Both owe their high position in part to opportunities opened up by I.B.M., which used Microsoft's operating system and Intel's semiconductors when it invaded and greatly expanded the personal computer market. One can only imagine how different the world would be had I.B.M. managed to maintain control, or at least a sizable stake, in those two markets as the PC market grew.
Over all, five of the top 10 a decade ago are still on the list. The Exxon Corporation has fallen from second to third, the Philip Morris Companies has climbed from eighth to seventh and Merck & Company has moved from ninth to sixth.
The other corporations that have fallen from the top 10 -- AT&T, General Motors, Du Pont and Ford Motor -- all remain in the top 40 and are leaders in their industries. AT&T would still be among the top 10 had it not spun off Lucent Technologies and NCR last year. The other three newcomers to the top 10 -- Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson -- were in the top 25 in 1987.
Only in technology can companies come from nowhere to reach the top in a decade -- or vice versa. In August 1987, Intel was valued at about $6 billion by the stock market, and Microsoft at about $3 billion. Now the figures are $125 billion and $142 billion, respectively.
Of the top 10 in 1987, the computer companies are the only ones with lower market capitalizations now than then. Digital has gone from $25 billion to about $5 billion. An aside on Digital: It was an early adherent to the theory, which it did well in selling to Wall Street, that dividends do not matter because it is better for a company to plow its profits back into the business. As a result, owners of that stock in the last decade have not only lost money -- Digital's price is down 81 percent from August 1987 -- they have not gotten any dividends that would cushion the blow.
I.B.M. has always paid a dividend, which it has just raised to 40 cents a quarter, up from 35 cents but well below the $1.10 quarterly it was paying when the stock last was hitting new highs. Since August 1987, a holder who stuck with I.B.M. has collected $31.08 in dividends for each share.
The new technology leaders are closer to Digital, at least in dividend philosophy. Microsoft has never paid a dividend; while Intel has been making payouts since 1992, they are not exactly generous. It now pays 5 cents a quarter, or 20 cents a year -- a dividend yield on the current stock price of $152.375 of one-tenth of 1 percent a year.
On that summer day in 1987 when I.B.M. last set a high, the Dow Jones industrial average did the same, closing at a record 2,709.20. The Dow would reach one more high that year, on the following Tuesday, and then plunge in the October market crash. It would be another two years, in August 1989, before the Dow again set a new high. The Dow is now up 167 percent from its 1987 peak.
I.B.M. is the last of the 30 stocks now in the Dow to rise above its 1987 peak. Two stocks then in the Dow -- but removed this year as Dow Jones pruned losers -- remain below their 1987 peaks. They are Bethlehem Steel and Woolworth.
And, of course, I.B.M.'s stock price still has not kept up with inflation. Adjusting for the rise of the Consumer Price Index, I.B.M. is still 28 percent below its 1987 peak.

HEADLINE: Rent Debate: Drama Is Familiar

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 13

 BODY:
The day after Gov. George E. Pataki announced his plan to broker a compromise that would gradually end rent regulations, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver was still saying that he wanted the laws extended, untouched. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, arguing that the Governor's plan did not go far enough, was still saying he wanted the laws abolished in a handful of years. Compromise seemed as distant as ever.
Far from softening their stances, the legislative leaders seemed prepared today to battle over the laws until the hour they are scheduled to expire, at midnight on June 15. They accused each other of intransigence, marshaled support for their positions and issued dire warnings about each other's plans. 
 In what seemed like a coordinated campaign, Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bruno, both Republicans, accused Mr. Silver, a Democrat of Manhattan, of trying to frighten tenants for political gain. Mr. Bruno defiantly reiterated his threat to allow the laws to expire unless Mr. Silver agreed to a plan to bring about their end.
"If the Speaker stays where he is, he's going to have the full responsibility for this law expiring, and every tenant will suffer and be hurt," said Mr. Bruno, of Rensselaer County, across the Hudson from Albany.
Mr. Silver returned the Republicans' accusations. "I would think the Governor should look at the record as to who has been frightening tenants," he said. "He and his colleague, the majority leader, came out in December telling tenants he was going to end the rent laws."
So where does this leave the 2.5 million people in regulated apartments who are subjected almost daily to the anxiety-raising news flashes about the future of the rules? Are things as hopeless as they seem?
Like almost everything the Legislature touches, the answer is not clear. Though some people might think there is not much time left before the expiration of the laws, 33 days is an eternity in Albany, where politicians habitually wait until moments before a deadline to work out compromises on thorny issues. That means there will be a lot more saber rattling on the rent laws before anyone will publicly admit a willingness to budge.
That is partly because both Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver want to look as if they are fighting until the last minute for their constituencies: for Mr. Silver, urban tenants; for Mr. Bruno, landlords and business interests.
May 20 looms as important in this political dance, because on that day thousands of tenants, probably accompanied by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his Democratic challengers, will trek to Albany for demonstrations in support of extending the laws. For symbolic as well as negotiating purposes, neither side, particularly not Mr. Silver, wants to display any signs of weakness before then.
But major philosophical and policy differences also separate the Governor and the two leaders that will be extraordinarily difficult to bridge. How do you find a middle ground when one side insists that the system has been a disaster and must be dismantled, and the other contends it has provided immeasurable benefits and must be defended at all costs?
"It is an issue that won't submit to compromise," said John Zogby, a pollster from the Syracuse area. "You've got to take one side or the other: preserve it or get rid of it. Any effort to walk the middle ground becomes obviously just that: a dodge."
Of the three leaders, Mr. Pataki has the most difficult balancing act. He does not want to alienate city voters or his fellow Republican, Mr. Giuliani, by endorsing Mr. Bruno's call to end rent protections immediately. But as a proponent of free markets and smaller government, he also does not want to continue a system forever that many economists say has deprived landlords of a fair return on their investments and discouraged new housing.
What the Governor proposed earlier this week attempts to walk both paths. He called for expanding a policy known as luxury decontrol, under which rent protections would be immediately abolished for people earning more than $175,000 a year for two consecutive years, except for tenants who are over 62 or disabled. He also proposed allowing landlords to charge market rates on apartments once they are vacated, a policy known as vacancy decontrol, which would eventually eliminate the limits on all 1.1 million regulated apartments.
Still, neither Mr. Silver nor Mr. Bruno was willing publicly to embrace the Governor's proposal today, even though it contains elements both sides like. Mr. Bruno, who is the Governor's main ally in the Legislature, said today that he considered Mr. Pataki's plan "closer to mine" than to Mr. Silver's, but still raised objections to it.
In particular, Mr. Bruno says he wants a definite date for ending most rent laws, something Mr. Pataki says he opposes. While vacancy decontrol would eventually accomplish that goal, it could take many years.
"When should it end?" he asked. "The Governor says maybe 30 years, maybe two centuries. That's unacceptable. I'm saying some reasonable, realistic length of time. I said two years, maybe it's four, maybe it's five. It sure isn't 20 or 30."
Besides setting a definite date for ending rent regulations altogether, Mr. Bruno said he would insist on decontrol for all apartments that become vacant before that date. That way, landlords could get immediate relief on vacated apartments while they were waiting for the rules to expire.
Many politicians in Albany have privately suggested that one avenue for compromise might be some form of limited vacancy decontrol, under which rent protections are lifted only on costly apartments as they become vacant. That policy already exists for units renting for $2,000 or more a month, and could be expanded by including less expensive apartments.
But Mr. Bruno seemed to close the door to that idea today, saying he would not allow any bill to pass in the Senate unless it included vacancy decontrol for all regulated apartments, regardless of their rent. "It absolutely will not get through the Senate," he said, referring to any form of limited vacancy decontrol.
That leaves Mr. Silver. Today, after Mr. Bruno, Mr. Pataki, former Mayor Edward I. Koch and the editorial boards of several major newspapers all called on him to be more flexible about scaling back the laws, he still was not budging.
Republicans say they think that Mr. Silver is playing a waiting game because he thinks voters will blame Mr. Pataki if the rent laws lapse, forcing him to accept a Democratic plan. But today, aides to Mr. Silver denied that.
"There is no such cockiness on this side," said a Silver aide, speaking on condition of anonymity. "People just need to wait until we get closer to the 15th."

HEADLINE: For a Flood-Stricken Town, Hope Is a Next-Door Neighbor to Despair

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: FALMOUTH, Ky., May 11

 BODY:
Rigg Street will never be the same. The Licking River made sure of that when it tore through the block and the rest of this small town like a tornado two months ago, ripping houses off their foundations and floating away cars, trucks, mobile homes, people and dreams in its angry, fast-moving flood waters.
Bob Wellman and his wife are the only people living on the street these days. Mr. Wellman recently spent an afternoon trying to hook up a makeshift sewer line to a used camping trailer parked on a muddy lot where his home once stood. He and his wife live in the trailer and pray they can get enough Federal disaster relief to build a new home outside of town, far from the Licking River. 
 "The river is going to go crazy again," Mr. Wellman said as he sawed a piece of plastic pipe. "But I'm not going to be here to see it. Whatever the Government offers me for my property, it's theirs."
Before the flood there were 25 families living on Rigg Street in tiny houses that meant the world to them. They are people like Ricky Cookendorfer and his mother, Dorothy, who has lived most of her 79 years on the street.
"It used to be nothing but families looking out for each other around here," Mr. Cookendorfer said. "That's all gone now."
But Mrs. Cookendorfer, now living with her daughter outside of town, is determined to return to Rigg, one of the hardest hit stretches of Falmouth, even if she is the only living soul left on a block of ghosts.
"This is home," she said. "I'm not going to let the river run me off."
Throughout the Midwest, cities and towns from Grand Forks, N.D., on the Red River to hamlets along the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers were devastated this spring by some of the most widely scattered flooding across the nation in years.
So far this year, 516 counties in 16 states have been declared major disaster areas in separate occurrences. Though complete damage assessments will not be clear for some time yet, the cost to recover from the flooding in the upper Midwest alone is expected to run into the billions.
While hardly the biggest town in the area to be submerged by the flooding, Falmouth, population 2,400 and about an hour's drive south of Cincinnati, was among the hardest hit. Five people here were killed -- more deaths by floods than any one town suffered. And in Falmouth, which sits at a bend in the Licking, more than 400 homes were damaged or destroyed when the swollen river, instead of following the bend, went straight across town.
The story of Rigg Street and Falmouth is partly one of surrender and sorrow, but mostly it is a story of a determined struggle to rebuild homes, businesses and hope. It is also a look into the future for other towns and cities, like the much bigger Grand Forks, which are in the earlier stages of putting back together lives and livelihoods torn apart by rivers gone crazy.
It is an uncertain future, as anyone in Falmouth could testify.
Falmouth is the seat of Pendleton County, where unemployment before the flood was 5 percent, about equal to the national level. Now the jobless rate is 15 percent, because many businesses have not reopened.
On some streets, like Rigg, there are almost as many vacant lots as buildings. Bulldozers knocked down dozens of homes too badly damaged by the flood to be repaired.
But there are also signs of hope springing up. McDonald's restaurant, the Dairy Queen and Wyatt's, the only grocery store in town, have reopened.
"It's still going to take years for us to come back to where we were," said a Falmouth City Council member, Jeff Carson. "For lack of a better term, we're making our way through uncharted waters."
More than two months have passed since the Licking stormed its banks and flooded at least 60 percent of the town in early March. But hundreds of Falmouth residents are still unsure when or if they will be able to return to their homes. So as they wait and worry, they sleep on sofas and spare beds in the homes of family and friends, or move into "New Hope," a village of mobile homes supplied by the Federal Government, two miles south of town.
"People are scattered in all directions," said Jack Wright, executive director of the Pendleton County Economic Development Authority.
Finding flood refugees a roof is Bill Hopper's job. Before the flood he was a geologist who inspected coal mines for the Kentucky Department of Surface Planning. Since the flood he has been on loan to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, helping locate housing. In the last 60 days he has put 7,000 miles on his blue, mud-splattered state truck.
"It's the best job I ever had," Mr. Hopper said as he stood on a porch of a flood-damaged house here on South Liberty Street. "I've got good news for people for a change. I got a place for them to live."
Lately, Mr. Hopper has been arranging for travel trailers to be set up next to homes now undergoing repairs so the owners do not have as far to go to work on their homes. He said he and other F.E.M.A. workers were surprised that they had not been busier. He said the demand for housing assistance is not as great as relief agencies had expected.
"There are ghost towns out there, and we don't know where the people are," he said. "They're not coming to F.E.M.A. Here in Kentucky, you got four or five generations of a clan living next to each other, and they're taking each other in."
Federal officials say 85 mobile homes have been set up at New Hope, and 37 are occupied. The site has a capacity of 162. Mr. Hopper and F.E.M.A. officials have set up 21 travel trailers in Falmouth, including the one next door to 410 Liberty, the home of Tony and Beth Spence and their two small children.
Until a week ago, the Spences had been living with her family near Cincinnati, which made her husband arrive late for work almost every morning since the flood.
"We're so lucky to have this trailer," Mrs. Spence said. "I never thought I'd miss Falmouth so much."
The couple hope to be back in their home, a one-and-a-half-story house, in a couple of weeks. They thought hard about not returning. The flood took so much: toys, appliances, a grandmother's dining room set.
"But there's something about a small town that makes you want to hold on," Mrs. Spence said. "In a small town, people know your name at the grocery store, at the bank. We're just going to pray that it doesn't happen again. I can't go through this again."
A lot of her neighbors have decided not to rebuild, at least not anywhere near the river. Federal officials say 212 applications have been filed in Falmouth for a buyout program.
Using a combination of Federal, state and local money, the authorities hope to buy as many of the most seriously flood-damaged properties in town as they can, so the homeowners can salvage as much of their lives as possible and either move out of town or rebuild on higher ground.
Statewide, the program has a budget of about $16 million. But Falmouth was only one of dozens of Kentucky towns hit by flooding this spring. Falmouth officials say they need at least $8 million for the buyout program, and they have no idea how much money they will receive from the Government. They also have no idea what the cash-strapped town will do with the lots if it buys them.
"It's going to be a nightmare," said Terry England, the Falmouth treasurer. "How do we maintain the lots? We don't have any money."
Unlike in Grand Forks, where city officials knew for weeks that melting snow would make the Red River dangerously high, and where the land is so flat that flood waters spread relatively slowly, the Licking turned deadly almost overnight after a day of heavy rain on Feb. 28.
People here talk in terms of hours, not days, when they recall how fast the water took over their town. One longtime resident, Bob Pettit, said that the water was ankle deep one minute, and 15 minutes later was up to his thigh and moving so fast that a strong man could barely walk through it.
"It was a humbling experience," he said. "But I'm through with crying. We're going to get back to normal. We're stubborn."
And in Falmouth, normal means going to buy groceries at Wyatt's, which has been part of the town in one form or another for 52 years, ever since Abe and Ruby Wyatt started selling eggs and milk from the back of an old truck. Soon they built a store, and in 1990 the family opened a sparkling supermarket on the edge of town and the river.
The flood sent nearly six and a half feet of water into the store. Mrs. Wyatt, an 81-year-old widow, had to lay off all 50 employees, and the business lost about $1 million.
Until the store reopened last Wednesday, the people of Falmouth had to drive 20 miles or more to buy groceries. "But when you're knocked down," Mrs. Wyatt said, "the only thing to do is get up."
A few blocks from Wyatt's, Mrs. Cookendofer sat in a swing on her porch at 416 Rigg Street. The swing was one of the few items the river did not steal from her. Inside, her family was painting and cleaning. A new stove sat in the middle of the living room, waiting to be installed when the kitchen is finished. She hopes to move back home in a week or so.
Across the street, on a crooked porch covered in mud and debris left from the flood, was a rust-colored dog, a chow, apparently abandoned by the people who lived in the house before the river chased them out. Any time someone approaches the dog it runs away, only to return to his lonely vigil when the person leaves.
"We bring him food and water," Mrs. Cookendofer said. "He's the only neighbor we've got right now, and on Rigg Street we take care of our neighbors."

RUTH W. MESSINGER
In prepared remarks outside Public School 234 in lower Manhattan, she outlined her differences with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani on a number of issues:
"Rudy Giuliani doesn't see the devastating effects of the budget cuts he has loosed upon the city's public school children. 
 He doesn't see the neighborhoods where the number of cops on the beat is going down.
He doesn't see the need to fight to make sure 2.6 million New Yorkers continue to have rent protection.
He doesn't see the one out of every 10 New Yorkers without jobs -- he says that a rising unemployment rate is really a good sign for New York.
If Rudy doesn't see the problems New Yorkers face, he can't fix them. And if he can't fix them, he should no longer be the Mayor.
I see the problems. And, as Mayor, I will fix them.
I've seen the problems in our schools. And, as Mayor, I will fix them. I will undo the damage the Mayor has done and restore our schools to excellence.
I will work with, not against, the Chancellor to cut class sizes. I will raise standards and lift scores, restock school libraries and make sure our kids don't have to attend class in converted closets or restrooms.
And, as Mayor, I will not balance the city's budget on the backs of our public schools."

HEADLINE: Rent Decontrol Study: From No Impact to 30% Increases

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
A study commissioned by New York City has found that allowing rent increases once an apartment falls vacant, a policy recommended by Gov. George E. Pataki, would have a limited impact on the rent of most apartments during the next two years. But a few areas, including the Upper West Side, would see rent increases as high as 30 percent, the study found.
The study, co-sponsored by the city's Rent Guidelines Board and by the Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at the New York University School of Law, addresses the potential effect of vacancy decontrol, as the policy is known, over two years, and does not consider a longer term. The results are based on data from the city's official 1996 Housing and Vacancy Survey. 
 As expected, the study suggests that vacancy decontrol would have the greatest effect on rents in Manhattan, where market rates are highest. It predicted significant increases above 96th Street in Manhattan, averaging 24 percent, since market rents are much higher than regulated rents in those neighborhoods. It also found that rents in newly vacated apartments in Stuyvesant Town and Turtle Bay would rise an average of 14 percent. In Chelsea, Clinton and Midtown, rents would rise an average of 23 percent upon becoming vacant.
The study predicts the tenants who would most likely leave their apartments in the next two years: those who are younger, single, or couples without children who live in apartments where the difference between the regulated and market-rate rents is smallest.
Over the longer term, rents on newly deregulated apartments would likely rise by even higher levels, the study's authors say. That is because apartments that become vacant in the first two years after decontrol would generally have regulated rents that are close to market levels.
"Over the long run, as people who currently enjoy the biggest rent discounts move out of their apartments, we can expect substantially larger increases," said Michael Schill, director of the N.Y.U. law school's real estate institute.
On Monday, Governor Pataki proposed eliminating rent protections on apartments as they become vacant, a plan that would eventually end a half-century-old system that limits increases on 1.1 million apartments in the state, most of them in New York City.
Tenant advocates, including Democrats in Albany, oppose any plan that would lift rent regulations, arguing that vacancy decontrol would encourage landlords to harass tenants to make them move out. Landlords, backed by Republicans who have supported efforts to eliminate regulation quickly, criticized Mr. Pataki's proposal as too weak. Without some form of agreement, rent regulation is scheduled to expire on June 16.
The study was conducted by Dr. Edgar O. Olsen, a professor of economics at the University of Virginia. It compared the rents of regulated apartments with the rents on similar market-rate units in the same neighborhoods.
"We commissioned this study in January, anticipating that the debate might come down to vacancy decontrol," said Douglas P. Hillstrom, executive director of the Rent Guidelines Board, the city agency that sets annual increases for rent-stabilized apartments. "We didn't have any idea that the report would be as timely as it's proven to be." It was completed on Monday.
Across the city, the study said, the median increase on vacant apartments would be $32 a month, or an average of 4 percent. The change would vary; many neighborhoods would see small increases or none at all, and some neighborhoods would see sizable increases in rents, the study said.
The study breaks down its figures by sections of boroughs taken from the Housing and Vacancy Survey. In Manhattan, the calculations show, rents would rise in Greenwich Village and the financial district by a monthly average of $131, or 12 percent, but would not change on the Lower East Side and in Chinatown. On the Upper West Side, the increases would average $293, or 30 percent, and on the Upper East Side, $108, or 11 percent. Perhaps surprisingly, the increase in Manhattan above 96th Street would average $147, or 24 percent, a month.
Asked why the northern part of Manhattan would experience relatively high increases, Dr. Olsen said that in general the estimates for the smaller areas "are less reliable than for the city as a whole."
He added: "And this problem was especially severe in a few cases, such as Manhattan above 96th Street, because of the small number of unregulated units available to estimate market rents. In central Harlem, for example, there were only four unregulated buildings that were surveyed."
In greatly simplified terms, the study used data from previous Housing and Vacancy Surveys to predict which types of tenants would most likely vacate their apartments in the next two years. Data from the 1996 survey were then used to estimate what the market rate rent for those newly vacated apartments would become if they were decontrolled.
In Brooklyn, the projected increases per month ranged from $59, or 10 percent, in southern Crown Heights, and $38, or 7 percent, in Sheepshead Bay, Gravesend, Flatlands and Canarsie, to no increase for sections like East New York, Brownsville, Williamsburg and Greenpoint. Flatbush would experience an average increase of $13, or 2 percent, the study said, while, surprisingly, apartments in Brooklyn Heights, Fort Greene, Park Slope, and Carroll Gardens would see no increases on average.
Asked to explain that finding, Professor Schill said Brooklyn has a large number of areas in which the average stabilized rent is close to market rates.
"The average stabilized rent in Brooklyn Heights is 90 percent of the unregulated market rent, which is fairly close," he said. "And in Park Slope, it's even closer, 96 percent of the unregulated rent."
As expected, landlord and tenant advocates took widely divergent views on the study.
"The independent study by the Rent Guidelines Board and N.Y.U. answers the first big lie that has always been trotted out by tenant leaders, that rents will skyrocket in every part of the city," said Joseph Strasburg, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the city's largest landlord organization. "What this study confirms is that most of the benefits of rent regulation are primarily in Manhattan."
Michael McKee, the rent law campaign manager for the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, referred to the only previous period of vacancy decontrol in New York, from 1971 to 1974, and said: "It was really devastating. There was an enormous amount of evictions and eviction attempts."
"This study is predicated on the assumption that no one will move, except voluntarily," Mr. McKee continued. "There will be a replay of history and landlords will go wild."

It compares the regulated rent to that of a similar market-rate apartment, taking into account numerous factors, including the apartment's size, age, condition, facilities and neighborhood; the building's size, age and condition and the condition of other buildings in the area.

HEADLINE: WITH FERRER OUT, MESSINGER FOCUSES ON FACING GIULIANI

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
With her main Democratic adversary stepping aside, Ruth W. Messinger yesterday sought to transform the mayoral race into a two-person contest with Rudolph W. Giuliani, ignoring her remaining Democratic rivals as she demanded a one-on-one debate with the Mayor.
Mr. Giuliani laughed off Ms. Messinger's demand for an early debate, which she said should be devoted to the candidates' differences on New York's endangered rent control system. But he heartily concurred with Ms. Messinger's assertion that this has become a two-person race, and in a hint of the general election ahead, painted the Manhattan Borough President as ideologically out of step with a changing city and a Manhattan partisan unable to relate to the four other boroughs. 
 The give and take between two politicians who now seemed poised to dominate New York's political life for the next six months occurred after Fernando Ferrer announced yesterday that he was quitting the mayoral race, choosing instead to run for a third term as Bronx borough president. Mr. Ferrer said he was halting his troubled campaign and endorsing Ms. Messinger to avoid a divisive primary that would insure Mr. Giuliani's re-election.
Mr. Ferrer's abrupt exit put Ms. Messinger in the spotlight. She quickly sought to take advantage of the unusual, if welcome, sight of microphone-wielding reporters and camera operators trailing her through the streets of lower Manhattan to a news conference. With the trim and gleaming backdrop of Public School 234 behind her -- and clearly enjoying what one adviser described as the biggest soapbox of her life -- Ms. Messinger engaged in the time-honored political tactic of challenging an incumbent to a debate, while laying out some of the themes that she will bring to the contest.
"My mom and dad used to tell me that you can't solve a problem you don't see," Ms. Messinger said, as an aide cleared out people behind her to insure cameras a clear shot of the school. Listing difficulties with public schools, rent protection and street police patrols, she concluded: "If Rudy doesn't see the problems New Yorkers face, he can't fix them. And if he can't fix them, he should no longer be the Mayor."
Notwithstanding Ms. Messinger's sudden dominance in the Democratic primary, her two remaining opponents, Councilman Sal F. Albanese and the Rev. Al Sharpton, both signaled that they were not prepared to give up. Mr. Albanese and Mr. Sharpton trail Ms. Messinger in endorsements, money and early opinion polls. But they have reputations as articulate and innovative mavericks, willing to take risks to advance their candidacies.
"There's no way in the world we're going to have a campaign coronation for Ruth Messinger," Mr. Albanese said. "I'm a much stronger candidate." He described her as the Mayor's "dream candidate," and predicted she would be demolished by Mr. Giuliani because she was too liberal on too many issues.
Mr. Sharpton disputed the idea of a two-person race. "The pundits say what they want," Mr. Sharpton said. "We have grown even in their polls. We have grown in fund-raising. We believe that we can be successful. The people that I speak for must be heard. The people that I've tried to represent must be at the table."
Mr. Sharpton also said that, the way the race was shaping up, every major party candidate for citywide office -- mayor, public advocate and comptroller -- was white. "We cannot end this century with an all-white Republican slate facing an all-white Democratic slate in a city that's majority people of color," he said.
Indeed, there were signs yesterday that if Ms. Messinger was now being seen as the inevitable Democratic nominee, which she was, it was creating as much of a sense of resignation as of celebration. Many New York professional political leaders had endorsed Mr. Ferrer precisely because they were wary that Ms. Messinger, with her Manhattan base and longtime affiliation with liberal causes, would present the Mayor with an easy political target.
And the Mayor and his political aides happily fed those anxieties yesterday. Fran Reiter, the Mayor's campaign manager, did not even wait for Mr. Ferrer to finish his withdrawal news conference before launching the artillery at Ms. Messinger.
As Mr. Ferrer spoke at the bottom of the steps of City Hall, Ms. Reiter assembled a news contingent at the top, where she called Ms. Messinger a renegade from 1960's.
Even Mr. Ferrer, in endorsing Ms. Messinger, could not bring himself to rebut the notion that she was too liberal to win a race against Mr. Giuliani. "That's a knock that I have never made," said Mr. Ferrer, who would like to run again for Mayor in 2001. "Apparently some others have, and they'll have to answer for it."
Mr. Ferrer's remarks, as well as his withdrawal, reflected a widespread sentiment among Democrats that Mr. Giuliani would be exceedingly difficult to defeat, given the city's ascending economy and descending crime rate.
Ms. Messinger shrugged off such questions as she made the best of her sudden political celebrity. Her decision to challenge Mr. Giuliani to a debate on the rent regulations was a last-minute addition to her speech, reflecting what asides said would be a new aggressiveness to a campaign that many Democrats believe has been, until now, listless.
Messinger campaign aides said they did not expect Mr. Giuliani to ever agree to a debate so early. But her aides calculated that such a gambit would bring attention both to her and her proposal that city residents in a referendum, rather than the State Legislature in a public vote, be allowed to decide the future the rent regulation system.
"I've made it clear where I stand," Ms. Messinger said. "I'm for a referendum in New York City by New Yorkers on the issue of rent regulation. It's time for Rudy to come out and tell New Yorkers where he stands on this issue. I challenge him to a debate immediately on rent regulation and rent protection for New Yorkers."
Mr. Giuliani supports the continuation of rent regulations and has called in the past for control of the system to be given to New York City. Ms. Messinger has refused to say what changes she wants in the system, other than having it extended for two years and studied further.
At the same time, Ms. Messinger, in her position as Manhattan Borough President, began airing radio advertising yesterday promoting the rent regulation proposal. Her aides said she would broadcast 54 such as advertisements, at a cost of $10,560, paid for out of her Manhattan Borough President budget.
Beyond that, Ms. Messinger offered other themes that she planned to develop during the campaign. She charged that Mr. Giuliani had imposed 'devastating" budget cuts on city schools. She also said that the number of police officers on the beat was declining.
By any measure, this was the most significant day in Ms. Messinger's political life, though there was not much public indication of that. After her news conference, Ms. Messinger walked back to her office. In one indication of the political hurdles Ms. Messinger faces in the months ahead, she was barely recognized as she made her way up the street through the lunch-time crowd.
She spent most of her day calling fund-raisers and political leaders, trying to nail down support. She ended her day in what was for her a routine stop at a dedication of an exhibit at Temple Emanu-el on Fifth Avenue. And her advisers argued that Mr. Ferrer's exit would ultimately prove liberating to Ms. Messinger, who has seemed stifled on the campaign trail so far.
"Ruth will have a bigger soapbox to say a lot of things we held in abeyance," an adviser said. "This race is now between Ruth and Rudy. That is just a fact. That's just the way it is."

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD: THE ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOME LAUNDRY;
Washday's Frontier: The Front-Loaders

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
SO you need to do the laundry, and while you're at it you wouldn't mind cleaning up the planet, too. Would it be worth spending close to $1,000 on an energy-efficient washing machine to help do your part of the global chore?
Many people, without a second thought, would reckon not. But environmental experts say that such washers are a sound investment, both on ecological grounds and in terms of household economics. 
 For years, the Federal Government has been requiring manufacturers to produce more efficient appliances. In April, for example, it required that all refrigerators made after 2001 use 30 percent less energy.
But sometimes, the appliance makers move faster than the regulators. Such is the case with washing machines: more efficient models are entering the market before the Government imposes new standards.
The new machines are radically different from what American consumers are used to. Like big machines in laundries -- and like models popular in Europe -- they load from the front and tumble clothes in a horizontal drum. In top-loaders, all the clothes sit in a large tub of water and are swirled around by an agitator. In front-loaders, also known in the trade as horizontal-axis washers, the tumbling provides the agitation.
Doing away with the back-and-forth agitation saves wear and tear on clothes. Because not all of the clothes need to be in the water at the same time, front-loaders use a third less water, saving a third of any energy needed to heat the water. In the spin cycle, the extra force of gravity helps the clothes to dry more quickly, saving still more energy if a clothes dryer is then used. And front loaders also take a lot less soap, for financial and environmental savings.
This summer, Maytag plans to introduce a front-loading model, the Neptune, retailing for $999. Last year, Frigidaire started marketing the Gallery, which sells for $799. And several models from Europe, like the Asko 20605, have been sold in the United States for years. All of them cost considerably more than the typical top-loading machines, although the prices of the domestic models are likely to go down as more are sold.
But whether or not consumers are willing to crunch the numbers, the fact is that machines like these pay for themselves over time. It has been proved since efficiency standards were set for air conditioners, refrigerators, freezers and other appliances.
According to tests conducted by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, a trade group, a front-loading washing machine cuts energy and water bills by an average of $100 a year (depending on how much laundry is done and on the costs of local water, sewage and gas or electricity services).
"If you are in a place where water or energy is very expensive, with high electric costs, then obviously the economics are going to come out even more favorably," said Jim McMahon, an energy conservation analyst at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., operated by the United States Energy Department.
But will consumers be willing to spend more now to save more in the long run?
"A typical rule of thumb is that things that offer a three-year payback get accepted, and things that do not are rejected," Mr. McMahon said.
That suggests that people might balk at the new machines. A top-of-the-line conventional washer costs roughly $600. So, with a machine costing about $1,000, a typical household would need four years to save the additional $400.
Although the savings involved for any single household might not be much, the savings on a national scale would be enormous.
It is estimated that Federal energy-efficiency standards for appliances, including air conditioners and dishwashers, will save consumers upward of $200 billion over the next three or four decades. The adoption of these technologies has already reduced the nation's demand for electricity by a few percentage points. And the energy savings available from new, efficient appliances will cut 400 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions, equal to the pollution from 16 million cars, according to the Livermore lab.
It vexes policy makers that Americans generally disdain capital investments that offer what economists consider a very attractive rate of return. Spending $1,000 for a washing machine that spins off savings of $100 a year is almost like buying a long-term bond that pays 10 percent, tax free and practically risk free. (There are some obvious differences: the machine eventually wears out, and the bond is easier to sell.)
But whatever the economics, few people replace major household appliances until they break, and even then most consumers opt for lower-price machines over those that cost the least to operate. So, advocates of efficiency are always looking for ways to entice consumers.
Many electric companies are willing to subsidize efficient appliances, since they postpone the need to build ever more costly generating plants.
The Consortium for Energy Efficiency, a Boston-based coalition of conservation groups, government agencies and electric utility companies across the nation, is promoting high-efficiency washers by enlisting utility companies in a program to encourage consumers to buy them. So far, utilities serving one-sixth of the households in the country are participating or have promised to do so, often offering cash subsidies for the purchases.
No such programs are in place in the New York metropolitan area. But in California, Pacific Gas and Electric and some water utilities are offering rebates of as much as $250 to customers who buy efficient washers before Oct. 31.
Appliance makers are counting on such deals to give their new products a foothold. But manufacturers also say they are not counting on environmentalism or frugality alone as their marketing pitch.
"If I am after the mass market, and I am, I'm not looking for a niche product that only people who are concerned about the environment will buy," said William L. Beer, the vice president for strategic marketing at Maytag. "Just based on energy savings alone, this product will pay for itself. But that may not be compelling enough. It has to be more than just saving money."
So, while Maytag set about to build a front-loading washer mainly as a way of anticipating Federal conservation requirements, the company gave its new machine the largest capacity of any household washer on the market, top- or front-loading. Because the machine is not yet in stores, independent tests by consumer groups have not been conducted.
When the suds clear, will a greener, cleaner nation emerge?
That may depend on whether consumers think of appliances as capital investments intended not only to perform chores, but also to generate financial and environmental returns. It also may depend on customers' being convinced that front-loading machines do a better job -- and on manufacturers' bringing the prices down.

HEADLINE: Pied Piper of the Second-Floor World

BYLINE: By BARBARA FLANAGAN

DATELINE: EASTON, Pa.

 BODY:
MATTHEW HOEY is lugging his furniture down his apartment stairs, across the sidewalk, into his truck and heading east, 80 miles, to New York City.
Neighbors guess that the rising young furniture designer is finally moving out, up to the Big Town, to make his mark, chase his dream, swim in the big pond and melt his little-town blues. 
 Isn't it time? Against the backdrop of Easton's neglected grandeur and endearingly quaint proportions, a 6-foot-6 architect with Fabio hair and dark suits (both rumpled) might feel a bit confined.
But this dramatic exit is not what it seems. Mr. Hoey, 34, is simply driving his design collection -- the C.L.C., the M.P.C. and the A.A.S. -- to the I.C.F.F.
That is, he's exhibiting the Corian Lounge Chair, the Molded Plywood Chair and the Aluminum Adjustable Stool at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center from May 17 through May 20. After the fair, Mr. Hoey says he will come back to live in Easton forevermore.
Every town needs a Matthew Hoey. A modern furniture designer who likes to explore new processes, he has not only designed a way to live without Manhattan, but also figured out new ways to help in historic Easton's renaissance and to share it with the cooped-up Manhattan editors and manufacturers who travel west to meet with him.
"He's really a pioneer of design development who's also an urban pioneer," said Susan Szenasy, editor of Metropolis magazine.
While producing furniture for limited-edition runs and large-scale manufacturing, Mr. Hoey also sells his design services to large companies and teaches industrial design to Lehigh University students who help him develop his work. It's a role, or a number of roles, that designers seldom craft for themselves.
He has transformed the ramshackle second floor of an elegant 1850's town house near Centre Square into his one-man headquarters, a sleek private apartment linked to a workshop and showroom.
"This is where I want to be," said Mr. Hoey, who was born in Camden, N.J., raised in Medford, N.J., and trained in Philadelphia before apprenticing with an Easton architect.
He is credited with being among the first to reclaim what he calls "this whole second-floor world." Where families once lived above their stores, there is a vast amount of empty space sitting right above the street-level shops of many American towns. In Easton, a city sapped by regional malls and then slighted by absentee landlords, the vacancies have looked especially forlorn.
The second-floor world Mr. Hoey extolls is not just square footage. The low cost of his space (less than $1,000 a month for 1,600 square feet) freed him to work more experimentally. As a part of a growing artists' community within a reawakening city (population 26,275) set at the confluence of two rolling rivers -- the Delaware and the Lehigh -- Mr. Hoey seems to feel a responsibility to keep up the momentum.
"I really feel like I'm setting an example by doing what I'm doing here," he said.
One client, Tom Samples, a market development manager at Dupont in Wilmington, Del., was impressed. "For Matthew, I think Easton is sort of a project in and of itself," he said. "He likes to do things that haven't been done before, and I think Easton is inspirational for him."
Initially, Mr. Hoey approached Dupont wanting to make curvaceous furniture out of Corian, its famously flat countertop material that is a nougat of minerals and acrylic. "We never dreamed you could make a chair from this material," Mr. Samples admitted.
Working with Dupont's technology center, Mr. Hoey had Corian mixed in candy colors and baked into shapes that seem to melt over the loopy frame of his surprisingly comfortable, all-weather, slightly bouncy Corian Lounge Chair. The charismatic piece was published in "The Sourcebook for Modern Furniture" (W. W. Norton, 1997), a reference full of 20th-century classics.
Many designers would stop there and wait for some big furniture corporation -- a Knoll or a Herman Miller -- to buy their intellectual property with a big lump sum or with royalty payments. Mr. Hoey is fixing to manufacture his own patented designs himself to retain as much quality control as possible, from the frame bending to the shipping.
Others might envy his economy of means. Rather than start a big company staffed with employees, Mr. Hoey creates a "virtual organization" to produce each design, employing independent subcontractors in Pennsylvania.
Collaborating with professors and undergraduates in the Integrated Product Development program at Lehigh, where industrial designs for the likes of Exxon and Chrysler are developed and tested, Mr. Hoey won a $70,000 state grant to figure out how to manufacture the Corian Lounge Chair. This summer, Mr. Hoey will produce a limited-edition series (at $1,360 a piece) while he talks to companies about ways of commercializing that design, and others, for a wider audience.
In the Tomato Project, Mr. Hoey and Lehigh students will explore his patented idea of using breast implant technology to make a line of what he calls "liquid furniture" by ganging together "little fluid pods."
"The idea is to find new uses for a material on which billions of dollars have already been spent," he explained, gently lifting a scale model of a chaise lounge. "And give it a more honorable function."
His workshop, according to the city's Mayor, Thomas Goldsmith, has done a "magnificent job" of spurring others to turn some of the town's abandoned assets -- its stately buildings -- into "relatively cheap live-work space." Mr. Hoey's landlord, who commissioned the renovation of the second floor ("as an original Hoey"), has a craft store on the ground floor. Around the corner, two architects, Oliver Andes and Jeffrey Gilbert, Manhattan transplants, opened the Archive Shop, a design store, in another landmark building. The ground-floor store sells Mr. Hoey's furniture.
In early May, Ms. Szenasy day-tripped out of New York with the furniture fair's organizers to see the very modern chairs he had just invented. The chairs were posed against the backdrop of the old architecture that's newly revamped, which is, in turn, surrounded by the old town that's being discovered.
Typically, Mr. Hoey leads his visitors on a working walking tour that starts in his studio, moves down the main street to one of Easton's vintage coffee shops and skirts the new Crayola Factory visitors' center. Occasionally, the group detours through a downtown artist's loft -- there's a new one every week or two -- so that Mr. Hoey can show the synchronism of his neighborhood.
"He's found a more humane way of conducting faraway relationships, and that allows him to reach out to his own community in a more relaxed way," Ms. Szenasy said. "He's showing how this new life style can actually work."
Perhaps there's a whole new design frontier out there in the small places lost between the big cities, where a new generation of entrepreneurial loners can repopulate the second-floor world that Mr. Hoey inhabits so gracefully.
Thinking about that new frontier and all its potential, Mr. Hoey shook his head and said, "It's untapped."
Matthew Hoey is to speak to the design trade on May 19 at 11 A.M. at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The public can see his work on May 20. Admission, $20; (212) 879-5776.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Again Falls vs. Yen, Losing 8.1% in Two Weeks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slid to another four-month low against the yen yesterday and fell against most other leading currencies after inflation data raised doubts that the Federal Reserve would lift interest rates next week.
The dollar's decline against the yen accelerated yesterday after a report showing an unexpected drop in United States producer prices. The report diminished hopes among some traders that the Fed would again raise interest rates next week. 
 "A lot of people don't think the Fed is going to tighten anymore," said Doug Horlick, a currency trader at ABN-Amro Bank in Chicago.
In New York, the dollar settled at 117.20 yen, down from 118.50 yen Tuesday and the lowest level since Jan. 17. The latest decline left the dollar barely 1 percent higher than its 1996 close of 115.93 yen. It was the eighth consecutive day that the dollar fell against the yen and left the dollar 8.1 percent below its four-and-a-half-year intraday high of 127.47 yen set only two weeks ago.
The dollar was quoted at 1.6944 marks in New York, down from 1.6959 marks on Tuesday and off 2.5 percent from its 38-month high of 1.7386 marks set May 5.
"With the dollar not doing well against the yen, that's certainly dragging it down against other currencies," said Lee Kassler of the Israel Discount Bank in New York. "The market's appetite for dollars has waned."
The British pound rallied to $1.6466, from $1.6329, partly on expectations that interest rates in Britain would rise further. The newly independent Bank of England, which raised rates last week, warned on Tuesday in its quarterly inflation report that rates would need to increase again in coming months to suppress inflationary pressure.
The mark strengthened against the dollar after Klaus-Dieter Kuhbacher, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, said the German Government would likely confront a 20-billion-mark shortfall in 1997 tax revenue. His comments, coming one day before the German Government reports its 1997 tax revenue estimates, suggested that Germany would face new difficulties keeping its 1997 budget deficit below the 3 percent of gross domestic product required for participation in the single-currency plan.

HEADLINE: Better Act Now to Prevent Another Balkan War

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Notes From the Underground on Another Balkan Rift" (news article, May 11) rightly signals the danger of another war in the Balkans. A year ago, a delegation of the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Preventive Action found that Albanians in Kosovo were losing patience with nonviolent resistance to Serbian rule. 
 With Albania on the verge of disintegration and Macedonia still vulnerable to economic crisis and ethnic Albanian unrest, peace and security in the South Balkans remains at risk. United Nations-mandated European troops led by Italy in Albania, along with United States and United Nations peacekeepers in Macedonia, are helping to stabilize the region. But these deployments are not backed up with the high-level political initiative needed to settle regional problems.
While Serbs and Albanians are not ready to agree on the final status of Kosovo, there are signs of willingness to talk. The United States and Europe must insist that the Belgrade Government end repression and enter unconditional negotiations with the nonviolent Albanian leadership. We must also persuade the people of Kosovo that they cannot press nationalist demands without considering the consequences for their neighbors.
Kosovo has not received the high-level attention it requires. It is time for both Europe and the United States to show they are serious by convening a high-level conference on the danger of war in the South Balkans.

HEADLINE: Crossroads For France

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: PARIS, May 14

 BODY:
When the Gaullist president of the National Assembly, a man previously known for his caustic views on American capitalism, enters the electoral fray by praising the way a free-market economy "rewards those who dare, those who take risks," it seems safe to say that something is stirring in France.
When the president of the French Senate, and a man with the ear of President Jacques Chirac, suggests that it is time to abolish the minimum wage and move faster on market reforms to "insert France in a world on the move," it even appears that real change may be at hand. 
 At the very least, these recent statements by Philippe Seguin and Rene Monory suggest that the central issue in a lackluster campaign for French parliamentary elections is now being set out more clearly: How much of the market-driven American and British models of economic growth does a depressed France want to adopt?
The right, long torn between economic liberty and Gaullist fraternity, has finally opted for the former, praising -- with a growing if still prudent openness -- the merits of privatizations, reduced taxation, a shareholding culture and deregulation. These changes would probably ease France's planned adoption of a single European currency. But because such ideas smack of what the French pejoratively call "Anglo-Saxon" economic models, their overt adoption has been a painful and wrenching process.
On the other side, Lionel Jospin's Socialist Party, unready for a Blair-like embrace of the market, has opted for a defense of the state's central role in the economy and attacks on those favoring "the path of harsh capitalism."
Such a debate may seem outdated. But in many ways France is.
It has not been through the Reaganite or Thatcherite reforms that, in the wake of economic change, moved President Clinton's Democrats and Tony Blair's Labor Party toward the center. Nor, like the Netherlands and even Italy, has it put pragmatic reform of the welfare state before paralyzing ideological clashes. Its economy has sagged and unemployment risen steadily to 12.8 percent of the population.
"The French people see increasingly that they are faced by choice between a right-wing government they do not like, and a Socialist opposition whose program they simply do not believe in," said Alain Touraine, a political scientist. "How can the Socialists support a free-market Europe and defend a bloated state at home? It is this that explains that a government whose popularity rating has hovered around 30 percent seems set to win rather than suffer a landslide defeat to the Left."
The Socialist Party program calls for a reduction of the working week to 35 hours from 39 without any loss of salary, and the creation of 350,000 new jobs in the state sector. It equates the pressures of the global economy with a return to the cruelty of 19th-century capitalism. "When people are fired, the stock market rises: that is the logic of this capitalism," it says.
The position is clear enough. Yet, since President Chirac abruptly announced the dissolution of Parliament three weeks ago and set the two-round election for May 25 and June 2, the point of the vote has tended to remain obscure. Having spoken of critical choices to justify calling the election one year early, the President and his Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, veered toward language so guarded that the choices seemed deliberately obscured.
Mr. Chirac's references to private initiative were invariably balanced by calls for solidarity. Allusions to Europe and the planned introduction of a common currency, the euro, in 1999, were dropped, apparently out of concern that the euro had become synonymous with fiscal austerity and reform of the state.
Only this week has such guardedness started to fall away. Mr. Monory's statement was, in French terms, extraordinary. "I do not believe in the minimum wage in France," he said. "What is better? I am going to shock you, but is it better to have one million unemployed young people or pay someone 4,500 francs a month instead of 6,000 Francs?" The current gross minimum wage is 6,406 francs, or $1,133 a month.
Mr. Seguin, never previously known as a free marketeer, followed up by declaring that, "If we have chosen a free-market system, it is because we believe that it is the economic system that best guarantees innovation and creativity." In so doing, he used the word liberalisme, considered taboo by wide swaths of Mr. Chirac's Gaullist party.
The electoral debate remains curiously muted. Over half of French people say the election leaves them indifferent and their hesitations make the result unpredictable. But Mr. Chirac seems to be moving toward the conclusion that the right can say what it believes and still win.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fall A Sharp 0.6%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
In an inflation report better than the most optimistic predictions, prices paid to American manufacturers and other producers fell six-tenths of l percent in April, the biggest monthly drop in nearly four years, Government figures showed today.
"It was, almost across the board, fabulous news," said Noralyn Marshall, an economist with Scotia Capital Markets in New York. "There is no serious visible inflation currently or in the pipeline." 
 The decline in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, which pulled inflation at the producer level down to less than 1 percent over the last year, touched off early rallies in the bond and stock markets. Analysts had been expecting no change in the index.
Investors were heartened by the report because it suggested that inflation continued to be contained and that as a result Federal Reserve policy makers would have little reason to raise short-term interest rates when they meet on Tuesday. But stock and bond prices later retreated to end little changed on the day.
While analysts said today that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, would now have a harder time defending a rate increase, few said that either today's inflation numbers or those contained in Thursday's report on consumer prices would be decisive.
"We're in a different environment" with the unemployment rate below 5 percent and the economy apparently still running faster than its sustainable long-term trend, said Nicholas S. Perna, an economist with Fleet Financial Group in Hartford. He put the odds that the Fed would raise rates next week for the second time this year at still "close to even money."
Evelina M. Tainer, chief economist at Indosuez Carr Futures in Chicago, noted that that the lagging nature of inflation data made today's report a poor guide to policy moves by the Fed, which looks ahead for bottlenecks and other pressures that are inflation's source.
But she said Fed officials had "time on their side" to wait for the economy to cool and were somewhat more likely than not to avoid raising rates on Tuesday. The central bank in March pushed short-term rates up a quarter of a percentage point, the first increase in two years, as insurance against overrapid economic growth generating faster inflation.
A separate economic report today indicated that the economy had begun to slow from its strong pace earlier in the year, bolstering the case for the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged.
The Commerce Department reported that business sales slumped three-tenths of 1 percent in March, while inventories rose three-tenths of 1 percent. The drop in business sales, the first this year, could portend a significant slowdown in the economy if shelves begin to bulge and cause store managers to reduce orders for fresh production, analyst said.
The report on producer prices was impressive not just in the magnitude of the fourth consecutive decline in the price of finished goods -- those ready for sale to the final business or individual user -- but in the fact that goods at earlier stages of production eased in price as well.
Such intermediate items as bolts of cloth fell three-tenths of 1 percent while crude goods, like raw cotton, declined nine-tenths of 1 percent. Both measures of price pressure in the product pipeline have now fallen three consecutive months.
"There is no evidence of industrial sector price pressures," commented James F. O'Sullivan, economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust. "The main threat continues to be labor costs, especially with the unemployment rate now a half-point lower than the 1996 average."
On Thursday, analysts will be closely watching the Labor Department's report on weekly first-time claims for unemployment insurance as well as the Consumer Price Index, which, unlike the producer index, includes services.
Although skidding energy prices once again accounted for much of the drop in April's producer prices, the core rate, which excludes the volatile energy and food sectors, was also surprisingly well behaved. It eased one-tenth of 1 percent for the third time this year, the only increase being a temporarily unnerving four-tenths of 1 percent March spurt.
The core rate benefited particularly from lower prices for computers, aircraft, automobiles, women's apparel and prescription that more than offset increases for tobacco, periodicals and other items.
Food prices, which jumped nine-tenths of 1 percent at the finished level in March, dropped four-tenths of 1 percent, the Labor Department's report also showed. Fresh and dry vegetables dived 20.4 percent, following a 13.3 percent surge, while the price of pork jumped 5.6 percent to more than reverse a March decline.
In widely watched sectors or intermediate goods, prices of nondurables used in manufacturing, such as wood pulp, declined two-tenths of 1 percent, while durables such as copper and brass mill shapes edged down one-tenth of 1 percent.
Among crude goods, natural gas dropped an additional 13.3 percent in April to contribute heavily to a 5.2 percent overall decline for raw energy materials.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises by 11.95 as Early Gains Wane

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks barreled toward new highs yesterday but ended only barely stronger as some pleasing inflation data failed to convince investors that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates next week.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose by as much as 77 points in the first hour of trading, but finished with a gain of just 11.95 at 7,286.16, about 7 points shy of Monday's record high. It was the second consecutive day that the Dow broke past 7,300 only to retreat below that mark by the close. 
 Broad market measures also faltered after an early jump with the bond market, although the New York Stock Exchange composite index managed to hold just enough of a gain to close at a new high.
With the Federal Reserve's next policy-making meeting less than a week away and the stock market suddenly trading near record levels again, it was not surprising to see the rally fade so easily, analysts said.
Much of the enthusiasm behind the market's speedy recovery has hinged on expectations the Fed would not increase short-term interest rates again in its crusade against inflation.
"It's kind of do or die now; we just made record highs, and there's no way of knowing exactly what's on the Fed's mind," said Rick Jandrain, chief investment officer for equity securities at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.
Bonds rallied yesterday morning after the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices paid to farms, factories and other producers fell a surprising six-tenths of 1 percent in April, the largest drop in nearly four years and the fourth consecutive decline.
The inflation data buoyed the recent optimism that inflation is not enough of a threat to merit another rate increase by Federal Reserve policy makers, who are scheduled to meet again on Tuesday. The Fed -- concerned that heavy market demand would aggravate inflationary pressures such as rising wages -- moved to slow things down in late March by raising a key short-term rate known as the Federal funds rate from 5.25 percent to 5.50 percent.
Until about a month ago, investors were fearful the Fed would muzzle consumer spending and company profits with a series of further Fed funds rate increases. Recent signs of moderation in the economy have eased those worries, spurring a sharp rebound in the markets.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by nearly a 3-to-2 margin on the Big Board, where volume totaled about 505 million shares, up from Tuesday's pace.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock list rose 2.92 to 836.05, about 1 1/2 points below Monday's record. The New York Stock Exchange composite rose 1.63, to 435.60, barely topping Monday's all-time high of 435.57.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.96, to 1,335.55, as technology issues struggled despite an encouraging earnings report from Applied Materials, the leading manufacturer of chip-making equipment. Applied Materials rose 3 27/64 to 63 55/64.
Intel, meanwhile, started the day with another steep slide amid news of another lawsuit charging patent infringement in the design of its Pentium microprocessors. But the stock, which in the morning nearly duplicated Tuesday's 6 3/4-point loss, rebounded in the afternoon, rising 1/2, to 152 7/8.
The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.37, to 581.97.
The Dow's biggest gainers were J. P. Morgan, up 2 1/2 to 104 1/2, and Du Pont, up 2 1/8 to 110 1/4. The weakest Dow issue was Procter & Gamble, down 2 1/8, to 130 3/8.

HEADLINE: Demigods in Pinstripes

BYLINE: By James Grant; James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, is the author of "The Trouble With Prosperity: The Loss of Fear, the Rise of Speculation and the Risk to American Savings."

 BODY:
Next week, when a Federal Reserve Board committee meets behind closed doors to discuss interest rates, the press will be expectantly crouched by the keyhole. Is there another governmental planning body, in this country or the former Soviet Union or points in between, whose deliberations inspire even a small charge of electricity, let alone reverence?
The veneration of central banks is the idolatry of the 1990's. Enjoying ultra-low unemployment in the United States, Americans worship and fall down. Yet -- strange to tell -- Germans seem to think no less of their own central bank despite record-high unemployment in Germany. It strains belief that the Fed could, by imposing a single interest rate on an increasingly deregulated financial system, cause a $7.9 trillion economy to move obediently in the desired direction -- or keep an $8 trillion stock market from falling out of the sky. 
 The most trenchant technical criticism of central economic planning was that the planners couldn't know enough to see into the future. The same holds with equal force about central banking.
Yet in this heyday of free markets, central bankers and the currencies they manage have never been more trusted. The stupendous bull market, the apparently endless economic expansion and the historically moderate inflation rate are things of wonder. Well, somebody must have caused them. Somebody, certainly, would be blamed if they went up in smoke. These days, praise or blame seems to fall on one head more than any other, that of the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan.
And so it goes around the world. There is a global bull market in the institution of money management. An "independent" monetary authority has become the intercontinental ideal. Independence, in this context, means liberation not only from gold bullion, which used to anchor the dollar, but also from politics. Even the politicians are prepared to believe that central bankers know best (or, at the least, that it would be inexpedient to suggest that they don't). Certainly, there are enough central banks: 171 in all, not forgetting those of Tonga, Sao Tome and Principe and the Solomon Islands.
When, in its fourth day of existence, Britain's Labor Government conferred on the Bank of England a new measure of autonomy in setting British interest rates, it cast its lot with governments around the world. Central banks, the Laborites implied, should be above petty politics. Drinking in the news, the London financial markets surged.
Likewise, the Japanese Government is moving to confer a measure of independence on the Bank of Japan. And the nations of a possible European Monetary Union are said to envision a future European central bank along the lines of the fiercely independent German Bundesbank.
There is just one thing wrong with this monolithic consensus about the omniscience and omnipotence of central banks: It is almost certainly wrong.
The only certainty about 20th-century monetary arrangements is their changeableness. No monetary system has lasted much longer than a quarter century. The classical gold standard died in World War I. Its successor, the road-show gold standard (the so-called gold exchange standard), sputtered out during the Great Depression. A still more free-form gold standard, Bretton Woods, came a cropper in the inflation of the early 1970's. The current pure paper standard -- in the Fed's case, a system based on the manipulation of a single interest rate, the Federal funds rate -- can therefore be considered almost long in the tooth.
Yet it, too, seemed to have no future at all on Aug. 6, 1979, the day Paul Volcker took over the apparently thankless job of leading the Fed. Inflation was then shortening the shelf life of money the world over. By the fall of 1981, long-term United States bonds had to yield 15 percent to find any buyers.
Then, a miracle: the high interest rates set by the Fed brought inflation down. What is largely ignored, however, is that the high rates did not bring about an actual fall in prices. Historically, rising prices had generally been followed by falling ones. In the 1980's, there was no deflation, but rather "disinflation," merely a slower rate of price increases.
The Volcker Fed inherited an inflationary mess, but by 1987, when Mr. Greenspan took over, it bequeathed one of another sort: asset inflation, caused in part by a series of Fed-engineered interest rate deductions in 1986. Mr. Greenspan was faced with a case of overblown prices in the stock market (and in the real estate and art markets) rather than at the checkout counter.
The excesses, which cropped up globally, were most vividly on display in Japan. Falling interest rates and a depreciating dollar (the latter helpfully engineered by the Reagan Administration) contributed to one of the zaniest and ultimately most destructive speculative episodes in history. Japan, its banks devastated by bad loans, is still trying to recover.
So is the world. In the 1990's, a kind of deflationary undertow tugs at many countries' economies almost eight years after the Japanese crackup. Central banks, complicit in the asset inflation of the 1980's, are now the not wholly deserving beneficiaries of the disinflation of the 1990's.
To be sure, consumer price inflation is setting new low readings almost everywhere. Before giving unconditional thanks for this blessing, however, we might pause to reflect on its probable future costs. In central banking, as in so many other human endeavors, underdoing it leads to overdoing it, and vice versa. In Germany, Japan and Switzerland, central banks have pushed interest rates down to record, or near-record, postwar lows. It is telling that these heroic measures -- modeled in part on the Fed's efforts -- have so far failed to revive their moribund economies.
What central banks can do is to manipulate domestic interest rates. What they can't do is what American entrepreneurs have so often successfully done: create jobs, build software companies, rehabilitate office buildings that should never have been built in the first place.
The suppression of interest rates, of course, can be highly inflationary -- both for the prices of financial assets and the reputations of central bankers. "Remember the glut of Japanese bank money that swept the world in the 1980's and led to the staggering bad loan problem that now hobbles the nation's banks?" The Wall Street Journal asked the other day. "Well, the Japanese banks are at it again -- this time in Asia." Despite clear signs of a new lending riot, there is no shortage of economists who are prepared to reassure us that the business cycle is dead.
Anything is possible, of course. It seems to me, however, that the new idolatry has already changed the behavior of individuals and corporations in ways that will contribute to the next downturn.
Believing devoutly in central banks, investors have assumed more risk than they would have taken in a more suspicious frame of mind. Seizing on their ability to borrow at low rates, corporations have overspent on capital projects ranging from automobile plants to semiconductor factories. Trusting implicitly in paper money, bankers and bondholders have apparently failed to draw any alarming, or even cautionary, conclusions from the recent plunge in the dollar exchange rate.
Only a Puritan could quarrel with easy credit, sky-high stocks and vintage champagne. But there should be no mistaking these time-honored symptoms of lax monetary policy with the permanent genius of central bankers.

Such a Deal: A Security That Thrilled Short-Sellers

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Why would a company issue a security that was virtually certain to drive down the price of its stock?
That is the question for Response USA, a small home security company based in Lawrenceville, N.J., and traded on the Nasdaq small-capitalization market. Last summer, the company issued a very unusual preferred security that seemed almost certain to push the price of the stock lower. And it did. 
 Needing capital to buy other home security businesses, Response USA found a bank willing to lend $15 million if Response could raise $7.5 million by selling equity securities.
The obvious way to do that would have been to sell common stock, or perhaps preferred stock that paid a fixed interest rate. But Response, advised by Zanett Capital, instead raised the $7.5 million by selling a very unusual type of convertible preferred stock.
The preferred securities were convertible into common stock within three months, at a price for each common share of $5 or less. The price was to be 80 percent of the market price of the common in the three days before the preferred shares were submitted for conversion. In other words, the lower the stock price, the more shares the preferred holder received. There was no floor to the conversion price.
At the time the issue was sold, on July 2, Response common was trading for about $9 a share. At a conversion rate of $5 a share, preferred buyers were getting a huge bargain. The obvious way to lock in those profits was to borrow Response common stock and sell it short, planning to repay the borrowed shares with stock the investor would get from the conversion.
At worst, the preferred owners would then lock in as profit the difference between the $5 conversion price and the price at which they sold the stock short. Assuming the short position could be put in at, say, $7 a share, that would reap a profit of $2 a share, or 40 percent, for a three-month investment.
At $5 a share, the conversion would require the company to issue 1.5 million new shares -- a lot for a company that only had 3.9 million shares outstanding at the time. And if the price of the common went down, that would mean more profits for the short-sellers, and more shares to be issued when the preferred shares were converted.
Predictably -- but evidently unpredicted by Response -- the short position in the stock soon soared. Some holders of the preferred found they could not sell it short, because no shares were available to be borrowed. The price fell to less than $5 within a few weeks. In late September, with the price a bit under $5, the company said it would not allow the shares to be converted, pending talks with the preferred holders about new terms. Those talks bore no agreement, and Response kept refusing to allow the conversion.
A preferred holder, Halifax Fund L.P., filed a lawsuit in Delaware, where Response is incorporated, seeking to force the company to convert the preferred stock. Responding to the suit, the company argued that its management and board had a "fiduciary duty to the corporation and all of its shareholders" to protect the company, and said that duty took precedence over its contract with the preferred shareholders. Response said that its stock price, already less than $2 a share, might fall to less than $1 if it lost, which would result in the loss of its Nasdaq listing.
On Tuesday, the Delaware judge, Vice Chancellor Jack B. Jacobs, ruled that the conversion must be allowed. "There is no fiduciary duty that excuses management causing the corporation to breach its fundamental contractural obligations to its investors," the judge said. "The defendants' argument that they acted under a good-faith belief that they were acting in the best interests of the corporation is not relevant."
David Parker, a partner in the New York law firm of Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolff & Cohen, which represented Halifax, called the decision "a clear and swift vindication of the rights of convertible security holders."
That decision came Tuesday, but it was not reported by the company until late yesterday, when Response essentially gave up but declared victory while doing so. The company said in a statement that it had reached a settlement with Halifax Fund that will let the fund do what it wanted to do all along -- convert the preferred shares and sell the common it receives.
As for the other holders, Response said it believed that most of them were willing to accept a settlement that would allow the company to redeem the preferred at 135 percent of the purchase price, plus 12 percent interest beginning last Monday. Any shares it does not redeem by Nov. 30 can be converted on what amount to the original terms. The company did not say where it would get the money to redeem the shares, and a company official said it would not comment on that or anything else.
One might expect management to be apologetic for getting into this position, in which it was forced to pay a 35 percent interest rate for money used for less than a year. But that is not the case. "We believe that the sale by the company of the series A preferred stock was a positive and integral part of the continuing endeavor to effectively capitalize our growing business," the company quoted Richard Brooks, its president, as saying.
Response stock rose 25 cents yesterday, to $2.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene: Battered by Its Rivals;
Competition at Every Turn Has Post Office on the Run

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
What snow, rain, heat and gloom of night cannot stay, U.P.S., fax machines and the Internet just might. That is the view of the Postmaster General, Marvin Runyon, who predicted last month that his giant quasi-government enterprise would lose about $1.4 billion next year, setting the stage for an increase of 2 to 3 cents in first-class postage in 1998.
"The Postal Service," he warned Congress, "faces growing competition across all product lines" -- a reality forcing policy makers to take the first hard look at the post office in a quarter-century. 
 Mr. Runyon's answer to the financial pressures of delivering mail six days a week is to expand into ancillary businesses like packing services and electronic-mail "postmarks" that could absorb part of the Postal Service's awesome overhead. "Growth," he said, "is what sustains our network."
But critics of the Postal Service are unconvinced. For one thing, they note, Mr. Runyon's ambitious plans are opposed by private competitors and viewed warily by postal unions. Even if expansion proves politically feasible, the skeptics argue that it is a formula for distracting already hard-pressed managers.
Their proposed alternative: strip the system of the privileges and obligations of its legal monopoly and let it stand or fall as a competitive enterprise. "The U.S. Postal Service embraces almost all the aspects of socialism discredited in Eastern Europe," said George Priest, a professor at the Yale University School of Law.
This radical approach, long dismissed outside conservative ranks, is now taken seriously by the mainstream and even by some of the Postal Service's largest customers. "The current framework is an anachronism," said Gene Del Pollito, president of the Advertising Mail Marketing Association, the trade group representing third-class "junk" mailers.
When the Postal Service was created in 1971 from the husk of the old Post Office, Congress demanded that it act like a private business. But the new enterprise's mandate still gave it powers almost unimaginable in free markets. Those who poach on the Postal Service's monopoly on the delivery of nonurgent letters are subject to criminal sanctions. Private delivery services are even prohibited from using privately owned mail boxes -- a stricture that explains all those sacks of circulars hanging on front door knobs.
By the same token, the scale of postal operations puts the service out of the league of all but a handful of mega-corporations. Last year the Postal Service's 800,000 employees processed 182 billion pieces of mail using 36,000 buildings, 200,000 vehicles and contract space on 15,000 commercial air service flights a day. Revenues exceeded $56 billion, more than the combined gross of Intel, McDonald's and Kodak.
But from a business perspective, this 900-pound gorilla looks more like a beached whale. The huge work force of the Postal Service (average compensation in 1996: $44,613) absorbs four-fifths of its revenues, leaving little room for productivity increases without unpalatable job cuts. It operates thousands of inefficient branches in rural areas, some of which, according to Larry M. Speakes, the former Presidential spokesman who is now a Postal Service senior vice president, absorb $4 for every dollar they generate.
Equally ominous, the Postal Service has been unable to hold its own in markets legally open to competition. While the service pioneered overnight delivery in the 1970's, it has since ceded 96 percent of the market to competitors. And it has hardly done better in package delivery: United Parcel Service's employee-owners now carry 10 times the volume of parcel post.
Paradoxically, the visible problems of the Postal Service in competitive markets are probably less threatening to its long-term viability than the subtler problems of sustaining its absolute monopoly on nonurgent letters. Both first-class and ad mail are running at record volumes, with deliveries reaching 170 billion in 1996. But indirect competition is gnawing away at the foundations.
The volume of third-class mail is relatively sensitive to postal rates: "Advertisers have a growing list of alternative media," Mr. Del Pollito said -- options ranging from newspaper inserts to Web-site sponsorship to infomercials on specialized cable channels.
So while the Postal Service is legally bound to cover its costs on each class of mail, it bends the rules to keep down rates by allocating proportionally less overhead to junk mail. In 1996, third-class mail represented 40 percent of postal volume but carried just 18 percent of what the Government calls "institutional costs." As a result, much of the fixed costs of the system are borne by first-class mail.
That has not proved a problem to date: the decline of first-class mail, as long-distance phone calls (and recently, E-mail) supplanted written personal correspondence, has been offset by the rising volume of business mail. But business mail -- particularly bills and checks -- is suddenly vulnerable to electronic bypass.
Starting in 1999, notes Martin Mayer, the author of "The Bankers," who is now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution, the Treasury will be required to make all payments electronically, from Social Security checks to the bills for paper clips. Mr. Mayer predicts the switch will spur a lot of companies to use electronic services for all their bill issuing and payment collection; if so, he predicts that could gobble up one-third of the Postal Service's first-class mail business.
One company already draining such business from the Postal Service is the Checkfree Corporation, based in Norcross, Ga. Checkfree operates computerized bill-paying systems used by 1.5 million people, most of them customers of banks now aggressively promoting electronic transfers, and says that it issues payment on 41 percent of customer transactions by electronic funds transfer -- rather than by mailing a check -- at a cost of 1 to 4 cents a transaction.
Checkfree dropped the other shoe in March, offering a system that allows large billers -- among them, BellSouth, General Public Utilities and the Small Business Administration -- to present bills through Checkfree's Web site rather than by mail. "It's the electronic round trip" -- the capacity to present and pay bills at the Web site -- "that makes this service so valuable," Matthew Lewis, a company spokesman, said.
To extricate the Postal Service from its tightening financial noose, Mr. Runyon is asking Congress for greater pricing flexibility, notably the right to offer volume discounts on third-class mail. The Postal Service is also seeking to sell new products, including an electronic "postmark" to act as proof of delivery of E-mail. And it is expanding into such complementary businesses as packing services and delivery of unaddressed advertising. But this route, too, is circumscribed politically: Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican from the San Diego area, and 15 colleagues have fired a warning shot, introducing legislation that would bar the Postal Service from competing with some 10,000 private stores (including San Diego-based Mail Boxes Etc.) that already offer ancillary postal services.
Expansion plans are also viewed with suspicion by organized labor, which acknowledges the long-term strains on the current system but fears the consequences of change on their members' bargaining power and job security. "We need to look at our core business and keep doing the very best we can," said Tom Fahey, a spokesman for the American Postal Workers Union, which represents the clerks and mail sorters.
Nor is it clear that plunging a quasi-government agency into the sink-or-swim environment of the free market would succeed. A much-publicized effort to become a force in E-mail never got off the ground in the mid-1980's, and there is little evidence that the organization has the skills to succeed in other new, fiercely contested markets. "The idea that the Postal Service is going to compete effectively with some of the most efficient and technologically sophisticated companies in the world is bizarre," scoffed Jim Rogers, a vice president at U.P.S.
Gregory Sidek, an economist and lawyer at the American Enterprise Institute and co-author of "Protecting Competition from the Postal Monopoly," would not even attempt to shore up the postal monopoly. He would abandon it, along with the system's obligation to provide six-day-a-week delivery to every mailbox at a common postal rate.
Mr. Sidek doubts that the loss of what is widely seen as an entitlement would alter the lives of many customers. The vast majority, he argues, would get equivalent or better service from private companies that would respond to market incentives, much like deregulated long-distance phone carriers. Besides, household-to-household communication -- the "Aunt Minnie mail" that Washington zealously defends -- now represents less than 4 percent of the mail stream.
And if Congress does want to guarantee daily deliveries to remote rural areas, Mr. Sidek says that it could appropriate money for the service, much the way it now subsidizes postage for the blind. Or it could mimic the regulation of phone service, using revenue from a fixed monthly charge on all mailboxes to underwrite uneconomical delivery. "If universal service generates social benefits, society as a whole should foot the bill," Mr. Sidek argued.
Eliminating the legal obligation to universal mail delivery -- what Mr. Speakes of the Postal Service labels "the sacred trust"-- is hardly on the radar screens of mainstream politicians. Indeed, the only changes under consideration would let the Postal Service give volume discounts on junk mail to big mailers in order to take the revenue-generating pressure off first-class mail. A bill to this end sponsored by Representative John M. McHugh, a Republican from Watertown, N.Y., who is chairman of the House postal subcommittee, is bitterly opposed by the postal unions.
Professor Priest of Yale doubts that radical postal changes will be taken seriously until the debate shifts from the question of abandoning an expensive public entitlement to the prospects for innovation. "Privatization is an opportunity," he argued, "not a punishment."
But Robert Poole, president of the libertarian Reason Foundation, said he expects attitudes to change as electronic bypass eat into the Postal Service's first-class mail dominance. "The death of the Postal Service's monopoly cash cows," he predicted, "will transform what now seems a radical idea into an economic necessity."

Continued growth in the mail volume handled by the United States Postal Service belies the agency's deep-seated problems, postal executives and critics agree. Almost every time that the lumbering Postal Service develops an innovation in communications, aggressive private competitors quickly conquer the new business. Some experts warn that the Federal government's move to electronic bill payment in the next few years -- which may prompt the private sector, too, to abandon traditional billing practices -- could be the final comeuppance for the Postal Service as it is now organized.

HEADLINE: The Leverage of Federal Research

 BODY:
An exhaustive study for the National Science Foundation has discovered that the novel ideas conceived by American patent holders depend far more on research paid for by government than on research paid for by private industry. The finding belies the glib assertion, heard often in Congress last year, that as private industry expands its research budget, Washington can scale back its research activities. The implication is that proposed cutbacks in Federal research would damage the economy.
Ten years ago, private industry and the Federal Government spent about the same amount on research and development. Today the Government still spends about $60 billion -- much less if corrected for the cost of programs like weapons maintenance that do not add to scientific knowledge. Meanwhile, industry-funded research and development has soared to about $120 million. Yet the Government's relatively small research budget has produced big results. Research funded by government and nonprofit agencies accounts for over 70 percent of the scientific papers cited in the study's sample of recent patent holders. 
 One explanation for the disparity is that government, more often than business, pays for basic research -- benefits from which spread throughout the economy, raising productivity. Industry spends its money on more narrow pursuits, like development of a specific product. Also, government and nonprofit researchers publish their findings early. Some industry research is suppressed to preserve proprietary advantage.
Spending on research and development contributes perhaps half of the growth in American living standards. Each dollar spent on basic research permanently adds 50 cents or more each year to national output -- an impact that is many times larger than the permanent gains from increases in ordinary business investment. This latest study suggests that government and university-based research pack the biggest wallop. Even so, the Administration and Congress are working on budget plans that would cut Federal research by between 14 and 20 percent after accounting for inflation.
President Clinton ran for office in 1992 on an agenda of public investment. It was a good idea then. It is an even better idea now.

Showdown in Milwaukee

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES

 BODY:
In the 1960's, the economist Milton Friedman provoked a furor when he argued that students should be permitted to transfer from failing public schools to successful private schools -- taking public dollars with them. Mr. Friedman predicted that free-market pressure would force the worst schools to close and mediocre ones to shape up. His critics countered that such a system would "skim off" the brightest students, promote white flight and leave inner-city schools black and poor. The proposal went nowhere.
Forty years later, inner-city schools have indeed become largely black and poor -- not through vouchers, but because dismal schools have frightened away both the black and white middle class. The voucher debate has re-emerged, but this time focused on means-tested strategies aimed at the poorest of the poor. Three-fifths of the states have choice programs that allow movement among public schools, with about 10 others considering means-tested plans that would afford poor families an escape hatch from miserable inner-city schools. As Joseph Viteritti wrote recently in The Brookings Review, the impulse has "erupted from a diverse coalition of activists that includes black, whites, and Hispanics; liberals, conservatives, and libertarians; Republicans and Democrats." 
 The battle lines have been drawn in Milwaukee, which has two voucher programs -- one financed primarily by foundations and one put into place by the Wisconsin legislature in 1990. Abysmal schools and an onerous busing program made the city an obvious candidate. With white flight nearly complete, the busing program had scattered inner-city children from one neighborhood to as many as 30 far-flung schools. The busing did little for integration, but afforded handsome subsidies for suburban schools that took children from the inner city. Meanwhile, many inner-city schools were either closed or turned into magnet campuses, with half the seats in some reserved for whites. The desire to educate children well in their home neighborhoods made African-American parents supporters of choice.
Independent calculations show that the average Milwaukee high school graduate leaves with a grade point average of D-plus. African-Americans and American Indians lag far behind whites in achievement. An analysis by Milwaukee's Policy Research Institute asserts that the citywide graduation rate has fallen from 80 percent two decades ago to about 45 percent today. In black central Milwaukee the number gets as low as 20 percent. By contrast, the parochial and private schools graduate more than 80 percent and send twice as many to college -- while spending about half as much per pupil.
The public choice plan was written by State Representative Polly Williams, who is from a poor district in central Milwaukee. An early study found that voucher students did no better academically than those who remained behind. But two better-designed studies -- one from Harvard University, the second from Princeton -- showed that the voucher students improved appreciably in math. The program functioned smoothly for its first seven years, when it included only 1.5 percent of the student body.
A law passed in 1995 expanding the program to 15 percent -- and including parochial schools -- was thrown out by a state court. Among other objections, the court cited the church-state connection. The teachers' union, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People are all fighting the plan. Of the three, the N.A.A.C.P.'s reasoning is weakest. It defends failing schools on the grounds that vouchers might destroy them.
State legislators seem determined to expand the plan to parochial schools, even if it means appealing to the United States Supreme Court. Timing favors the legislators. The Court has signaled in several recent cases that it wants to weaken church-state barriers in education.
In Milwaukee, the threat of expanded competition has worked precisely as Milton Friedman predicted. A system that once treated parents with contempt has begun to answer their calls and embrace local experiments through a charter school and other partnerships with community groups. A city that once rebuffed requests for public Montessori schools now has them. Said John Gardner of the Milwaukee school board: "A system that has been arrogant and indifferent for 20 years has suddenly got religion."

HEADLINE: Bill to Redesign Housing Policy Clears Hurdle

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Challenging decades of housing policy that favored the neediest, the House voted today to change the face of public housing by providing shelter to more of the working poor.
The bill, which passed 293 to 132, would repeal a landmark 1937 Depression-era housing law that Republicans say has turned once livable housing projects into miserable ghettos for the unemployed. It would replace the old framework with a system that made way for higher-income tenants and created what the bill's supporters said would be more self-sufficient communities, requiring less Government aid. 
 The measure, which is opposed by the Clinton Administration as too harsh, could cut roughly in half the percentage of extremely poor tenants living in public housing, now roughly 75 percent, through attrition. It would also retool rent policies so that every tenant's monthly payments would not necessarily rise along with income, a practice criticized as discouraging public housing residents from getting off welfare.
The measure would also require many public housing tenants who are unemployed to perform eight hours of community service a month, or in most cases, risk eviction.
The legislation is another step in Republican efforts to compel more people to get off welfare and join the work force or at the very least, repay the community through volunteer neighborhood work.
"There will be no bill that is signed that will end poverty," said Representative Rick A. Lazio, the New York Republican who sponsored the measure. "The best that we can hope for is that we will begin to set a set of incentives for work, for family, for local control, for responsibility and for accountability."
Only a single Republican, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, opposed the measure, while 71 Democrats supported it.
The Senate is expected to take up its version of the bill later this spring. That legislation does not go as far as the House measure and is closer to a Clinton Administration proposal. Last year, similar bills were passed by both houses but died in a House-Senate conference.
The Housing Act of 1937 was designed to provide shelter on a temporary basis to working-class people who had lost their jobs during the Depression and were forced out of their homes. Sixty years later, housing projects are set aside almost entirely for extremely poor tenants, most of whom receive public assistance. Critics say many of the regulations passed during the last several decades have encouraged tenants to remain unemployed, turning public housing into violent ghettos.
Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who heads the Banking Committee, which developed the bill, said his party wants to 'break the dependency cycle."
The majority of Democrats who opposed the measure objected to the community service requirement, which Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. of Illinois called a form of slavery. But they were most disturbed by provisions that they said would abandon the nation's poorest people, denying them admission to public housing at a time when the housing stock is considerably diminished.
"So we turn our back on the very poor," said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Democrat of Massachusetts, whose substitute bill was voted down today, 261 to 163.
"We can allow public housing to go to more working families, but we don't have to do it by abandoning the poor," Mr. Kennedy said in debate on the floor.
Convinced that the New Deal-era housing law had grown cumbersome and out of touch in the last two decades, House Republicans called for the new legislation to incorporate notions of responsibility and accountability. It was time, they argued, to grant local housing authorities the discretion to remedy deep-seated problems of violence and neglect in public housing.
Chief among their proposals in the bill is to allow local housing authorities, which depend primarily on Federal money, to reconfigure the mix of tenants in housing projects. The bill would free housing authorities from rules that give preference in subsidies and apartments almost exclusively to the country's poorest people.
Under the bill, the agencies will be allowed to set aside most units, as they open up, in public housing projects for the working poor -- tenants who hold jobs and earn as much as 80 percent of an area's median income. The bill would not allow them to evict very poor tenants -- who earn 30 percent or less of an area's median income -- to make room for higher-income tenants. The local housing authorities would also be permitted to give the working poor a greater number of subsidized housing vouchers, which give residents a choice of where they want to live.
More than 3,400 local housing authorities own and operate about 13,200 public housing developments, which shelter 1.4 million families. About 2.7 million households receive Federal rent assistance. The bill would cover all such housing.
Just as crucial, Republicans said, the new measure would not link rent levels to income, a rule that both Republicans and Democrats agree discourages tenants from working. Currently, tenants pay rent that is up to 30 percent of their income. The House bill gives residents a choice. They can pay 30 percent of their income or a flat rate set by their local housing authority.
And in keeping with the welfare system's new work policy, tenants who are able-bodied, unemployed and not students or enrolled in a public assistance work program would be required to perform at last eight hours a month of community service. That would affect 450,000 people who get Federal housing subsidies.
In addition, the bill would allow local governments to develop their own low-income housing programs and receive Federal housing money.
Representative James P. Moran, a Democrat from Virginia, said the new bill goes a long way toward revisiting the intent of Roosevelt's 1937 law. "Housing was never supposed to be a permanent entitlement," Mr. Moran said. "The purpose of assisted housing was to help families get on their feet, give them an opportunity to become self-sufficient and then enter the economic and social mainstream of society."

HEADLINE: THE NATO DECISION: THE POLICY;
Road to Approval Is Rocky, And the Gamble Is Perilous

SERIES: EXPANDING ALLIANCE -- The American Push

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
The decision to extend membership in NATO to former Soviet-bloc countries in Central Europe, which Russia explicitly if grudgingly accepted today, is almost certainly the most significant United States foreign policy initiative since the end of the cold war. It represents a redrawing of the world security map as basic as Washington's decision to recognize Communist China.
Yet it was made, early in 1995, in characteristic Clinton Administration style, without a formal policy review, without a structured evaluation of competing viewpoints, without political debate and over the initial objections of senior military officers. 
 With both President Clinton and his Republican rival, former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, committed to NATO expansion, the subject figured very little in last year's electoral campaign.
And so the key question is only now being posed: will this momentous decision enhance and enlarge the democratic Europe that has been built in the half-century since World War II or will it draw a new scar-like line across the Continent, east of the old iron curtain, and hinder Russia's rapprochement with the West?
Today's agreement vindicates the insistence of the Administration that it could reach an accommodation of sorts with the Russians, which its critics had doubted was possible. But the jury may be out for years on what the accommodation will cost in obliging Moscow to accept an arrangement it clearly detests.
Although the decision to expand NATO was described at the time as a preliminary and tentative one, it has stood without substantial revision and is scheduled for final approval at the alliance's summit meeting in Madrid early in July.
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, which have evolved most rapidly from totalitarianism toward democracy and market economies, are universally expected to be voted in this summer. Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania are still pressing for admission at the same time, but they are more likely to be told to wait.
Then, probably next year, the new arrangement will have to be ratified by the 16 existing members and the new candidates. Turkey has already suggested that it may refuse, but that is taken by the other allies as a bargaining position.

Ratification Is Called 'No Easy Sell' in Senate
Gaining the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate may not be easy, given widespread skepticism about making new American commitments in an area where the national interest is not clear to many and where the payoff is not evident.
"This is no easy sell," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican on whom the Administration is counting to lead the fight for Senate approval.
The public, whose interest in foreign policy has waned since the crumbling of the Berlin wall and of Communist governments almost everywhere, has paid little attention -- even though the expansion of NATO will commit the United States to fight if need be for Prague and Budapest precisely as it is now committed to defending cities like Berlin and Paris.
That obligation is laid out in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Charter, signed in 1949. Early on, it gave pause to leaders in several Western capitals; several years ago, Douglas Hurd, then the British Foreign Secretary, told a group of Americans that he thought any American President or British Prime Minister would be "most reluctant to send their boys to die for Warsaw or Bratislava."
Within the foreign policy community, the debate has been intensifying in recent weeks, but the exchanges have been polite and curiously muted. They make it plain, nonetheless, that many experts consider this a perilous gamble. Even the advocates of expansion see it as a close call; a top Administration official termed it "a very difficult decision, for me and most other people."
Underlying the gamble is the conviction -- publicly voiced by Henry A. Kissinger, unspoken but deeply held by the main shapers of foreign policy here -- that Russia might someday threaten Central and Eastern Europe once again and that now is the moment, when Russia is weak, to extend Western protection to potential targets. Doing so, the Administration says, will have important side benefits as well, including the encouragement of reform in the Eastern European countries and the discouragement of regional disputes.
But many are not convinced.
"Something of the highest importance is at stake here," wrote George F. Kennan, the retired diplomat and Russian scholar, arguing that expansion "would be the most fateful error of American policy in the whole post-cold-war era."
Mr. Kennan asserted that NATO expansion would likely "inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion; to have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy, to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations and to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking."
Another man who has spent his life studying and writing about Russia, Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, has been one of the main advocates of the new policy. He has argued that Russia has nothing to fear from a bigger NATO, although he readily acknowledges that many Russians have yet to be persuaded that this is the case.
"By expanding NATO but linking Russia to it," he said the other day in an interview, "we are trying to avoid the errors that were made at the end of World War I and the end of World War II: not punitive like Versailles, not permissive like Yalta."

'Catastrophic Effects' Of Closing the Door
Russia'a agreement today to a formal relationship with the new NATO-to-be, a White House official said, "is proof in itself, along with the renewed strength of the reformers in Moscow, that this isn't destabilizing Boris Yeltsin."
American policy makers argue that not expanding NATO would have had, as one senior State Department official put it, "catastrophic effects" in Central and Eastern Europe by implying that countries like Hungary and Poland were consigned permanently to be a buffer zone between Germany and Russia. That status cost them dearly during most of the 20th century.
The policy makers also insist that countries like Slovenia have been prompted by the possibility of NATO membership to accelerate their commitment to democracy (although Slovakia, just as eager for membership, has felt no such incentive). They also argue that countries like Hungary and Romania have begun to put aside their ancient animosity in the hope of winning NATO backing, just as Germany and France were able to abandon their hostility in NATO's early days.
"Just the prospect of NATO enlargement has given Central and Eastern Europe greater stability than it has seen in this century," Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is of Czech descent, said recently. "This is the productive paradox at NATO's heart: By extending solemn security guarantees, we actually reduce the chance that our troops will again be called to fight in Europe."
Maybe yes and maybe no, say the critics, including both Republicans and Democrats.
Some, like Mr. Kennan, worry about the Russians. Arms-control experts like Paul H. Nitze and Fred C. Ikle oppose expansion at least in part because they think it highly unlikely that the Russians, faced with a Western alliance even close to their borders, will ratify the Start 2 treaty or show any enthusiasm for further reductions in their still-formidable stockpiles of nuclear weapons.
Others, such as Michael Mandelbaum, an adviser to Mr. Clinton during the 1992 campaign and now a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, see the agreement as a bad bargain from almost every point of view "because we're getting nothing and might lose a lot."
The three countries most likely to be admitted, Professor Mandelbaum argued, need no incentives to move toward democracy and are no threat to the stability of the region. Russia, he said, "is not now a threat, and if it became a threat, the countries that it would threaten are not these three but the Baltic states and Ukraine -- precisely those that NATO is least likely to admit."
Mr. Mandelbaum conceded that "the Russians are too weak to lash back now -- that's not the real problem." But he insisted that relations between Washington and Moscow had already deteriorated on such questions as arms control and the continued independence of former Soviet states with which Moscow is at odds.
Few current members of the Senate have objected publicly to NATO enlargement. But on April 23, Ms. Albright and Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen were subjected to an intense, prolonged barrage of senatorial skepticism from members of the Armed Services Committee.
Senator John Warner of Virginia, a Republican who usually takes a bipartisan approach to foreign policy, said of NATO, "I come from the school that if it's not broken, why try and fix it?" After hearing from him and others, Ms. Albright commented, "There is no question that we have a very difficult job ahead of us" on ratification.

The Accord's Shepherd Fears Overconfidence
Although a special office has been set up to handle the ratification effort, and Ronald Asmus, a Rand Corporation expert, has been recruited as a special adviser, Mr. Lugar said he was concerned that the Administration was overconfident. Winning ratification, he said, would require an effort every bit as intense as that which won ratification of the chemical-weapons treaty at the last moment this month.
No one doubts President Clinton's commitment to expansion, a subject that first moved into his policy plans early in 1993, when he was pressed on the subject by President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic and Lech Walesa, then the President of Poland, when they were in Washington for the dedication of the Holocaust Memorial.
That summer, a group of mid-level advisers in the White House and the State Department began pushing for early action on four countries: the three current leaders and Slovakia, which had not long before separated from the Czech Republic. Anthony Lake, then the President's national security adviser, signed on.
But the advocates were unable immediately to win the backing of Warren Christopher, then the Secretary of State, of Mr. Talbott or, crucially, of the top Pentagon brass. Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, became the intellectual godfather of the Partnership for Peace, a loose alliance that for a time constituted an alternative to NATO expansion.
Discarding NATO and setting up a new organization was briefly considered, because that might have seemed less a red flag to the Russians, for whom NATO is a prime symbol of cold war confrontation. That was discarded as too expensive and as a move that might suggest to the European allies that American commitment to Europe was somehow softening.
As is so often the case, Mr. Clinton's mind was concentrated by a forthcoming trip, and without a formal policy review, according to several senior officials, he decided to announce during a European visit in January 1994 that it was no longer a question of "if" but of "when" NATO would expand to the east. The destination of the train had been made clear, but it hadn't left the station yet, one official said later, and there were a lot of potential blockages on the track.
Getting rid of them fell to Richard Holbrooke, who in August 1994 became become Assistant Secretary of State for European affairs. Long talks with Mr. Talbott produced a consensus for action, the generals were brought on board and the work of calming Moscow began. The European allies had their doubts -- one foreign minister complained about "steamroller policy-making that leaves basic questions unanswered" -- but Mr. Holbrooke got them into line, too.

The Price for Europe Of U.S. Involvement
In the end, despite deep misgivings, the Europeans had no choice, a British diplomat said this week. Their highest priority is keeping the United States engaged in Europe, and if the expansion of NATO was the price for that, they had no choice but to pay. Furthermore, it would ease the pressure on them to integrate Eastern and Western Europe by taking the new democracies into the European Union, which would entail major economic sacrifice.
How much of a role domestic politics played is hotly disputed.
One of the main players said flatly, "Not one iota." But another said that in the days after the Republican triumph in the 1994 election, he reminded many in the Administration who were reluctant that NATO expansion was part of the Republicans' Contract with America. Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Polish-American Democrat from Baltimore, reportedly told a State Department official that her parents had turned Franklin D. Roosevelt's portrait to the wall after Yalta and said she did not want to have to do the same thing with Mr. Clinton's picture.
Mr. Clinton managed to travel often to Cleveland, the city with the largest population of Americans of Eastern and Central European origin. He and his aides passed the word before November 1996 that they would not be disappointed.

HEADLINE: Ghosts of Earlier Day Still Haunt the Fed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your May 10 Business Day article about the softened Grinch-like qualities of Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, is interesting but beside the point. The Fed chairman is not a Grinch, but the chief of a highly cautious and powerful institution whose actions affect the welfare of every American.
Lately the Fed has been in a quandary because the United States economy has performed in a manner that the Fed's economic data and historical experience say it shouldn't. Growth has been rapid but price inflation tame. Wages and employment have also grown briskly, but so have productivity and corporate profits. 
 The Fed agrees that direct evidence of price inflation is scant but is nonetheless uneasy. It is nagged by the fear that inflationary pressures will somehow build up and ignite sooner or later. The Fed's institutional instincts are pushing it toward a restriction of the economy's present growth rate, which by all indications is still quite healthy.
The Government's economic data are not picking up the effects of rapid technology growth, while the Fed has not recognized that the economy is not nearly as inflation-prone as it once was. The Fed needs to lead the country toward the realization of the nation's full growth potential and be less susceptible to the ghosts of an earlier day.

HEADLINE: City Budget Shuns Tricks and Election Ploys

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Mr. Giuliani's Budget Challenge" (editorial, May 9), on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's 1998 budget submission, declares that it is "using more gimmicks than ever." Nothing could be less true.
The foundation of the budget is fiscally prudent and was developed without fiscal gimmickry. One-time revenue sources represent less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the budget, and not one cent can be found from refinancing of debt. The only asset sale is of a hotel, which a government in a free-market society should not have owned in the first place. 
 While the city's economic performance accelerated significantly in fiscal 1997, resulting in unusually high increases in tax receipts of $1 billion, the 1998 tax revenue forecast contains prudent assumptions based on historic trends. Unlike your editorial, a news article the next day highlighted this fact.
This budget is not, as you say, a typical "election-year budget." Active and disciplined management of the operating budget has allowed the city to finance new needs through reductions in agency spending. This has generated additional surplus revenues that will allow $856 million of fiscal 1998 expenditures to be prepaid this year. Previous mayors in re-election years have used surplus revenues to expand government.
Tax cuts in the budget are not just "crowd-pleasing," as you charge; they are necessary. The tax burden on our private sector is onerous.
Your editorial says the Mayor should look "ruthlessly" for savings in delivery of services. I applaud your Damascus-like conversion: over the last three years, you blasted this administration for "ruthlessly" cutting costs. As you now know, reductions were not "ruthless" but led to enhanced service delivery. Let's hope you do not abandon your new-found principles.

Interest Rate Concerns Push Dollar Lower Against Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen yesterday to near the level at which it started the year amid diminished expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week. But it rose slightly against the German mark.
Higher rates would help the dollar by making bank deposits and bonds denominated in it more attractive. The dollar has fallen nearly 10 percent against the yen since reaching a four-and-a-half-year high May 1. 
 The plunge followed three months of warnings that Japanese officials opposed further gains by the dollar. And it came as analysts questioned whether the pace of economic growth in the United States will compel the Fed to increase rates at its policy meeting next Tuesday. The uncertainty has led Japanese investors to unload dollars, traders said.
"We've seen the Japanese selling dollars -- particularly in the options market -- to hedge their dollar investments," Chris Iggo, a currency strategist at Barclays Bank, said.
The dollar fell as low as 115.85 yen in intraday dealings before settling in New York at 116.10 yen, down from 117.20 Wednesday. It was the weakest since Jan. 10 and left the dollar barely above its 115.93-yen level at the end of 1996.
But the dollar cost 1.6988 marks in New York, up from 1.6944.
A German Government warning that tax revenue would fall short of projections lifted the dollar. A revenue shortfall would increase Germany's budget deficit, making the country less attractive to invest in.
Economic reports released yesterday in the United States carried mixed implications for the Fed's interest-rate policy and hence the dollar, traders said.
First, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, compared with economists' average forecast of a two-tenths of 1 percent increase. While the gain barely exceeded expectations, and while the overall Consumer Price Index was up only one-tenth of 1 percent, the report buoyed the dollar because it seemed to increase the chances of a rate increase.
The rise was tempered by other, weaker economic figures released a while later, including data on industrial production.

Treasury Prices Edge Up Amid Mixed Economic Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended slightly higher yesterday as investors remained divided over whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates next week.
Reports showing that consumer prices barely rose in April and that industrial production was flat raised hopes among investors that the economy was slowing enough to forestall a rate increase by the Fed. 
 But a sharp drop in initial weekly unemployment claims and a weak dollar discouraged bond buyers early in the session.
"Today's economic data releases provided support for both sides of the 'Will the Fed tighten on May 20 question?' " said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 6/32, to 97. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.86 percent, from 6.88 percent on Wednesday.
Market participants were encouraged by a report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showing a decline in manufacturing activity. The Philadelphia bank's index of business activity dropped to 1.6 in May from 5.7 in April.
A slowdown in manufacturing was also indicated by a Federal Reserve report showing that production at factories, mines and utilities was unchanged last month after rising a revised six-tenths of 1 percent in March.
While the bulk of economic evidence points to a slower pace of business activity, there is still much uncertainty about what this means for second-quarter growth in the gross domestic product, Mr. Fine at Chase Asset Management said.
Bond prices were also supported by a report on consumer prices, which like Wednesday's report on producer prices showed little inflationary pressure. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose one-tenth of 1 percent in April, matching expectations.
But the bond market was somewhat unsettled by the core rate of the price index, which excludes food and energy costs. The core rate rose three-tenths of 1 percent -- the biggest gain since September.
Still, Mr. Fine noted, the monthly year-over-year increase in the index continued to decline and now stands at 2.5 percent. He called it "a truly remarkable performance."
One month of softer economic data by itself would not be enough to deter the Fed from throwing water on the fires of exuberance, irrational or otherwise, Mr. Fine said. When coupled with the recent agreement to balance the budget, however, what the Fed does next week will carry a political undertone and will thus be a significantly stronger signal to the market, he added.
"A Fed move to a less accommodative posture on May 20, therefore, is being approached by many market participants as a 50-50 proposition," Mr. Fine said. "However, another Fed tightening move at some point in the future, irrespective of whether or not it occurs next week, is highly probable."
"Another Fed tightening move of 25 basis points at Tuesday's Federal Open Market Committee meeting would not come as a surprise and would certainly be justified if the Fed wants to remain pre-emptive and guard against the preponderance of upside risks," he said.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Real Choice

BYLINE: By A.M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
And now NATO will expand its membership, to help protect democracy and Western civilization in Europe. But outside Europe, in Asia and the Middle East, its members and partners will continue doing everything they can get away with to strengthen dictatorships that are the enemies of democracy and Western civilization.
 Studiously and persistently, NATO members continue to ignore or pervert the most important international choice they face -- how to deal with those dictatorships. 
 For a decade, Western leaders have said the choice was between "isolating" the dictators, which they think dangerous, or "engaging" them in the hope that they can be talked into not being bloody-handed tyrannies, or maybe not quite so bloody.
 The real choice is far different -- collaboration with dictatorships, or democratic self-protection.
 Shall we continue to make dictators stronger politically, economically and militarily? Or shall we refuse to transfer to them the technological, military and money power created under Western democracy, and which they can one day use against us?
The talks on NATO expansion did not even deal with that. Now only the U.S. Senate can save us from NATO's deliberate failure.
 The choice has faced the West for generations. Three times it chose collaboration -- with Hitler, Japan, Iraq -- until they made mistakes that brought the West into war against them.
 But in those days at least we knew what was going on -- appeasement of the dictators, and betrayal of their victims. Churchill, Roosevelt, de Gaulle let the world know.
 Now Western political and business leaders, without public discussion or personal shame, choose their favorite dictatorships -- meaning with the most contracts.
 China is their first pick. In their insipid self-delusion, Western nations believe that there the cash register rings loudest. Chinese leaders are the smartest in the world. They have made America believe it is in its interests to suffer a $39.5 billion annual deficit in its China trade, damage its own manufactures and kiss hand for the privilege.
 The U.S. frowns on deals with Iran, Iraq and Cuba. Western Europe says who are you to lecture us when you too are deep in the China trough?
 Russia, our newly proclaimed partner, busily arranges military and nuclear deals with Iran. From all over Europe businessmen traipse to Baghdad. They line up contracts against the day their governments succeed in lifting the U.N. embargo.
 No leader speaks the full truth, not even the great dissident for democracy, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic. He says NATO expansion is essential to Euro-American civilization -- but slides off on ending the empowerment of its enemies outside Europe.
 Western leaders know what to do. About China, end the huge Western financial contribution to its military potential by refusing trade with the hundreds of companies owned by China's army. Stop Western aviation and technology companies from helping Beijing duplicate their plants.
 Almost all Western leaders are Christians. Why do they not at least economically penalize all countries that persecute Christianity? The day is coming when President Clinton will be asked that in his own church.
 Does anybody believe that if the U.S., Britain, France and Germany took such steps the rest of NATO, or Russia or Japan, could hold out?
 The goal would not be to "isolate" all dictators but to force them to real "engagement" that might reduce their threat to Western society and loosen their oppression at home.
 The Clinton Administration has consulted every foreign country involved on expanding NATO -- but not the American people, who will have to take the risk of getting involved in still more of what Mr. Havel calls Europe's "tribal passions."
Mr. Clinton will not end collaboration for the U.S., let alone for NATO. Responsibility passes to the Senate.
The Senate has a chance that will not come again: to demand that NATO members not expand the power of hostile dictatorships, before it agrees to expand NATO.
 May American senators have the strength and wisdom to choose protection of democracy over collaboration with dictatorships that would destroy it.

HEADLINE: Union Cites Productivity As an Issue In Police Pact

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association is taking some jabs at Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani because the Mayor, who likes to boast that he has made city workers far more productive, does not want to negotiate with the police union about increased police productivity.
The union, representing 29,000 police officers, is demanding that the city negotiate over how savings from increased police productivity should go toward raises for the police. 
 But city officials say they have already made a generous offer to the union and do not have to bargain over productivity. The union, whose contract expired 26 months ago, has rejected the city's offer, which calls for a two-year pay freeze and then a raise of almost 16 percent over the next three years -- more than the 13 percent received by most municipal unions in the last three years of their contracts.
The skirmish has come in a flurry of legal papers filed with the city's Office of Collective Bargaining, which has taken preliminary steps to arbitrate the long-simmering contract dispute.
City Labor Commissioner James F. Hanley is arguing that the three-person arbitration panel should not be required to weigh the union's productivity claim when it determines what should be in a new contract.
But the union's top negotiator, Charles G. Moerdler, says the panel should take productivity into account, asserting that the police have been working harder and should be rewarded for saving the city money and helping reduce crime.
Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed watchdog group, said it was odd that Mr. Giuliani, who has often bragged about raising productivity, would want to take that subject off the bargaining table.
"There is some irony here," he said. "I'm a great believer in gain-sharing. You should have to negotiate over productivity, and the city should have the force of character to take the issue head-on and not hide behind it."
Efforts to resolve the contract dispute are proceeding on two tracks. In January, the city asked the Office of Collective Bargaining to set up an arbitration panel after the two sides hit an impasse. On the other track, the union, fearing that the panel would rule in the city's favor, persuaded the city to resume talks in February in the hope of reaching a settlement and avoiding a contract imposed through arbitration.
In its legal papers, the police union rejects the city's demand for a pay freeze for 1995 and 1996, insisting instead that the police should receive a retroactive "gain-sharing raise" for those two years and subsequent years based on increased productivity.
The union argues that the police have "generated savings in excess of 2 percent per annum," or more than $40 million a year, by working harder and merging the transit and the housing police into the Police Department. The union also is demanding larger seniority raises, more vacation days and holidays and higher city contributions for health insurance and annuities.
"What the P.B.A. seeks, as part of its overall wage increase, is a share of the economic savings it has helped generate," the union said.
But the city argued that any decision involving an increased workload and greater productivity should be made unilaterally by management and not through negotiations.
One senior city official said: "It doesn't make sense to give the police more money because crime is down. Does that mean you'd cut their pay if crime goes up or raise teachers' pay if test scores go up one year or pay firefighters more if there are more fires?"
Labor experts say the main reason the city does not want to give the police more money to reward them for greater productivity is that other unions, most notably the teachers and firefighters, would no doubt complain that their contracts did not similarly reward them for increased productivity. These experts say Mr. Giuliani does not anger those unions in an election year.
Nor does Mr. Giuliani want the police dispute to last through November. Several labor experts who have followed the dispute said the city might secretly ask the arbitration panel to award the police more than the city is offering at the bargaining table. Such an award might make the police happy, and could inoculate Mr. Giuliani against charges that he gave more to the police than to other unions.
City officials deny any such strategy.

HEADLINE: 3 Democratic Rivals Attack Giuliani, Not One Another

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
In their first appearance together since Fernando Ferrer dropped out of the mayoral race, the three Democratic candidates politely sidestepped invitations to criticize one another at a forum yesterday while they attacked the record of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Speaking to some business people and political aides, Ruth W. Messinger, Sal F. Albanese and the Rev. Al Sharpton spent 90 minutes agreeing on several topics, from their support of rent regulations to their assessment that race relations had deteriorated in New York City since Mr. Giuliani moved into Gracie Mansion. 
 Since the withdrawal earlier this week of Mr. Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, Ms. Messinger has been buoyed by the perception that she is now the front-runner in the Sept. 9 Democratic primary. But she has also been criticized by some Democratic officials that she is too liberal to win against the Republican Mayor.
Throughout the forum, Ms. Messinger never strayed far from discussing the need to improve the city's schools and her wish to stimulate economic development and create jobs, topics that seem to be developing as core themes that campaign aides said were intended as part of a moderate political platform and image for the Manhattan Borough President.
"I am focused particularly on education," she said. "On reducing class size, on setting standards and telling the school system: 'If you reach the standards we set for you, we will reward you. If you do not, we will have to take action against you.' The education of our children is that important."
She also touched on the city's high unemployment rate. "Wall Street is hitting record highs, but we've got bragging rights to the nation's highest unemployment," she said. "I cheer the successes, the places where our economic engine is running strong. But that engine isn't pulling enough trains. If we're going to create new economic opportunities for unemployed New Yorkers, we must reinvest."
While they gave similar views on current issues like rent regulation, the three candidates also discussed issues that they consider the themes of their campaigns. They often went to those themes, regardless of the questions they were asked.
Mr. Albanese, a City Councilman from Bay Ridge in Brooklyn, reiterated his call for campaign finance reform and for further restrictions on campaign donations.
"We have a campaign finance system in this city and in this country that's flawed," he said, responding to a question seeking how he defined himself politically. "Anything we talk about here in terms of jobs, education, is affected by the political system. The political system is so flooded by big money that everything that flows from there is polluted."
The breakfast forum, held in a dining room near the top of the World Trade Center, was sponsored by the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce and the weekly business publication Crain's New York Business.
As in other candidate forums, Mr. Sharpton provided many of the most memorable lines, making humorous jabs at Mr. Giuliani's record as well as offering lively rejoinders.
When asked whether they considered themselves liberal, each candidate declined to answer directly.
Mr. Sharpton said jocularly that he is a conservative. "When one fights for the criminal justice system to uphold its principles and laws as we've done in various civil rights cases, we're conserving the law," said Mr. Sharpton, a Baptist minister who has played a role in cases involving allegations of racially motivated violence and police brutality.
"We are fighting for law and order," he said. "When we stand and say that we cannot have a city where cops or robbers engage in criminal activity, that's a very conservative notion." He said the Giuliani administration has been "very liberal in giving away money intended for children's education."
"We need conservatives like me," he said.
Mr. Albanese described himself as an "economic populist with a strong law enforcement record."
Ms. Messinger declined to discuss labels altogether. "We can spend this entire election season trying to figure out what label fits with what person and whether that label is a good or bad label," she said. "I think what voters want is someone who will identify problems New Yorkers are facing, and who will tell New Yorkers what she's going to do to solve their problems."
After the forum, the Giuliani campaign wasted no time placing a label on Ms. Messinger. No sooner had the forum ended than Fran Reiter, the Mayor's campaign chairwoman, spoke to reporters as Mr. Giuliani's Democratic rivals stood nearby.
"I think Ruth is running away from her past," Ms. Reiter said, asserting that Ms. Messinger's record was more liberal than those of many Democrats. "She's trying to create a centrist image for herself that belies a 20-year record in public life."

HEADLINE: Price Waterhouse to Receive State Grants in Exchange for More Jobs

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In exchange for a pledge to add more than 1,000 workers in its Manhattan offices over the next five years, the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse will receive $2 million in state grants, Gov. George E. Pataki said yesterday.
Although the incentives, which also include tax breaks, are modest compared with those granted other companies, city and state officials praised the agreement as a reflection of the growing willingness of companies not only to remain in New York City, but also to expand here. 
 "It is a signal of our continued faith in the city as a great place from which to serve our premier clients," James J. Schiro, the accounting firm's chairman, said in a news release.
Under the agreement, Price Waterhouse is to add 1,090 workers in Manhattan by 2002, an increase of nearly 50 percent from its current New York City work force of 2,200. The firm said its expansion will take place mainly in its headquarters at 1177 Avenue of the Americas, at 44th Street, where almost all its workers are based, and in two floors of a building it has leased at 11 Madison Avenue, at 24th Street.
Price Waterhouse said it had been courted by developers and government officials elsewhere in the region. Mike Ascolese, a company spokesman, said it had considered sites in Westchester County, New Jersey and Connecticut.
"This is another fight we have won," Mr. Pataki said at a news conference.
Unlike other companies that have threatened to move everyone from executives to clerks out of New York City, Price Waterhouse, which has been Manhattan since 1890, said an exodus was not considered.
"The question was not whether we would remain, but how much of us would remain," Mr. Ascolese said.
Price Waterhouse ranks fourth in employment among New York City accounting firms, behind Arthur Andersen, Deloitte & Touche and Ernst & Young. It said the swift pace of employment growth that it pledged to city and state officials would result from an expansion of its management consulting business, which is centered in Manhattan, and a faster rate of hiring in Manhattan than at its offices elsewhere in the nation.
The agreement does not obligate Price Waterhouse to transfer any current employees to Manhattan, the firm said.
The state grants to Price Waterhouse amount to slightly more than $1,800 for each new Manhattan worker it has promised to hire. Past business retention agreements have been far more costly, reaching a record of $51,000 per employee that was granted to Chase Manhattan in 1988.
In addition to its $2 million in state grants, Price Waterhouse is to receive an exemption from city and state sales taxes on things like computer equipment and furniture for the offices it has leased on Madison Avenue.
State officials said the accounting firm had agreed to pay back some of its financial benefits if it does not meet its objective of 1,090 new jobs in five years, and retain a Manhattan work force at least that large for the following five years.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Flying Is a Pain That United Wants to Share

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
After more than three decades of peddling the "friendly skies," United Airlines is changing course for a bold but risky alternative: acknowledging just how problematic the skies, the gates, the planes and even its employees can be for travelers, particularly frequent fliers.
That high-stakes shift in marketing strategy, which tries in an empathetic way to feel passengers' pain, was inspired by a study of frequent travelers on all airlines. 
 The change is unusual for an industry that almost always uses the most positive imagery to portray its services. Carriers from Eastern in the 1960's ("The wings of man") to Delta today ("On top of the world") have confidently asserted that their skies are the bluest, their flight attendants the most courteous, their meals the tastiest. With rare exceptions, advertising campaigns have shied from suggesting, much less showing, that flights can land late, luggage can get lost or workers can turn surly.
But United, still remaking itself almost three years after employees took control of the company, is gambling on the unconventional approach -- to be introduced in television commercials and print advertisements that begin appearing next Thursday -- as a way to appeal to skeptical consumers and break through the increasing clutter of airline campaigns.
Only by addressing the myriad difficulties that frustrate fliers, executives of United and its two new advertising agencies declare, can their message be believed about the airline spending $400 million over the next 5 to 10 years on improvements aimed at customer satisfaction.
That surprising switch may help improve perceptions about United's performance, said Karen Goodwin, editor in chief of Frequent Flyer magazine in Oak Brook, Ill.
"For a while, our readership has either been picking on United or not that happy with United's programs," she said in a telephone interview yesterday. "A lot of the letters about United have been negative, feeling perhaps that they're not that customer-driven."
In a survey released on Wednesday by Frequent Flyer and the research firm J. D. Power & Associates, Ms. Goodwin said, United's service finished below average among airlines for flights of less than 500 miles, trailing America West, Continental, U S Airways, Delta and Southwest. On flights longer than 500 miles, United finished third, she added, behind Continental and Trans World Airlines.
According to the most recent Department of Transportation data for on-time performance, United finished fourth among 10 carriers.
The new campaign has been eagerly awaited by the airline and advertising industries because it is the first since United shocked both by dismissing the Leo Burnett Company, the large Chicago agency that won United's business in 1965 by creating the "friendly skies" theme.
The campaign makes its case for United in brash, slyly forthright ways. One print ad proclaims that United is "a better way for cynics to travel" and another asks cheekily, "Wouldn't it be great if we could all fly commercials?"
One of three United television spots even rewrites history, canceling the Wright Brothers' first flight by interpolating modern-day difficulties like unexplained delays and indifferent airline personnel. "If Orville and Wilbur had to go through what you do just to fly," says the announcer, the actor Mandy Patinkin, "they would've stayed in the bicycle business." The successor slogan to "friendly skies" is "United Airlines. Rising."
"We need to get at and disarm, as quickly as we can, a lot of angry people who are not paying attention to us," said Bill Westbrook, president and chief creative officer of Fallon McElligott, the upstart Minneapolis agency that in October was named, along with Young & Rubicam Advertising in New York, to replace Burnett on the $120 million worldwide United account. The Fallon McElligott work is for domestic markets; Y.& R.'s runs overseas.
"Most frequent fliers are angry because they feel they're not appreciated for the contribution they make to the airline industry's bottom line," he said, "and they are incredulous about airline promises, because they're almost always disenchanted."
Peter Murphy, executive vice president and senior creative director at Y.& R., said: "The customers are all we've got, and therefore they're everything to us. 'Rising' gives concrete reasons why we are rising to meet, and we hope rise above, their ever-changing expectations in an ever-changing world."
Mr. Westbrook said: " 'Friendly skies' was created at a time when a lot of people were afraid to fly and when friendliness was of higher value. It's a wonderful part of advertising history, but the market changed."
John D. Kiker, vice president of corporate communications for United, a unit of the UAL Corporation in Elk Grove Village, Ill., said that the nontraditional tone of the campaign was the result of interviews with consumers, adding, "They said, 'Don't lie to us anymore.' "
All the executives said they recognized the dangers involved in bringing up the problems associated with flying, from delays to unresponsive employees to bad food, before offering United as the answer for those weary of airline annoyances.
That kind of advertising, known as problem/solution, is a staple for products like detergents and drugs. But it is rarely done for airlines. Exceptions include a 1967 ad for Pacific Air Lines addressed to a passenger "with the sweat in your palms" and a 1974 commercial for Southern Airways comparing competitors' coach-class service to steerage on an immigrant ship.
By contrast, most airline ads are all solution and no problem, such as "On top of the world," created for Delta by the Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising Worldwide unit of Cordiant P.L.C.
The reason for avoiding reminders that anguish seems to be issued with boarding passes is a fear that depicting those difficulties may only send worried customers to fill seats on rivals' aircraft -- or push them to driving or teleconferences.
But doing that is necessary, Mr. Westbrook said, because "only by showing we understand can we get through that wall built up, brick by brick, over the years."
The solutions detailed in the campaign include improving service at gates; for instance, unhappy fliers will be offered perks like upgrades. Also promised are better meals and more employee training.
That last point is important because United's adoption of its employee stock ownership plan in July 1994 has not eliminated a reputation for fractious labor-management relations. For example, United's flight attendants decided against becoming employee-owners.
"If you have happy employees," said Ms. Goodwin of Frequent Flyer magazine, "you probably have happy customers."
The part that employees will play in whether "Rising" rises or falls is underscored by a commercial devoted to them. That spot shows employees waiting, grumbling and fidgeting, for a 6 P.M. training session that starts at 6:26.
"Feeling a little frustrated?" the trainer asks when he finally arrives. "Well, hang on to that feeling the next time a frustrated customer comes to you with a problem."
"Act like you own the place," he adds, "because, you know, you do."

HEADLINE: Canada's Leader Finds Hometown Fretful

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: SHAWINIGAN, Quebec, May 14

 BODY:
Prime Minister Jean Chretien's Liberal Party holds a commanding lead as the June 2 national elections approach, but Mr. Chretien himself is in one of the toughest fights of his long political career.
As he campaigns for his own seat in Parliament representing this old French-speaking mill town northeast of Montreal, he faces a tough opponent and a grumpy electorate that is largely disappointed that Mr. Chretien has not been able to solve the problems in his own backyard. 
 For the 63-year-old Prime Minister, Shawinigan, with its railcars heaped with wood pulp and workers carrying metal lunch pails, is as much a part of his personal myth as Hope, Ark., is for President Clinton's.
Mr. Chretien was first elected to represent this area in Ottawa in 1963, and Shawinigan has returned him to the House of Commons eight times, the last as a hard-working Prime Minister who looked and sounded like an ordinary guy. He always campaigns with his crooked smile and fractured diction, in both English and French, as "the little guy from Shawinigan."
But the common-man guise may be wearing thin. "For 30 years he's been saying 'I'm the little guy from Shawinigan' and in my mind it's pejorative," said Yves Duhaime, 57, a local lawyer and Bloc Quebecois politician who polls say is running neck and neck with Mr. Chretien. "What people need now is a gentleman from Shawinigan."
The main issues here can be seen as a microcosm of the most important issues facing Canada in this election: the need to create jobs, protect the social network and keep the country together.
But while Mr. Chretien remains popular in English-speaking Canada, he has not made friends here with the way he has handled those issues since taking office as Canada's 20th Prime Minister a little over three and a half years ago.
"He's a real liability in Quebec," said Larry LeDuc, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.
Many people here still see him as a traitor to the Quebec cause, Professor LeDuc said, and his inability or unwillingness to shower Shawinigan with governmental goodies has added to local disappointment over his leadership.
In some ways, it is the achievements that Mr. Chretien most proudly boasts of elsewhere in Canada that get him into the most trouble here.
He tells voters that his Government has created 793,000 jobs, and reduced the national unemployment rate to 9.6 percent, from just over 11 percent when he took office.
But in Shawinigan and surrounding areas in the district, unemployment is about 16 percent, and more than 10,000 of the district's 75,000 residents are on welfare.
To reduce the ballooning national deficit that he inherited in 1993, Mr. Chretien has had to cut deeply into Canada's most cherished social program -- universal health care -- and generally tighten the broad range of assistance programs. Here, some 450 poor families rely on a food bank run by Roman Catholic priests.
And wherever he campaigns, Mr. Chretien is reminded that although the "no" side won the October 1995 referendum in Quebec on splitting up Canada, he badly underestimated the separatist sentiment of his fellow Quebecers. In a personal rebuke for the Prime Minister, who led the campaign for unity, 54.6 percent of the people here voted for Quebec to pull out of Canada.
Few analysts actually expect Mr. Chretien to lose, although they say that if the Liberals do poorly, there will be pressure on him to resign. If the unexpected happened and he were to lose while his party retained control of the Government, space would be found for him in another district so he could remain Prime Minister.
For now, Mr. Chretien is taking no chances of suffering any such blow to his leadership. While he campaigns for his party across Canada, a number of his Cabinet ministers go on the stump for him in Shawinigan, repeating the rather modest message he gave in a nationally televised debate among party leaders on Monday.
"In some areas, I am sorry to say, we were not able to do all we wanted to do," Mr. Chretien said. "You do not expect your Government to perform miracles."
There has never been love lost between Mr. Chretien and Mr. Duhaime. Both are lawyers born in Shawinigan, but they have taken very different paths. Mr. Chretien staunchly supports keeping Quebec in Canada. He has always belonged to the Liberal Party, and he held nearly every major Cabinet position before becoming Prime Minister.
Mr. Duhaime has held office in the provincial government but in the mid-1980's he retired from politics. He came back to the political scene last fall, running unsuccessfully for the leadership of the Bloc Quebecois, the separatist party.
Mr. Duhaime and Mr. Chretien have been in some very public shouting matches, and the Prime Minister once threatened to punch Mr. Duhaime in the nose because he had blocked a favorite project. ("I'm not the chicken type at all, so try it," Mr. Duhaime responded.)
The mood of the people in Shawinigan is as acrid and unpleasant as the thin smoke coming out of the huge paper mill on the outskirts of town.
"They have reduced the deficit on the backs of poor people," said Claire Doucet, a manager of the Roland Bertrand Center, which runs a food bank here. "They should all stop talking about the deficit and start doing something about poverty."
Even those people who have jobs are worried about losing them. "For me now it's not too bad because I have work, but really we need many more jobs," said Roger Beaulieu, 38, production director at the Doral International boatyard in nearby Grand-Mere.
Mr. Duhaime's party, the Bloc Quebecois, has focused on Shawinigan and gladly helps in the attack on Mr. Chretien. The party's leader, Gilles Duceppe, called Mr. Chretien "the little guy from Ottawa who disguises himself as the little guy from Shawinigan every four years."
Mr. Chretien may have caught a break recently. The separatist movement was badly splintered when former Premier Jacques Parizeau hinted in a new book that he had arranged to have France recognize Quebec independence within days of a yes vote in the 1995 referendum. Previously he had pledged to first negotiate a new partnership arrangement with the rest of Canada.
Mr. Chretien pounced on Mr. Parizeau's statements as proof that the separatists had been deceiving the people of Quebec. That has put Mr. Duhaime, who had asked Mr. Parizeau to campaign on his behalf, on the defensive. "What we've been doing in the last few days is what everyone knows is damage control," Mr. Duhaime said.
Although Mr. Chretien has tried to keep national unity from dominating his campaign, it once again threatens to take control. Mr. Duhaime is relying on voters who approved separation in 1995 to withhold their support for Mr. Chretien, even if he is Prime Minister.
But for Mrs. Doucet at the Shawinigan food bank, unity is not the most important issue to be decided.
"Here, the first preoccupation is survival," she said. "If you have nothing to eat, it doesn't matter whether you are in a country called Canada or a country called Quebec."

HEADLINE: What Is NATO? Europe's Glue, Not Kremlin's Foe

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

 BODY:
Western Europeans who support NATO's expansion to take in the new democracies of Central Europe do not see the move, primarily, as insurance against the possibility that Russia might one day emerge again as a threat to their security.
From President Jacques Chirac of France to President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic, most of them instead see NATO expansion primarily as a way of guaranteeing the stability of an ethnically riven and historically volatile region that spawned two world wars. For this purpose, they have also viewed Russian assent as essential. 
 Though expanding the alliance would certainly move back the day when Russia might ever threaten Central Europe again, to Europeans that argument seems to be -- as detractors of expansion often portray it -- outdated thinking from the cold war. Convincing the Russians that expansion would be no threat to them was the aim of the Founding Act that President Boris N. Yeltsin and NATO leaders announced this week and will sign in Paris on May 27.
Most European leaders, east or west, would have no trouble agreeing with Mr. Yeltsin and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who agreed yesterday that the deal was a "fundamental, far-reaching step toward insuring lasting stability and security in Europe."
NATO, which never fired a shot in anger during the cold war, is now seen as the best way of deterring another tragedy like the war in Bosnia, which neither the European Union nor the United Nations could stop. NATO, once it was led reluctantly and belatedly by the United States, could, and did halt the killing, with Russian troops as part of the NATO peacekeeping force.
Gradually, Western European and American leaders have come to understand that fear of this kind of disorder, more than anxiety about their larger eastern neighbor, is the most important reason Central European countries like the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and now others, farther east, like Romania and Bulgaria want so badly to join the alliance.
There is an important symbolic value, as well.
"The new democracies want to join NATO for the same reason they want to get into the European Union -- because they see admission to both these institutions as proof that they have been fully accepted as Western democracies," one high-ranking NATO diplomat said.
People in these countries watched a security vacuum develop around Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990's and drew a lesson from that disaster for themselves.
That lesson was that joining a collective alliance whose members pledged mutually to resolve ethnic, historical or territorial disputes peacefully was the best way to avoid another Bosnia-like war elsewhere.
Motivated by the desire to join the alliance, first Hungary and Slovakia and last year Hungary and Romania resolved historic impediments to cooperation between them that were long masked during the Communist period.
The Hungarian-Romanian accord removed tensions between the two countries over the treatment of the large ethnic Hungarian minority in Romania as a potential source of friction nearly as serious as the one in Bosnia.
More recently, Romania and Ukraine, which wants to associate itself with NATO but not to join it, have resolved border disputes by treaty, NATO diplomats point out.
Skeptics may say that Greece and Turkey, both longtime NATO members, have not resolved their disputes over territory in the Aegean Sea or over ethnically divided Cyprus, and both have nearly gone to war over those differences in the past.
But, as Mr. Havel said at a meeting with editors and writers at The New York Times this week, "I believe if it weren't for NATO, three wars might have been fought between Greece and Turkey in the last decade."
There are many in Western Europe who would agree with him -- even the French, who under Mr. Chirac are considering whether to put their military forces back into NATO structures that President Charles de Gaulle pulled them out of in 1966.
Adding Central European countries to the NATO mix will help give the alliance the more European cast that Mr. Chirac is insisting upon as a condition of reintegrating.
France would be happier about expansion if Romania and possibly other south-central European countries were included in the first wave. But Mr. Chirac, at least, has never been known to doubt the wisdom of expansion in principle, or to voice suspicions that the Clinton Administration foisted expansion on unwilling Western Europeans to insure continued American domination of European security structures, as some cynics surmise.
President Clinton and other NATO leaders plan to name the first new candidates for membership at a summit meeting in Madrid July 8 and 9.
Italy and Spain, concerned that the expected admission of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary could divert the alliance's attention from security problems in the Mediterranean region, agree with the French about Romania.
Italy is also backing Slovenia for early membership, and now that Bulgaria has voted out a neo-Communist Government, there is some support for encouraging it too.
On the success of expansion and gradually increasing cooperation with Russia, Ukraine and other countries on the eastern edges of the alliance hangs a great deal.
A transformed NATO, in the view of its supporters on the Continent, can provide the necessary security underpinning for a successful transition to democracy and a free market economy not only for Central Europe but also for the countries of the former Soviet Union.
That will enable the European Union to go ahead with its own expansion, bringing the new democracies into a political and economic institution that has done as much as NATO did over the last half century to make war unthinkable between old enemies, ethnic or otherwise.
And it will also preserve what many Europeans believe is the linchpin of the entire post-World War II structure.
NATO, which will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 1999, is the most tangible political and strategic link between the United States and Europe. Even France, which often views the United States as a rival, is eager to guarantee the continued commitment of the world's only superpower to Europe's continued security and prosperity.
NATO's expansion, by guaranteeing the alliance's continued relevance, also guarantees Europeans that continued and valued American commitment.

HEADLINE: Price Inflation Held to Scant Rise in April

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
As part of a last flurry of statistics before the Federal Reserve meets on interest rates, the Government reported today that declines for energy and food held consumer inflation to a scant one-tenth of 1 percent in April.
But the latest tabulation of consumer prices did not provide any insight into what the Federal Reserve would do when it meets Tuesday. 
 "The Fed has more reason to tighten than not -- but it's not a laydown," said Frederick Breimyer, chief economist at the State Street Bank in Boston, offering a typical comment.
With the economy clearly slowing in recent weeks, the main question seemed to be whether the central bank thought the deceleration would be enough to prevent an increase in inflation.
Unlike recent reports on employment costs and producer prices, which were widely regarded as reassuring on this score, today's Consumer Price Index was a bit unnerving in that its core rate climbed by three-tenths of 1 percent, the largest increase since September.
The core rate, which disregards energy and food because they swing widely from month to month, often because of weather, also crept up to 2.7 percent over the latest 12 months from 2.5 percent in March.
Analysts expressed some concern about this even though the April increase largely reflected the biggest jump in four years in the price of clothing, also a volatile item because of seasonal introductions and markdowns.
"These data are somewhat disconcerting in the face of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meeting" and could be used to justify a tightening of monetary policy, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the investment firm, told its clients today.
Securities markets largely took today's news in stride, apparently reflecting the status of the Consumer Price Index as an indicator of past developments and not of future risk.
William Cheney, chief economist at John Hancock in Boston, said he doubted the April consumer index would count for much in the Fed's deliberations. "Waiting to see inflation in the C.P.I. before hiking rates is like waiting to see flames in the windows before calling the fire department," he said. "At that point, you are too late."
Instead, the labor market poses a bigger threat to continued low inflation, Mr. Cheney and others contend. They point to an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, a tightness that seemed to show no letup today with the Labor Department's report that the number of people making initial jobless claims, a forward-looking indicator, dropped sharply in the week ended last Saturday.
Claims tumbled 31,000 from the previous week, to 319,000, returning to low levels after two weeks when totals were swollen by automotive strikes and floods in the Midwest.
Still another report, this one compiled by the Fed, showed that output of factories, mines and utilities was unchanged in April after an increase of six-tenths of 1 percent in March.
Industrial production, an indicator of current conditions, would have advanced three-tenths of 1 percent had it not been dragged down by a drop in output of motor vehicles and parts, more than half of which was attributed to strikes. Utility production jumped 2 percent, reflecting cool temperatures, the Fed said.
The capacity use rate, which measures how near to production limits businesses are operating, fell to a somewhat slower 83.4 percent of capacity last month. The March rate was revised down to 83.7 from 84.1.
"Our economy is in for a smooth landing on a pathway of moderate growth and stable inflation," contended Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "After a massive rise in consumer demand and a buildup in inventories in the first quarter, production is slowing down until the surplus stocks are sold off."
The Consumer Price Index report was marked by a second consecutive large drop in the price of energy, 1.5 percent in April, and a two-tenths of 1 percent decline in food that owed much to fruits and vegetables but also included a 6.8 percent jump in the price of coffee.
Transportation costs fell for the third time in four months as gasoline fell 2.6 percent and used cars slumped 1.6 percent to more than offset higher automobile finance charges and a l.2 percent rise in airline fares. Plane tickets had jumped 4.5 percent in March on renewal of the 10 percent Federal tax.
The jump in the price of apparel was nine-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest since February 1993. This, along with another increase in tobacco prices, 2.4 percent, accounted for the core's acceleration to three-tenths of 1 percent after increases of two-tenths of 1 percent for five of the six preceding months.
Merrill Lynch summed up the price report as "mixed," but added, "On balance, we believe that inflation remains dormant."

HEADLINE: New Buyers Turn Art Sales Into Expensive Parties

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
The feel-good factor that economists and real estate brokers keep talking about has infected the market for Impressionist, modern and contemporary art at virtually every price level. For the last two weeks, bidders at the important spring sales at Sotheby's and Christie's in Manhattan spent staggering sums on everything from ultra-sweet Impressionist paintings to hard-edged modern ones. There were even takers for the tough subjects tackled by avant-garde contemporary artists in the late 1980's and early 90's.
One reason the atmosphere at the auctions was so buoyant was that many new collectors showed up at the Sotheby's and Christie's salesrooms. This new breed buys in new ways. Its members are not like the successful businessmen in the 1980's who made conspicuous consumption part of the fun by wanting to be seen. Nor are they like the buyers of the far quieter early 1990's, who simply stayed home and bid by telephone or through a dealer. 
 Today's buyers, still business tycoons for the most part, like to be seen, and they treat these sales as parties with a highly selective guest list. But they don't necessarily want to be known as big spenders. They come to the sales, cellular phones in hand, and sit in one part of the room instructing an agent in a different part of the room, also using a cellular phone, on how much to spend.
And spend they do. At all levels. Several years ago it was only the top-notch works that had a lot of competition, but the market has expanded. Even middle-range paintings, drawings and sculptures, in the $100,000 to $1 million range, often had several interested buyers.
Of the two auction houses, Christie's was the winner this spring. Its sales of contemporary art totaled just under $30 million and for Impressionist $234.5 million, the highest total since 1990. Sotheby's contemporary sales brought in $21.9 million and its Impressionist sales $100.5 million.
"There's a broadening of the market worldwide," said Christopher Burge, Christie's chairman in America and the company's star auctioneer. "The money's been stockpiled. All these people buy things like luxury cars, and now it's filtering down to us and they're buying art. We all feel it."
Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive worldwide, called the current market healthy. "When you have as much material as we did selling so well, it's a good sign for days ahead," she said. "Still, it's a selective market."
Collectors today do their homework: they know when the condition of a work of art presents problems, if it has been around the market or simply isn't a good example of an artist's work. They are scared by what happened to the speculators of the 1980's, who paid too much in moments of passion and later were burned when they tried unsuccessfully to sell for the same high prices. Value and quality mean a lot today.
"Today's buyer keeps getting smarter and smarter," said Ernst Beyeler, a dealer based in Basel, Switzerland, who bought several important works this week for clients.
Mr. Beyeler was an important presence at what was the most anticipated sale of the last two weeks, the auction of 29 Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, drawings and sculptures from the collection of John Langeloth Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb. The 66-minute sale made $92.7 million, above Christie's $80 million estimate.
Mr. Loeb, a Wall Street investor, and his wife, a philanthropist, had been serious collectors since the late 1950's, often buying from well-known galleries like Knoedler & Company in Manhattan or at auctions in the United States and abroad. Mr. Beyeler bought the most expensive work of the spring sales, Cezanne's "Madame Cezanne Seated in a Yellow Chair" (1888-1890), a powerful portrait of the artist's wife in a red dress; it was a star of the Loebs' collection. Mr. Beyeler paid $23.1 million, less than Christie's estimate of $25 million.
Another big-ticket painting from the Loeb collection was "Manet With His Palette" (1878). Christie's had estimated the self-portrait would fetch $15 million, but it did better, selling to an unidentified telephone bidder for $18.7 million.
The prices of the Cezanne and the Manet were the second highest paid for works by these artists. But Toulouse-Lautrec's "Seated Dancer in Pink Stockings" (1890), which was bought by another unidentified telephone bidder for $14.5 million, set a record for his work. The price was well above Christie's $10 million high estimate. (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
The Loebs' art was the most important private collection to be sold at auction this spring, but it was not by any means the only one. Christie's also offered eight works that had belonged to Jacques Koerfer, a German businessman whose heirs have been selling his collection at Christie's for three years. These works got off to a tough start, with some not selling at all. Among them was Braque's "Bottle of Rum" (1912), an oval Cubist painting estimated at $3 million to $4 million, for which no one was willing to pay more than $2 million.
But Mondrian's "Composition No. 3 (Composition With Red, Blue, Yellow and Black)" (1929) brought $4.1 million, just above its $4 million estimate, from Thomas H. Lee, the leveraged-buyout specialist. A small painting (19 3/4 inches square) in pristine condition, with the artist's original frame, it drew bids from several New York dealers, including Larry Gagosian and Robert Mnuchin.
There was still more competition for "Gauguin at His Easel" (1884-1885), a self-portrait. Bids hopscotched from one end of the sales room to the other, finally landing at the telephone bank. An unidentified telephone bidder paid $3.8 million, more than twice the painting's high estimate of $1.5 million.
Sotheby's had its share of estate property, too. And because these works had not been on the market, they tended to fare the best. Its top seller, Klimt's "Tavern at Litzleberg" (1915-1916), sold for $17.4 million to an unidentified telephone bidder. It was from the estate of Serge Sabarsky, a New York dealer and a pioneer in supporting 20th-century German and Austrian art, who died in February 1996.
Another fresh work that brought Sotheby's a large price was a Degas pastel, "Dancers" (1899), which set an artist's record by fetching $11 million, above its estimate of $7 million. The unknown buyer bid through Alexander Apsis, head of Sotheby's department of Impressionist and modern art in New York. The work was sold by the heirs of the French dealer Paul Durand-Ruel.
Contemporary art generally does not have great estate property, but it does benefit from brand names. Take Christie's sale, where sculptures being sold by Douglas S. Cramer, a television producer best known for "Dynasty" and "The Love Boat," brought high prices. Among the most popular was Ellsworth Kelly's "Untitled," a stainless-steel wall sculpture from 1986 in the shape of a flying arch. Estimated at $200,000 to $300,000, it sold to a telephone bidder for $442,500.
Sotheby's was selling art from the CBS corporate collection, about 100 works, primarily paintings and prints, purchased since the 1960's. The collection's artists included Jean Dubuffet, Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock and Henry Moore. Among the best was Kline's "Crosstown" (1955), a black-and-white abstract work bought by William C. Paley, the founder of CBS, more than 30 years ago. It sold to an unidentified bidder for $2.2 million, above its $1.5 million estimate.
But by far the most exciting part of the sale was a group of 11 works sold by the Boston Children's Heart Foundation. The collection was assembled by Dr. Bernardo Nadal-Ginard, a Boston cardiologist now serving a one-year sentence for misappropriating money from the nonprofit research foundation. In his buying days, Dr. Nadal-Ginard was offered the best of the newest artists, and buyers at Sotheby's knew it.
Robert Gober's untitled wax leg of a girl, for example, was expected to sell for $50,000 to $70,000. It went for $96,000. While Mr. Gober's work has brought higher prices at auction, this was one of the most sought-after pieces. So was Kiki Smith's sculpture of a woman crouched on the floor, urinating. Several people tried to buy it, but it finally went to Anthony D'Offay, a London dealer, for $223,500, almost three times its high estimate of $80,000 and a record for the artist.
This is tough art that appeals to a small but passionate group of collectors. But it is what Tobias Meyer, director of Sotheby's contemporary art worldwide, called "the art of our day," the kind of work buyers in 10 years will wish they had had the nerve to buy.

HEADLINE: Late Rally Sends the Dow Above 7,300-Point Level

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks surged yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at more than 7,300 points for the first time.
Stocks were bolstered by manufacturing data that pointed to a slowing economy, suggesting that Federal Reserve policy makers would not need to raise interest rates when they meet on Tuesday. 
 The Dow rose 47.39 points, to 7,333.55, with virtually all the gain coming in the final hour of trading.
The Nasdaq composite index, loaded with technology issues, rose 18.03 points, or 1.35 percent, to 1,353.58, its best gain in nine sessions. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.84 points, to 841.88.
Reports on factory utilization across the country and a review of Philadelphia-area manufacturing suggested that growth is slowing from its decade-best rate in the first quarter, diminishing the potential for inflation.
"The markets either don't expect a Fed rate increase, or they expect a benign one," said Laszlo Birinyi, who runs his own research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
Advancing issues outpaced those that declined by 1,302 to 1,188 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of the Intel Corporation rose for a second day, extending its comeback after two rival makers of computer chips filed lawsuits contending that Intel's best-selling Pentium chip uses their patented technology. Intel climbed 5 1/4, to 158 1/8, after falling as much as 13 in the previous two sessions.
Shares of the Hewlett-Packard Company rose 2 1/4, to 58 7/8, on expectations that its second-quarter profit would exceed estimates on strong sales of servers and other computers. After the market closed, the company posted earnings of 75 cents a share, 6 cents less than estimates.
Shares of Amazon.com Inc., a money-losing Internet book retailer, soared on their first day of trading. Amazon jumped as much as 12, to 30, before closing at 23 1/2. Strong demand for shares bolstered the initial sale price to 18 each late on Wednesday, more than the original forecast of 12 to 14.
Gateway 2000 Inc., a direct-marketing retailer of personal computers, saw its shares surge 7 1/2, to a record 68 7/8, after the company said it would split its stock 2 for 1, buy back as many as 10 million shares and move to the New York Stock Exchange from the Nasdaq market.
Among retailers, Gap Inc. said its profit rose to 31 cents, from 28 cents in the quarter a year earlier, matching forecasts; its shares rose 5/8, to 32 3/4. The Kmart Corporation's stock fell 3/8 a share, to 14 1/8, after it reported profit of 3 cents a share, better than some analysts' forecasts. Investors apparently anticipated slower growth later this year.
The Capital One Financial Corporation's shares fell 3 1/2, to 36 3/8, after the company forecast lower-than-expected earnings for its second quarter.
Oil shares declined as the slowing economy and ample supplies pointed to a decline in petroleum prices. The Exxon Corporation lost 1, to 58 7/8; Texaco Inc. fell 7/8, to 110 1/8.
Banks gave up some of Wednesday's gains. Shares of the BankAmerica Corporation fell 1, to 119 7/8, after rising 4 on Wednesday.
Shares of Intuit Inc. climbed 3 3/16 , to 27 1/8, on speculation that the financial software company might be acquired as soon as Monday.

HEADLINE: One Thrives, The Other Doesn't;
After Latin Venture Fails, VW Succeeds And Ford Scrambles

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: PACHECO, Argentina

 BODY:
Supported by concrete posts and topped with five lines of barbed wire, the six-foot-high chain-link fence zigzags through the heart of what used to be a blossoming auto-making partnership here. On one side of the fence are the operations of the Ford Motor Company, on the other side those of Volkswagen A.G., now divided by a nasty corporate divorce -- a case study of the difficulties in breaking up a big-company joint venture.
The basic mistake of Ford, its officials now acknowledge, lay in assuming that a marriage made in the late 1980's would last indefinitely. The union looked good on paper: the companies would make cars together for Brazil and Argentina, sharing all the profits and producing no competing models. 
 The trouble was that Ford let VW make the subcompacts, a segment that has since come to account for half the region's auto sales, with Ford still struggling to catch up. Ford was also caught off guard by rapid economic changes that turned the once-stagnant countries into attractive markets.
As a result, Ford has endured heavy losses in a region that has become the most profitable in the world for rivals like the General Motors Corporation and Fiat S.p.A. "We've essentially started over; we're building a new company from the ground up in Argentina and Brazil," said Alex Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive.
Ford and Volkswagen combined their subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina in 1987, when hyperinflation, weak growth and a ban on car imports had badly hurt sales in both countries. Their joint venture, known as Autolatina, became highly profitable even in this hostile environment by closing surplus Ford and Volkswagen assembly plants and offering aging models that were cheap to build. The plant here, on the northern outskirts of Buenos Aires, was originally a Ford factory, with Volkswagen moving in; it is now divided roughly in half by a fence even more sturdy than the one that wraps around the whole complex.
With Brazil and Argentina banning car imports for most of the 1980's, Autolatina sold some of the world's stalest models. Midsize Ford Falcons, nearly identical to the 1960 United States model, were made here from 1961 until 1991. So many of these automotive fossils are still on the road that a visitor almost expects to see Elvis Presley step out of one at any moment.
But after the debt crisis of the 1980's faded away, the Brazilian and Argentine economies sprang back to life in the early 1990's. Autolatina, and Ford in particular, was caught unprepared.
Inflation dropped, economic growth increased and car sales soared. The import ban was replaced with steep tariffs, prompting nearly a dozen auto makers to start exporting their latest models here and begin planning new factories. Suddenly faced with true competition -- and reluctant to share the technology needed to build their own latest models -- Ford and VW decided in early 1995 to break Autolatina apart.
That decision was a boon to Volkswagen, which has since produced steady earnings while holding onto a third of the regional auto market. But Ford's operations emerged from the venture in disarray, with much lower market shares -- mainly because of its lack of small cars. Because of the Autolatina breakup, Ford lost a staggering $645 million in its South American division last year.
The moral, as Ford officials see it now, is that companies combining operations should look hard at what might happen if the venture later comes undone.
"Emotionally, you know, the last thing you want to do is contemplate coming apart," said Jacques Nasser, president of Ford's worldwide automotive operations.
Still, he said, "At some stage up front, you kind of need to brainstorm the conditions under which the partnership stops providing the added value and synergies."
Roger D. Stark, a specialist in auto industry joint ventures at Coudert Brothers, the international law firm, boils down Autolatina's lesson for other multinationals more succinctly: "Be careful who you marry, and have a good prenuptial agreement."
The biggest problem for Ford has been that almost all the growth in both auto markets has come in subcompacts, particularly the smallest subcompacts, called "popular cars." But Ford specialized in midsize cars before Autolatina, while Volkswagen built mainly smaller cars.
During the joint venture, the two companies made all Autolatina's cars together and shared all the profits. The larger cars mostly bore Ford nameplates and went to family-owned Ford dealers, though, while the smaller cars tended to have Volkswagen nameplates and went to Volkswagen dealers.
Ford dealers begged for a small car as the Brazilian market in particular shifted strongly in the early 1990's. But Ford executives were reluctant to erode Autolatina's profits by developing a subcompact from scratch and then placing it in competition with Volkswagen's Gol, from which Ford was already taking half the profits.
At the same time, VW officials were reluctant to share their subcompact designs with Ford for fear that Ford would use them in other world markets.
Yet the result of Ford's decision to focus on Autolatina's profits rather than on Ford brand cars was that Ford emerged from the alliance with a reputation for making cars bigger than most consumers wanted.
"Obviously, we should have nurtured our brand better in those years," said Ivan Silva, the new president of Ford of Brazil. "It would be much less painful now."
For their part, Volkswagen officials are delighted with the breakup, having retained their dominant market position in Brazil and gained a larger share in Argentina. VW entered Autolatina in 1987 with just 10 percent of the Argentine car market, for instance, but was the market leader last year with 18.6 percent. "Things have turned out very well, even better than we hoped," said Norberto C. Dubar, president of Volkswagen Argentina.
Volkswagen officials even feel that they learned a lot from working with Ford in Autolatina, improving their abilities to track costs more closely and cut the number of management meetings. "VW learned how to be leaner," said Miguel Jorge, the acting president at Volkswagen of Brazil.
Ford's failure to develop a small car earlier is only one of several embarrassing mistakes. Overconfidence when the venture broke up, for example, resulted in extravagant spending by local managers. They started by opening a new headquarters in one of the most expensive skyscrapers in Sao Paulo, renting 10 floors at an annual cost of $1 million a floor. New executives sent down from Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., have now broken the lease, laying off hundreds of salaried workers and moving the rest into unused office space at a Ford assembly plant on the city's outskirts.
"Frankly, being part of an auto company is having the feel of it," said James J. Padilla, Ford's new corporate vice president for Brazil and Argentina, who has his offices at the Sao Paulo assembly plant.
Ford's South American operations hit bottom on Dec. 29, when a huge explosion destroyed one end of the assembly plant here in Pacheco, killing one worker and injuring four others while shattering cars, walls and the roof across an indoor area the size of a football field.
While large explosions sometimes happen in oil refineries and chemical factories, they are rare in auto assembly plants. Ford officials acknowledge some responsibility for the accident, which occurred when gasoline leaked over a weekend from fuel pumps at the end of the assembly line, forming a foot-deep pool that ignited when workers tried to clean it up.
"The maintenance procedures and operating procedures for the fuel pumps were not totally safe," said Jorge T. Mostany, president of Ford of Argentina.
Still, Ford's fortunes in South America have begun to improve. The company is starting to benefit from cost-cutting and from a $2.6 billion program to rebuild factories. It is also introducing new models previously sold only in Europe.
Ford's market share in Argentina jumped four percentage points in the first quarter, making it the market leader after finishing in fourth place last year. The company's losses in Brazil have also narrowed. Rival auto executives credit Ford's new models here and to the company's decision to send in what one analyst called a "S.W.A.T. team" of star managers.
Mr. Padilla used to head manufacturing and engineering at Jaguar, a Ford subsidiary whose quality problems he is widely credited with fixing. Mr. Silva was one of the few marketing executives at Autolatina to try, if unsuccessfully, to persuade Ford officials that they were making a mistake in ignoring the small-car market. And James L. Solberg, the new manufacturing director for Ford's Latin American operations, used to be the president of Ford's joint venture with Mazda at Flat Rock, Mich., a test ground for the application of Japanese management principles in the United States.
Their first step has been to lay off nearly a third of the work force, because Ford's factories here have not been operating at full capacity; employment in the two nations is now about 11,000.
New models, three years in the planning, are also selling well. The subcompact Ka, designed for sale in countries where many people can barely afford any vehicle, has been an immediate hit. Less than 12 feet long, the Ka has better handling and performance than larger but older models like the Fiesta and the Escort, and sells for $10,000 to $14,000. Mr. Nasser, a collector of antique watches, personally designed the oval, analog clock on the dashboard, an elegant improvement on the digital readouts in most small cars.
As Ford's market share starts to recover, particularly in Argentina, even some Volkswagen dealers have envied their Ford rivals. "They have the models that people want at the prices they want," said Roberto Senese, the sales manager at a Volkswagen dealership in Buenos Aires.
Narrowing losses in South America are one reason that Ford posted sharply higher worldwide first-quarter earnings on April 16. Yet while the losses here have become less horrendous, Ford officials do not expect their South American operations to break even until next year.
So while less gloomy than a year ago, Ford executives remain rueful that the breakup of Autolatina has produced so many problems. "The dissolution was very difficult," Mr. Padilla said. "More difficult than we ever anticipated."

"Line Down the Middle"
In 1987, this plant in Pacheco, Argentina, was a symbol of a new auto-making partnership between Ford and Volkswagen to produce cars for consumers in Brazil and Argentina. Today, the factory is divided by a six-foot fence, evidence of a corporate divorce.
 
"Ford's Mistake ..."
By allowing VW to make subcompacts for the companies' Autolatina joint venture while it made larger cars, Ford fumbled away market share in South America's biggest countries.
 
THEN -- Ford took this 1960 Falcon design, below, from the United States and built it in Argentina with very few changes for three decades. Ford continued to build the Falcon after becoming partners with VW, but consumers wanted smaller, more modern cars. Falcon production ended in 1991.
PRODUCED 1961-91: 494,209
1991 SALES: 2,335
 
NOW -- The Ka, below, is part of Ford's effort to win back market share. Introduced this spring, the Ka has been selling briskly; 4,951 were sold in Brazil last month. A foot shorter than a Mazda Miata, the Ka is so small that Ford has not yet decided whether it will ever be sold in the United States.
 
"... Is VW's Gain"
The breakup of the automakers' partnership has been a boon to Volkswagen, which has produced steady earnings while holding onto a big share of the auto market in Brazil and Argentina.
 
THEN -- The Gol (which means goal in Portuguese and Spanish) was a hit in Brazil after it was redesigned at the beginning of Volkswagen's joint venture with Ford in 1987. Sales began climbing sharply when Brazil reduced sales taxes on tiny popular cars with 1-liter engines, like the 1992 Gol, below.
1992 SALES: 135,669 (in Brazil)
 
NOW -- Newly redesigned two years ago, the Gol was the best-selling car in Brazil and across South America last year. Below, a 1997 Gol.
1996 SALES: 356,724 (in Brazil)

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Murdoch Bids for Dodgers Simply to Bolster a Lineup

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
If Rupert Murdoch's Fox Group is able to acquire the Los Angeles Dodgers, the team would move from the hands of the O'Malley family, whose only business has been baseball, into the embrace of an aggressive conglomerate that wants to use the team to enhance its domestic and global media interests.
Fox is now in exclusive negotiations with Peter O'Malley, the Dodgers' owner, and Murdoch said in Tokyo on Wednesday that he hoped to complete a deal in a month for a $350 million purchase price. 
 "I think of this as network-building and empire-building," said Andrew Zimbalist, a sports finance expert and a professor of economics at Smith College, "because at the price being quoted, it's not understandable as an investment in a baseball franchise."
Financial World has placed a value of $178 million on the team and stadium, but did not calculate the value of the land beneath and around the stadium, some of the most valuable in Los Angeles, or the team's training facilities in Florida and the Dominican Republic. Still, Michael Ozanian, the magazine's deputy editor, said that ownership by Fox would be a huge coup. "It's not such a crazy price," he said. "The Dodgers already make a ton of money, but it's an old stadium."
Dodger Stadium, which opened in 1962, was built for $18 million.
Fox is the antithesis of the O'Malley-run Dodgers. Murdoch loves to ski and sail, and accumulate media properties like The New York Post, sometimes for profit, sometimes for political power. Murdoch's bid for the Dodgers shows more his lust for acquiring content for his empire than his love for American sports. And it is cheaper than the $395 million yearly fee Fox is paying for National Football League TV rights.
The Dodgers, and nothing else, comprise the entire business realm of the low-key O'Malley, last of the baseball scions. Forty-seven years ago, Peter O'Malley's father, Walter, paid $1.4 million to take control of the Dodgers; at $350 million, Murdoch would be paying 250 times more.
It is a very different world now, where only the richest people or corporations can afford the indulgence of a sports franchise, and where multinational companies like Murdoch's or Time Warner see a baseball team as software, not a public trust.
"The Dodgers always kept their prices low and their business simple," said Peter Bavasi, a former executive with the Dodgers and other clubs. "They were just in the baseball business. But when you pay $350 million, you have $35 million in cash flow to generate, so you have to maximize your returns by maximizing your revenues."
Dodger Stadium, now in its 36th season, would likely be Fox's first outpost of change, with the first-time construction of luxury suites and club seats and the possible expansion of signs beyond two Coca-Cola signs atop the Mitsubishi electronic scoreboards. Ticket prices, which average $11.16 this year, below the $11.98 major league average, are usually among the lowest in baseball. They could increase in time under Fox.
"The family has jealously guarded the look of Dodger Stadium since the day it opened," said Tom Villante, a former head of broadcasting for Major League Baseball, and now a consultant. "But Murdoch would be foolish not to test some new ideas."
More than anything else, Fox's bid for the Dodgers is a television play, one that would create the kind of vertical integration enjoyed by Time Warner and the Tribune Company. Time Warner owns the Atlanta Braves and TBS, the cable superstation that carries 125 Braves games. Tribune owns the Chicago Cubs and WGN, another cable superstation, which telecasts 140 Cubs games.
Fox already televises major league games through the Fox Network, one of baseball's national broadcast partners, and through FX and the Fox Sports Net, its national cable outlets.
Traditionally, the Dodgers have avoided selling the TV rights to the majority of their games, reasoning that they should not sacrifice attendance, usually among baseball's highest, for viewership. This season, only 48 games are available on KTLA-TV, a broadcast station, and 40 on Fox Sports West 2, Fox's regional cable sports network.
That would certainly change with Fox as the owner. "No question, there would be more games," said Marc Ganis, the president of SportsCorp Ltd., a Chicago-based consulting firm. "It would be more Tribune-like, with virtually every game on TV. More programming -- and that's what the games are -- means more commercial inventory. The more it makes from advertising, the more valuable the cable network becomes."
Murdoch undoubtedly has designs for his potential acquisition beyond Southern California, where he could market the Dodgers, with Asian stars like Hideo Nomo and Chan Ho Park, and Hispanic stars like Raul Mondesi, to his growing international satellite sports television holdings in Japan, Asia, Latin America, Australia and Europe.
Murdoch would not enter baseball without some corporate enemies. Ted Turner, the Time Warner vice chairman, has likened the Australian-born Murdoch to Adolf Hitler because of his business practices and once promised to squash Murdoch "like a bug."
And Murdoch is at legal odds with the Walt Disney Company, which owns 25 percent of the Anaheim Angels with an option to buy the rest. Several months ago, Disney sued Fox to stop the movement of games of Disney's hockey team, the Mighty Ducks, from Fox Sports West, an established regional sports channel, to a new offshoot with fewer subscribers, Fox Sports West 2. Fox countered with a lawsuit alleging that Disney had conspired with cable systems to keep Fox Sports West 2 from being carried.

HEADLINE: After a Veto, Pataki Offers His Own Solar-Panel Plan

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Seven months after he vetoed a similar bill, Gov. George E. Pataki offered his own proposal yesterday to allow New Yorkers to install rooftop solar panels and sell excess electricity back to their utilities, earning credit on their electric bills.
The Governor's bill also offers a tax credit to spur homeowners to invest in the expensive technology. Mr. Pataki also added requirements for safety features that could prevent electric shocks to line workers during a power failure. 
 Last October, the Governor said the lack of these requirements was the basis for his veto, which was sharply criticized by environmentalists.
New York State residents currently may use solar panels only if they are not connected to the main power grid. About 15 states, including California and all of New England, already allow homeowners essentially to become small-scale solar power plants, running their electric meters backward and sending the power back to their utilities when they generate more than they use.
"Clean solar energy can and should play a more significant role in meeting New York State's energy needs," Mr. Pataki said in a written statement.
Legislators who back the concept said they were optimistic that a solar-power bill would win passage this year. But some environmentalists expressed concern that the tax-credit provisions in the Governor's plan might stir opposition and hurt the measure's chances.
Steven C. Englebright, a Democratic Assemblyman from East Setauket, who sponsored the vetoed bill, said, "I'm pleased that the Governor has belatedly come to the position that was made available to him last year."
Mr. Pataki's bill -- like the versions passed by the Legislature last year -- would cap at about 30,000 the number of households that could have solar panels connected to the grid. Even so, energy experts said such a law could help cut energy costs and avert blackouts on scorching summer days.
Photovoltaic cells produce the most power at just those times of the day and year when demand for air conditioning drains existing supplies in New York City, Long Island and much of New England, said Thomas Thompson, the executive director of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, a private group based in Massachusetts that represents users and installers of solar cells.
"You don't think of New York when you think solar power, but it's really ideal," Mr. Thompson said. Energy costs in and around New York City are far higher than the national average, making solar panels -- despite the initial high cost -- a boon in the long run, he said.
Allowing reversible meters for solar power in a big state like New York is also likely to increase the demand for photovoltaic panels, spurring mass production, which could then lower the price of the systems, said Larry Sherwood, executive director of the American Solar Energy Society, in Boulder, Colo. Probably fewer than 1,000 households across the country send solar power back to their electric companies, he said. But that number could quickly swell if the cost of a panel of photovoltaic cells and related equipment -- now around $15,000 -- continues to drop.
Mr. Pataki's bill would lower the initial investment further by offering a personal income tax credit for 25 percent of the cost of a system, up to a ceiling of $3,750.
Mr. Englebright said that the tax credit would have to be carefully studied by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee to see if it made economic sense. He added that the benefit from a tax credit appeared to conflict with another provision of Mr. Pataki's bill that would allow a utility to collect up to $350 from a customer for the cost of connecting such a system to power lines.
But some environmental groups expressed concern that the tax provisions could hurt the bill. Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a private organization, said, "It's the kind of thing he knows the Assembly will reject. It makes me think it's an attempt to posture rather than getting something enacted into law."
But others sided with Mr. Pataki. Ashok Gupta, a lawyer and energy expert for the Natural Resources Defense Council who helped write the new bill as well as last year's version, said, "This is a very important step in getting clean energy sources into New York."
New York's electric utilities, although not yet privy to details of Mr. Pataki's new proposal, continued to oppose the idea of allowing metered solar power, said Howard Shapiro, president of the Energy Association of New York, a lobby representing the state's eight largest investor-owned power providers. He said utilities would in essence be subsidizing expensive solar-power systems for wealthy customers, passing on costs to poorer customers.

HEADLINE: $25 Million In Endowment To Be Sought By A.C.L.U.

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
The American Civil Liberties Union, the nation's oldest and largest civil liberties group, is preparing to announce on Sunday its first endowment campaign, with the goal of raising $25 million by 1999, $10 million of which has already been raised.
Joining thousands of other nonprofit groups trying to take advantage of a strong economy and booming stock market, the A.C.L.U. is seeking the endowment, or what it calls a "trust for the Bill of Rights," to insure future financial stability and end what the group acknowledges is its extreme vulnerability to shifts in the nation's political and economic climate. 
 "Even a 1 percent drop in annual contributions creates a $350,000 gap that can be met only by reducing program and staff," the group says in its "gold book," which describes the campaign to prospective donors. At its high point of annual cash flow, the group has only a six-week reserve in its current annual budget of $35 million, the gold book says.
The largest contribution to the endowment so far has come from the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust, which last November gave the campaign $2 million. Robert Crane, president of the Joyce Mertz Gilmore Foundation, which administers the trust, said an endowment would enable the A.C.L.U. "to continue taking on the tough and often unpopular issues it has taken on in the past."
The civil liberties group, like so many advocacy organizations, has tended almost by definition to think more about programs than fund-raising, Mr. Crane said.
"And because it is a principled organization that has taken on some very controversial issues -- from defending gay rights to freedom of speech for Nazis in Skokie, Ill. -- it has been even harder to raise money," Mr. Crane added. "So launching this endowment drive is an important maturation point for the A.C.L.U."
The organization, with its headquarters in New York, has more than 300 chapters and some 275,000 members whose contributions, along with foundation grants, provide virtually all of its annual budget, 80 percent of which supports litigation, lobbying and public education programs. Fund-raising accounts for about 12 percent of the budget, and administration costs for the remaining 8 percent. Members pay $20 in annual fees, but the average contribution is about $50 a member.
The group will formally announce the new campaign in a full-page newspaper advertisement on Sunday. But Woody Kaplan, a member of the A.C.L.U.'s national board and one of the campaign's six co-chairmen, said that he and several others active in the group began asking about 50 supporters for endowment gifts a year ago.
"We've got an overwhelmingly positive response, perhaps because people feel that their rights and liberties are under systematic attack," said Mr. Kaplan, a real estate developer in Boston who has pledged $1 million to the campaign, the largest gift so far from an individual.
The group has enlisted celebrities as honorary co-chairmen and co-chairwomen. Among them are Whoopi Goldberg, Phil Donahue, Rob Reiner, Marlo Thomas and Barbra Streisand, as well as scholars like Henry Louis Gates Jr. and politicians like Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the former Governor of Connecticut.
The A.C.L.U., founded in 1920, has been a litigant in most of what became landmark civil liberties cases, from the Scopes "monkey trial" over the teaching of evolution in 1925 to its victory last year in the Supreme Court decision in Romer v. Evans, involving equal rights for lesbians and gay men. Last year it challenged the Clinton Administration's Communications Decency Act, contending that the Federal Government has no right to censor ostensibly "indecent" material on the Internet.
The group's low point came in 1977, when it defended the rights of neo-Nazis to demonstrate in Skokie, a heavily Jewish suburb of Chicago. Though the court upheld its argument, thousands of A.C.L.U. members resigned in fury and contributions plunged, leaving the group nearly $500,000 in debt in 1978.
But the crisis was what Samuel Walker, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska, called in his history of the group "a blessing in disguise" in that it "exposed a host of organizational problems" and forced the A.C.L.U. to overhaul its operations.
Membership, now at a record high, is still growing, but slowly.
Ira Glasser, the A.C.L.U.'s national director since the furor over the Skokie case, called the campaign "the culmination of the rebuilding that began after Skokie." The climate is now right for a successful endowment drive, he added, because "we are in the midst of a 15-year siege to reverse the gains in civil rights and liberties of the Warren Supreme Court."

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE CALLS FOR MINIMUM WAGE IN WORKFARE PLAN

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Weighing in on one of the most contentious issues from last year's landmark welfare bill, the White House said today that most of the recipients being placed in work programs should be covered by minimum-wage laws.
The long-awaited legal interpretation drew surprised and angry response from governors of both parties and from the authors of the welfare law, who said it had the potential to gut the legislation's work requirements. 
 Applying the minimum wage, they said, would vastly increase the cost of running work programs and leave most states unable to enroll the required number of recipients. Critics say it could also reduce the incentive for workfare participants to leave the rolls for private jobs.
"This could really hamper what we're trying to do," said Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, the main author of the bill. "It could drastically cut back the hours that welfare recipients are required to work."
Gov. Thomas Carper of Delaware, a Democrat, said that if the interpretation held, states would either have to raise their benefits or reduce their work programs at the risk of Federal penalty. "It's an untenable position to put a state in," he said.
The issue, which has been the subject of lengthy, behind-the-scenes discussion, arose from what amounts to an oversight in drafting the legislation. While previous welfare laws explicitly outlined when minimum wage laws applied, the current law is silent.
Focusing on the issue months ago, labor leaders argued that workfare recipients were covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires the minimum wage in most cases. In late February, the Labor Department drafted a confidential report backing the unions' interpretation, and after months of study, the White House has agreed, although with what may be limited enthusiasm.
"Our reading of the Fair Labor Standards Act is that it covers workfare recipients," Bruce Reed, the White House domestic policy adviser, said today in an interview.
Mr. Reed, a strong supporter of work requirements, disagreed with those who said the interpretation would leave states unable to put welfare recipients to work. "Most recipients would be earning the minimum wage anyway," he said.
The decision is the second in recent weeks in which the White House has sided with union leaders on issues arising from the welfare bill. On May 2, the Administration barred a Texas plan that would have given private corporations a broad new role in providing social services.
That decision was made by President Clinton himself, after an Oval Office appeal from the leaders of public employees' unions, whose jobs would have been at risk. It was widely interpreted as an effort to repay the union leaders who have supported the Democratic Party.
By contrast, it was unclear whether today's development stemmed from political considerations or mostly from a technical reading of the nation's labor laws.
While expressing concern about the decision, Mr. Shaw declined to interpret it as a sign of waning Presidential support for work requirements. "I still feel the President is a full partner on welfare reform," he said. "If the White House thinks their hands are tied by the current labor laws and wants us to fix it, we'll do that."
Mr. Reed declined to comment on whether the White House would support legislation that exempted workfare programs from minimum wage laws.
The debate over the Fair Labor Standards Act is being closely watched because it may offer clues about whether welfare recipients are covered by other labor laws as well. In some states, for instance, workers covered by the labor act are automatically eligible for workers' compensation and unemployment insurance.
Mr. Reed said a similar issue had delayed a formal announcement of Administration policy. He said he was waiting for the Treasury Department to decide whether workfare participants qualified for the earned income tax credit, a wage supplement that offers low-wage workers cash payments of up to $3,300 a year.
Applying the fair labor law may also set precedents that make it easier for labor leaders to organize recipients into unions.
Among the issues remaining to be clarified is how the wage would be calculated. The average cash welfare benefit is about $370 a month, meaning recipients could not be required to work more than 77 hours a month -- or 19 hours a week -- at the minimum wage of $4.75 an hour.
But the welfare law requires most recipients to work 20 hours a week in 1997, rising to 30 hours by 2000.
But Mr. Reed said that under some circumstances, states could also include the value of food stamps when calculating the effective wage. That would increase the estimated "wages" paid to welfare recipients by hundreds of dollars a month. But a confidential background paper prepared by the Department of Labor suggests that food stamps could be counted only in certain limited circumstances.
Since welfare recipients also receive Medicaid, Mr. Shaw said the value of that program should also be considered part of the wage. But the Labor Department paper said the value of Medicaid would not apply.
Mr. Reed's comments came in an interview today, and the White House has not publicly released the pivotal, technical details.
The fair labor law would require the minimum wage to apply when workfare participants are engaged in a traditional "employee-employer" relationship. While that would appear to cover most work programs, it would not apply if recipients were engaged in educational or training activities.
In March, the American Public Welfare Association passed a unanimous resolution urging that workfare programs be exempt from the labor act. The organization represents the state officials who run welfare programs.
Public employee unions have long opposed workfare programs, in part because of concerns about worker displacement. They fear that local governments would be less likely to hire union members to rake leaves or sweep streets if workfare participants could be forced to do the same work at much lower wages.
Today's announcement marked the second union victory on that issue this week. In New York, a state judge ruled on Monday that participants in a city workfare program must be paid not only the minimum wage, but the "prevailing wage" paid to other public employees, or as much as $8 or $9 an hour.
While today's decision may ease some of the union's concerns, it may make private employers less enthusiastic about hiring welfare recipients.
"It adds terrific costs," said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican who helped design the welfare law. "If we're going to tell every employer, 'Oh, by the way, we're going to have a Federal auditor here,' that's going to be a terrific disincentive" to hiring recipients.
Robert Rector, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington, said the decision to apply minimum wage laws would cripple the work requirements. "That's a gangland execution of welfare reform," he said. "You want to make welfare less attractive than low-skilled jobs. You want to increase the incentive for people to get off the rolls as quickly as possible."
But the founder of one influential work program disagreed. Peter Cove, the founder of America Works, said treating welfare recipients as traditional workers "tells them that they're being valued, and that's terribly important."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Lower Against Yen, But Manages to Stabilize a Bit

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday but steadied against the yen for the first time since its frenetic slide began more than a week ago, helped by rumors of central bank sales of the Japanese currency.
Although the dollar still finished with a slight loss against the yen for the day, traders were buying dollars as the week drew to a close, a sign that some believe the dollar may be stabilizing. 
 "There was talk that the Bank of England was buying dollars against yen, or selling yen against other currencies on behalf of the Bank of Japan," said Dieter Bluhm, vice president of foreign exchange at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "It came from various sources, and it isn't completely out of the question that they have indeed done that."
Central banks typically do not comment on whether they have intervened in the foreign-exchange markets.
In New York, the dollar finished at 115.55 yen, down from 116.10 yen on Thursday, but up from its intraday low of 114.85 yen. It was the first time in more than a week that the decline was less than one yen. The dollar fell to 1.6925 marks from 1.6988 marks. The pound fell to $1.6367 from $1.6426.
The dollar received a temporary boost from a Commerce Department report of surprisingly strong housing construction in April, which contributed to speculation that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at its policy-making meeting on Tuesday. Doubts that the Fed would raise rates had been contributing to the dollar's decline.
But the dollar faded as the stock market reacted badly to the Commerce Department report, and pushed the Dow Jones average down nearly 140 points.
Since hitting a four-and-a-half-year high of 127.46 yen May 1, the dollar has dropped about 11 yen, or nearly 9 percent.
Much of that decline came after May 8, when signs of higher interest rates in Japan, a slower United States economy and warnings from Japanese officials about an undervalued yen caused the biggest dollar selloff in nearly two years.
Japanese officials have since toned down their comments, a sign they fear the dollar's decline has gone too far.

HEADLINE: Entrenched Problems in the Emerging Peruvian Market

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru

 BODY:
Bruce Heafitz made and lost a $50 million fortune in the oil business in the United States in the 1980's and then regained much of it, only to sink millions into an ill-fated venture to look for sunken ships, ancient Egyptian tombs and other lost treasures.
For those setbacks, he had only himself and the uncertainties of the marketplace to blame. Now, though, he said he was discovering a daunting new challenge to his entrepreneurial ambitions: bureaucracy and high-level cronyism in countries that are emerging markets. 
 Two years ago, Mr. Heafitz said, he settled on Peru as the ideal target to export one of America's hottest businesses of the 1990's -- gambling. The Government had recently relaxed restrictions on gambling, and private casinos, bingo parlors and slot-machine houses were springing up throughout the country. With a group of investors, he opened an entertainment complex in the affluent Miraflores district of Lima in 1995, and it became an immediate hit.
But what initially appeared to be a royal flush has turned out to be one of the worst wagers of Mr. Heafitz's career. Soon after the complex -- a bingo parlor and nightclub -- opened, he become embroiled in legal disputes because of what he regarded as corruption and intimidation.
The upshot? Mr. Heafitz has closed the bingo parlor and may have to shut down the disco, too. He said he stood to lose $5 million in start-up costs and was accused of what he said were a variety of trumped up charges.
When Mr. Heafitz started going about setting up his gambling emporium in Peru -- with a group of investors who ran a fleet of casino ships off Florida -- it seemed that the venture would go smoothly. He quickly cut a deal with Augusto Miyagusuku, head of the Government insurance company and a close friend of President Alberto K. Fujimori, to find space for his business in a prime location.
Mr. Miyagusuku showed Mr. Heafitz five properties owned by the insurance company, known as Popular y Porvenir, and Mr. Heafitz agreed to lease a building for $50,000 a month. After spending his "last pennies" to refurbish it, he said, he opened the American Bingo parlor and the adjoining disco in 1995. The entertainment complex quickly started to pull in 30,000 people a month and to make a hefty profit, he said.
But even as the venture seemed to be headed for business success, legal problems cropped up. First, Inca Tursa, the insurance company's real estate affiliate and Mr. Heafitz's partner in the leasing contract, informed him that he was in violation of their joint operating agreement and instructed him to vacate the building.
A letter from the state insurance company followed, saying he had no rights to be in the building because the company had canceled its contract with Inca Tursa. Then, a Peruvian court ordered him to vacate. A legal battled followed, with both sides suing for breach of contract.
Though Mr. Heafitz is appealing the court's ruling, he has already discharged 100 employees after shutting down the bingo parlor. He plans to close his disco, one of the most popular nightspots in Lima, if the case is not resolved soon.
Meantime, he said, he is being harassed by the Peruvian military and the police, who follow him, linger near his apartment and sometimes cut the electric power to the disco during prime hours. And he has been indicted on charges of fraud and violating city building codes by a prosecutor who he says is friendly with Mr. Miyagusuku.
What went wrong? By Mr. Heafitz's account, which is supported by officials of the United States Embassy here, the Government simply saw how much money he was making and decided to take over his business. And, he added, he has had little recourse because the leasing agreement the Government drew up is convoluted and, more to the point, because no one in Peru, not even the courts, is willing to cross a friend of the President.
"We've crapped out because the odds were stacked so heavily against us," Mr. Heafitz said. "This should serve as a warning to investors seeking to do business in Peru. You are very, very vulnerable because there is no justice."
The state insurance company declined to respond to repeated requests for its reaction to Mr. Heafitz's accusations. Mr. Fujimori's office and the Peruvian military likewise refused to comment.
But senior officials at the United States Embassy, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the main outlines of his story. They said his case underscored the risk American companies, especially small and midsize concerns, face when doing business in countries with weak judicial systems.
And the Peruvian justice system is notoriously corrupt, with many judges quick to accept or demand bribes and most judges vulnerable to pressure from the Government, the embassy officials said.
"We appealed to Government officials and trade associations on Mr. Heafitz's behalf, but it was too hot a potato for anyone in Peru to pursue," one official said. "The response to our appeals was always the same: 'Miyagusuku is the godfather of Fujimori's kids, and the President's mother lives in one of his apartments. What do you expect me to do?' "
The embassy's commercial section said it spent about 25 percent of its time helping American companies resolve legal disputes, mainly involving accusations, by Peruvians, of fraud or late payments.
The embassy said Peru remained a good place to make medium- and long-term investments, but it recommended that American businesses get an agreement to resolve any legal disputes in another country.
And such situations are not unique to Peru or Latin America. Variations of the Heafitz case are known in emerging markets in Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.
Mr. Heafitz partly blamed his own naivete for his troubles. Because he was introduced to Mr. Miyagusuku by a former Governor of Florida, Bob Martinez, he said, he looked on the Peruvian official's involvement as a guarantee of smooth sailing.
And he signed a complicated leasing contract he did not fully understand because Mr. Miyagusuku assured him it was standard procedure in Peru, he said. Embassy officials agreed that Mr. Heafitz should have exercised more caution about the agreement.
For his part, the 56-year-old American entrepreneur said he was not about to give up. "If eventually we have to close up shop here," he said, "I'm taking all these fancy disco lights and slot machines and opening up across town."

HEADLINE: An African Tyrant Departs

 BODY:
President Mobutu Sese Seko no doubt fled Kinshasa yesterday to save his life and his fortune rather than to spare Zaire a final spasm of violence as rebel forces closed in on the capital. Anything else would have been out of character for a man who misruled his country for nearly 32 years, impoverishing his people as he skimmed millions, perhaps billions of dollars from the Government to enrich himself.
His was a destructive and flamboyant dictatorship, sustained with the cynical assistance of the United States and France. Few cold-war alliances reflected so poorly on those involved. Mr. Mobutu ran his resource-rich country like a satrap, smothering political opposition, selling off its minerals for the benefit of a few and demanding a fawning allegiance that often bordered on parody. Washington accepted the abuses as the price of maintaining a cold-war ally, and France was happy to use Mr. Mobutu to retain its influence and economic links in Central Africa. 
 Zaire deserves better, but may not get it. Rebels who have fought a successful seven-month campaign will assume power in the days ahead without governing experience or a clear commitment to democracy and the rule of law. Their leader, Laurent Kabila, has conducted a scorched-earth offensive, permitting the killing of Hutu refugees from Rwanda by his Tutsi commanders. Mr. Kabila has assured Western diplomats he does not intend to copy Mr. Mobutu's methods, but the brutal behavior of his followers in recent months belies those words.
Mr. Kabila can set a different pattern by dealing humanely with the remnants of the Mobutu court and moving quickly to demonstrate that he is more interested in governance than revenge. Thousands of Rwandan refugees remain trapped in Zaire, and Mr. Kabila must do everything he can to prevent his troops from attacking them and impeding the work of international relief organizations.
It will take years for Zaire to recover from the Mobutu regime, even under enlightened leadership. An immediate effort should be made to freeze Mr. Mobutu's assets in Europe and anywhere else he placed them. His fortune alone could give Zaire an economic boost. The only pity is that his sacking of Zaire did not end years ago.

News Vendors Face Prospect Of Last Stand

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
ADAM PETRELLA'S newsstand sits on the northwest corner of Canal Street and the Bowery. He calls it Petrella's Point and gussies it up with bright red paint and drawings of Bruce Lee, Marilyn Monroe and the Shroud of Turin.
"This corner is like the end of the world," said Mr. Petrella above the rude roar of the trucks rumbling past. "If you stood here for 10 minutes, you'd see that every other person who comes here is completely lost." 
 To help, he painted a sign with handy directions: "Essex Street, Where Jewish People Used to Be -- Seven Blocks East. Little Italy, Where Italians Used to Be -- Two Blocks North."
Those tips might be replaced by a final one: "Petrella's Point -- Where Adam Used To Be -- You're Standing On It."
Yesterday Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani signed into law new rules governing sidewalk newsstands, increasing the annual fee charged the city's 330 vendors from $538 to as much as $5,000, depending on the location. The law also provides for 100 more stands to be put out for competitive bids. Current renters will have five years before the city decides whether to continue renting the stands or to seek bids.
The law is part of the initiative to replace current street furniture (newsstands and bus shelters) with new streamlined versions that will be built by the company that wins a 20-year city contract. The new items and 30 public toilets will be financed by selling advertising space on them, generating hundreds of millions for whoever gets the contract.
MR. PETRELLA wonders when he'll become a victim of design and progress.
"That's what I'm afraid of," he said. "I was going to put a sign above the stand saying 'Endangered Species.' "
Supporters of the move said it will lend a sense of style and order to sidewalks marred by ramshackle stands, as well as bring the city millions in revenue. Administration officials also said it would maximize the income earned by the city for limited public space.
"We suspect there are locations that can bring in over $100,000 a year," said Craig Muraskin, director of policy for the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development and Planning. "We hope to show that the people of the city are best served by a free market-based competitive system that will bring in an appropriate amount of money."
The group representing most of Manhattan's newsstand operators is content with the agreement. But Steven Stollman, a former newsstand builder and operator with a soft spot for newsies, has rallied a small number of them who are afraid for their livelihoods and alarmed by what they see as a process in which too many details have yet to be explained.
"For many people, this has been a marginal living," he said. "If the dealer's rent is regulated at $5,000 a year, his landlord can dispute him and create a situation where he might have to pay thousands more. You're talking about a huge prize to get rid of these stands."
TAI LEE, who spends 12 hours a day at a stand in Chinatown, said that the Chinese-language papers he specializes in do not make him enough money to pay the increased fees. Lotto sales help, but winning it would probably be the only guarantee for his future.
Mr. Stollman thinks the whole process has been entered into too quickly, a point he has made at numerous forums. And while the city touts the free and improved street furniture, he is worried about a blizzard of advertising on look-alike stands.
"This is mall furniture," he said. "New York should strive to maintain its uniqueness. We shouldn't accept these things that are the same like Des Moines or even Paris."
Mr. Stollman said the outsides of stands and shelters could be improved, and you don't have to look overseas, either.
"We're in Fort Knox when it comes to design, and we are rich beyond belief," he said. "We could do it in a New York kind of way. We have so many artists and designers who can render objects in our common spaces. Each could be unique and it could be the result of what each community decides is best in its judgment."
Mr. Petrella and eight other vendors joined Mr. Stollman yesterday at City Hall to protest the law. Nothing changed.
"This just means a headache in trying to figure out a way to make a living," Mr. Petrella said. "In fact, today I was wondering if I should begin looking for another job." He has a stack of classifieds he could thumb through, gratis. He has a newsstand.

HEADLINE: Starts of Housing Up 2.6%, But Key Category Is Weak

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Construction of single-family houses was weak last month, providing another sign of economic slowing. But a survey found that consumer confidence remained strong.
The Commerce Department said today that housing starts over all rose 2.6 percent in April, to an annual rate of 1.473 million, exceeding analysts' expectations. But almost all of the gain came in the volatile category of apartment construction. Starts on multifamily projects increased 10.9 percent from March, while single-family housing starts rose just three-tenths of 1 percent. 
 Moreover, the number of applications for construction permits fell.
"This is really another sign of moderation in the economy," said Eileen Neely, manager of economic forecasting at Fannie Mae. "Single-family starts were a little bit weaker than most analysts expected."
Still, real estate markets have been bolstered by the highest levels of consumer confidence in the economy in decades, the lowest unemployment rate in almost a quarter- century and record gains in the stock market. The University of Michigan said today that its preliminary index of consumer sentiment for May climbed to 104.6 from 101.4 last month; the rise is the fourth consecutive monthly increase.
The gain in consumer confidence suggested that the March decision by Federal Reserve policy makers to push up interest rates "hasn't diminished household spirits," said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds.
While that might give the Fed pause, other economists pointed to the housing numbers as an indication that growth has moderated. "When you look at the level of starts, we are right in the range that the Fed would like," said Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. "It doesn't look like home building is going to be an engine of growth."
Taken together, today's economic reports added to the uncertainty about whether the policy makers will raise interest rates when they meet next week. Recent data have provided a mixed picture of the prospects for an acceleration in inflation.
The 2.6 percent increase in housing starts in April followed a decline in March, which was revised today to a 7.7 percent drop from the 6.4 percent reported previously.
Though construction this year may not beat 1996's level, which was the highest in eight years, starts remain strong because demand in parts of the country is exceeding the supply of new homes, analysts said.
Additionally, the Midwest flooding restrained starts in March and April, possibly setting the stage for the "mother of all rebounds in May or June," said Ian Shepherson, an economist at HSBC Securities Inc. in New York. Permits for new construction will also rebound, he said.
By region, housing starts rose 11.3 percent in the South and seven-tenths of 1 percent in the Midwest. Starts fell 7.4 percent in the Northeast and 6.5 percent in the West.
Looking ahead, home builders expect the housing industry to hold its own, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders, although their optimism slipped a bit this month. The trade group's housing market index, released on Thursday, declined to 54 in May from 56 in April.
"We are optimistic," said James Martell Jr., president and chief executive of Fortress Group Inc., a home builder in Vienna, Va., that has reported a 70 percent increase in revenue for the first quarter. "Working through our backlog will result in strong closings and revenues in the second half of 1997."
Relatively low mortgage rates are helping the market. Although the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rose to 8.14 percent in April from 7.9 percent in March, rates are below last summer's levels.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Off as Traders Warily Await Fed Meeting

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
With the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates drawing near, bond market participants became more sensitive to economic data yesterday and sold off after reports showed strength in housing and a rise in consumer sentiment.
The data kept alive market concerns that the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy group, was likely to raise short-term rates on Tuesday to slow growth and keep inflation from heating up. Despite yesterday's market action, dealers, traders and investors remained split over what the Fed would do. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 15/32 , to 96 17/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.90 percent from 6.86 percent.
Treasury prices fell after the Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose 2.6 percent in April, more than the rise of one-tenth of 1 percent that analysts had been expecting. But nearly all of the gain came in apartment construction, and the number of building permits fell.
"This mixed report on housing starts and building permits does not indicate the sort of strength that would lead the Federal Reserve to tighten short-term rates" next week, said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc. "What should be more important to the Fed is the recent reported softness in April retail sales and industrial production, which represent far larger slices of the economy than housing."
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a consulting firm, said housing starts were healthy, but not excessive. "For the Fed, this is the last piece of economic information before next week's F.O.M.C. meeting," he said. "The data of the past six weeks have been a mixed bag, with a lot of indications that the economy has slowed after the December-through-February spurt, including slower sales and employment growth, declining orders and low inflation and labor-cost increases. But there have been some signs of continuing growth, including housing's persisting strength and high levels of consumer confidence."
Indeed, bond prices weakened further after the University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment for May showed a reading of 104.6, up sharply from a reading of 101.4 in April, traders said. (The report is released only to paying subscribers.) The jump suggested to some investors that the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates on March 25 by a quarter of a percentage point had not diminished the enthusiasm of consumers.
Kathleen Camilli, director of economic research at Tucker Anthony Inc., said the bond market had paused over new evidence that economic growth might not be decelerating as rapidly as previously anticipated.
"However, I wouldn't be surprised to see a strong rally in the bond market after the F.O.M.C. meeting, because if the Fed tightens, then market participants will perceive the move as the last tightening for a while, and thus the bond market will rally," she said. "And if they don't, market participants will perceive it as a window of opportunity until the next meeting on July 1 and 2."
"So after the knee-jerk reaction, the market will rally regardless of whether they tighten or not," Ms. Camilli added.

Waiting For Lefty

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
It was probably over the minute Jane Fonda married Ted Turner. But liberalism has continued its free fall out of fashion.
The Hollywood Women's Political Caucus has shut down. Mario Cuomo is reduced to debating Dan Quayle. The third generation of Kennedy men has muddied the liberal banner with swinish treatment of women -- in an era when the women are no longer willing to bury themselves in their church, their cups and their credit cards. 
 Embracing the rich and ignoring the poor is good politics. Richard Riordan swatted radical-turned-liberal Tom Hayden in the Los Angeles mayoral race, just as Rudolph Giuliani will swat liberal-still-liberal Ruth Messinger in New York.
Tony Blair says his generation of leaders has moved beyond ideology, beyond left and right. His first act as Prime Minister was to turn over Britain's monetary policy to the banks.
Bill Clinton, whose legacy will be doing away with welfare, preaches volunteerism instead of government. He struck a budget deal that analysts say will snuff out the big government spending without which liberalism is just nostalgia.
So liberals are definitely in spotted-owl land. Of course, there are still a few hardy souls left who are happy to call themselves left. And there is one who is even willing to prop up the fading ideology.
After investing with others in the liberal magazine The Nation in 1995 to revive it, Paul Newman has now become a kibitzing owner, writing the occasional rant. "Longhand on a yellow pad," he says.
His role as the last liberal suits him. In his movies he often played a guy fighting the system.
"If government is unable to give us government, it ought, at least, to give us a few laughs," Cool Hand Luke wrote recently. His first piece was a whimsical look at what would happen if Jesse Helms had to answer questions at his own confirmation hearing. His second mocked Newt Gingrich for proposing that rich people in Hollywood finance the N.E.A.
So far, he says dryly in a telephone interview, his liberal voice has amounted to "two hiccups." "But unless there's a noisy, vibrant voice on the left, people will think the center is to the right of Genghis Khan," he says. "We just got rid of Dornan and now we get Burton. They just keep popping out of rat holes."
He scorns the Republicans on culinary grounds as well. Al D'Amato's mother has a line of Mama D'Amato spaghetti sauce coming out that will compete with Newman's Own. "If D'Amato thinks he's getting into the spaghetti sauce business, he has another sauce coming," the actor/director/chef/race driver/philanthropist/journalist taunts. "Sinatra tried to run us out of the business with spaghetti sauces. It was not successful. D'Amato should stick to potholes. D'Amato and I ought to face off with meatballs at 15 feet."
Although Mr. Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward, are friendly with Bill and Hillary Clinton, the actor was not full of praise for the President or other Democrats.
"Everything is about what's winnable, not about the morality of issues," he says. "They can't do anything courageous because they're protecting themselves for the next election. They come up with baby steps when they should be taking strides on core issues -- inner cities, race relations, the growing and stunning gap between rich and poor.
"With brave leadership, you might be forced to take positions on moral issues, even if there are adverse economic and political consequences. I've been contemplating racing cars again. I stopped because I was afraid I was too long in the tooth, that I wasn't quick enough. And then I decided, you can do anything if you are prepared to deal with the consequences."
He despairs at the failure to fix campaign finance, and at the White House's permanent campaign apparatus. "There's an old statement that disease protects itself," he says. "The system will go to any length to maintain its foothold, with cholesterol, alcohol, cocaine and pollsters."
He advises me to go see "Waiting for Lefty," an Off Broadway production of the archetypal proletariat play of the 30's, directed by Ms. Woodward. "The play is elemental and naive, but the passion is so focused, so relentless and uncompromising, that you're up yelling 'Strike!' at the end."
Uncompromising passion is a wonderful thing, but Lefty never met Dick Morris.

HEADLINE: For Market, a Rate Rise Now May Be Better Than None

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Will the Fed just wait?
That's the nagging question for investors ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee. 
 Indeed, for many on Wall Street, the only thing worse than the Fed's raising rates next week is the Fed's deciding not to raise rates. Why? Since many investors believe that at least one more rate increase this year is inevitable, it makes sense to them to get it out of the way now.
In contrast with March, when analysts were overwhelmingly convinced that the central bank would raise short-term interest rates rather than hold them steady, sentiment on Wall Street today is split about what the Fed will do. Inflation is practically nonexistent and the robust growth of the first quarter appears to be fading -- reasons for the Fed to hold off.
But if the Fed leaves its target rate at 5.5 percent on Tuesday, uncertainty may dog the financial markets and stocks and bonds are more likely to experience sharp ups and downs this summer, extending the roller-coaster ride of recent months.
"It makes for a more uncertain market and, therefore, the possibility of a more volatile market," said Richard Berner, the chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Unless the economy slows much more than expected, every new economic report will be scoured for hints of what the Fed's policy makers will do when they gather again in July. And given the erratic nature of a lot of the Government's statistics, markets could be in for some wild swings.
What would be especially tough is a string of economic reports indicating that the slowdown in consumer spending in April was simply a pause rather than a genuine downshift in the exuberant pace of earlier this year. Traders would conclude that the economy was too strong for the Fed to feel confident that inflation would remain under control, reversing the sentiment underlying the recent rally. Interest rates would move higher and stock prices lower.
With a rate increase next week, the outlook would be different, even if stocks and bonds tumble initially.
On one hand, if the slowdown is confirmed in economic reports for May and June, then a Fed rate increase next week would clear the way for a market rally. With two Fed rate increases already in the bag, investors could fairly conclude that the central bank would wait quite a while before acting again.
On the other hand, even if the economic news turns out to be less comforting to Wall Street, the Fed's back-to-back rate increases would help squelch speculation that the central bank would try a third rate increase so soon. And the confidence that the Fed was ahead of the curve would help cushion any fall.
The Fed, of course, has to take a lot more into account than just the markets. And perhaps the biggest force weighing against an immediate rate increase is the one Fed officials never like to talk about: politics.
The criticism of the Fed from politicians and commentators has been sharp enough since its quarter-point increase in March that Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, went out of his way last week to deliver an unusually detailed defense of the central bank. The sniping would certainly increase if the Fed lifts rates again next week, especially because it is so hard to persuade elected officials of the need for acting before a new inflationary surge is detected.
"Launching a pre-emptive strike against inflation has to be difficult in any political context," Mr. Berner of the Mellon Bank said. The Fed wants to be pre-emptive but not premature. "If the Fed is premature," he said, "it erodes its public support and its political support for what they do and their independence."
Moreover, the underlying economic rationale for a rate increase, in the eyes of some Wall Street economists, has weakened in the last two weeks. William Dudley, the chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, just changed his view on Thursday, saying that "the odds favor the Fed standing pat." Citing the Fed's decision last summer not to raise interest rates despite a burst of growth in the spring, Mr. Dudley said that Mr. Greenspan "has shown a willingness to be patient when the economy is slowing."
Indeed, even analysts who lean toward a rate increase acknowledge that the Fed has plenty of reasons to be patient. The Producer Price Index has fallen four months in a row, including a six-tenths of a percent decline in April. The Consumer Price Index is up just 2.5 percent in the last 12 months, while the more closely watched Employment Cost Index rose less than 3 percent. The decline in April retail sales is also a sign that the opportunity to raise prices remains limited. And the balanced budget agreement in Washington helps ease fears. The Fed has already moved once this year to brake the economy by raising its Federal funds target -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.
But others contend that the weight of evidence tilts slightly in the other direction. They start with the exceptionally low unemployment rate. Since last May, it has dropped to 4.9 percent from 5.5 percent. While most experts applaud an economy capable of generating jobs for almost everyone who wants one, the fear is that the jobless rate is so low that it is just a matter of time before inflationary pressures bubble over.
The average unemployment rate for the last 12 months of 5.3 percent is the lowest since the year ended February 1990, when inflation was clearly on the rise and the economy was only a few months from falling into recession. Other than that brief period, unemployment has not been so low in nearly a quarter of a century.
As for real growth, which has averaged about 4 percent in the last year, the economy has not expanded at such a rapid pace for a full year since 1987. Before that, the last three quarters of 1984 and the first of 1985 added up to another strong year. But at that time the economy was still rebounding from the severe 1981-82 recession and labor markets were not tight. Unemployment averaged 7.4 percent and was still at 6.2 percent in 1987.
So for all the talk of a new economic era, it is no surprise that Mr. Greenspan is worried that conditions today are simply too good to last. In defending the Fed's March 25 rate increase in his speech last week, the Fed chairman said the move was "taken not so much as a consequence of a change in the most probable forecast of moderate growth and low inflation for later this year and next, but rather to address the probability that being wrong had materially increased."
To Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, that means the Fed's job is "to make sure that growth isn't so brisk over the next 12 months that it lowers the unemployment rate." But even with that in mind, he says, next week the Fed could still leave Wall Street waiting.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lays Out Its Fraud Case Against Governor of Arizona

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, May 16

 BODY:
Opening the Government's fraud case against Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona, a Federal prosecutor told jurors here today that Mr. Symington had concocted an elaborate web of financial lies in a desperate effort to salvage a crumbling real estate empire.
Mr. Symington's lawyer countered that his client was an honorable developer who took risks and sometimes suffered as a result but that he had never acted dishonorably. 
 The prosecutor, David Schindler, showed blowup after blowup of bank statements and other financial documents to the jury. That evidence, Mr. Schindler argued, showed that when Mr. Symington fell into financial trouble, he falsely inflated and deflated his true net worth time after time to obtain new development loans or have old loans forgiven from 1986 to 1991.
At one point in 1990, he added, Mr. Symington told one lender that he was $5.3 million in the black and another that he was $4.1 million in the red.
"The defendant is a very smart and clever man who told lies," Mr. Schindler declared as he opened the prosecution's attack in Federal District Court here. "To get loans, he portrayed a man with millions. In financial trouble, he portrayed a different person."
Mr. Symington's lawyer, John Dowd, himself a former Justice Department lawyer, countered that the Governor had done no more or less than make estimates of his worth at various points. Mr. Dowd said the lenders knew they were estimates and accepted them as such because they understood the extremely fluid nature of the real estate market.
"They were highly subjective figures," Mr. Dowd argued. "There are many different kinds of values in real estate -- short-term values, long-term values, liquidation values, fire-sale values. There is no hard-and-fast rule."
The Government prosecutors, Mr. Dowd asserted, did not understand the nature of risk or the fluidity in the real estate market.
Mr. Symington, a 51-year-old descendant of an Eastern family long involved in big business and politics, faces 22 counts of fraud, perjury and extortion. Most of the charges date back before he became the Governor in 1991. If convicted he could be sent to prison for dozens of years, depending on the charges proved.
Specifically, Mr. Symington is charged with giving false statements to federally insured financial institutions, with lying about his financial affairs during a bankruptcy hearing and with trying to extort less onerous terms for a loan, after he became Governor, by threatening to use the power of his office to steer business away from the lender.
"The defendant abused his office by trying to force one of his lenders out of a promise to pay a $10 million loan," Mr. Schindler declared in enumerating the various charges against Mr. Symington.
Mr. Dowd countered that Mr. Symington had made no effort to extort but had simply pointed out to the lender that the business climate was bad and growing worse.
"That was not threat," he added. "That was just common sense."
The trial here is the second time in a decade that an Arizona governor has been accused of felonious wrongdoing, and the current case, even though the trial is just getting started, has already created turmoil in the state's political scene and interrupted in the day-to-day flow of decisions and actions from the Governor's office.
In the earlier case, Gov. Evan Mecham, Mr. Symington's predecessor, was accused of accepting illegal campaign money. He was acquitted, but not before being impeached.
Throughout much of the 1980's, Mr. Symington was one of booming Arizona's most successful land developers. He built some of Phoenix's most expensive office parks and shopping malls. But like many other developers in the Southwest, he was laid financially low by the recession. Eventually, he was forced to declare bankruptcy.
"Fife Symington was a risk-taker just like the pioneers who settled the valley here," Mr. Dowd said early today in defense of his client.
In the prosecution's opening statement, Mr. Schindler charged that Mr. Symington had kept a special list of which lenders were to get which estimates. Mr. Schindler said some Symington aides and employees not only knew of the list but also, when instructed, "fixed" the figures on financial statements to reflect whatever Mr. Symington instructed.
"He would tell which figures to fix, which to add to and which to subtract from," Mr. Schindler said.
He also accused Mr. Symington of repeatedly overstating the share he held in various developments, as well as the value of those shares.
The case is expected to take the better part of several months to try. Testimony and presentation of evidence are to resume on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Champions Of Breakfast;
Pop-Up Pastries Growing As First Meal of the Day

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
No food defines the baby-boom generation like Pop-Tarts. When they came on the market in 1964, they were newfangled, convenient, sweet-tooth friendly and relatively cheap. Children grew up eating them long before the advent of the harried family with two working parents.
So it is perhaps no surprise that Pop-Tarts and their imitators have turned out to be a durable habit, an icon of popular taste -- if not culture -- that is proving extremely difficult to outgrow. 
 The Pop-Tart "was really a product that came on the market before its time," said Jon Wilson, former head of the convenience foods division and now an executive vice president at the Kellogg Company, which introduced it. "It's more relevant today than it was 30 years ago."
And it is more successful. Led by Kellogg, whose sales of Pop-Tarts totaled nearly $330 million in 1996, the market for toaster pastries -- the industry's generic term -- has steadily expanded. And though Americans still eat more cereal, eggs and toast in the morning, over the last decade toaster pastries have been the fastest-growing breakfast product, with consumption tripling, according to NPD Group, a Chicago market research firm.
Makers of toaster pastries declined to disclose profit margins, but Eric Katzman, an analyst for Merrill Lynch Equity Research, said Pop-Tarts were extremely lucrative. For Kellogg, they represent 27 percent of profits but just 19 percent of sales. The company sells more Pop-Tarts than Frosted Flakes, its leading cold cereal and the No. 1 cereal in the United States.
From the beginning, Pop-Tarts were a hit because of their appeal to children, whose tastes continue to drive sales, not only on the American market but also internationally. But food companies are hoping that as baby boomers age, they take this acquired taste with them.
"Few Pop-Tarts are consumed by people over 50," Mr. Wilson said. "But as the core consumers get older, I can see the market expanding."
Indeed, there are signs that toaster pastries are changing in pursuit of older eaters.
About a year ago, Nabisco introduced toaster pastries in its successful Snackwell's low-fat line. Until then, said Ann Smith, director of communications for Nabisco, the food business of RJR Nabisco, "there were no products for health-conscious families." Since 1995, she said, "the wellness segment of the market has expanded by 150 percent."
Snackwell's has zoomed to No. 4 among toaster pastry brands, behind Kellogg, which introduced low-fat Pop-Tarts last summer; private-label offerings, and Pillsbury Toaster Strudels, a premium-priced frozen pastry aimed at adults.
The leading "natural food" brand is Nature's Choice Toaster Pastries, introduced in July by Barbara's Bakery Inc. in Petaluma, Calif. They have none of the chemical additives or artificial colors used in the leading brands and far less sodium. As junk food goes, they are definitely less junky. But at nearly double the price of the leading brands, they still go light on nutrition, providing slightly more fiber but fewer vitamins and minerals and about the same calories as brands such as Kellogg and Nabisco.
Kellogg did not invent Pop-Tarts. The company developed its version of the toaster pastry after a competitor began marketing something similar in the early 1960's. "With our expertise in cereals and grains, we saw this as an opportunity for the company to become the market leader," Mr. Wilson said.
It did not take long for Pop-Tarts to become a breakfast Band-Aid. And now the rest of the world is discovering them. Outside the United States, sales of Pop-Tarts amounted to $75 million last year.
"Convenience foods are making a bigger contribution to our overall business around the world," said Karen Kafer, the director of communications for Kellogg.
Some industry analysts put Kellogg's share of the toaster pastry market at nearly 70 percent. But that is only for those sold in the cereal aisle. When sales of the frozen pastries made by Pillsbury, a unit of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., are included, Pop-Tarts accounted for a little more than 50 percent of the $617.6 million market last year, according to the Nielsen Scantrack survey of supermarkets.
Over the last five years, sales of toaster pastries in dollars have increased nearly 50 percent. But last year they slipped a bit -- less than 2 percent -- mainly because of price-cutting. Volume increased, however, in large part because Kellogg in June started packing eight pastries in a box instead of six without raising the price. This came in response to the eight-count package used by Nabisco for its Toastettes.
As a result, Toastettes, which had been coming on strong, dropped 45 percent in sales volume last year, though the rapid growth of Snackwell's eased some of the company's pain. Nabisco is still positioning Toastettes as the "quality value" brand, as Ms. Smith put it, but is spending heavily to promote Snackwell's.
Kellogg also reduced the suggested retail price of the larger 12-pastry package by almost 20 percent, from $3.21 to $2.59. Price has always helped sell toaster pastries. At 20 to 30 cents each, they provide a lot to eat for the money.
Who eats Pop-Tarts and other toaster pastries? Until recently, they were aimed mainly at children younger than 15, with customers fairly evenly spread across geographic, economic and ethnic lines. When children with one or more working parents have to fend for themselves, or when a parent needs to come up with a breakfast within minutes, what could be easier than a self-contained food that can be heated in a toaster and requires neither fork nor plate?
Americans ate an average of six toaster pastries apiece last year, compared with two in 1986, according to the NPD Group. The average 6- to 12-year-old ate 18 of them last year, while those older than 45 managed just three.
Studies have shown that about half of American households buy toaster pastries, with children typically driving the purchase -- though adults are easily tempted, too.
And while attention is now being paid to older consumers, children are still being aggressively courted through advertising and promotions. This summer, Pop-Tarts will be sold with special flavors and decorations coordinated with characters from the new "Batman and Robin" movie, including a Mr. Freeze flavor with ice-blue frosting and cherry filling and a strawberry Batgirl variety that has purple icing and yellow bat signals.
Ms. Kafer of Kellogg would not disclose the cost of the promotion but said it was a first for Pop-Tarts.
Never mind that most toaster pastries are highly processed, full of additives, overly sweetened and lately, like the Batman line, increasingly garish. Those characteristics have certainly never deterred the children of America.
Kellogg just introduced a "wild watermelon" flavor with flashy pink and turquoise icing, a novelty with the Power Ranger set in mind. The company has teams of researchers concocting new flavors, which are tested in focus groups and at stores. Watermelon was a winner, it seems, but apricot, a popular flavor in Australia, did not tempt Americans. Strawberry remains the all-time favorite.
Kellogg has more than 20 flavors, including six in its new low-fat line. And choices for the adults who might shudder at the sight of turquoise and pink icing are increasing.
Like the customer for Nature's Choice, the Snackwell's consumer is older and may not necessarily have children at home. Pillsbury Toaster Strudels are also designed to appeal to adults in addition to children. Some of the Pillsbury pastries have cheese fillings, also aimed at a more mature consumer.
Mr. Katzman, 32, may be typical. He said he had grown up eating Pop-Tarts. "I still like those Pop-Tarts," he said. "I'll eat any flavor."

Cereal is still America's favorite breakfast food. Over the last decade, however, toaster pastries have been the fastest-growing breakfast product, with consumption tripling. Kellogg's Pop-Tarts have been the leading toaster pastry since their introduction in 1964. But competitors, such as Nabisco with its low-fat Snackwell's line, are beginning to cut into Kellogg's market share.

Pop-Tarts were first introduced in 1964. Although there were no reruns of Gilligan's Island to watch while I sampled an assortment of iced strawberry toaster pastries, I did put on some Beatles music to get in the right mood. The following listing is alphabetical, by brand, and is not a ranking. The pastries were heated, following manufacturer's directions, in a regular pop-up toaster.
 
Barbara's Nature's Choice Toaster Pastries
 
PRICE: About 70 cents each
CALORIES: 190
Fat: 2 grams
SODIUM: 40 milligrams
 
Comments: These are made without chemical additives, artificial flavorings or colors. The pastry is quite crumbly, the icing is too sweet and though the strawberry filling had character and good flavor, there was not enough of it.
 
Kellogg's Pop-Tarts
 
Price: 22 to 30 cents each
Calories: 200
Fat: 5 grams
Sodium: 180 milligrams
 
Comments: The toaster pastry classic has thick sugary icing decorated with grainy little colored sprinkles. The pastry is like flaky cardboard, and the strawberry filling is just plain sweet.
 
Kellogg's Low-Fat Pop-Tarts
 
Price: 22 to 30 cents each
Calories: 190
Fat: 3 grams
Sodium: 200 milligrams
 
Comments: There is hardly any detectable difference in terms of appearance, taste or texture between these and the regular frosted strawberry Pop-Tarts. Oddly enough, the unfrosted low-fat variety, which I also sampled, was not as flaky as the regular unfrosted strawberry Pop-Tarts.
 
Nabisco Snackwell's Toaster Pastries
 
Price: 30 to 35 cents each
Calories: 170
Fat: 1 gram
Sodium: 200 milligrams
 
Comments: These are drizzled with pink icing that has a very chalky flavor. The pastry is like a thick, slightly soggy cracker, and the filling has an artificial, almost sour taste.
 
Nabisco Toastettes Toaster Pastries
 
Price: 20 to 25 cents each
Calories: 190
Fat: 5 grams
Sodium: 190 milligrams
 
Comments: With their nicely fluted edges, these had more eye- appeal and were slathered with a little less white icing with colored sprinkles. Is that why they are cheaper? The pastry was somewhat bready and the filling exceedingly sweet.
 
Pillsbury Toaster Strudel Pastries
 
Price: About 40 to 45 cents each
Calories: 200
Fat: 9 grams
Sodium: 190 milligrams
 
Comments: These frozen toaster pastries are richer and fresher-tasting than the shelf-stable ones. But the filling, an odd formula identified as "artificial strawberry with real fruit" was gooey and cloying, the real losing out to the artificial. The pastries come with do-it-yourself icing, which was better than that on the other pastries. (Photoraphs by Naum Kazhdan/The New York Times)(pg. 35)

HEADLINE: Case of Jitters Trims the Dow By 138 Points

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Oh, what a jittery, volatile market.
After reaching two new highs this week and capping off a rally of nearly 15 percent in just over a month, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 138.88 points, or 1.89 percent, yesterday. 
 More than a fifth of this year's sessions -- 14 -- have seen moves of a hundred points or more in either direction, with two just this week. There have been eight such surges and plunges, five up and three down, since the market rebound began April 14, a reflection of the fact that investors' overall optimism is subject to sudden bouts of doubt as everyone waits for the Federal Reserve to make its next move on interest rates.
The decline in the Dow yesterday, to 7,194.67, was part of a broad retreat led by a sharp selloff of computer and technology stocks combined with declines in drug, banking, soft drink and household product stocks.
Selling was also generated by a jump in interest rates in the bond market, which has been bouncing up and down as economic reports shift views on whether the Fed's policy-making committee will raise its target for short-term interest rates when it meets Tuesday.
A rise in housing starts in April and reports that consumer confidence climbed to a record level in the University of Michigan survey suggested that the economy might not be slowing as much as Fed officials think is necessary after a first-quarter pace of 5.6 percent, a nine-year high. Other data reported earlier this week, including April retail sales, suggested that consumer spending had dropped sharply in the beginning of the quarter.
Although all the economic reports for the week do not give a clear picture of how quickly the economy is slowing, Douglas R. Cliggott, the United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan & Company, said that any indication of strength was upsetting to investors because "the expectation of a Fed tightening has ground its way out of the financial markets."
Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation, said that much of the selling yesterday could probably be attributed to profit taking after the furious rally of the last several weeks. A sign of this, he said, is that many of the big gainers in the last two weeks, including I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and General Electric, fell yesterday. Among the winners were the stocks of retailers, truckers and toy makers.
Hewlett-Packard, which disappointed expectations when it reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of 75 cents a share, dropped 6 1/8, or 10 percent, to 52 3/4, while I.B.M. fell 3 7/8, to 170. Together, the two accounted for a quarter of the Dow's decline. Other technology leaders also suffered, including Intel and Microsoft.
Merck, off 2 3/8, to 91 1/4; Procter & Gamble, down 3, to 130 5/8, and Johnson & Johnson, off 1 1/4, to 60 1/4, accounted for another 16 percent of the Dow's plunge.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 12.13 points, or 1.4 percent, to 829.75, while the Nasdaq composite index dropped 12.85 points, or 0.95 percent, to 1,340.73. The Nasdaq 100, which is dominated by technology stocks, fell 1.8 percent, or 16.5 points, to 915.29.
But stocks of smaller companies seemed to fare a little better, probably because even though they have had a sudden rebound they are still underperforming the bigger issues over the last year. The Russell index of 2,000 stocks slipped 0.63 point, or 0.17 percent, to 365.28.
Analysts said the selling yesterday was also accentuated by the monthly expiration of stock and index options. According to Birinyi Associates of Greenwich, Conn., there were six computer-driven sell programs and just one buy program. Together the computer selling equaled a 104-point decline in the Dow.
With the Fed meeting set for Tuesday and the surprisingly strong earnings reports for the first quarter of this year already digested, the near-term outlook for the stock market is likely to hinge on the bond market and interest rates.
The decline in interest rates since mid-April is the factor that has brought the market back, many analysts say. At the bottom of the selloff that pushed the Dow down 9.8 percent, the yield on the 30-year bond was around 7.16 percent; yesterday, it stood at 6.90 percent.

HEADLINE: Baltimore's Poor Brace for Round 2

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: BALTIMORE, May 16

 BODY:
In an unmowed courtyard of the Flag housing project, two little boys and a girl crawl over the steel jungle gym, its white paint worn down to rust. The mother of one, Sharron Sturdavant, watches from the stoop of the apartment she rents for $96 a month. From the window behind her wafts the distinctive odor of leaking gas.
Living in the project is neither cozy nor comfortable, but it is home. Soon, though, Ms. Sturdavant, 38, an unemployed mother of six, and the 254 other families in Flag Court Houses will be leaving. 
 "I've been here for 22 years," Ms. Sturdavant said. "And it's a known fact that these places are supposed to be torn down."
With the project scheduled for demolition in 2000, pressure is escalating on public housing residents like those here, particularly Ms. Sturdavant and other welfare recipients. They are under the gun to get a job because they will lose their monthly checks under the welfare bill passed last year. Once they find work, they also must find child care. And for families with two or three children, that service can cost as much as they earn.
This week, the House of Representatives tightened the vise again, passing legislation that seeks to dismantle a 60-year-old system of public housing for the poor.
Among other provisions, the House bill would close more public housing to the poorest while opening units to working people who can pay closer to market rates. As in the overhaul of welfare, the goal is to goad more people to go to work and pay more of their own way. Some Flag residents pay as little as $5 a month for their apartments.
While the Senate and the Clinton Administration have yet to put their stamps on the House bill, the direction is clear. Federal and local officials hope to overhaul programs that have fostered a network of decrepit buildings and, many public housing critics argue, a culture of dependency.
Because of Congressional budget cuts in public housing support, the nation's 3,400 local housing authorities have already taken steps that narrowed options for residents. Currently about 1.4 million Americans live in public housing.
The Baltimore Housing Authority recently tore down two projects, and another will be razed next year. Flag Court Houses, a mix of 3-story and 12-story brick structures, will be last.
Baltimore's housing authority, the nation's fifth largest, with 40 projects and 18,000 tenant households, is wrestling with the new economics of trying to maintain a housing safety net. The city was set to receive $108 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1995. Instead, it got $96 million, and this year the amount fell to $81 million.
"Our whole purpose is to attract higher-income people," said Daniel Paul Henson 3d, executive director of the Baltimore Housing Authority.
To cope with the cuts, the city is replacing projects like Flag with town houses and more scattered housing, for which it is charging much more. In the place of a project demolished earlier, where the average rent was $150 a month, the housing authority expects the average for the new housing to reach $350 within two years.
Flag tenants are not optimistic about their prospects.
Malinda Ragg and Trina Thomas, both 26-year-old mothers on welfare, work part time as maids at a Holiday Inn as part of a job-training program called Project Independence.
"We get paid $60 every two weeks," Ms. Ragg said. Her monthly rent is $101., and the women cannot see how they will afford homes that the city is building, including some for sale, once they have to move.
"They tell us they're going to tear it down and we'll have first priority to come back," Ms. Ragg said.
"But that can't be true," she said, pointing to what happened after another project was demolished. "They tore Lafayette down, and they're building houses over them and they're selling those houses for $30,000 apiece.
"The rent? The rent's something like $474 a month! You have to be making $18,000 a year and have $900 in the bank just to get one."
The bill in Congress does eliminate the rule that rents must rise as tenants' incomes rise.
Among those who will be affected is Charles McFadden, 37, who was visiting from another project with his 7-year-old granddaughter, Ashley. Mr. McFadden went to work as a janitor last July and takes home $190 a week. His rent of $350 is about to be raised above $400, he said.
And going to work poses a new problem for him.
"I need a second job," Mr. McFadden said. "I need day care for her," he said of Ashley, whom he and and his wife are rearing. Quality day care starts at about $75 a week.
One feature of Congress's housing bill, a requirement that unemployed, able-bodied tenants do volunteer work in the community, has stirred much more dust among the lawmakers than among people here. The bill requires eight hours of community service work a month, like helping out at the Big Boys and Girls' Club, and requires the eviction of those who refuse.
In return for all the years she has received welfare, Ms. Sturdavant said, the volunteer work "is worth doing."
It is the crescendo of pressure from public housing and welfare authorities to get real, paying jobs that weighs on people most. Robin Mack, manager of Flag, said she was beginning to detect a shift in attitudes. Tenants, Ms. Mack said, are acting more responsibly, like showing up when they are summoned when they do not pay their rent.
"This is really, really serious," Ms. Mack said. "They can't stay on the street. There's a no-loitering law here now, and not everybody can get along with relatives and friends."
Mr. Henson of the housing authority acknowledged that some of the poorest poor -- those who cannot find jobs or cannot pay the higher rents -- would lose access to public housing and be forced into shelters for the homeless. To help them over the short term, the city is expanding construction of transitional housing, including 200 units that will open within nine months. As Mr. Henson put it, they will become part of the city's "continuum of care" program.
Ms. Sturdavant takes in all these changes with acquiescence, fear and defiance as she faces the loss of her three-bedroom apartment.
"God said it will come a time and day when the wealthy man will press the poor," she said. "The Government just started a new program saying you got to go out to work. Most of us are not well educated and all. Jobs want you to have degrees. For me, it would be janitorial. We all know that's something I can do."
People have a way of getting by, Ms. Sturdavant said. "The Government can do what it wants. We're still going to make it."

HEADLINE: Charges Against Danish Mother Are Dropped

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
A state judge dismissed charges yesterday against a Danish tourist who was arrested for leaving her baby in a stroller on the sidewalk while she ate inside an East Village restaurant. Charges against the baby's father, who lives in Brooklyn, are still pending.
The charges against the tourist, Annette Sorensen, were dropped at the request of the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, and prosecutors noted that the dismissal was not opposed by the City Administration for Children's Services. Ms. Sorensen, an actress, had been charged with endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor. 
 "No purpose would be served by the prosecution of this case at this time," said David Austen, the assistant district attorney prosecuting the case.
Judge Michael Gross of Criminal Court told Ms. Sorensen, 30, that charges would be dropped and that the record of the charges would be sealed if she remained out of trouble for six months. The judge said that Ms. Sorensen would not have to remain in the United States or return to court at the end of the six months.
On vacation in New York, Ms. Sorensen left the child on the sidewalk while she ate just inside the window with the child's father, Exavier Wardlaw, 49. Mr. Wardlaw was also arrested and charged with endangering the welfare of a child and disorderly conduct.
Yesterday, his lawyer attacked the Manhattan District Attorney's office for failing to dismiss the charges against his client.
"If you have the choice of being a Danish television actress with the support of the Danish Government behind you or of being an unemployed black playwright, the choice is obvious when you are dealing with the city," said Ronald L. Kuby, Mr. Wardlaw's lawyer.
A spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney said that Ms. Sorensen's case had been heard quickly at the request of her defense lawyers. She said that no action has been taken on Mr. Wardlaw's case because it is being handled on a normal schedule.
In a brief press conference on the courthouse steps, Ms. Sorensen, who was reunited with her 14-month-old girl on Wednesday, said she planned to return home with her daughter as soon as possible.
"I am very happy with the result and I will now go home to my daughter," she said. "As soon as possible, I will return to Denmark."
Ms. Sorensen's arrest created a brief international contretemps, stunning many in Denmark, where mothers often leave children outside while they shop and eat. However, the authorities here noted that what was appropriate in Copenhagen, a city of 1.3 million with a low crime rate, was not always so in New York.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani defended the action of officers who arrested Ms. Sorensen after people complained that the child had been left alone on the sidewalk for some time.
In Denmark, Ms. Sorensen is featured in a television show about police officers on a small island. The name of the show, translated from the Danish, is "Cops on Samsoe."

Starts of Housing Rise, But Weakness Is Seen
Housing starts rose 2.6 percent in April, exceeding analysts' expectations of an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent. But most of the gains were in the volatile category of apartment construction; single-family housing starts rose just three-tenths of 1 percent. Moreover, the number of applications for construction permits fell. 
 A separate survey found that consumer confidence remained strong, even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in March. The two reports added to the uncertainty about whether the policy makers will raise rates again on Tuesday. [Page 34.]
 
Bond Prices Fall
The housing report and consumer sentiment survey helped pull down Treasury bond prices. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.90 percent from 6.86 percent. Despite the nervous selloff, dealers, traders and investors remained split over what Fed policy makers would do next week. [34.]
 
2 Utilities Call Off $6 Billion Merger
Two big Midwest utilities, Wisconsin Energy and Northern States Power, canceled plans for a $6 billion merger, citing Federal regulators' refusal to approve the deal. While the regulators did not reject the deal outright, they asked for a new merger plan that would include the sale of some generating plants. The companies said that the regulatory commission's offer of a further review showed that its polcies were unsettled. [34.]

A Step Toward a Balanced Budget
The House Budget Committee took the first legislative step yesterday toward enactment of a balanced budget bill. It voted 31 to 7 to approve a resolution that will serve as a guide for future tax cuts and spending. The Senate Budget Committee is to vote on its resolution on Monday, and Republican leaders said they expect both branches of Congress will give final approval by the end of next week. [9.]
 
Dollar Stems Slide Against Yen
The dollar fell against the yen again, but for the first time in more than a week, the loss was less than 1 yen. Traders were buying dollars, indicating that they believe the dollar may be stabilizing after its nearly two-week slide. In New York, the dollar finished at 115.55 yen, down from 116.10 yen on Thursday. [32.]
ADT in Talks to End Hostile Bid
ADT, the security system company, said it was in talks with Western Resources on a possible end to Western's hostile bid. ADT has already accepted a $5.6 billion friendly offer from Tyco International. [35.]
 
Aetna's President to Resign
Aetna's president, Joseph Sebastianelli, said he was resigning, citing personal reasons. Mr. Sebastianelli, 50, had been on the job a little more than two months. [35.]
 
A Casino Owner's Travails in Peru
A bingo parlor and disco that was opened in Lima, Peru, in 1995 by an American who made his $50 million fortune in the oil business was headed for success. That is until problems cropped up from what the businessman, Bruce Heafitz, above, at his disco, says is an attempt by the Peruvian Government to take over the business. Variations of that case are also appearing in emerging markets in Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.[35.]
 
Coffee Prices Retreat
An increase in United States coffee inventories helped push coffee futures lower. The report of the increased inventories helped ease worries that stockpiles would begin a steep decline that might result in a scarcity of supply and even higher prices. On other commodity markets, corn rose. [32.]
 
Business Gifts to Governors' Group
Some of the nation's biggest corporations have given millions of dollars to the National Governors' Association and an affiliated research arm in the last several years. In return lobbyists for the corporations have gained access to the governors' policy-making apparatus and can rub shoulders with governors and their staffs. [1.]

HEADLINE: CORPORATE GIFTS HELP GAIN ACCESS TO U.S. GOVERNORS

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
In the past several years, a select group of the nation's biggest corporations have given millions of dollars to the National Governors' Association and an affiliated research arm. In return for their tax-deductible contributions, the corporations' lobbyists have gained unusual access to the governors' policy-making apparatus.
They take part in the governors' plenary meetings, attend receptions with governors, get briefings from the group's leaders and staff, are offered private work spaces and meeting areas at its annual gatherings and attend other events to help them "become better acquainted with governors' staffs and to share common interests," an association fact sheet says. 
 They also frequently attend staff meetings that develop many of the governors' policy recommendations, giving them a chance to influence the formulation of state and Federal regulations that can mean billions of dollars to participating companies.
Among them are corporations as diverse as AT&T, Exxon, General Motors, Dow Chemical, Pfizer, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Philip Morris and Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The bipartisan governors' group defends the practice as perfectly legal and aimed only at getting the best advice on important issues. But critics say it gives the corporations a lobbying advantage unavailable to their adversaries on major policy issues.
The corporate "fellows" were actively recruited by the governors' group. Membership was restricted to no more than 100 big companies. Other interest groups, like labor unions and policy advocacy organizations, were not invited.
The results were vividly illustrated at a meeting of the governors' natural resources committee on April 16, when the corporate fellows joined in a daylong discussion on issues including electricity policy, environmental regulation by the Federal Government and pending legislation on the cleanup of toxic waste dumps.
In the afternoon, the committee asked Gregory F. Wetstone, legislative director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmentalist group, to join a panel discussing the Clean Air Act.
Mr. Wetstone, who said he had not been invited to attend the full day's program, said later that he was surprised to find himself facing not just the state environmental officials he had expected but also officials from big corporations that have been lobbying hard against tighter air quality standards proposed by the environmental agency. "It is very troubling that corporations are able to buy a much greater level of access than the public in general or the public-interest community," Mr. Wetstone said in an interview later.
The corporate donations -- about $786,000 in 1996, the association's records show -- support an entity known as the Center for Best Practices. Founded in 1974 as part of the governors' organization, it was renamed last year and is a legally distinct nonprofit corporation, but is still run by a board of four governors. The center also receives financing from philanthropic foundations and from the Federal Government.
Under a program set up in 1988, for an annual payment of up to $12,000, a company can designate one or more "corporate fellows" who work on the center's research into social and economic policies.
As a side benefit, the participants, who are most often senior lobbyists for the corporations, rub shoulders with governors and their staffs in a way that few others can match.
The governors' group describes the program as "an unparalleled opportunity to serve as catalysts to change."
Ann McBride, the president of Common Cause, the public affairs lobby, called the arrangement "just another permutation in the way that access is being purchased in the political process."
"They are so far off base that I can't tell you," responded Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, chairman of the center and former chairman of the governors' association. "We are raising money for a foundation in order to allow the Center for Best Practices, which is currently held hostage by just Federal dollars, to do more things to help the environment, help the economy, help the governors do their job better."
The organization has played an increasingly influential role in shaping Federal policy, especially by urging that Federal social and regulatory programs be delegated to state governments.
Gov. Bob Miller of Nevada, the association's chairman, said the group was beyond being swayed by special interests because it usually operated by consensus among 50 governors.
But the corporate fellows do frequently attend meetings of specialized committees of the association that recommend policies on issues of intense interest to big business, like environmental rules, tax policy and health insurance.
Association officials insisted that every meeting attended by corporate fellows was open to anybody else who wanted to attend. But because the meetings are not publicized, almost nobody but lobbyists ever attends even the open meetings.
While lobbyists for industry trade associations, Federal officials, environmentalists and other interested parties are sometimes invited to present their views at such meetings, few outsiders are involved to the extent that corporate fellows are.
One example of the policy-making sessions where corporate fellows have taken part is an association committee's deliberations over a newly drafted policy about restructuring the electric utility industry, one of the biggest economic issues facing the Federal and state governments.
Among those on the governors' list of corporate fellows are William Lhota, executive vice president of the American Electric Power Company, Steven J. Kean, senior vice president for the Enron Corporation, and Roger Schwarz, director of Federal affairs at the Public Service Electric and Gas Company of New Jersey, all corporations with major financial stakes in restructuring the electric utility industry.
But Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors' organization, said the corporations mostly supported a broader, public interest in issues like job training. "There is very little work that you would argue is business oriented in any sense of the word," he said. "A lot of it is education, early childhood education. There is very little we do that has business implications."
Corporate fellows "do sit in and listen to the discussions, and at times they do in fact give presentations," he said, but their role in policy making is modest.
But the association's fact sheet describing the program to potential participants says that the program gives "a unique opportunity" to present industry's views to governors on specific issues.
"Corporate fellows are often asked to provide private sector input on current and emerging policy issues in panel discussions, meetings and written reports," it says.
"Sure, on the marketing side, we probably have made that pitch," said the director of the center, John B. Thomasian. "It is a lot less than it is cracked up to be."
But Bill Hogan, director of investigative projects at the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan research group that examines political finance issues, said that this kind of participation could be very valuable to a lobbyist. "At the simplest level, you are privy to their thoughts, deliberations, et cetera," he said. "At a higher level, perhaps you can influence them, nip something in the bud, or whatever."

HEADLINE: House Panel, 31-7, Advances the Balanced-Budget Deal

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Using the tax-cutting and spending deal struck by President Clinton and Republican leaders as a blueprint, the House Budget Committee took the first legislative step today toward enactment of a balanced-budget bill.
"We've been struggling with this for a long time," Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Democrat who heads the Budget Committee, said as it voted 31 to 7 to approve a resolution that will guide future action on tax cuts and spending. 
 The Senate Budget Committee is to vote on its resolution on Monday, and Republican leaders said they expected both the House and the Senate would give final approval by the end of next week.
After two weeks of haggling, Republican leaders and the White House announced on Thursday night that they had agreed to a written deal on a five-year budget plan. The final deal, whose broad outline follows the agreement that the political leaders announced earlier this month, includes $115 billion in savings to the Medicare program and an $85 billion package of tax cuts. Among them are a $500-a-child tax credit, broad-based and permanent reductions in the capital gains tax, "significant" reductions in the inheritance tax and an expansion of Individual Retirement Accounts.
Thursday night's deal locked in place what earlier had been only spoken agreements. In the end, the Republicans won guarantees that they would have the controlling say in how the tax cuts would be distributed, the specifics of which will be left to the Ways and Means Committee. And the White House won assurances that it would get roughly $35 billion in tax credits for post-secondary education, as well as protection against cuts in education and social programs it considers most important.
"This agreement includes the most significant increase in education funding in 30 years," Mr. Clinton said. "Even more important, it provides the largest single increase in higher education since the G.I. bill in 1945, more than 50 years ago."
But even as some Republicans and Democrats were toasting one another today in a spirit of bipartisanship, Speaker Newt Gingrich's office was boasting in a private memorandum that Republicans had prevailed over the Administration and Democrats in many important areas.
The memorandum said Republican negotiators had been able to thwart White House efforts to increase welfare spending for legal immigrants who entered the country after August, when the new welfare law took effect. And the memo said Republicans had won language in the final deal that provisions reducing capital gains and estate taxes could include indexing for inflation or losses on sales of residences.
"The agreement substantially scales back the President's insatiable appetite for more Government spending programs," the memorandum continued, listing 40 programs that it said the Administration had failed to protect.
Those programs include several of Mr. Clinton's favorites, including Americorps, the volunteer service organization, and Goals 2000, the President's education improvement program, as well as some perennial Republican targets like the Legal Services Corporation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
The agreement calls for $1.69 trillion in spending for fiscal year 1998, which begins on Oct. 1, with a deficit of $90.4 billion. Although that will probably represent an increase from this year's anticipated deficit of $75 billion, the negotiators said deficits would decline in each of the succeeding years, ending with a surplus of $1.3 billion by 2002.
The agreement was signed off by President Clinton, Speaker Gingrich, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader.
Some Democrats in the House have raised objections in the past over cuts in capital gains taxes, criticizing the idea as a tax break for the wealthy.
Drawing up a budget resolution is the first step in the legislative process toward a budget. The resolution, which does not require the President's signature, sets spending limits and certain other conditions for the committees that will actually write the legislation that will become law.
But before that happens, the full House and Senate must approve their respective resolutions, reconcile any differences and then vote again on identical bills.
Mr. Lott said on Thursday night that he expected that entire process to be completed by the time Congress breaks for the Memorial Day recess starting on May 23.
Most of the budget and its details will still be shaped by the Republican-controlled tax-writing and spending committees. But the deal between the Clinton Administration and the Republican leaders is meant to insure that each side's top priorities will be protected.
Republicans made the tax cuts a priority item. But the only specifics they laid out in the budget deal was that the per-child tax credit should be $500. It will be left largely to the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, led by Representative Bill Archer of Texas, to decide the size of the reductions in capital gains taxes and inheritance taxes and who will receive the benefits.
The White House and Congressional Democrats argued for and won a much more expansive list of priority items, the largest of which was the $35 billion the President wanted for post-secondary education programs, including a tuition tax credit.
In addition, the Administration was able to protect about a dozen domestic spending programs, some of which have been frequent targets of Republicans. All of the protected programs are to receive the spending that Mr. Clinton proposed in his 1998 budget. Among those are Head Start, Job Corps, bilingual and immigrant education and Pell grants for college students, which are to increase by $300, to a maximum award of $3,000.

HEADLINE: MASTER OF RUIN -- A special report.;
An Anatomy Of Autocracy: Mobutu's Era

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire, May 16

 BODY:
In more than three decades at the center of his country's political stage, Mobutu Seso Seke was nothing if not an extraordinary survivor. But his tenacity and resourcefulness finally failed him today as he stealthily left his capital, a defeated man.
Mr. Mobutu has been called one of the world's wealthiest heads of state, a brutal dictator, an inveterate meddler in the affairs of neighbors and a colossal ego. His style, at once bold and vainglorious, was for an entire generation the very model of an African autocrat. 
 Resplendent in his signature leopard-skin cap and carved wooden scepter topped with an eagle, Mr. Mobutu -- through his canny courtship of Western support, destabilization of his neighbors, systematic corruption and grandiose economic schemes -- left Zaire teetering on the brink of economic collapse. His cult of personality rose to such heights that for weeks at a time, Zaire's official press was forbidden to mention the name of any other Zairian than the President himself.
Mr. Mobutu almost singlehandedly invented Zaire, even giving the country its name in replacement of the colonial name, Congo. But his personal appetite for luxury and wealth spawned a system of official corruption so rapacious that he leaves behind a country in ruin, where revenue from lucrative mines has been squandered or squirreled away in foreign bank accounts. Life in a vast country deprived of roads, health care, electricity, telephones and often education has reverted to a brutishness unknown since the 1940's. Still, even many of Mr. Mobutu's harshest critics acknowledge one achievement, and it is a major one in an Africa of artificially drawn states riven by ethnic animosities.
Inheriting a land of more than 450 ethnic groups that had French as an official language but no commonly spoken tongue, Mr. Mobutu managed to forge a sense of nationhood in Africa's third-largest country as strong as exists anywhere on this continent. This was accomplished, in part, by successfully promoting the use of three major African languages -- Lingala, Swahili and Tshiluba -- to draw citizens together across ethnic lines.
At the same time, Zaire experienced a period of extraordinary cultural creativity, in song, in dress and in art. This came about partly as a result of deliberate efforts to favor local influences over foreign ones, and partly because of the need of Zairians to survive by their own means in the absence of a functioning Government.
Throughout a career that began at independence from Belgium, during the height of the cold war, Mr. Mobutu seemed to thrive on crises, buying off enemies when he did not kill them outright, and currying favor with Washington by allowing his country to be used as a base in wars against Soviet influence in central Africa.
But the rebel leader Laurent Kabila's seven-month fight revealed Mr. Mobutu's army to be toothless and his Government an empty shell. In the end, the undoing of a man known as a master calculator resulted from a long series of costly misjudgments of a sick and aging politician well past his prime.

Rising Star
A Helping Hand From the C.I.A.
Mr. Mobutu's ascent began in September 1960, at the dawn of Zaire's independence, when he seized power during quarrels between the pro-Western President Joseph Kasavubu and the nationalist Patrice Lumumba, the country's first Prime Minister. Mr. Mobutu, a journalist and army sergeant, had been picked by Mr. Lumumba as chief of staff and prodded toward the center of the political stage by the Central Intelligence Agency, which had chosen him as its best tool for keeping the nation out of the socialist orbit. Although he has always denied it, many scholars believe that Mr. Mobutu helped organize the 1961 execution of Mr. Lumumba at C.I.A.'s urging.
During the early independence years, the C.I.A. called most of the shots in Zaire. Nonetheless, Mr. Mobutu often frustrated his C.I.A. handlers. In the words of Smith Hempstone, the former American diplomat and journalist, Mr. Mobutu was in the 1960's "one of the weakest strongmen in history, a black Hamlet, plagued by indecision, unwilling to assume power himself."
But when Mr. Mobutu finally seized power outright on Nov. 24, 1965, after American help enabled him to extinguish a series of regional uprisings by followers of Mr. Lumumba, he wasted little time putting his stamp on Zaire.
By Zairian standards, Mr. Mobutu's early years in office were a period of relative calm, even if sporadic troubles continued here and there, notably in the Fizi-Baraka mountain range of South Kivu Province, where a sputtering rebellion led by one Laurent Desire Kabila refused to die.
Beginning with his first speech after seizing power, Mr. Mobutu set a dictatorial tone, telling a large crowd gathered in a Kinshasa stadium that it had taken five years for the politicians to lead the country to ruin.
"This is why on Nov. 24, 1965, the stupid struggle for influence in which political parties were engaged was ended," he said. "For five years, there will be no more political party activity in the country."
Almost immediately, Mr. Mobutu established a brand of unchallenged one-man rule that lasted until 1990.
Mr. Mobutu ordered the creation of a sole, powerful political party, the Popular Revolutionary Movement, making membership obligatory for all Zairians. In the early years, at least, he set out to attract the best and brightest of Zaire's small university community, eagerly soliciting their advice.
With time, however, the effects of flattery and a growing taste for power took over, and the President's style of rule became both insular and absolute. Challengers, both imagined and real, often paid with their lives, like the four former Cabinet ministers whom Mr. Mobutu had publicly hanged before 50,000 spectators six months after he took office.
As an unmistakable Mobutu style began to emerge in the late 1960's and early 1970's, it became clear that the Zairian leader's ambition was to fashion a great African state. Mr. Mobutu began to study other dictatorships, drawing freely from them.
"This man has spoken; he has written, set forth orientation and decrees," Mpinga Kasenda, a former Prime Minister, said in a characteristic speech of the period praising Mr. Mobutu. "The sum total of his actions constitutes Mobutism, just as the sum total of Mao's actions constitutes Maoism."

All-Powerful Leader
From Mobutu To Mobutism
Mobutism quickly became the new national ideology, and since a constitution written expressly to please him provided the President unlimited powers, Mr. Mobutu's words took on the force of law.
By 1970, with mineral revenues growing fast, Mr. Mobutu felt secure enough in his rule to make known his grandiose vision for Zaire. At an extraordinary party congress that year, he announced a bid for national greatness called Goal 80.
The plan consisted of a 10-year program to double copper production, industrialize the country with steel mills and deep-water ports, and undertake a program of huge investments in Kinshasa, Kisangani and around the southern mining capital, Lubumbashi.
The largest project of all was the Inga dam, near Kinshasa, at the time one of the world's largest hydroelectric dams, followed by the 1,110-mile-long Inga-Shaba power grid, spanning dense forest and empty savanna on its route to the copper-producing, independence-minded Shaba Province, which Mr. Mobutu's project aimed to make dependent upon electricity supplied from afar.
When the World Bank refused to finance the project, believing it to be far too costly, the United States Export-Import Bank stepped in, in a gesture of political support for a man considered to be a vital cold-war ally. But within a few years, the heavy debt incurred for the $1 billion project, which has been operating since 1977, became a crippling economic burden.
In 1971, Mr. Mobutu unveiled a new twist on the official ideology with a program known as "authenticity." Zairians were obliged to change their Western names to African ones, drop titles like Mr. and Mrs. in favor of "citizen" and abandon European dress for tunics for men and wraps of printed cloth for women.
Mr. Mobutu sought to set the tone by replacing his given name, Joseph Desire Mobutu, with Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu waza Banga, which has often been translated as "the all-conquering warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake."
Authenticity was followed, in 1973, by "Zairianization," a program that expropriated farms, factories and businesses belonging to foreigners, from Belgians who had remained since the colonial period to the Greek, Jewish and Pakistani traders who had dominated much of the country's small-scale commerce.
As might have been expected, the nationalizations and handing out of businesses to politically selected Zairians were initially popular. It was not long, however, before things began to go badly wrong. With almost no prior experience in the businesses they inherited, many Zairians quickly sought to lure foreigners back to run them in their place. Others simply sold off their goods and failed to re-stock.
Soon Zaire's economy was near collapse. One group of people, however, benefited far more than others, and in lasting ways, from the Africanization program: Mr. Mobutu and a small circle of relatives and friends.
Takeovers under Zairianization were, in fact, but one of Mr. Mobutu's many sources of wealth. The scholars Crawford Young and Thomas Turner quoted 1978 Bank of Zaire estimates that 50 Zairian companies had illegally secreted some $300 million abroad. Eight of the largest of these companies were owned by Mr. Mobutu or his immediate family.
The collapse of the economy under Zairianization did not force Mr. Mobutu to backtrack; instead, he rushed ahead into ever more radical measures that over time helped undo him. Returning home from a state visit to China and North Korea in 1974, Mr. Mobutu announced a 10-point program to eliminate what he called the country's 10 scourges. A food shortage, he said, would be ended by organizing agricultural brigades. Unemployment was to be ended by decree. Every community was ordered to begin building nursery schools, and employers were told to provide free uniforms and supplies for their workers' children.
Marked by his experience of the Communist east, Mr. Mobutu grew ever more grandiose, and his cult of personality ever more intense. President Mobutu began to affect titles like the Helmsman and the Guide, and the news on state television opened with images of Mr. Mobutu descending from the heavens.
While the economy continued to decline, it was not until the collapse of copper prices in the mid-1970's that Mr. Mobutu reluctantly began to change economic course.
But by then, no one would lend to Zaire any longer, foreign aid programs were bring cut back sharply, inflation was galloping and the grand state that he had set out to build entered a long period of decay.
According to histories of this period, Mr. Mobutu, seeing no way out of his country's economic and political crisis, briefly considered abandoning power when he took his family to Switzerland in March 1976.
But he returned home to confront a series of major new crises, the most serious of which were invasions of Shaba Province in March 1977 and May 1978 by remnants of the Katangese rebel force that had sought independence for that region shortly after independence.
The two Shaba invasions, both from Angolan territory, quickly revealed the battlefield ineptitude of the Zairian Army, and in both instances, foreign troops and American transport planes had to be summoned to put down the rebellions.

Regional Meddler
A Finger in Affairs Of His Neighbors
 The tremendous mineral wealth of Shaba, with 80 percent of the world's cobalt reserves and 20 percent of its copper supplies, helped Mr. Mobutu secure international military and financial support. The West, and Washington in particular, also had been using Zaire as a weapons supply and staging area for support of the anti-Communist Unita rebel movement fighting the Marxist Government in Angola.
Mr. Mobutu, acting with strong C.I.A. encouragement, had been assisting rebel movements fighting Angola's Marxist Government. The first involvement was a disastrous C.I.A.-backed effort to seize Angola's oil-producing Cabinda enclave, which began in 1975, the day before Angola achieved independence from Portugal.
Mr. Mobutu's meddling in Angola, at the behest of Washington, set a pattern for the rest of his rule. He constantly kept a finger in the crises of neighboring countries, from Chad and Congo to Uganda and the Sudan. With its borders with nine other countries, Mr. Mobutu marketed his country to Washington and Paris -- obtaining economic aid and political support in exchange -- as a platform for interventions and covert operations throughout central and southern Africa.
With the end of the cold war, Mr. Mobutu's relevance to Washington and most of the West declined sharply. In 1990, as a wave of democratic change swept much of Africa, Mr. Mobutu was forced to allow multiparty politics.
A tumultuous national conference that drew from many parts of Zairian society convened and obliged Mr. Mobutu to accept his most determined political rival, Etienne Tshisekedi, as Prime Minister.
When Mr. Tshisekedi sought to assert his control over state finances, however, Mr. Mobutu removed him from office, setting off a crisis that led to the first of two outbreaks of killings and looting in the capital by Government soldiers.
Popular support for Mr. Tshisekedi was so overwhelming that Mr. Mobutu retreated from the capital, living for a time on his luxurious houseboat on the Congo River, and eventually in his palatial home in the northern town of Gbadolite.
After the swift end of a second stint in office by Mr. Tshisekedi, officials in Washington, Paris and Brussels in 1994 engineered the appointment as Prime Minister of Kengo wa Dondo, a long associate of the President and former Finance Minister. Mr. Kengo was supposed to govern for a year, and his mandate was to organize national elections, rein in galloping inflation and restore the authority of a decaying state.
Despite unstinting Western support, Mr. Kengo's administration was widely seen as a disaster. Civil servants were unpaid for months at a time, no progress was made toward elections and corruption continued as blatantly as ever.
Mr. Mobutu experienced a brief and unexpected return to international relevance with the 1994 civil war and mass killing in neighboring Rwanda. More than a million Rwandan Hutu, many of them participants in the killing of members of the Tutsi minority, fled into Zaire after a Tutsi-led insurgency seized power.
Foreign governments and international aid organizations were obliged to deal with Mr. Mobutu, ending a period of diplomatic isolation. Relations with France, which had been a major backer of the defeated Hutu Government in Rwanda, nearly returned to their historic warmth.
The end for Mr. Mobutu came with surprising speed, after Rwanda's Tutsi-led Government supported an uprising by Zairian Tutsi who had come under attack in eastern Zaire.
In three weeks in October 1996, what had been a Tutsi uprising turned into a full-blown political rebellion against Mr. Mobutu led by Mr. Kabila.
Once Mr. Kabila's newborn Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo seized the major cities of Zaire's far east, African patrons with scores to settle against Mr. Mobutu lined up to help the rebels with money, men and arms.
The anti-Mobutu coalition came to include Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and, with major support provided toward the end of the war, Angola, where Mr. Mobutu had interfered the most in three decades of rule.
When Bill Richardson, the United States delegate to the United Nations and President Clinton's special envoy, visited Zaire early this month to engineer Mr. Mobutu's resignation, the aging, cancer-ridden President asked him why, after years of loyal service and friendship with the West, he had been abandoned.
"I said the mess you are in is not our mess," Mr. Richardson said. "You just didn't govern your own country."

THE CLIFF WALK
 A Memoir of a Job Lost and a Life Found.
 By Don J. Snyder.
 265 pp. Boston:
 Little, Brown & Company. $23.95. 
 At 41, Don Snyder thought he had earned the right to an exceptional life. He'd edited a newspaper and published three books. As an assistant professor of English and creative writing at Colgate University, he threw himself into college teaching, volunteering for extra courses, toiling over student recommendations for weeks and hectoring senior colleagues on their lack of literary passion.
But after three years, his contract was not renewed. Mr. Snyder assumed he could move on and up, as he always had -- to Princeton, perhaps, or another of the Ivies. His wife and children would adjust, eventually. But "when it came to telling Colleen that I had been fired, I could never seem to find the right time, or the right room in our house," he recalls. "There was always her with her lovely pregnant belly and her faith in me, and then there was me with my pink slip."
Ninety-six rejection letters later, Don Snyder's world had shrunk to the back bedroom of a tiny rented house on the coast of Maine. As savings dwindled, he gulped sleeping pills while Colleen kept their young family afloat with heroic economies. After nearly two years of denial and distress, Mr. Snyder jettisoned his many illusions. Hired first as a greenskeeper, then as a construction laborer, house painter and cottage caretaker for the summer rich, he reluctantly embraced the kind of hard work he had evaded all his life.
"The Cliff Walk" is Mr. Snyder's first-person account of life after campus. It blends several genres of memoir: the Orwellian literature of class slide, the lament of the disillusioned academic and the downsizing tale of the midlife executive. Like G. J. Meyer's "Executive Blues" or Jon Katz's corporate-revenge novel "Sign Off," Mr. Snyder's book is a cautionary fable, a scarred survivor's warning to "the class of managerial mercenaries of my generation who moved anywhere for money, who called places home when we had no attachment to the land or the people, but where the opportunity for advancement was high."
Mr. Snyder's middle-class melodrama is strengthened by novelistic pacing and detail. When the author discovers that during his years of false security the work world has mysteriously split into two alien realms -- computer jobs versus mall/prison/hospital jobs -- he starts waking up angry and placing crank calls to former colleagues (asking one, for instance, "how in God's name you ever got through graduate school"). Sitting in the unemployment office, he ostentatiously thumbs a copy of Bellow's "Herzog." He broods on conflicting advice from equally stressed friends: max out your credit cards, buy real estate and declare bankruptcy, grow up.
The book's most memorable scenes record the effects of job loss on family affections and marital trust. While his children count food stamps and keep the thermostat low, their reality-impaired father makes grand gestures: expensive bikes all around, new clothes, binges at McDonald's. His self-pity and their bewilderment are convincingly drawn, as are the glimpses of relatives and friends whose burdens (divorce, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis) often outweigh the narrator's lost-Paradise angst. Many readers would give a lot at this point for an uncensored 20-minute talk with Colleen Snyder. But her husband's domestic portraiture is affectionate and clear; one would recognize her on the street, and the kids too. You wish them well throughout, even as you wish Mr. Snyder would get a grip, especially on his new life.
Unlike thousands of academic exiles before him, he does not try for positions in campus administration, secondary-school teaching, journalism or publishing. He does not become a temp, or scrounge any job he can to feed his family, or even take a computer class during the extra paid year that Colgate gave him. Instead, he lies a lot to insurance companies and collection agencies; brings a mentally ill former student home as a boarder; dramatically tosses his American Lit texts into the town dump; blows a month's food budget on a natty tweed jacket; takes a halfhearted overdose of pills; fantasizes about selling his unborn child; then hands the family savings to a stranger dying of cancer.
"I know that it takes a very weak man to lose his way when he has a beautiful wife and four healthy children living under his roof, no debt, over $3,000 left in the bank, and he's not in a war or facing anything even close to real peril," Mr. Snyder writes dolefully, "but I was so lost. . . . There were too many people, too many talented and driven people waiting at every slot for a way in."
Over the last decade, millions of Americans pushed out of good jobs have largely left in stoic silence. But Mr. Snyder is a natural protester and contrarian. His testament of loss makes grim, instructive reading for upwardly mobile baby boomers, elected officials, academics on both sides of the tenure line and women tied to men whose employment is in jeopardy, or could be.
As a victim of academic oppression, Mr. Snyder is less convincing. He universalizes his experience by casting himself as a stereotypical ambitious yuppie; actually, he was a professional Quixote who transferred late and unsuccessfully to academe. No one put a gun to his head and said, Go teach in college. He reveled in the perks and privileges of professordom, but (like many before him) arrogantly misjudged the realities of faculty work at century's end, especially the pressure to fit in, the absolute need to produce and the desperate competition among the nation's million surplus Ph.D.'s for even the most thankless teaching posts.
Though formerly a journalist, he never asks the classic questions of a reporter in a strange environment: Who runs this place? What do these people really want? Narcotized by comfort and status, seeing only the beauty and not the Darwinian ruthlessness of the campus world, he clung hard and fell hard. In this respect, Mr. Snyder's adventures recall that other popular brand of memoir, the story of addiction and detox. Fortunately, on his journey to another life he took good notes. By book's end, writer and reader have relearned the lessons that both academe and manual labor efficiently teach: (1) Do the work. (2) Think of others. (3) Life is unfair.

Between Worlds
 The Autobiography
 of Leo Lionni.
 Illustrated. 295 pp.
 New York: Alfred A. Knopf.
 $35. 
 Leo Lionni was born in 1910. The story of his career over the 87 years from then to now traces not so much the familiarly described arc as one long and smoothly flowing upward curve. Closer inspection reveals this curve to be a dense and intricate pattern of zigs, zags, loops, spikes, dips and almost no long straight stretches -- the spoor of a Renaissance man of the arts restlessly shuttling between Europe and America, among disciplines from graphic design to architecture to painting to illustration to sculpture to writing, and between one esthetic and artistic salon or movement or cohort and another. He fit into every succeeding era as it unfolded, and into every creative milieu. Through his prolific and varied work he left emphatic evidence from the 1920's onward that "Lionni was here." He's still at it today in his studio in Tuscany, generating -- among other things -- further books in a series of fables for children that have sold in the millions worldwide.
They don't offer training for careers like Leo Lionni's in any college. Indeed, to follow in "Between Worlds" his delightfully meandering, serendipitous, utterly unplanned path to fame and fortune is to be reminded that a life so peripatetic, so varied and so powered by pure chance -- no degrees, no grants, no sinecures -- would stun the average young careerist of today.
Leo Lionni was born in Amsterdam in that now mythical age before World War I, and one of this autobiography's charms is the author's keen atmospheric sense, evoking everyday life and customs in gentler times. The Lionnis were a close-knit clan of modest means, proper Dutch burghers, but shot through with culture. Mr. Lionni's father was an accountant, his mother a modestly accomplished concert singer, and his traveling Uncle Willem not only avidly bought up masterworks of then-provocative and affordable modern art but stockpiled them in the homes of relatives. Young Leo had a Chagall hanging in the hallway just outside his childhood bedroom. His imagination being a tinderbox, combustion occurred early; he was already prowling the galleries of Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum with his drawing pad while his contemporaries in knee pants were out kicking soccer balls around. His parents' restlessness for a better life uprooted Leo early and often. He traded Amsterdam for Brussels, Brussels for Philadelphia, Philadelphia for Genoa, Genoa for Zurich before he moved to Milan and then back to Philadelphia as an unemployed 29-year-old. Along the way, despite often precarious family financial straits, a formal education that was spotty at best and a series of soul-deadening clerical jobs, he managed to pick up four languages and fan a rising passion for art, music, architecture, poetry and radical politics. He was from the outset a modernist, full of the fission of Futurism, and wherever he happened to be he seemed to land among young firebrands being geniuses together on the leading edge, as if they had been saving him a seat. This laid the basis for a lifelong network of friendships and contacts with the great and near great in the arts in Europe and America.
By the mid-30's fascism was making the ground shake underfoot for Europe's Jews, and when Hitler marched into the Sudetenland, Leo Lionni, half Jewish himself, was gone. To Philadelphia, of all places, and to a lowly assistant art director's job in a huge and famously staid advertising agency. He was only warming up. His avant-garde sensibilities almost immediately whisked him out of obscurity and onto the "Great Ideas of Man" campaign for the Container Corporation of America -- probably the most ambitious advertising effort dedicated to the intellectual uplift of the masses -- and he soon found himself dispensing patronage to a who's who of artists, from Man Ray to Willem de Kooning to Piet Mondrian to Saul Steinberg, during the long-running campaign.
These lofty connections segued into others and then others, until he was on a first-name basis with Buckminster Fuller, Alexander Calder, Josef Albers, Louis Kahn, Walter Gropius and even Andy Warhol. He was in high demand as a lecturer, teacher, panel member and idea man (he was deeply involved in organizing the first International Design Conference at Aspen, Colo.). In the late 40's, he left Philadelphia to become art director of Fortune magazine and to swim tirelessly in New York's deep cultural waters. Stirrings of inner restlessness could no longer be suppressed, however, and in the early 60's Leo Lionni finally bolted the 9-to-5 commercial life -- and America -- for a farm in Italy and full concentration on creative fulfillment.
His story is that of a man with an exquisitely fine-tuned creative imagination, a clear mind, perfect taste and mercilessly high standards, besotted by the arts to the exclusion of most of quotidian life, which it was his beloved wife Nora's task to handle. His two sons, one of whom died of cancer in his 40's, appear only in rare cameo. This is the story of Leo Lionni, period. His best friends in America were the advertising man Ed Zern and Robert Osborn, the artist. These key figures remain vague -- for example, though Mr. Lionni reproduces a series of his long letters to Osborn, he reproduces none of Osborn's to him.
A confessional tell-all this isn't. Throughout the story the aristocratic good manners and old-fashioned European self-restraint that keep a tight lid on gushing are evident. If Mr. Lionni doesn't have something good to say about someone, he leaves a kind of icy pause in the narrative and moves on to someone worth praising. This is a wise, mellow, richly populated and satisfying autobiography that reviews his life without pettiness.

The American Century
 The Rise and Decline of
 the United States as a World Power.
 By Donald W. White.
 551 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $35. 
 In the summer of 1960, Life magazine organized a symposium on what it called "the most crucial debate of our generation." The question that Henry Luce, the editor in chief, posed was "What is the national purpose of the U.S.A.?" Is the nation great enough? Is it great in the right way? But most of all, what should it do with its greatness?
This kind of talk had been in the air for some time. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund had commissioned a vast project to "clarify the national purposes and objectives" in 1956. Four years later President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed his Presidential Commission on National Goals. Harvard's eminent historian Oscar Handlin edited a volume on the subject. Even Hans Morgenthau, the theoretician of national power, published a book on "The Purpose of American Politics."
Why does this intellectual atmosphere seem so very different from our own? What made the self-confident superpower of the early 1960's the doubt- ridden and purposeless colossus of today? At some level this is the question Donald W. White asks in his interesting book, "The American Century." The volume is a cultural and intellectual tour of America as a world power, focused mainly on the years after World War II. Mr. White, who teaches history at New York University, looks carefully at the foreign-policy writings of the time, but also at the sociology, literature, movies and even the poetry. While not astounding in its insights, this is a first-rate work, a kind of inner history of the cold war.
Mr. White's answer to the question of what changed the American psyche is essentially that failure, at home and abroad, did. Recognition of problems at home unsettled the happy consensus about American greatness that had formed in the postwar era. By 1962 and 1963, only a few years after Henry Luce's symposium, the Students for a Democratic Society had written the Port Huron Statement and Betty Friedan had published "The Feminine Mystique." From an international perspective, American power declined steadily from the 1960's onward.
There is something incomplete about Mr. White's intelligent answers. Though every society has had dissent and dissenters, compared with most others America has been optimistic and confident for much of its history. And while the United States has declined from the towering heights of the 1950's (when it accounted for over 40 percent of world output), it is still the world's greatest military power, dominates the new international economy and remains the prime example of the political system now sweeping the globe. (With regard to economics, Mr. White's analysis seems curiously dated, as if the book had been written 10 years ago, when Japan and Germany seemed invulnerable and the United States an indebted and unproductive giant.)
So why the ennui? Perhaps our current drift is a product not of failure but rather of success: success in three great projects that began in the 1930's and continued for almost three generations. Having defeated poverty at home (for the most part) and fascism and Communism abroad, we are left with no great national crusades. We stand on the eve of the 21st century all dressed up and with no place to go. Commenting on the mood in the 1950's, the columnist Arthur Krock observed, "The news from the aquarium suggests that what this country really needs is a good 5-cent national porpoise." Adjusting for inflation, that is still true.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Study Abroad On the Rise

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
BESIEGED with exams and spring fever, college students yearn to be out. It is a likely season for the idea of a semester or a year abroad, possibly in Bora Bora, to take root in underclass minds. And colleges support such dreams, as an asset to graduates' employability and to ease pressure on dormitories.
Many colleges develop and staff their own overseas programs, or link up with an overseas university for a joint project. The colleges are likely to channel their undergraduates to programs where they play a role, but many programs provide credits accepted by colleges other than their sponsors or co-sponsors. 
 At Middlebury College in Vermont, for example, so many students take semesters abroad that the freshman class of 550 to 575 students receives a supplement of 100 additional students in February, who occupy space left by those who take the spring semester abroad. According to Phil Benoit, a spokesman, the college's strong reputation in languages and in overseas study helps to propel this trend, but student awareness of the global economy is a rising factor.
In the expiring academic year, 305 Middlebury students participated in 95 programs in 36 countries; this was 55 percent of the junior class (a rise from 51 percent the year before, and 48 percent the year before).
Internships are now greatly prized, and directors of study-abroad programs are increasingly trying to help students secure work overseas, unpaid if need be.
Connie Horak, the director of overseas studies for the University of Southern California, said that the expense of studying abroad was not much different from that in the United States, except for the irresistible extracurricular travel.
Overseas study by American students is on the rise. In the 1994-95 academic year, 84,403 college students from the United States studied for credit in a foreign country, a jump of 10.6 percent from the year before, according to Richard M. Krasno, president of the nonprofit Institute of International Education. The climb has continued steadily since the organization began keeping records in 1985, except for a plateau in 1991-92 in a time of tension over the Gulf war. In addition, high school students join spring and summer exchange programs, and unnumbered thousands of students and others study everything from languages to viticulture without matriculating.
The Institute of International Education shows a 30 percent rise in students going to China, where 1,257 students matriculated in 1994-95, and a rise of 42 percent for Australia, with 3,346. Europe, however, is the destination for two-thirds of United States students studying abroad, although its market share is decreasing. Britain is far and away the leader, with 19,410 students, which represented a 16 percent rise.
Ms. Horak noted an increase in one-semester tours; many students, she said, cannot afford the time for a whole year away. Mr. Krasno said that the increase in one-semester offerings paralleled the increased diversity of all overseas courses: more places, more schools, more subjects. His organization's current "Academic Year Abroad" is indeed formidable; its 670 pages weigh almost four pounds.
 
Finding the Right Program
College students shopping for overseas courses can usually find "Academic Year Abroad" and the other major reference, Peterson's 1997 "Study Abroad," in libraries or college exchange offices.
The Peterson book, with 1,966 pages, lists 1,500 programs, all affiliated with or sponsored by accredited United States or foreign universities. The International Education book lists 2,430 programs, 60 percent of them sponsored by accredited United States colleges; the rest are offered by nonprofit agencies and cultural organizations like museums. Reading the sections for Florence, Italy, is like reading a seed catalogue: Peterson's has 36 offerings; the International Education list totals 54.
Happily, "Academic Year Abroad" reprints the invaluable 1970's essay "How to Read Study-Abroad Literature" by Lily von Klemperer, who died in 1988. Here is an example, leading off with a quote from a typical ad: " 'Write for a Fully Illustrated Brochure.' Even organizers of high-quality programs love to publicize them with attractive photographs of breathtaking scenery, lively cafe scenes, marble columns and Gothic spires. Unless the brochure devotes equal space to academic facilities, one may well question whether there is any provision at all for serious study," she advises.
"Academic Year Abroad," $42.95, plus $5 for shipping and handling, may be ordered from I.I.E. Books, Post Office Box 371, Annapolis Junction, Md. 20701; (800) 445-0443. Peterson's "Study Abroad," $26.95, plus about $7 for shipping and handling, is sold in bookstores or may be ordered by calling (800) 338-3282 or writing Peterson's, Post Office Box 2123, Princeton, N.J. 08543.
 
High School Programs
The resources for high school students are thinner. The Council on International Educational Exchange, the 50-year-old nonprofit parent of Council Travel and Council Charters, has stopped producing its two books, "The High School Student's Guide to Study, Travel and Adventure Abroad" (1995) and "Smart Vacations, the Traveler's Guide to Learning Adventures Abroad" (1993). But if you can find them in a library, they might provide some valid descriptions.
The high school area is particularly difficult because the programs seldom bear the name of a university, a fact that would provide some guidance to a parent. An excellent but narrow resource is the "Advisory List of International Educational Travel and Exchange Programs." The 1997-98 edition is in preparation because programs are not complete until early in the calendar year and must be evaluated by a committee after that. The 1996-97 edition lists 55 organizations that sought evaluation from the nonprofit Council on Standards for International Educational Travel and were approved. The organizations pay a fee of $1,100 to $16,000, depending on the number of students, for the evaluation. The booklet lists organizations that bring foreign students to the United States as well as those that operate programs overseas, with the emphasis on inbound students.
The standards by which programs are judged are given in the book, and this material can help parents looking at organizations that have never sought listing. The guidelines emphasize the parents' need to know who has direct, hands-on control of a program. The booklet costs $10, postage included, from C.S.I.E.T., 3 Loudoun Street, S.E., Leesburg, Va. 20175; (703) 771-2040.
 
Guide for the Nonstudent
Eclectic, even eccentric, and wide-ranging choices are given in the 1997 Transitions Abroad guide, "Alternative Travel Directory." This 400-page book includes adult education courses, teaching opportunities, and volunteer programs; $19.95, plus $4 shipping and handling. It may be ordered from Transitions Abroad, Post Office Box 1300, Amherst, Mass. 01004; (413) 256-3414.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Along the Grand Canyon, and Down to Its Floor

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO

 BODY:
HIGHWAY 89 north of Flagstaff, Ariz., slices straight over the flat, scrub-covered Colorado Plateau. When I drove it, late one Wednesday afternoon in early April, there were snow clouds up ahead. Across the Navajo Reservation to the east, I could see the Echo Cliffs reaching all the way into Utah, and my rear view mirror framed Arizona's crown, 12,655-foot Humphreys Peak in the San Francisco Mountains to the south.
Invigorating sights, all. But somewhere to the northwest lay the region's most remarkable feature: the Grand Canyon. 
 I wished I didn't know it was there, so that I could come upon the great, 277-mile gorge of the Colorado River as the Spanish explorer, Garcia Lopez de Cardenas, did in 1540 -- by surprise. Given all I'd heard and read about America's most vaunted beauty spot, from "Brighty of the Grand Canyon," the children's book by Marguerite Henry about a wild canyon burro, to Wallace Stegner's version of John Wesley Powell's landmark 1869 expedition down the Colorado River in "Beyond the Hundredth Meridian," this was clearly impossible.
Still, I tried to follow Cardenas's path by approaching the Grand Canyon from the east, along Highways 89 and 64, a drive of about 250 miles from Phoenix, as opposed the busier, slightly shorter route to the national park's south entrance near the touristy hamlet of Tusayan. When I reached the scenic turnout on Highway 64 for the gorge of the Little Colorado River, which joins the greater Colorado about 60 miles southwest of Glen Canyon Dam, I decided that if I were Cardenas I'd have looked into the 3,100-foot sheer-walled chasm and turned back, thinking I'd seen all there was to see and missing the Grand Canyon. Colorado River tributaries like the Little Colorado and Bright Angel Creek seem to many almost as impressive as the big river, whose gorge is up to 18 miles across, defining a canyon country rather than a narrow slot.
It was starting to snow, leading me to wonder whether I should have come to the Grand Canyon in early spring at all. The week before I arrived, three feet of snow had fallen on the North Rim (closed until May 15); the South Rim got a foot.
I had never been to the Grand Canyon before and was traveling alone, so I'd resigned myself to the fact that it wouldn't be wise to try anything too adventurous, like backpacking from rim to rim, or to the falls in the Havasupai Indian Reservation. This would be a beginner's trip. I'd stick mostly to the South Rim, where tourist-friendly facilities cluster, including two scenic drives with myriad turnouts, seasonal shuttle bus service, a main visitor center, six lodges, nine restaurants and snack bars, a big grocery store, bank and post office.
If I'd waited until the high, hot summer season, I probably wouldn't have been able to reserve a room in the park; those are booked as much as a year in advance. It seemed important to stay close to the rim; I couldn't see commuting to the canyon from a chain motel outside the park. When I called Amfac, the company that manages the park's lodges, about a month before my visit, I felt lucky to get a historic cabin at Bright Angel Lodge; it had no chasm view but was close to the rim and cost $66 a night.
Apart from camping or a $59 cabin (open seasonally) at Maswick Lodge, about a 10-minute walk from the canyon's edge, the tidy little wood, stone and adobe cottages at Bright Angel Lodge appeared to be the cheapest lodging option in the park. However, the reservations agent didn't mention that Bright Angel also has about 19 equally well-situated rooms with shared baths priced from $38 to $46.
As a lark, I asked about overnight mule trips to Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the canyon, assuming that these would have been booked up, too. But there was space available for a Friday morning (returning about noon the next day), and even the $265 price didn't stop me. I wanted to be among the 1 percent of the millions who visit the Grand Canyon to get to the bottom.
The rate includes the services of a wrangler guide, transportation by mule, lunch, a steak dinner, breakfast, a leather water flask and lodging at Phantom Ranch, set in a cottonwood grove on the banks of Bright Angel Creek, which hatchets through some of the oldest rock in the canyon on its way to the river from the North Rim. Brighty's old stomping ground, and my idea of paradise on earth.
It would have been a lot cheaper to walk down (nine and a half miles on the winding Bright Angel Trail or seven via the steeper South Kaibab) and camp or stay in a hiker's dorm at Phantom Ranch for $22 (though campsites and space in the dorms can be hard to come by). Next trip that's what I plan to do. But this time, I packed my bandanna and boots, and imagined the views I'd get from the back of a big, sure-footed mule.
AT the eastern entrance to the park (admission $20 a car), I told the attendant I'd never seen the Grand Canyon before. He sent me straight to Desert View, a scenic point overlooking the park's eastern precincts. It enjoys a sliver of a view of the Colorado River, mint green when I saw it, curling behind the 70-foot Watchtower, an imitation Anasazi kiva designed in 1932 by Mary Elizabeth Jane Colter. Four other Colter structures (including Bright Angel Lodge), built to resemble Hopi dwellings, Navajo pueblos and mountaineers' cabins, line the South Rim and vie for attention with the natural wonder 4,500 feet below.
The canyon wins, even with clouds dimming the brilliance of its palette and fingering into hard rock valleys between buttes with names like Jupiter Temple and Wotan's Throne.
At every turnoff I tried along the pinon- and juniper-lined East Rim Drive it was the same: light snow, thin crowds and astonishing views. From Lipan Point, I could see how the broad Tonto Platform separates the wide outer gorge from the narrow inner one just above the river. At Grandview, a sign pointed the way down the trail to a mine operated around 1890 by Pete Berry, who found that bringing tourists to the canyon by stagecoach was more profitable than taking copper out.
Since then, tourism in the Grand Canyon has grown, resulting in traffic jams and pollution. To solve the problem, the 78-year-old national park is rebuilding roads around the village, keeps the West Rim Drive closed to private vehicles from mid-April to mid-October and runs a free shuttle service in those months. Other shuttles take visitors around the village or out to Yaki Point, near the popular South Kaibab trailhead, with new routes (plied by electric buses) starting this year. The goal is to ban most cars from the South Rim.
Construction work had made a mess of the village when I was there. Still, I had no trouble driving right past the grand old El Tovar Hotel, built like a Swiss chalet in 1904, around the time that a spur of the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railroad reached the canyon from Williams. The hotel remains the top of the line in the national park ($112 to $168 for doubles, $20 for a steak dinner accompanied by canyon views in the restaurant and $5 for a manhattan at the snug bar), with the modern, motel-like Kachina and Thunderbird Lodges on the rim next door (doubles $102 to $112) running a close second.
Scruffy but endearing Bright Angel Lodge, built in 1935, is just to the west of them: a single-story, wood and stone building with a big fireplace, busy lobby, gift shop, two restaurants, a snack bar, tour desk and an information board bearing forecasts for the following day.
The cabins surround the lodge in a somewhat haphazard way, and look a little poky from the outside. Mine lay rather too close to the main road. But inside it was spacious and quiet, with effective radiators at the base of three walls, a spotless private bath providing plenty of hot water, a hurricane lamp, television, nice double bed covered with a Navajo print spread, and lots of windows. Had one of them opened onto the canyon, the cabin would have been heaven.
I had a filling plate of chicken and beef fajitas in the Bright Angel Restaurant for dinner ($10), and attended the evening ranger program on John Muir, even though I was about to drop. But ranger programs are free; I planned to take in as many as I could during my one full day on the South Rim.
My alarm went off at 6 on Thursday. I jumped into my jeans and ran the 50 steps to the canyon's brink, where the new light was seeking out all the canyon's hidey-holes; joggers pounded by on the Rim Trail, and men with cameras on tripods were talking about f-stops. Then I bought a muffin and a banana (for about $2) at the Fountain snack bar and walked over to the north porch at the El Tovar for coffee with a Navajo ranger named Alice Malatke. She explained how the building of Glen Canyon Dam in 1964 changed the canyon, sweeping away beaches, lowering the river's temperature and attracting non-native plants and animals. But she ended on a decided upbeat, with a Navajo singsong, bidding us to "always travel in beauty."
I attended two more programs led by inspiring, articulate rangers in the course of the day -- a short rim walk and a geology talk at Yavapai Observation Station, during which I learned that almost every day in the summertime someone has to be rescued from trails by helicopter, and that modern science hasn't yet come up with a completely convincing theory to explain the canyon's creation.
My mule trip orientation meeting met at 4 at the rim by Bright Angel Lodge. Our little group was shown how to keep our mules from snitching grass by thrashing them with leather switches, and warned that we could get our money back only if we lost nerve before heading into the canyon. After that we'd be given water flasks and put on the trail to walk back, with our credit cards charged for the full amount.
I wasn't about to wimp out, even though I could barely get my legs around the barrel-chested mule named Connie I was assigned to in Stone Corral the next morning. Marilyn Williams, the tall wrangler from Texas who led my seven-member group, helped me at every turn and was particularly attentive to an elderly lady from Connecticut who'd decided the trip was one of the things she wanted to do before she died.
I'm glad I did it, even though it's tough on the knees, and all along the way down Bright Angel Trail and back up the South Kaibab the next day hikers kept giving us superior looks. They hate the mules, which foul and clog the trails but have been used in the Grand Canyon since the turn of the century.
WE had box lunches, packed with rolls, sausage, cheese, apples and cookies about halfway down at Indian Gardens, where the redbud trees were beginning to flower. Then we squeezed through Tapeats Narrows and ricocheted down the Devil's Corkscrew, reaching the two bridges that span the river near Phantom Ranch in the early afternoon.
Mary Jane Colter designed the four oldest cabins there too, and the Civilian Conservation Corps had a hand in renovations. But I hope no one changes a thing at Phantom Ranch, because when I go back I want it to be exactly the same -- a small cabin enclave with a canteen and dining room, shower house, plenty of benches and river boulders for cogitating, and the swift-flowing creek, named Bright Angel by John Wesley Powell, as a foil to a much muddier stream farther upstream he called the Dirty Devil.
My cabin had a double bed, toilet, sink and windows opening onto fields of blooming beavertail cactuses. In T-shirt weather at canyon bottom, I walked up North Kaibab Trail and put my feet into Bright Angel Creek, returning just in time for a dinner of steak, baked potato and chocolate cake (which cost the hikers who joined us $28 each). Then I watched the setting sun strike the beautiful pink Zoroaster granite along the Colorado River -- wondering where in the world I'd been as happy.
My sleep was as deep as the canyon that night. But before I knew it, there were flapjacks, bacon and scrambled eggs at 6:30, followed by mount-up. Going up is easier on the knees than going down.
On the top, Marilyn shook my hand and gave me a certificate declaring that I'd made it to the bottom of the Grand Canyon by mule. A little hokey, I thought.
I'd rather have her job.
 
The bottom line in the canyon
 
Logistics
I spent about $90 a day on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, not including car rental and mule trip.
To reach the Canyon in early April, I flew from New York to Phoenix on USAirways, (800) 428-4322; because I planned to drive from Phoenix to Los Angeles, my return was from L.A., with the round trip fare coming to $268. I purchased the ticket through Preferred Holidays, (800) 990-1919, as part of a fly-drive See America package.
I rented an economy car at the airport in Phoenix from Value Rent a Car, (800) 327-2501; the weekly rate was $109, with unlimited mileage, but I also got a 5 percent A.A.A. discount.
 
Excursions
For basic tourist information on the canyon, contact Grand Canyon National Park, Post Office Box 129, Grand Canyon, Ariz. 86023; (520) 638-7888. (To save time, the Park Service suggests marking the envelope "Attention: Trip Planner.") Information about backcountry hiking and camping is available from the Backcountry Office, at the same address, (520) 638-7875; fax (520) 638-2125.
Another way to explore the canyon, in depth and economically, is to take a multiday field seminar offered by the Grand Canyon Field Institute, Post Office Box 399, Grand Canyon, Ariz. 86023; (520) 638-2485.
Train travel to the Grand Canyon is available year round on the Grand Canyon Railway, (800) 843-8724, which makes one round trip from Williams, Ariz., daily; coach class tickets cost $60, including the park entrance fee.
Information on hiking, camping and horseback riding in the Havasupai Indian Reservation, on the South Rim west of the park, is available by calling (520) 448-2141 or 448-2121.
 
Lodging
Amfac Parks and Resorts, (303) 297-2757, fax (520) 638-9247, handles reservations for the seven lodges within Grand Canyon National Park, and Moqui Lodge at the south entrance. Bright Angel, El Tovar, Kachina and Thunderbird are on the rim; Maswik and Yavapai are back from it. At Phantom Ranch, in addition to the dormitories, just two of the 11 cabins are set aside for hikers; they cost $59 a night and can be reserved 11 months in advance. Anyone who can get to the bottom of the canyon can eat there, by reservation (breakfast $12, sack lunch $6, hiker's stew dinner $18 and steak dinner $28).
Amfac takes reservations for the mule ride, too. Participants must weigh under 200 pounds, be at least 4 feet, 7 inches tall and speak and understand English.
Inside the park, call the lodging office, (520) 638-2631, to find a room; in the fall, winter and spring it is not uncommon, because of cancellations, to get space at the last minute.

HEADLINE: Special East End Issue;
The Hamptons' Real Estate Market Is Surging

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
THE Hamptons are back.
Their timeless appeal never went out of fashion, of course. But the recession put a crimp in the real estate market even in this gilt-edged enclave. The bottom of that cycle, about 1991, seems like a dim memory to real estate experts now. 
 Today's thriving Hamptons market -- fueled by low interest rates and the marathon bull run on Wall Street -- is at its highest since the frenetic peak of the late 1980's. Parts of the Hamptons have even surpassed the record prices of that era and are setting new benchmarks.
Vacant land is selling so fast that the big worry is how to slow it down -- lest the East End lose the fabled rural look and feel that made it popular. Town, state and Federal programs have set aside millions of dollars to buy open space, but critics fear the funds are too little.
"We're in a race to preserve this place from becoming the same as every other place," said Edwin M. Schwenk. Last year he quit as director of the Long Island Builders Institute to join conservationists in seeking to control growth. Since then, the market's continuing rise has only underscored the issue.
While the Hamptons have long prospered from their proximity to New York City, their cachet has now spread across the nation and overseas, drawing renters and even buyers from afar. Savvy brokers are hiring bilingual agents.
"We have a lot of people coming from London, Italy, France, Germany, South America -- all over," said Peter L. Hallock, president of Allan M. Schneider Associates realty.
Another striking sign of the soaring demand is a new Hamptons trend known as tear-downs. Some buyers are acquiring older, modest houses only to demolish them to make way for their dream country homes.
"People buy these incredibly expensive properties and take down the houses to do what they want to do," said Christopher J. Coy, an architect at Barnes Coy & Associates in Bridgehampton. "Ten years ago you would have seen people working with the house that's there. Now it's almost not a decision to demolish."
At Sotheby's International Realty, Paul C. Brennan, vice president, said: "Sometimes they buy two adjacent lots, knock down both houses and build one new, spreading out for more land and a bigger home." Sotheby's own recent entry into the Hamptons, by taking over the Braverman Newbold agency, is itself an indicator of the market's allure.
In the resale arena, prices of existing homes in parts of the Hamptons have not only reached their prior peaks but now exceed them. High-end properties run into the millions of dollars.
Southampton's Town Supervisor, Vincent J. Cannuscio, said: "We're seeing dramatic escalation in home values and vacant land east of the canal -- and I mean increments upwards of 100 percent since 1992."
The Schneider agency cites a three-bedroom house on 1.2 acres near the ocean in East Hampton. After selling for $1.05 million last year, it is back on the market at $1.7 million, and prospective buyers are said to be making serious inquiries. The property has a spring-fed pond, a newly installed 50-foot pool -- and an appraisal backing up its heady asking price.
New construction is booming so much that building permits in the Hamptons now outnumber those in Brookhaven, the giant suburb to the west. Renovations and additions are also keeping contractors busy.
"Just look at Montauk Highway between 8:30 and 9:30 on a weekday morning," said Stuart A. Epstein, co-owner of Devlin McNiff Real Estate, "and it's literally bumper to bumper with pickups, trucks and vans of guys coming out here to work on renovations, new construction, tear-downs, fix-ups, you name it."
East Hampton's Town Supervisor, Catherine Lester, said: "It seems to be booming on the East End."
Seasonal rentals are also strong, although brokers say the market has softened a bit this spring, perhaps because so many people have been buying and building their own places.
"Rentals were off the wall last year, but people are still raising their prices and getting them," said Frances S. Nill of Cook Pony Farm Real Estate. "We had one client who rented out for $29,000 last summer. This year he put on a tag of $50,000 and got it, almost doubling."
The Hamptons resurgence cuts a sharp contrast to the market for much of the rest of Long Island. There, battered property values are still struggling to recover from the region's devastating loss of jobs at Grumman and other aerospace companies during the recession.
For decades the Hamptons have established themselves as an elite world apart from the conventional suburbs that characterize most of the island.
The natural beauty of the East End's ocean beaches, dunes, bays, harbors, ponds and woods, the picturesque villages and centuries of fishing and farming have all made the South Fork an exclusive retreat and playground for the powerful, talented, rich and famous.
Among the many celebrities who live or summer in the Hamptons are Calvin Klein, Christie Brinkley, Ronald O. Perelman, Alan Alda, Kurt Vonnegut, Tom Hanks, Paul Simon, Cindy Crawford, John F. Kennedy Jr. and Alec Baldwin, to name a few.
"The dynamics of this market is Wall Street, the entertainment business, advertising, the fashion industry, the arts," said Mr. Epstein. Thus the Hamptons market moves in tandem with luxury areas like the Upper East Side of Manhattan, not with the Island's middle-class communities like Valley Stream and Deer Park.
Several demographic, economic, technological and social trends are also converging in the Hamptons.
People who began as occasional summer visitors are staying longer, into the "shoulder seasons." Part-time residents are becoming year-rounders. Renters are becoming owners. Established residents are stepping up to bigger, better places. Recent retirees are settling here permanently. Formerly single boomers now arrive with families in tow, seeking more room.
Telecommuters are spending more time out east and less in the city.
"A literary agent friend of mine moved out here and started out taking the jitney back to the city three days a week, then two, now one," said Mr. Epstein.
Mr. Hallock said: "A lot of people have gone from summer to year-round country homes, or coming out every weekend except maybe in the dead of winter. You have writers and financial people, and as long as you've got your computer, fax and telephone, you're all set."
The national economic recovery has benefited the Hamptons.
"A lot of what fuels this market is Wall Street, and Wall Street has done fabulous," said Pattie A. Romanzi, owner of Par East Mortgage Company in East Hampton. "People are getting big bonuses and commissions and have money to spend. New York is always going to be the financial capital, and this will be the playground.
"This has also become a new home for Hollywood. In the summer a lot of them set up shop and work here, and some stay year-round. Billy Joel has been here for ever and ever, and Steven Spielberg for a long time. We just got a head writer for 'Another World' who just gave up everything in L.A. and moved here. He works by phone and fax and goes to L.A. when he needs to."
Ever since 21 families of English settlers bought Southampton from the Shinnecock Indians 357 years ago -- for 16 thick cloaks and a promise of 60 bushels of corn -- local real estate has proven to be a winning investment, the experts say.
"The Hamptons are like a blue chip stock -- although it may go down, it will always come back," Miss Romanzi said. Her reasoning is simple: "They can never take the ocean away."
An appraiser, Peter N. Davidson of East Hampton, said: "The East End is always going to remain strong, the last market to lose value in a recession and the first market to gain value coming out of a recession. As the so-called megalopolis has developed from Washington to Boston, this has to remain a prime vacation destination."
But the Hamptons are not a monolithic community, and not all parts are sharing equally in the boom.
"I live in the poor Hamptons -- Hampton Bays," Supervisor Cannuscio said. "We have not seen the big price escalation there and in East Quogue and Westhampton as elsewhere, but more in line with general inflation."
The Hamptons offer an enormous variety of housing, from modest prefabricated homes in out-of-the-way corners to magnificent country estates and oceanfront mansions.
"We're selling everything from $150,000 houses to $15 million properties," said Mr. Hallock of the Schneider agency.
The Cook agency recently sold a four-bedroom bayfront house for $375,000 -- up from its previous sale price of $270,000 just two years before. Cook also was the broker for a stone castle in Southampton, complete with a moat and suits of armor, that went for a king's ransom of $1.45 million.
"The term 'the Hamptons' is a beef for a lot of us," said Mr. Brennan of Sotheby's. "Every Hampton has its own flavor and ambiance." Miss Romanzi said: "When people hear 'the Hamptons,' they invariably think of the rich, but there are a lot of regular people, too."
At the top of the Hamptons pecking order, brokers agree, is East Hampton, with Southampton not far behind. As usual, the high end is doing the best.
"There is what I call the astronomical market, in the $900,000 to $10 million range, like Lily Pond Lane and Further Lane, where you have celebrities like Lee Radziwill, Jerry Della Femina and Martha Stewart," said Michael G. Pavlakos, owner of East Coast Appraisal Services. "It's not uncommon to see a $10 million listing there go for $10 million. That market is rated excellent."
Although some traditional price boundaries still hold -- property east of Shinnecock Canal, for example, fetches bigger price tags than parcels to the west -- others are blurring. While homes south of Montauk Highway have always sold for a premium, now expensive new homes are being built across the road as well.
"I'm amazed that north of the highway there are pockets of homes selling between $700,000 and $1 million," said Miss Romanzi, the mortgage broker.
Another 1990's wrinkle has been the advent of the Atlantic Golf Club in Bridgehampton, pushing up home prices on lots bordering its course.
"Spec builders are back," Mr. Hallock said, referring to speculative developers. "Back in the 80's they would build three or four at a time, competing with themselves. Now it's mostly one at a time, and it's usually sold by the time the foundation gets poured."
Although the current market is robust, brokers agree that volume has not reached the frenzied extreme of the late 1980's, when people bought properties without even seeing them, bid more than the asking price and flipped properties for resale profits without ever occupying them -- all symptoms of a market bubble threatening to burst.
Much of today's market comes from Hamptonites themselves as repeat buyers.
"I've done business with some people who have bought and sold four times in six years," Miss Romanzi said. "They're smart people who always buy right. Typically, they're moving up in size and location or changing architectural styles."
Brokers say that buyers' tastes have shifted from modern designs back to traditional cedar shingle or wooden clapboard styles -- and to a synthesis that some call post-modern. "It's got the traditional exterior but a modern inside with wide open spaces and cathedral ceilings," said Ms. Nill of Cook Pony Farm Real Estate.
One verity has endured through all fads. "There's a tremendous clamor for anything on, or near, or within sight of water -- be it ocean, bay, harbor or pond," Mr. Epstein said. "There's a lot of it here, but they're not making any more of it, so the value is increasing tremendously."
Growth has fostered a flourishing cultural and social life, which has only added to the Hamptons' charm and spurred commercial real estate with art galleries, antique shops, boutiques, chic restaurants and nightclubs of the moment.
"The Hamptons are more exciting," Mr. Epstein said, ticking off such items as the film festival, a new musical festival and a major improvement in restaurants. "The library has a $3 million addition," he added, "Guild Hall is thriving, the vineyards, and there's an equestrian thing happening with polo."
Supervisor Cannuscio added: "We see a tremendous number of summer events using the mantle of charitable causes."
Strict town and village zoning requirements for large lots are credited with keeping standards -- and property values -- high. Mr. Epstein said: "The Hamptons retains its beauty -- you don't feel you're living in a suburb or subdivision."
Yet growth has brought problems like traffic congestion and a scarcity of parking.
And the old ways continue to disappear. "Where I used to look out at potato fields, now you look out at homes," said Dennis F. Deuel, owner of Do-Well Construction in Southampton. "The open space is less and less each year, but the quality of life is still good."
Mr. Epstein views the changes as positive. "If you're an old-time Bonacker who made a living fishing or farming, you might not see it the same way," he said, using the traditional word for a South Fork native. "But that's what happens with the march of time. This is no longer a farming and fishing community, but we're trying to preserve remnants of both."

Stabilized Rent Rise Still Rising
 
Q. I am a rent-stabilized tenant in Manhattan. My current lease was due for renewal on Oct. 1, 1996. Last summer, before the renewal date, my landlord offered me a new two-year lease with a 4 percent increase. I signed and returned the lease on June 5, 1996, and it was signed and returned to me by the landlord on June 21, 1996. On June 24, 1996, the Rent Guidelines Board voted to allow a 7 percent increase for two-year lease renewals beginning Oct. 1, 1996. In February, the landlord suddenly demanded the 7 percent increase. I claim that the fully executed lease at 4 percent was a binding contract. Who is right? . . . Joseph Roberts, Manhattan.
A. Gary H. Schatsky, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that all lease-renewal forms for rent-stabilized tenants have a box that can be checked if the applicable guideline increase is unknown at the time the lease is executed. When that box is checked, Mr. Schatsky said, any rent increase in the lease is subject to adjustment when the new increase is ordered. 
 Assuming that the form was filled out properly, he said, the tenant would have been on notice that the increase would be adjusted when the new rates were set. In such a case, Mr. Schatsky said, the landlord could have notified the tenant of the new increase prior to the lease commencement date and adjusted the rent accordingly.
In the case described, however, it appears that the landlord did not notify the tenant of the increase for seven months, and, in fact, accepted the 4 percent increase for four months before requesting a change. Under those circumstances, Mr. Schatsky said, the tenant can argue that the landlord has waived his or her right to an adjustment. If the landlord continues to demand the increase, he said, the tenant can file a lease violation complaint with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal or he can continue paying the lower rent and assert the landlord's waiver as a defense to any legal action filed by the landlord.
 
Condo Renter Calls Elevator Fee Unfair
 
Q. I am a rent-stabilized tenant in a condominium and the board of managers is now imposing a $100 fee plus a $500 security deposit on residents who wish to use the building's elevators for delivery or removal of bulky items like furniture. I have been using the elevators for the last 20 years for free and there is nothing in my lease that permits the imposition of a fee. Is the board of managers exceeding its authority? If so, what recourse do I have if building employees physically prevent the delivery of furniture because of failure to pay the fee and security deposit? . . . Melvin Schechter, Manhattan.
A. "The board of managers can impose reasonable fees upon members of the condominium association," said Paul Gulielmetti, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in real estate. "But the real question is: Can they pass those fees on to a rent-stabilized tenant? I think the answer to that is no."
The letter-writer, Mr. Gulielmetti said, is someone's tenant. As such, he said, the tenant is entitled to a continuation of the services he has enjoyed for the past 20 years. And while the board of managers may impose reasonable fees upon condominium owners, he said, they cannot change the terms of the letter-writer's tenancy. If fees are required, Mr. Gulielmetti said, they are most likely the responsibility of the owner of the apartment.
The tenant, he said, should advise the owner, in writing, that he will not be responsible for payment of any fees or deposits required by the board of managers. If building employees interfere with a furniture delivery, Mr. Gulielmetti said, the tenant can then either withhold his rent or file a complaint with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal demanding a reduction of rent based upon decreased services.

HEADLINE: Special East End Issue;
'Titanic' Adds Another Feather to His Cap

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
NEVER let it be said that Peter Stone shies away from the big subjects. In a Broadway season packed with new musicals, "Titanic," for which Mr. Stone wrote the book, dwarfs the competition in bulk, weight, height and cost. The big gets the big treatment onstage, with 43 named parts, a budget of $10 million and an attention to historical detail that betrays Mr. Stone's hand.
"I'm a political person, although I don't mean that in the Washington, D.C., sense," said Mr. Stone, sitting in the Lunt-Fontanne Theater several hours before the play opened, oblivious to the banging hammers and whirring drills onstage. "I'm interested in the dissemination of information." 
 No question, theatergoers get a thorough history lesson along with the drama in "Titanic," a show that spends as much time on the Edwardian class structure, the development of the wireless, and the economics of trans-Atlantic shipping as it does on the scramble for the lifeboats.
"This was the first failure of the Industrial Revolution," said the erudite Mr. Stone, who also has a reputation as a wit. "It didn't work because man forgot that there will always be icebergs. People like that, the sense of nature as a force that humbles man and puts him in a proper perspective."
With the opening-night reviews looming, Mr. Stone had every right to be in a lather, but with 13 Broadway shows under his belt, he has achieved the slightly world-weary manner of someone who knows that the creators of a musical cannot control its fate. From here on in, what happens, happens.
For Mr. Stone, what happens has tended to be good, which is why, for the last 26 years, he has lived a reasonable approximation of the good life in a house in Amagansett surrounded by 20 acres of woods.
Mr. Stone, who has written dozens of musicals, films and television movies, is best known for "1776," a musical that allowed him to indulge his passion for history and make a dollar or two in the process. The play won three Tony Awards, including best musical, and ran for 1,217 performances. "I did it because I realized I didn't know anything about the American Revolution, which was strange, because I was a good history student," Mr. Stone said. "I knew about Franklin, this foxy old guy with the kite, but Hancock, no. He was just a large signature on an insurance policy."
Not everyone would look at the writing of the Declaration of Independence and see singing and dancing, but Mr. Stone liked the idea of displaying what he calls "a kind of impudent affection"' for the old boys who drafted the thing. "I wanted to de-cardboardize them," he said.
More recently, he pressed Will Rogers into service, weaving the life story of the humorist into a naughty Ziegfeld revue in "The Will Rogers Follies," a show that bagged six Tonys. In between, he picked up a Tony for his book for "Woman of the Year"' in 1983. Broadway can be a cruel taskmaster, but Mr. Stone has skated down the street without hitting too many potholes.
Destiny intended him for a different career. His father, a history teacher, moved his family to Los Angeles in the 1920's and, after working as a script reader, became a producer and a screenwriter at Fox studios, where he turned out Tom Mix pictures. The script, it would seem, was written, but Mr. Stone took a wayward path. In the world capital of the movies, he discovered the theater.
After studying at Bard College and the Yale School of Drama, Mr. Stone headed for Paris, where he spent 13 years working for CBS radio and television. It was a nice life, hanging out with Art Buchwald, working with "Murrow's Boys," the journalistic heirs of the Edward R. Murrow era. When Mr. Stone was not busy writing and reading straight news stories for radio, he did television features on subjects like the Arc de Triomphe horse race, the Cannes Film Festival or Princess Grace's wedding. In other words, he fearlessy took on the really tough assignments.
"I was getting a sentimental education and letting Hollywood rub off me," he said. His first venture into the commercial theater was odd. His agent, as it happened, represented the venerable actor Alfred Drake, whom he envisioned in the lead role of a musical version of "Kean," Jean-Paul Sartre's play about the 19th-century Shakespearean actor Edmund Kean. The agent figured that Mr. Stone, who knew French, could handle the assignment of writing the musical's book. He could, he did, and the play opened at the Broadway Theater in November 1961. It achieved, as the French say, a succes d'estime. Translated, that means "nice reviews, no box-office coin."
Mr. Stone was hooked. He had the good fortune to strike up an acquaintance with Frank Loesser, the creator of "Guys and Dolls" and "Most Happy Fella."
"He gave me a crash course in musicals," Mr. Stone said. "He knew everything, and he was articulate and precise."
Mr. Stone went on a tear. He picked up an Emmy in 1962 for an episode he wrote for the television drama "The Defenders." Drawing on his Parisian experience, he wrote a mystery called "Charade," which became a film starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Mr. Stone's screenplay for the film led to a five-picture deal with Universal. His follow-up film, "Father Goose" (yes, Cary Grant again), earned Mr. Stone and his fellow screenwriter Frank Tarkoff an Oscar for best screenplay.
Mr. Stone stumbled with "Skyscraper," a musical about a plucky reporter who tries to stop predatory developers. The musical's main contribution was to throw Julie Harris and Charles Nelson Reilly together. The result was marriage, and Mr. Reilly is now directing Ms. Harris in "The Gin Game" on Broadway, so something came of the effort. "A terrific idea, but it never gelled," said Mr. Stone of "Skyscraper." On Broadway, no one has ever admitted to a bad idea.
But then came "1776," and a Tony Award for Mr. Stone, who rolled right along, writing "My One and Only," "Two by Two," "Sugar," "Woman of the Year," "Will Rogers Follies," and a half dozen other musicals. With "Titanic," he joins forces again with the composer and lyricist Maury Yeston, who worked with him, behind the scenes, to patch up "Grand Hotel" a few years back.
In "The Season," his classic study of Broadway, William Goldman described the plight of the musical book writer in piteous terms. People come to musicals to hear the music and watch the production numbers, he argued, while the hapless book writer simply sets up the transitions into the singing and dancing. Mr. Stone thinks otherwise.
"People don't know what a book is," he said. "They think it's the jokes. Well, everybody knows the actors make those up as they go along. A book is a concept and a structure, and dialogue is the smallest part." The Law of Stone is simple: no book, no musical. "You can have the best score in the world, but if the book is weak, it won't work. On the other hand, if the book is good, it can carry a mediocre score."
Misconceptions about the role of the book annoy Mr. Stone. So does the term "Hamptons."
"Anyone who calls it the Hamptons doesn't live there," he said. Mr. Stone and his wife began spending time on the East End of Long Island a little more than 30 years ago, when they rented a summer house in East Hampton that once stood on the grounds of Steven Spielberg's estate. They have been year-rounders since buying their Amagansett house and tend to socialize with old pals like Sidney Lumet, Nora Ephron, Alan Pakula, Ben Bradlee, Avery Corman or John Leo. During high season, he hunkers down, pulls up the drawbridge, and, buffered by his woods, tunes out the honking horns and Type-A behavior that signal the migratory influx from Manhattan.
At the moment, "Titanic," which opened to mixed reviews, awaits the benediction that a fistful of Tony awards can confer. Six new musicals are fighting it out, and Mr. Stone's big baby could use a lift. In the meantime, the pot continues to bubble. The Roundabout Theater is presenting a revival of "1776" this summer, and Mr. Stone has two projects on the drawing board. The first is "Curtains," a collaboration with John Kander and Fred Ebb that has been marinating for a long time. The second is "Love Me, Love My Dog," a show with music by Jimmy Webb. "It's relatively modest," Mr. Stone said. "But then, any show would be after this."

When the Performance Is a Prize

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHERMAN 

 BODY:
THE concert season is winding down but several musical enticements remain. Today at 3 the Connecticut Valley Chamber Orchestra concludes its year at Trinity Episcopal Church, Hartford, with the group's music director, Tibor Pusztai, leading the all-volunteer ensemble in Ralph Vaughan Williams's "Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis" and Schumann's "Spring" Symphony. Also featured are two soloists: the orchestra's principal clarinetist (and teacher in the Torrington Schools), Gwendolyn Winkel, playing the Nielsen Concerto, and Erin Keefe, a junior at Williston-Northhampton School and winner of Hartford Symphony's Young Artists Competition, who collects her performance prize with Saint-Saens's Violin Concerto No. 3.
The recent explosion of interest in medieval music has spawned many new groups and hundreds of recordings, but few ensembles have caused a greater stir than the women known as Anonymous 4. Their a cappella vocal blend has given ancient music a fresh intensity, and their compact disks (half a dozen of them so far) have been longtime residents on Billboard's classical best-seller charts. 
 Anonymous 4 (Ruth Cunningham, Marsha Genensky, Susan Hellauer and Johanna Maria Rose) will be in South Church, New Britain, today at 4; the program celebrates "Vespers of 1210," which the ensemble describes as "a solemn vespers service for the Feast of Mary's Assumption, from the golden age of medieval music at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in France."
At 3 o'clock this afternoon a free program at the Rye High School in Westchester County features the United States Military Academy Band under the direction of Lieut. Col. David Deitrick. Among attractions of the 3 o'clock concert are performances of Ronald Lo Presti's remembrance of J.F.K., "Elegy for a Young American;" David Amram's "Rondo alla Turca," with the composer playing the wood flute solo; show tunes sung by Sgt. Mary Kay Messinger, and a lively demonstration of close-order musical drill by West Point's Hellcats Fife and Bugle Corps.
Then at 4 this afternoon, a free open house at Caramoor offers previews of the summer festival. Among those expected to attend are the singer Barbara Cook, the pianists Misha Dichter and Stella Simakova, the violinist-conductor Peter Oundjian and the conductor Will Crutchfield. More information, including driving directions, can be obtained by calling (914) 232-5035 or (914) 232-1252.
And also in Westchester County this afternoon is a 5 o'clock recital by the pianist Earl Buys at Wainwright House (260 Stuyvesant Avenue); Mr. Buys's program includes Shostakovich's Prelude and Fugue in C Major as well as sonatas by Chopin and Beethoven.
The Hartt School of Music in West Hartford held its commencement concert last night, but the school's community division still has a few more events scheduled. On Friday evening at 7:30, William Willett presides over the Greater Hartford New Horizons Band, an ensemble of older musicians performing marches and concert pieces in Millard Auditorium.
The following week, string honors winners offer 7 P.M. recitals at Millard on May 27, 28 and 29. Two more concerts, in Berkman Auditorium on May 30 and 31, also at 7, will be performed by woodwind, brass and percussion honorees. All the events are open to the public without charge; more information can be obtained by calling (860) 768-4451.
Also ready to call it a season are the Armstrong Chamber Concerts. The oboist Gerard Reuter, the violist Louise Schulman, the cellist Michael Mermagen and the pianist Jonathan Feldman join the violinist and artistic director Helen Armstrong in quartets by Mozart and Dvorak as well as Charles Martin Loeffler's "Two Rhapsodies." The ensemble will play in a private home in the Greenwich area on Friday night at 7; a public performance takes place in First Congregational Church on the Green, Washington, next Sunday afternoon at 3. (860) 868-0522.
They called Bill Monroe "the father of bluegrass," and several of his former band members -- the banjo master Bill Keith, Clarence (Tater) Tate at the fiddle and Ernie Sykes Jr. on string bass -- are getting together for a tribute. The 8 P.M. Saturday concert at the Quick Center for the Arts, Fairfield University, will be preceded by a free jam from 5 until about 7:30, with outdoor picnic sites available. Normally, audiences are lectured about taping professional performances but in this case audience members are invited to tape the segment called "I Remember Bill." (203) 254-4010.
The group also gets together at 8:30 P.M. next Sunday at the Emelin Theater in Mamaroneck. A 5 o'clock screening of "High Lonesome" and a barbecue at 7 are part of this get-together. The Emelin's box office number is (914) 698-0098.
Falls Village is alive with the sounds of folk, as the New York Pinewoods Club arrives in Connecticut for its annual Spring Folk Music Weekend, from Friday through May 26. Bob Malenky, Bill Amatneek, Roy Harris and Michael O'Leary Johns are among the guest performers at all sorts of workshops, concerts, dances, group sings and more; the cost (averaging a little under $200 for a three-day weekend, $250 for all four days) includes kosher meals; the number to call for more details is (718) 575-1906.

HEADLINE: WESTCHESTER BRIEFS

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:

Student Killer
Judge Peter M. Leavitt of Westchester County Court has revoked a controversial sentence he imposed for a fatal stabbing inside Mount Vernon High School and instead ordered the killer, Hopeton Minott, 20, to state prison for three to nine years. 
 On Oct. 16, 1995, a Westchester County jury convicted Mr. Minott of first-degree manslaughter in the 1994 stabbing death of a fellow student, Shebuel Jackson, 17.
Judge Leavitt originally sentenced Mr. Minott to five years' probation as a youthful offender.
But last week, the judge vacated the earlier sentence after finding that the defendant had obtained it by making untrue statements to the court about his participation in a separate crime, a Brooklyn holdup, which occurred two months after the killing.
Mr. Minott, who was indicted for the gunpoint robbery of a Brooklyn restaurant, said he was not guilty and claimed that it was a person wearing his coat who committed the robbery.
Later, Mr. Minott accepted a bargain in that case and pleaded to a reduced weapons-possession charge. He is serving a sentence in that case of one and a half to three years.
Judge Leavitt was criticized by Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro and others for his lenient treatment of Mr. Minott in the killing.
 
Welfare Developments
Westchester's Medicaid Managed Care program for welfare recipients, the first of its kind in New York, has been chosen as a model for other counties in the state. Also, another Westchester initiative, a pilot proposal to identify and treat Home Relief recipients suffering from drug or alcohol addiction, has won state approval.
The State Health Department is asking Westchester to help it introduce the Medicaid Managed Care Program in 31 counties.
"As the first in the state to introduce a managed-care system on a countywide basis, Westchester is leading the way for other counties throughout New York," said County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke.
He estimated that the county's program saved Westchester taxpayers more than $12 million last year. Managed care for welfare recipients was first put into place last year, using a competitive bidding process to select managed-care plans. Currently, five managed-care plans are serving 29,000 Westchester welfare recipients.
Under the program, health care providers guarantee a rate ceiling, unlike Medicaid, which is based on a fee-for-service system.
The other project -- a joint effort of the county's Departments of Social Services and Community Mental Health -- will assess all Home Relief applicants and recipients and enroll those with drug or alcohol problems in the Coordinated Care Program.
It is estimated that drug-addicted welfare recipients cost taxpayers $18 million a year.
"We know that 10 percent of the Home Relief population is using 77 percent of our Medicaid dollar resources," said Mary E. Glass, the Social Services Commissioner.
The program has been approved as a demonstration project by the State Department of Health.
 
Bartender Law Sought
County Legislator Paul J. Noto has sponsored a resolution calling on the state to raise the minimum age for bartenders to 21 from 18.
Mr. Noto said he was prompted by the recent death of a 21-year-old Fordham University student from Port Chester, which is in his district. Mr. McNeil disappeared in March after leaving a bar on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The student, a junior who was studying accounting, was later found drowned, but no foul play was suspected.
"The tragic loss of young Patrick McNeil Jr., who was allegedly served alcohol by an 18-year-old bartender in Manhattan, has highlighted a long-existing problem of bars not enforcing drinking laws," Mr. Noto said. "It is no surprise that many bartenders under the age of 21 are having difficulty saying no to their peers who come into a bar looking to be served. The law as it exists today doesn't make sense, and it just doesn't work."
Mr. Noto called it a loophole in the law to allow someone too young to drink to serve liquor. The resolution will need at least 9 votes in the Board of Legislators before going to Gov. George E. Pataki.
"To the extent that some good can come of a tragedy, I think this is a step in the right direction," Mr. Noto said.
 
Running for Governor
Myron R. Schoenfeld, the Scarsdale cardiologist who ran for President in 1995, has announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for Governor.
The 68-year-old doctor said his platform, based on idealism and pragmatism, includes a plan to use landfill to build islands in the Atlantic Ocean for airports, garbage incinerators, prisons, casinos and high-rise apartments.
Dr. Schoenfeld said he dropped out of the Presidential race at the end of November 1995 because he ran out of money.
He is optimistic about this race, however, and said last week that he thought he stood a 60 to 75 percent chance of winning, "because people are dissatisfied."
To get on a statewide primary ballot, he would need 15,000 signatures on nominating petitions. He said he expected to do that and to raise $10 million to $20 million for the campaign.
"This is atrociously expensive, but I think it's doable," he said.
He said he decided to become a candidate one morning in 1991 when he was reading the newspaper and expressed frustration over the way the country was being run.
His platform includes decentralization of state government and private corporations, diversification of the economy, improvement of the quality of life in rural areas and aid to small, independent farmers, among other things.
 
'Bear Club Med'
The 195-pound black bear that had 25 police officers, a handful of State Department of Environmental Protection biologists and newspaper reporters in hot pursuit on May 7 is now reportedly lolling in the Catskills, happy to be free of the cares of civilization, secondhand pizza grabbed surreptitiously behind restaurants and immobilizing dart guns.
Dick Henry, a big-game biologist for the state, said the bear, finally caught on the 16th hole of Ridgeway Golf Course in White Plains, was released last Saturday in a 500,000-acre area that his captors described as "Bear Club Med." It is a heavily forested area upstate that is home to 600 other bears -- many of them unattached females looking for a furry Prince Charming, Mr. Henry said.
The pudgy bear is believed to be not more than 18 months old, even though he is larger than most his age. It was suspected that his mother, probably a resident of the Berkshires, tossed him out because she was getting ready to start another family.
Still small by bear standards, Westchester's wandering bear may be having temporary trouble attracting a member of the opposite sex because older, larger bears get the best females, Mr. Henry said.
The bear had wandered for a week through Mount Pleasant, Greenburgh and north Yonkers without success in his mating mission before being caught.
Mr. Henry had hoped to chase him up a tree and then immobilize him, but the bear refused, probably because a mostly healed wound on his side was still sore and made climbing painful. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: For Junior Achievers, Volunteers Are Key

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
ALL the emphasis recently focused on the importance of volunteers comes as no surprise to Junior Achievement, the organization that has been relying on volunteers for 78 years. Since Junior Achievement's founding in 1919, its partnerships with volunteers in the business community have been a major strength.
"We're the largest and oldest economic education organization in the world that gives young people practical knowledge and experience in the competitive private enterprise system," said Angela D. Giustino, president of Junior Achievement of the Hudson Valley in Elmsford, which serves Westchester. 
 "Through the volunteer efforts of more than 700 teachers and business people, we have 9,000 students involved in our school-to-work programs, teaching them how business works," Ms. Giustino said. "But we need more volunteers. Schools all over the the county are waiting. We're looking for energetic people, willing to give an hour a week as a consultant to a Junior Achievement class at one of our local schools."
Maureen Walker, controller for the city of Mount Vernon, has been a classroom volunteer for Junior Achievement for four years.
"I don't have the time, but I make time because teaching my three classes every week is the most rewarding thing I do," said Ms. Walker, who besides her demanding job runs a household that includes three children. "I feel my work in the program impacts on students' futures in a very positive way. For instance, my 15- and 16-year-olds need to know how adults handle money. I show them the importance of budgeting, how to divide a salary so that something is left for emergencies. Most of my students aren't familiar with checks or checking accounts. But by the end of the program they know how to balance one."
Ms. Walker, who is also a member of the Junior Achievement board, said her personal goal is to make sure every school in Mount Vernon has a Junior Achievement program. "That means we have to find 25 new volunteers," she said. "The students love the program, and volunteers soon realize that they are the people who can inspire them to develop positive attitudes toward work."
According to an independent study made by Formative Evaluation Research Associates of Salt Lake City, economics students in Junior Achievement scored significantly higher than did students in traditional high school economics classes.
"The Junior Achievement component is an extremely important addition to my teaching," said Jeffrey Roberts who teaches a mandatory economics and government course for 12th graders at Gorton High School in Yonkers. "The consultants bring real experiences to the classroom and make economics come alive."
Every Tuesday Oscar Melendes, an International Business Machines executive who works with I.B.M. global customers on price bids, teaches students in Mr. Roberts's economics class about business practices.
"It's a hands-on class," Mr. Roberts observed. "With the help of Mr. Melendes, the students formed Senior Inc. -- an honest-to-goodness company -- elected officials, chose a product, Senior T-shirts, and then sold stock."
Each of the 27 students bought three shares of stock at $2 a share. The president's salary was set at $5. Other officials were paid $4, and it was decided that the sales staff would receive a 10 percent commission.
"The T-shirts, designed by the students, feature our mascot, a wolf, on the front and Gorton High School '97 on the back, with every graduating student's name woven into the '97' ", Mr. Roberts said. "They mounted a good marketing campaign and the T-shirts appear to be a good product choice. Sales are brisk. The company will be dissolved at the end of the school year with the profits to be divided among the student shareholders."
Such a firsthand business experience, Mr. Melendes said, gives students an understanding of the free enterprise system and prepares them for the work force.
"This is my first semester as a volunteer, and I am committed to the Junior Achievement concept," Mr. Melendes said. "I see how the program fosters positive attitudes toward work. For me, it has also been personally rewarding. My public-speaking skills have been much improved."
In addition to working as a consultant to the Senior Inc. company, Mr. Melendes has introduced his students to the mysteries of the stock market.
"I have turned the Dow Jones Industrial Average into an assignment, an exercise in buying and selling stocks," he said. "Students pick three stocks in different industries and track them for a couple of weeks. They then write a page on each stock, commenting on its performance, why they selected it, and so on."
The time commitment to the program, required of volunteers, is 45 minutes a week for 8 to 10 weeks. "Some time for preparation is also necessary," Mr. Melendes said, "but the rewards are great."
John Sahm agrees. Mr. Sahm, vice president and general manager of Royal Insurance in Elmsford, has been a Junior Achievement volunteer for seven years.
"I probably learned as much from my kids at Lincoln High School in Yonkers as they did from me," he said. "They are future consumers, and they had a very different approach to the marketplace. I got a fresh look at how business is regarded by the up-and-coming generation, which was extremely valuable to me. In turn, I gave future employees insight as to what the workplace will demand of them."
Mirroring the growing interest of businesses in international markets, is the Junior Achievement International program.
"In the last two years, Junior Achievement programs were set up in 90 countries around the globe, despite the fact that volunteerism isn't big abroad," Ms. Giustino said. "What is interesting is that with the breakup of the Soviet Union, Russia, which came to us for help in setting up a program, now has the largest Junior Achievement operation outside the U.S."
The international aspect of Junior Achievement, Ms. Giustino said, was recently demonstrated at an economics symposium involving 25 countries.
Using computers to make economic decisions on how to run a global company, 12th graders from 25 countries competed for market share.
"Russia won; Japan came in second," Ms. Giustino said, "which shows that Junior Achievement International is giving students in other nations a firm understanding of the role of business in a global economy."
For information on how to become a volunteer, the number to call is 592-6040.

HEADLINE: Bias Still a Concern At Private Golf Clubs

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
LAST weekend at St. Andrew's Golf Club in Hastings-on-Hudson, Wall Street brokers and corporate executives took time out from their daily pressures to commune with nature on the links and possibly break 90 -- all for the price of a $20,000 initiation fee and about $9,000 a year.
At the county-owned Saxon Woods Golf Course in Scarsdale, Ray Gutierrez was also listening to the birds and smelling springtime in the air. And he was likewise hoping for a score that he could brag about, but for less than $20 a day and no initiation fee. "I love this game!" the retired bus driver said. 
 George and Arlene Rosenberg were similarly enthralled with both the sport and the countryside at the private Ridgeway Country Club in White Plains where, like their counterparts at St. Andrews, they had paid dearly for the privilege.
While the golfers at the three courses shared a common passion, they were different in most other respects, and that was reflected in where they teed off. The membership at Ridgeway, where the Rosenbergs belong, is mostly Jewish and white; at St. Andrews, it is predominantly Christian and white. By contrast, many of Mr. Gutierrez's fellow golfers at the public course are blue-collar workers representing ethnically diverse backgrounds.
Despite the passage in 1989 of the New York State Human Rights law -- which made it illegal for organizations serving the public to discriminate on the basis of skin color, sex, church affiliation or national origin -- the homogeneity of private golf club memberships persists.
And while golf officials acknowledged that private clubs continue to be exclusive, they observed that the reasons for that had changed and insisted that nothing unlawful persists.
"Race, ethnicity, gender or religion are not issues anymore and have not been for some years," said William Rose Jr., president of the 75-year-old Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, where the 79th P.G.A. Championship will be held this summer from Aug. 11 to 17.
"It's a matter of economics now," he said.
In 1990, four national professional golf organizations made integration a prerequisite for a club's being a host of their tournaments, and Winged Foot counts several black members.
In fact, many private clubs today proudly mention their black and Hispanic members, although the numbers remain small. Similarly, some predominantly Christian clubs boast that they have Jewish members, and vice versa. And more private clubs -- not all, however -- appear proud of the role women play on their governing boards.
As Marc C. Bergschneider, chairman of Hudson National Golf Club in Croton-on-Hudson, Westchester's newest and most expensive club, explained it: "We're open to females, blacks, Hispanics, Jews, Catholics and Protestants. What we're looking for are good golfers with good character and good money."
Equity memberships at Hudson National cost $150,000, and yearly dues are $10,000. Initiation fees at other private clubs range from $20,000 to $150,000, and yearly fees start at $5,000.
"At those prices, private club memberships are not for your average Joe," said Colin Burns, the general manager at Winged Foot.
Economics may be the reason, but that is little consolation to black leaders like Winston A. Ross, the Westchester Regional Director for the New York State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. branches.
"We don't even get to be discriminated against because a lot of minorities can't afford memberships to begin with," he said.
Those kinds of concerns are especially troubling in light of the success of Tiger Woods, the Masters golf champion whose heritage is a mixture of black, Thai, white and American Indian.
While some view Mr. Woods's success as a milestone for civil rights and believe it will open doors for youngsters inspired by his example, others call attention to the limitations of what has essentially been a wealthy white man's game.
Indeed, the tradition at places like Winged Foot -- the interior of its stone club house is decorated with plush blue and gold carpeting, wood paneling and understated, elegant furniture -- appears steeped in an old-money heritage established by a white upper class.
And although the admission standards have changed over the years, clubs like Winged Foot and St. Andrew's continue to be exclusive -- although in ways different from the past.
For example, at St. Andrew's, the oldest golf club in the United States, admission until the 1970's was limited to Scottish Presbyterians, Michael P. Beckerich, the club's president, said.
That proved to be an economically unsound policy for the club, which eventually reached out to a broader membership to stay in business. Laws prohibiting discriminatory policies had little to do with it, the president said.
Nevertheless, St. Andrew's continues in spirit to be what Mr. Beckerich unapologetically described as clubby -- attracting like-minded players to its fairways.
"When choosing members, we ask, 'Is this a person I would have fun being hooked up with on the first tee?' " he said.
Jay Mottola, executive director of the Metropolitan Golf Association, an Elmsford-based nonprofit group representing 400 clubs, said it was not surprising that the changes in legislation had made little difference in the basic exclusivity of many private golf clubs.
"Sometimes they are painted as trying to keep out some groups, but I don't see that," Mr. Mottola said. "Clubs basically are groups of friends, so you can expect that one may be predominantly Jewish and another predominantly Christian, for example."
In recent years, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Michigan and Montana have enacted legislation redefining many private clubs as public institutions. Also, Maryland and Minnesota bar discrimination at country clubs if they accept state-property-tax deductions under open-space laws.
In 1994, New York's Human Rights Law was amended to make it applicable to any club that has more than 100 members, regularly serves meals and receives money directly or indirectly from nonmembers for business purposes.
Even though most private clubs now comply with the law, civil rights leaders are questioning whether the former discriminatory policies have only gone undercover. Are clubs inviting a few token minority members into their ranks and thereby complying with the letter of the law but not its spirit? they ask.
Lawrence Otis Graham, the author of the recently published book "Proversity: Getting Past Face Value and Finding the Soul of People" (John Wiley & Sons), said clubs now engage in polite forms of bigotry that in essence have the same impact as earlier forms of discrimination.
"In other words, they just found another way to say that they only want to be around people who remind them of themselves," said Mr. Graham, who is also the author of "Member of the Club," an investigation into discrimination at Greenwich Country Club.
Looking to the future, some minority leaders are optimistic that Mr. Woods's recent victory and the media attention it has garnered will eventually serve as a catalyst for clubs to become more inclusive, despite the problems of the past.
"I think that golf will eventually undergo a change, which will probably scare some white people to death," said Ernest Prince, president of the Urban League of Westchester.
"This is one of the last sports to be integrated, and private clubs are one of the last bastions where some whites still don't have to look over their shoulder to see if they shouldn't say something," he said.
In the immediate future, the most likely venue for young minority golfers is the public course.
"The passion for golf is no less on a public course," said Salvatore A. DeSantis, Westchester's Commissioner of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, who estimated that there were about 275,000 rounds of golf played on Westchester's public courses last year. He said that golfers often line up in the very early morning hours to be the first to tee off.
The county operates five public courses and is negotiating to acquire a sixth. The county courses, where greens fees with a Parks Department pass range from $11 to $19, are Dunwoodie in Yonkers, Maple Moor in White Plains, Mohansic in Yorktown Heights, Saxon Woods in Scarsdale and Sprain Lake in Yonkers.
Some golfers like Anthony G. Azrak, a Wall Street trader from Bronxville who was playing at Saxon Woods last week, said they prefer the public venue, even though the price of admission at a private club was not a deterrent. They said they were happy not to be dealing with the social pressures and snobbery that one often encounters at private clubs.
"It's relaxing here," Mr. Azrak said. "Why should I have to pay big money to be outside with nature and play a good game of golf?"

HEADLINE: F.Y.I.: English At Work

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: RAHWAY

 BODY:
WHEN the 3:15 buzzer sounds at the Guest Packaging plant, most of the first-shift workers leave their soap-cutting machines, their enormous mixing vats filled with raspberry fragrance, their stacks of boxes of ginseng body lotion, and head for home. But six men and four women -- packers, compounders, label operators -- climb a flight of metal stairs past a towering silver tank of propylene glycol and file into a windowless room isolated from the chugs and beeps of the factory floor.
It is time for English class. 
 "Today, we're going to learn how to fill out an actual Guest Packaging accident report," says the teacher, Bonnie Finkelstein, "because, God forbid, anything happens to you, you need to know how to tell people about it."
For the next two hours, Ms. Finkelstein and her eager pupils, who hail from seven countries, discuss the dangers of bypassing safety devices and working on moving parts and the distinctions between "inhalation," "ingestion" and "absorption." Frank Alcindor, a machine operator from Haiti who has his eye on a supervisor's job, volunteers to explain the importance of clearing all the bottles off the production line before starting the next run. "This class helps a lot," he says afterward. "It gives me better communication with my workers and my boss."
Lots of people have come to the same conclusion as Mr. Alcindor. And not just at Guest, where 120 of the plant's 470 workers have signed up for English classes that cover subjects such as how to fill out work order forms and follow the Federal government's designated good manufacturing practices. Across New Jersey, more and more workers are preparing for the 21st Century by studying English on the job, thanks in part to a program run by the state Labor Department that has brought teachers into more than 200 workplaces since it started in 1995.
Here in the state that a recent Princeton University study tabbed as the one with the nation's most diverse immigrant population, companies from screw makers to hospitals to hotels are finding that they need their employees to speak a common language in order to grow, meet tougher safety standards and -- counterintuitively -- stay competitive in the global marketplace.
And employees need to improve their English to hold onto their jobs in the face of workplace changes requiring blue- and white-collar workers alike to know how to perform their colleagues' tasks, do more paperwork, feel at home at a computer keyboard and simply communicate more.
Though the surge in employee language training is happening at the same that immigration reforms have thousands of people scrambling to learn English in order to be allowed to stay in the country, it is a separate phenomenon, said Paul Scherbina, who runs the state program.
"This whole thing is being pushed more by economics than immigration," he said.
Often as not, workers signing up for English courses are veteran employees, many of them already citizens, said Nancy Fisher, education director for Jewish Vocational Service of Metrowest in East Orange, which is Ms. Finkelstein's employer and one of the state's steadiest suppliers of English teachers.
"What we're finding is that employees who have been around 15 or 20 years -- good, productive employees -- are not able to keep up with changes in the workplace," Ms. Fisher said. "A lot of hospitals, for instance, are going to patient-focused care, where somebody who was once just a cleaning person is now in charge of dietary, housekeeping, maintenance and transport for a cluster of rooms, and she has to have a lot more contact with patients and be able to answer their questions. Her job orders are coming through on a computer now. In a factory, you have more interactions between line workers and supervisors, and people have to do more advanced computations. All that requires language skills."
Many other factors are making English an increasingly essential tool in the workplace:
* International standards like the quality-control specifications known as ISO 9000, which many manufacturers are adopting. The system requires written documentation of every task in the production process.
* Business practices like Total Quality Management that require workers at every level of a company to become directly involved in making decisions.
* The fact that New Jersey's immigrant population is growing more ethnically diverse even as the rest of the country's is growing less diverse, according to Thomas Espenshade, a Princeton University sociologist who recently published a book about the state's immigrants. The Census Bureau says the percentage of New Jersey residents who speak little or no English increased by 25 percent from 1980 to 1990. And while most of those people speak Spanish, 40 percent of them speak neither English nor Spanish. For supervisors, that means being bilingual is often not enough.

Have Curriculum, Will Travel
In the big-government scheme of things, New Jersey's workplace English program -- one of fewer than half a dozen in the country, Mr. Scherbina said -- is still relatively small. It began in 1995 with a budget of $100,000 and will cost $900,000 this year, almost all of which goes to pay teachers. But Mr. Scherbina said the program's size made it nimble. He prides himself on starting classes within two or three weeks of meeting with a company. And the teachers -- who come from the staffs of community colleges or nonprofit groups like Jewish Vocational Service, which has been sending English teachers to job sites since 1992 -- will set up shop anywhere.
At a wholesale rose company, for example, classes were held after work on the tables where the the roses were cut.
The 10-week, 40-hour courses, at beginning, intermediate and advanced levels, are tailored to each company's needs and particular vocabulary.
"It's not conversational English," Mr. Scherbina said. "It's more important to be able to say, 'Stop the press, Jose, hand caught,' than 'Nice weather out there.' " (Nevertheless, he said, the courses help workers off the job, too. "One woman told me she overheard her kids say, 'We better be careful because Mama's beginning to understand us.' ")
Mr. Scherbina encourages companies to pay employees for at least half their class time. Workers often have to make considerable sacrifices to attend, he said, and the fiscal and symbolic support cuts the dropout rate. But many companies, including Guest Packaging, do not.
Barbara Texeira, the training manager at Guest Packaging, where English lessons have just started, said she hoped they would pay off for employees and management alike. Safety needs to be improved -- "We've had a lot of accidents in the past," she said. Workers have complained that their suggestions are not listened to.
And satisfying the company's biggest customers is getting harder. "Procter & Gamble is getting stricter and stricter with their requirements," Ms. Texeira said. "Every single person who works on a P&G line needs to be able to read their Standard Operating Procedures. And when P&G audits us, we have to be able to go to every person on the line and ask them to describe their job."
Some companies find that the benefits of English training build up over time. In 1991, the H&H Swiss Screw Company in Somerset brought in consultants to teach Total Quality Management to a work force that spoke mostly Spanish, Russian and Serbo-Croatian. But the company controller, Diane Lucas, said it became clear that while the workers were picking up new mathematical techniques, softer concepts like team-building were not getting through.
When the state program started in 1995, H&H jumped at it.
Now, "if we're conducting a tour and our customer wants to see their parts being produced, we bring them right out to the floor, and the setter and the operator explain the process to them," Ms. Lucas said. "It's great for our customers."
H&H is so encouraged that it is now looking to be certified in ISO 9000, the paperwork-intensive manufacturing protocol set by the International Standards Organization and accepted around the world.
"This ISO registration and certification that we're now reaching for is like the icing on the cake," Ms. Lucas said. "It's the culmination of many years of education of the work force, and at its base is E.S.L."
Another force driving the need for a lingua franca in the workplace is the demographic fact that companies have often been settled like cities, with a few pioneers from one ethnic group setting up a foothold in one department and recruiting friends and relatives as jobs open up. The result is linguistically isolated "neighborhoods" that can function as long as they are self-sufficient, just as someone in a cohesive ethnic neighborhood can survive without learning English. But cross-training and other attempts to integrate a company can lead to chaos.
Take Gar Products, a restaurant furniture maker in Lakewood that held its first English-class graduation last month. Gar, which has grown from a few dozen employees to 85, recently decided to introduce a new tier of management between the supervisors and the line workers.
"We needed someone to be in charge of three or four people, to handle paperwork and give people someone to report to when they finish a job to keep work flowing," said Elaine Garfunkel, an officer of the company. "What we found was that the support people we felt were responsible enough to do this didn't have the English."
It gets more complicated.
"In our upholstery department, the supervisor speaks only English," Ms. Garfunkel said. "Her lead person speaks Polish and English, so he had no trouble communicating with the Polish workers in his group, but he couldn't communicate with the people in his group who spoke Spanish. And if people who needed seat pads for assembly came over to the upholstery area to look for seat pads, they couldn't ask the supervisor where the seat pads are, and so they would need a translator, which means pulling somebody away from their work."
No one becomes fluent in English in 10 weeks, but Ms. Garfunkel said the course had already had a big impact. "Morale is better," she said, "and I think we're seeing an easing of possible tensions between people from different backgrounds. We're looking at a more harmonious workplace, and I think that in itself is going to benefit us."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
In Oakland, 400 Homes on 303 Acres, 203 Open Space

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: OAKLAND

 BODY:
A 303-ACRE tract of woodlands edging the Ramapo River in this Bergen County borough is beginning its transformation into a residential enclave that will have 400 homes, but still preserve much of the site's natural setting.
The detached houses and town homes will be laid out on 100 acres, mostly in clusters of three or four, so that the rest will remain open. They will be set against the Ramapo Mountains off Ramapo Valley Road (Route 202) in this community, where 20 percent of its nine square miles is parkland. 
 Model homes are now taking shape and roads are being installed for the first 95 detached homes at Ramapo River Reserve, as the project will be known. The complex will be built at a cost of more than $70 million over the next four years by Baker Residential, a subsidiary of the Baker Companies of Pleasant Valley, N.Y.
The company is using its own equity and bank financing to build the project. It is the first sizable development in Oakland in a dozen years and is rising on one of the few large tracts left for residential development, said Michael F. Kauker, the borough's planning consultant.
The project is proceeding at a time when the housing market in Bergen County, as in the rest of suburban New Jersey, is strengthening, said Randolph L. Wine, president of the West Bergen Association of Realtors.
Factors in the improving market, he said, are increased demand coupled with a low inventory of existing homes, heightened consumer confidence in the economy and reasonable mortgage interest rates. He said home prices, which dropped by as much as 30 percent during the housing downturn in the late 80's and early 90's, have also stabilized and begun to move up.
Those market conditions, along with what John W. Dolan Jr., project manager, said his company viewed as a rare site just 40 minutes from midtown Manhattan in a natural setting, were crucial in its decision to move ahead with the project. Other factors were existing state approvals for the site and access to the final link of Interstate 287, which was completed three years ago through the center of Oakland and is two miles from the entrance to the project.
Baker's development plan is not the first for the site, 189 acres of which was the former estate of the late Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Sidney Kingsley, who purchased the property in the mid-30's as a summer retreat. Though Mr. Kingsley lived there until his death two years ago, he sold the property in 1985 to River Bend Associates, New York and New Jersey investors.
Initially, the investors proposed building 364 residences, most of them town houses on the 189-acre site. But the borough rejected the proposal in 1986 contending it was too dense, even though the special cluster zoning at the time for that part of Oakland permitted two units an acre.
The developer sued and then bought 108 adjacent acres. A year later River Bend reached an agreement with the city to build 394 units in what is the current tract. The 1987 settlement called for the developer to give the borough $1.3 million, including $500,00 toward meeting the borough's Mount Laurel obligation to provide 220 units affordable to families with low or moderate incomes and to construct a sewage treatment plant to service the new community. Most of Oakland is not now served by public sewers.
Then the recession hit and River Bend ultimately chose not to develop the site.
Mr. Dolan of Baker said his company had purchased the site in 1994 and agreed to meet the terms of the settlement, despite the fact that the property is laced with wetlands that under state law cannot be developed and require buffer zones around them.
"We felt we could come up with a responsible development plan that would conform with the state approvals and take advantage of the site's natural beauty," added Ian R. Jones, project development manager. The site includes rock outcroppings, a lake and estuaries that feed into the river, which borders the site on the east. The mountains border it on the west.
The company presented its site plan to the Oakland Planning Board for review in 1995. It was reconfigured from River Bend's plan to include detached homes and town houses with garages, which Baker considers more viable in today's market. It also has six more homes than River Bend's plan because Baker purchased six additional acres.
After a year of negotiations, the company was granted preliminary approval for the entire site last July and final approval for the first phase three weeks ago.
Most of the 400 homes in the project, designed as a homeowners' association, will follow the site's topography, placing them on flatlands or natural plateaus and tucking them amid thick woodlands. Some homes will overlook a six-acre lake, but most of the land along the river as well as most of the mountainside will be left untouched.
MR. KAUKER, Oakland's planning consultant, said Ramapo River Reserve implements the zoning the borough put in place in 1985 and recognizes areas of the site that are amenable to development and those that should be preserved. As such it is consistent with the planning objective of local officials to maintain Oakland's semirural character, he said.
Mayor J. Peter Kendall added that though the project would increase Oakland's 4,000 homes by 10 percent it was not expected to overburden municipal resources because the borough's population had dropped in the last 15 years to just under 12,000 from 14,000. He also said traffic along Route 202 in the part of town near the project has decreased since I-287 was finished.
Baker also is in the final stages of negotiations with the county on improvements from Route 202 into the site, mainly widening the road for a left-turning lane into the project.
"We would have liked to have put the site into parkland," said Mr. Kendall, "but it was in private hands for over 50 years and we couldn't afford to buy it." The current plan "is the best we could do," he said.
Work is proceeding on the first 95 homes, which will be in clusters of three and four. The three- and four-bedroom detached houses, with 2,250 to 3,305 square feet of space, will have two-car garages.
The homes, designed in seven styles by E.D.I Architecture Inc of Houston, will sit on 5,500-square-foot lots and be fee simple, meaning buyers own the land under the houses. Preconstruction prices will range from the high-$200,000 to the mid-$300,000 range. Sales are to begin next month.
As of the first quarter the average sales price for existing detached homes in the county was $278,729, up from $265,861 the same time last year, according to the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service, which covers Bergen, Passaic and Hudson Counties.
Construction is also under way on an outdoor pool and clubhouse, with meeting space and an exercise room. The lake will have a beach and floating dock and nature trails through the property are also planned. The monthly homeowner's fee is expected to be $150.
Down the road, Mr. Dolan said, the plan also calls for 39 larger and more expensive detached homes on bigger lots on a plateau 500 feet up the side of the mountain. The zoning also permits town houses, the size and price of which have not yet been determined, he said. He said they would be developed according to market demand.

HEADLINE: Preserving a Delicate Balance

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
TO drive along South Orange Avenue as it crosses from a frayed section of Newark to the neatly tended village of South Orange is a jarring experience. Within a single block, an urban landscape of littered streets, roll-down security gates and graffiti-scarred apartment buildings gives way to the leafy charms of gas-fired street lamps, proud Victorians and pampered front lawns. That the owners of the gaslit Victorians and Tudors include both whites and blacks is a fact that residents of South Orange, and its sister township, Maplewood, see as a crucial part of their suburban identity. But as more and more black families replace whites in parts of their communities, there is growing concern about whether this balance can be maintained.
Maintaining diversity, local residents and officials have learned, does not happen on its own. Treading warily along the delicate fault lines where race, idealism and property values meet, the two towns have set up a Racial Balance Task Force to publicly confront the kind of issues that many communities might prefer to keep closeted. 
 Thirty years ago this summer, race riots devastated Newark and sent much of its white population packing for newer suburbs to the south and west. But as New Jersey's largest city fell victim to urban decay and racial ghettoization, South Orange and Maplewood held the line against white flight, islands of integration in a largely segregated sea.
Once a single municipality -- Maplewood seceded after World War I -- the towns are linked in innumerable ways, including a combined school system, recreation programs, and what Bob Klein, a local realtor, calls "a sense that we're in this together." The South Orange/Maplewood school district remains the envy of surrounding communities, and many homes in both towns sell for well over $300,000.
Like numerous other municipalities that border largely black urban areas, South Orange and Maplewood, with 38,000 residents, can no longer ignore shifting demographics. Their black populations, less than 5 percent in 1970, have grown to 19 percent in South Orange and 13 percent in Maplewood, according to the 1990 census, the most recent figures available. More telling, however, is the racial makeup of the towns' shared school district. In 1990, the student population was 22 percent nonwhite. Today that figure is 45 percent, reflecting the fact that many white empty-nesters are being replaced by minority households with school-age children.
Perhaps more troubling to many residents is the pattern of demographic change. Sections of South Orange and Maplewood that abut Newark and Irvington have become predominantly black while the more expensive neighborhoods that hug South Mountain to the west remain largely white. Adjacent communities like Millburn and Short Hills that sit on the other side of the forested ridge are 99 percent white, a fact that some black home-seekers say deters them from looking beyond South Orange and Maplewood.
Town officials and local residents charge, while declining to name specific brokers or agencies, that some real-estate agents steer whites and blacks to different parts of town, creating new albeit relatively affluent ghettos. A dozen agents who were interviewed for this article denied charges that they steered clients by skin color, saying that it is economics that largely determines where blacks and whites buy homes; the agents said that segregated enclaves serve no one.
Many residents agree that the integrated character of South Orange and Maplewood ranks with the excellence of the schools as attractions for them. "I moved here so my kids could grow up in a microcosm of the real world," said Brian O'Leary, 40, an executive at Maplewood's Hammond map company who lives three blocks from Newark in South Orange's Tuxedo Park section. "No one benefits when people of different races live separately."
Residents of both towns, after a decade of apprehension and rancorous debate, formed the 30-member task force and hired an integration specialist to help them grapple with what sociologists refer to as "resegregation." Their hope is to turn South Orange/ Maplewood into a model of diversity, much like Shaker Heights, Ohio, the Cleveland suburb that pioneered engineered integration 30 years ago.
"If we could freeze this moment in time, the mix we have now would be perfect," Donald L. DeMarco, the task force's consultant, told 300 residents last month during a public forum at the towns' shared high school, Columbia. "But the problem is momentum and to not make an effort is to give in to segregation. Ignoring the issue will not make it go away."
WHILE most Americans approach the discussion of race with caution, people here have begun to talk about the topic with increasing ease. In classrooms, town meetings and during casual encounters at the new Starbucks in South Orange, people broach the subject without reluctance. "By openly discussing race, people realize that we all cut our lawns, take care of our homes and want a good education for our kids," said Celia King, 36, a hospital administrator and Maplewood's only black elected committeewoman, as her two children played in the backyard. "It's inspiring to hear people talk about something as delicate as race for the first time in their lives."
That talk has also led to action. Since November, when it hired Mr. DeMarco, a veteran of Shaker Heights, the interracial task force has begun working to identify brokers it believes engage in steering. Last month, the group began advertising their communities in metropolitan area newspapers, featuring a toll-free number for potential home buyers who will be referred to participating real-estate agents. This list of "preferred brokers" will be determined, committee members said, by sending people of various races to real-estate offices and seeing what neighborhoods they are offered as prospective home buyers.
The task force has other goals as well: promoting racial harmony, encouraging blacks and whites to socialize more freely and increasing minority participation in civic life. But they also believe that their communities' ultimate well-being is tied to a robust real-estate market in which people of all races can compete for housing in every part of town. After careful evaluation, both white and black residents have come to the same conclusion: Once a neighborhood becomes predominantly black, white demand dries up and property values fall.
Shirley Matthews has a first-hand understanding of that equation. When she and her husband, who is white, moved from Park Slope, Brooklyn, to Maplewood 10 years ago, she was the first black on their block. But since then, nearly every house that has come on the market has been sold to a black family, she says. "Brokers claim they weren't steering but why is it I never saw a white person looking at these houses?" asked Ms. Matthews, a doctoral student in psychology whose husband is an executive at Christofle Silver in Manhattan.
Now that the couple wants to move to a larger house in town, they have been told by their broker to set the asking price below what they paid. "It's devastating," said Ms. Matthews. "This street is as beautiful as it was when we moved in. It's obvious to me that once the racial makeup of a neighborhood goes beyond the comfort level of whites, the value of that neighborhood goes down."
While housing prices in both towns declined during the late 1980's and early 1990's, which may partly account for the decreased value in Ms. Matthews's home, they have begun to rebound, say brokers, thanks in part to the region's improving economy, but also because speedier train service to Manhattan via a new rail link, Midtown Direct, has started to draw a growing number of young professionals from New York City, Hoboken, Jersey City and even the postwar suburbs further to the west. The service, which New Jersey Transit inaugurated last summer, has shaved travel time by a third, allowing commuters from South Orange and Maplewood to reach Penn Station in under a half hour.
There is an unmistakable pride in the town's cosmopolitan citizenry, its municipal art gallery, its spirit of volunteerism and the fact that interracial families and gay couples have begun flocking here in recent years. Income levels in the two towns are comfortable; in South Orange, according to the 1990 Census, household median income for blacks was $73,327, and for whites, $63,688; in Maplewood, for blacks $59,306 and for whites, $57,947.
Even South Orange's commercial center, once plagued with 17 vacant storefronts, has come back to life. In the last year, a dozen new businesses have opened, and town officials have ambitious plans to build a performing arts center, a movie theater and a small hotel adjacent to the train station. A $2.5 million redesign of South Orange Avenue, which will widen sidewalks and slow speeding traffic, is scheduled to begin this summer. "These are the kinds of improvements that will increase competition for housing," said William Calabrese, South Orange's chief elected official. "Sometimes I think all this talk about race might just exaggerate the problem."
But physical improvements alone, Mr. DeMarco and task force members agree, may not be enough to overcome white reservations about sharing neighborhoods with blacks. Douglas S. Massey, a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of "American Apartheid: Segregation and the Making of the Underclass" (Harvard University Press, 1993), says that in a series of recent surveys black respondents describe a neighborhood as ideally integrated when the racial composition is equal parts black and white. Whites, on the other hand, see the ideal mix as no more than 20 percent black. "It's the sad reality of our country," said Dr. Massey. "Unfortunately, most communities fighting resegregation will find it an uphill slog."
Those towns that have kept a change from comfortably integrated to largely black at bay have done so by making racial balance something of a crusade. For Shaker Heights, that mission has been an intrinsic part of the town's psyche since the mid 1960's. Sixth graders take racial sensitivity classes and a loan program entices whites to move to black neighborhoods.
But despite its stable mix of race and class and a vigorous housing market, there are still parts of the Ohio town that are overwhelming white or black. The job of staving off separateness, say Shaker Heights officials, is never done.
"While not perfect, Shaker Heights is an example of the possibilities for promoting integration and better race relations in a community," said John Yinger, author of "Closed Doors, Opportunities Lost: The Continuing Costs of Housing Discrimination" (Russell Sage Foundation, 1995). "At the very least, discrimination is relatively low and people of all races have equal access to housing."
But few communities have the political will to take on racial issues so boldly, says Mr. DeMarco, who has worked with a dozen towns around the country. In many cases, a municipality will act only after panic selling has begun, when people realize they can't sell their homes.
"There is a very brief window of opportunity, when property values are strong and people are willing to do the hard work that's required," said Mr. DeMarco, executive director of the Fund for an Open Society, a nonprofit organization based in Philadelphia. "You can count on both hands and a few toes the number of places in this country that have maintained true integration."
Freeport, L.I., Teaneck, N.J., and West Mount Airy, a suburb of Philadelphia, he said, are among the few East Coast communities that have sustained racial balance.
Many newcomers say that the diversity of South Orange and Maplewood is what attracted them. When Kerry and Philip Robinson, both white, began looking to move from their Brooklyn Heights apartment last year, they initially avoided South Orange and Maplewood because friends and brokers intimated that the towns "had problems." Instead, they searched for a home in western New Jersey communities that until recently were mostly farmland. Ms. Robinson, 33, said she was dismayed by what she found.
"All we saw were treeless tract developments with vinyl siding, not the kind of houses where you'd want to put a candle in the window at Christmas," she said.
MORE troubling was what she called the "stifling sterility" of the newer suburbs, the sense that everyone was the same. "My biggest fear about leaving Brooklyn was losing the rich culture, the diversity," she said. "I didn't want my daughter to grow up in a white-bread community."
At the insistence of a friend, she and her husband, a vice president at Smith Barney, toured South Orange and fell in love with a 1929 Tudor on Mayhew Drive with cathedral ceilings, a back staircase and "no wood veneer anywhere," she said.
The fact that a number of black families live in the neighborhood was part of the draw. "When a child grows up with people who are all the same, race eventually becomes an issue," she said, as her 5-year-old daughter tugged at her hem. "In a place like South Orange, there's a better chance that race will be irrelevant."
George Robinson, (no relation to Kerry and Philip) who moved his family from Manhattan to Maplewood in 1984, was also drawn by the town's racial mix. "I have no interest in living in a cocoon," he said. But that same diversity, he believes, also frightens some older residents, many of whom fled Newark a generation ago when things there began to change. "They may have come here because there wasn't anything 'offensive' about the towns," said Mr. Robinson, a member of the board of education who is white, "and to some that may mean there weren't many African Americans."
While the integration of the community is a draw to many, a more crucial factor to young families is frequently the schools, where a decline in scores on standardized tests in recent years has been a cause of concern. Dr. Ralph Lieber, the superintendent of schools, says the slump in standardized test scores has convinced some people that the education system, consistently ranked among the nation's top 8 percent, is on a downward slide.
That decline, he said, reflects that many new students transferred from less rigorous schools. After a few years in the South Orange/Maplewood system, he said, the scores of recently arrived students have increased. Last year, state test scores at Columbia High School rose 6 percent, he said.
"The education we offer is still among the best in the country," he said. "We regularly send students to Harvard and Yale. But if we have to play the test score game to prove the perceived worth of our education system, we'll focus on raising test scores."
For some, the changing hue of Columbia's student body is in itself a source of alarm. "People see groups of African American kids leaving school and they make assumptions about the quality of education," Dr. Lieber said. "It's frustrating to have to battle stereotypes."
And that, say task force members, is at the heart of South Orange and Maplewood's problem. To combat negative perceptions, the task force has created a program to reach out to brokers, corporate relocation consultants and potential home buyers. It also hopes to push for new local ordinances that, for example, would ban "for sale" signs from front lawns.
The governments of both towns have each contributed $50,000 toward the cost of promoting their communities, hiring a coordinator to oversee the entire effort, including the testing program aimed at both identifying real-estate agents that the committee will designate as "preferred" and determining those who engage in racial steering.
Many real-estate brokers reject accusations of racial steering and say they are being unfairly blamed for forces beyond their control. Linda Firestone, director of education for the North Central Jersey Association of Realtors, says sales agents know that steering is a violation of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, and that even talking about race to prospective buyers can cost them their real-estate licenses.
"For brokers, the only color they know is green," she said. "If I won't show you a house in a more expensive neighborhood, it has everything to do with your finances. Oftentimes discrimination is in the eye of the beholder."
Harold Carillo, who owns the Coldwell Banker brokerage in Union, says that many agents engage in steering without realizing it. "Sometimes we figure, 'Italians want to live with Italians and Greeks with other Greeks,' " he said. "I think I was guilty of that kind of thing until people told me it was wrong."
During his 30 years in the real-estate business, Mr. Carillo has seen dramatic change in Essex County. Since the late 1960's, towns like Orange, East Orange and Irvington, all of which border Newark, have become more than 75 percent black. A former resident of Newark, Mr. Carillo joined his neighbors in a hasty exodus shortly after the riots subsided, taking a $12,000 loss on his house. "Once the National Guard and the tanks left, nearly every house on my street was up for sale," he said.
He believes that Maplewood and South Orange are poor candidates for wholesale resegregation, largely because property values remain high. "It's all about economics," he said. "Most blacks simply can't afford to live in these towns."
According to figures compiled by the task force, the average sale price for homes in South Orange, $203,600 in 1992, rose to $219,000 last year. In Maplewood, average prices rose from $176,000 to $185,000 in the same period. In the last six months, brokers say, interest in the towns has soared, thanks in large part to the new train service.
"This is the busiest we've been in years," said Roy Scott, the owner of the Re/Max Village Square agency in South Orange. "We're swamped, especially with people from the city who want to live in the suburbs without giving up the cosmopolitan lifestyle they're used to."
One sign of the booming market is the six-bedroom Colonial that Mr. Scott recently sold in South Orange's historic Montrose section, a few blocks from the Orange border. After just a week on the market, the house sold for $425,000. Three years ago, it sold for $340,000. "Bidding wars have become standard fare," he said.
It is in moderately priced neighborhoods, however, where homes sell in the $100,000 to $160,000 range, that resegregation is more of a concern.
Last year, when Mr. Carillo sold a foreclosed house to a black family on a predominantly white stretch of Williams Street, just a few blocks from Newark, the sale had a startling impact. "Within a few months, there were five or six 'for sale' signs," he recalled. "I guess some things never change."
LONG before she knew what the term resegregation meant, Suzanne Ryan was trying to change the status quo. An elementary school teacher who moved from Ozone Park, Queens, to Maplewood in 1985, Ms. Ryan was raking the leaves on her front lawn several years ago when she noticed that only black families were being shown the house next to hers.
"When I called up the broker and said, 'Don't you know that steering is illegal?' he slipped and said, 'No it isn't.' " Outraged by what she saw, Ms. Ryan and a group of neighbors revived a local organization that had been formed in the mid-1980's to deal with an outburst of racist graffiti that began appearing on the homes of black residents. "I realized that if we didn't do something, we would lose our town," she said, sitting on the front steps of her house surrounded by a blaze of flowering azaleas.
Although the group was unsuccessful in enlisting the support of town officials, at least the issue was brought into the open, she said.
"It was a bittersweet experience," said Ms. Ryan, 38, recalling the spate of angry phone calls from brokers, the hate mail, the cold glare of neighbors. "Some people thought I was a bigot, others thought I was just nuts. There's still plenty of hard work ahead of us, but the hardest part was just bringing the issue out of the closet."
"As a society," said Dr. Lieber, the school superintendent, who lives in South Orange, "we have so many stereotypes and built-in anxieties to overcome. We're on the cutting edge here because these are the kinds of problems the whole nation will eventually have to face. And if we can't succeed, I'm afraid no one can."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Future of Real Estate Service Networks;
Mergers Squeezing the Loose Brokerage Alliances

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
CONSOLIDATION is much on the minds of real estate brokers and managers these days as acquisitions and mergers, announced and rumored, are widely thought to be on the way toward creating a few large national companies that will dominate markets.
One of the issues raised by this trend is whether the networks that link independent companies to give them something of a national presence will survive in their present form or falter as some of their strongest members opt to join the new national powers. 
 There has certainly been a flurry of activity. Last week, CB Commercial Real Estate Services Group announced that it had "essentially completed negotiations" for the acquisition of Koll Real Estate Services for $130 million of its own stock and the assumption of $35 million in debt.
The combination will create a behemoth with 6,400 employees and 250 million square feet of property under management, and which last year had almost $700 million in revenues and participated in 26,000 sales or leases.
Meanwhile, LaSalle Partners has announced plans to acquire the Galbreath Company and its intention to sell stock to the public. Although the headquarters of each of these companies are elsewhere, all have offices in New York and have sought to be important players in this market.
Some participants in the market say real estate service providers are simply acting in ways that parallel the corporate patterns of their customers by : providing national and international management and transaction capabilities and tapping public capital markets to finance growth,
"We really don't have any choice," said Raymond T. O'Keefe, president of Grubb & Ellis New York. "If you want to do business you have to be national. And you cannot finance that kind of structure as a private company."
"This is a very important time in real estate," added Mr. O'Keefe, whose parent company, Grubb & Ellis, is publicly traded. "We are seeing a sea change take place. Clients don't want to deal with 80 different brokers in 80 different cities."
Most industry executives say that small, entrepreneurial firms will survive, using their knowledge of local markets and ability to move quickly to make deals happen. The question, they say, is the fate of larger, regional companies and of the tactics they have used to try to match the broad base of their larger competitors.
One of these tactics was networks, which come in a variety of forms. In general, they are confederations of independent companies in different geographic locations who agree to cooperate, maintain standard procedures and refer business to one another. This allows a company that has a strong presence in one region to offer clients access to affiliated concerns elsewhere in the nation or the globe.
BUT with the growth of true national real estate service firms some question the continuing viability of networks, particularly with corporate clients who increasingly want one-stop shopping.
"Networks, in my opinion, are an endangered species," said Stephen B. Siegel, president of Insignia Commercial Group. "They were developed to be an alternative for organizations without the inclination and wherewithal to become national and international. There is a desire now for seamless delivery of services and a single point of contact."
Indeed, Insignia Commercial recently broke with a network that a predecessor company, Edward S. Gordon, helped to found. Oncor International and Insignia said in a joint statement that three companies acquired by Insignia, all previously members of the network, were ending their participation. The companies are now known as Insignia/Edward S. Gordon, Rostenberg-Doern/ESG and Insignia/Frain, Camins & Swartchild.
The resignations poke some pretty big holes in Oncor's net. Gordon was its representative in New York City and northern New Jersey; Rostenberg-Doern covered Westchester and Fairfield Counties to the north and east of the city, and Frain, Camins was the affiliate in the Chicago area.
Since Insignia Commercial is growing by acquisition, using financing supplied by its parent, Insignia Financial Group, the loss of the network affiliation has little consequence. Indeed Mr. Siegel has said the company wants to be represented in seven or eight major markets across the country.
David A. Ball, the president of Oncor, said the split was the direct result of Insignia's acquisitions, which he said would inevitably lead to conflicts of interest. "What we had here was a simple difference in structural incompatibility," he said. He noted that a group of brokers who had been with Koll in Phoenix had recently set up operations as an Insignia subsidiary that competes with an existing Oncor affiliate in the city..
"We have a big company in Phoenix," he said. "When they opened that office it was in direct conflict."
"Having Gordon stay in Oncor was like having the wolf guard the hen house," said Andrew H. Roos, executive vice president of Williams Real Estate Company in New York. "Eventually," he said, referring to the Gordon company's acquistions of other Oncor concerns, "it ate too many hens."
Mr. Ball said he expected Oncor to replace the losses in the New York and Chicago areas with other affiliates. But executives in New York said that the Gordon operation would be hard to replace. "Who is he going to get?" said Mr. O'Keefe asked. "Galbreath has gone away and Williams and Newmark are affiliated with other networks," he said, referring to Newmark & Company Real Estate.
"Losing Gordon takes the heart out of Oncor," said Steven A. Swerdlow, executive vice president and manager of CB Commercial's office in New York. "The New York office drives a high percentage of the total business in an organization like that."
BEYOND the details of the Oncor-Insignia split, some executives question whether alliances of individual companies can match big national firms in the competition for corporate business.
"The big question is whether being a regional company and part of a network has any validity anymore," said Richard Podos, vice president of Equis Corporation and manager of its New York office. "The big companies are not going to networks, they are going to the national companies."
But not everyone is ready to declare a calamity. "If I'm Macy's and Oncor is Gimbels, bad news for Gimbels is good news for Macy's," said Robert L. Billingsley, an executive vice president at Colliers ABR, the New York affiliate of the competing Colliers network.
He said that despite the trend toward consolidation the firms in the Colliers organization were prospering and retaining their independence. "They are healthy and they provide an alternative to national companies," he said. "This is all client driven and our clients say they like us the way we are."
But the pressure for consolidation is pushing even successful companies to alter their operations. Mr. Roos of Williams, which is part of a network called GVA, said the members were tightening their financial ties to one another and taking added steps to appear more seamless, including opening a Williams GVA office in Chicago. "Customers do not want referral representation," Mr. Roos said, "you have got to provide them with standardized service."
There is a downside to standardized service, he said. "Large companies look for a single source and accept lower echelon talent as the price for it," he said. Moreover, He said, many of the companies rely on salaried workers, who may be less motivated to be creative than brokers who put together deals to earn more lucrative commissions.
"In the end, the best and the brightest will go where they can make the big bucks," Mr. Roos said.
Personal relationships count, too, and they can be hard to develop, particularly if top executives of a company are managing a complex organization, said Peter R. Friedman, president of the Friedman Realty Group. "New York is different," he said. "It is too big and too complex to be dominated by one or two companies. In New York, senior managers have relations with property owners at the highest level. It takes a long time to build these relationships and some of these people are just starting."
Some people think the urge to consolidate is a result of both the efforts of corporate America to farm out the real estate operations they once handled internally and the efforts of companies to squeeze the management fees they pay to the absolute minimum.
"Consolidation is being driven by the property management side, not brokerage," said Patrick M. Robinson, a principal in The Staubach Company, which opened a New York office in January. "The margins in management are so thin that you really have to be huge to get the economies of scale."
He said the basic problem with networks is that, as confederations, they find it hard to enforce discipline except at relatively long intervals. "If a partner screws up a deal, you can't fire anybody," Mr. Robinson said. "As a single company, you can deal with it."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
The Loose Brick in the Foundation of Co-op Finance

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
HAPPINESS descends upon the members of a co-op board when it successfully refinances the building's mortgage. So Philip Prince has reason to be pleased just now.
Mr. Prince is the treasurer of the 42-unit co-op at 160 West 77th Street. Although it is 40 percent occupied by rent-regulated tenants, the co-op has completed a refinancing of its 10-year mortgage with the National Cooperative Bank, a leading lender to co-ops in New York City. 
 "We were able to save money, with better terms than we had five years ago," said Mr. Prince. "We also had more options, because there are more lenders lending to co-ops now than there were then."
But the view of this corner of the mortgage world from the lending side is not so rosy. The bank was able to provide the financing it did because of a favorable appraisal, calculated on the basis of the market value of the apartments as rentals should the bank ever have to foreclose on the loan. But the future use of this method of appraisal, which establishes the "loan-to-value" ratio that lenders use in deciding how much credit to advance, has been thrown into doubt.
For two years financiers in the co-op field have been awaiting the promulgation of regulations by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal dealing with the rents that can be charged if a lender forecloses on a co-op corporation, sending a formerly rent-regulated building back to rental status. This unhappy outcome for shareholders rarely occurs, but projected rents in the event of foreclosure play a key part in loan underwriting by banks.
A ruling by the New York State Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, has obliged the agency to issue these rules, which will be crucial in determining how much financing will be available to co-ops in the future. The rules will also affect the number of lenders that decide to remain active in co-op financing, both for buildings and individual buyers.
If they are viewed as unfavorable -- anything that prevents appraisers from utilizing free-market rents as the stand-in for value, as they have historically done -- all converted co-ops, even those with high percentages of apartments occupied by owners, could be hurt, according to appraisers, mortgage lenders and other intermediaries.
The possible consequences are grim -- shareholders required to pay more maintenance to pay off debt; sellers less able to find buyers as lenders shy away from purchase loans for apartments, and untested financial entities replacing long-established institutions as major financing sources.
But, as well as the stakes are recognized in financial circles, there is a human dimension to the issue that has apparently given the state agency pause. This is the impact on former shareholders in the rare circumstance of a reversion to a rental, through foreclosure or otherwise.
Rent-regulated tenants would not be affected; they would continue to pay their regulated rent, assuming the Legislature renews rent regulation laws this year. But a shareholder -- having perhaps lost the equity already invested in the building but possibly still living in an apartment where he was once a regulated renter -- might well find a new market-rate rent to be higher than the former maintenance charge he was paying unless new rules say otherwise.
The Council of New York Cooperatives, an advocacy organization for co-ops and condominiums, takes the position that the calculations should be based on the old regulated rents updated for normal increases and vacancy allowances. Alternatively, the council would find it acceptable to have rents set at the level of the maintenance charges in the co-op before reversion. The council's membership consists of 1,939 properties with 275,000 apartments, the overwhelming majority converted from rentals. About 60 percent of the units are owner-occupied. About half the apartments are in Manhattan.
THE council argues that a market-rate standard for rents after deconversion provides too much incentive for mortgage lenders to foreclose rather than negotiate in troubled, overfinanced co-ops. The council is concerned not only about banks but also about private lenders or sponsors who, it contends, would be tempted to take over the underlying financing in buildings with low levels of owner occupancy.
"I've been knee deep in these troubles for seven years now," said Stuart M. Saft, chairman of the council. "At countless meetings in basements I've listened to shareholders who were in tears over the possibility of financial ruin." The meetings have involved buildings large and small in moderate-income neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens where conversions took place at the height of the market.
But, is tinkering with the financial system the proper way to handle these problems? Some lawyers in the co-op field say that the State Attorney General's office should more forcefully use its power of review over co-op conversion offering plans to assure that their essential elements are clearly set forth, rather than masked in boilerplate and legalese. Such critical matters as the physical condition of the building, the background of the sponsors as housing investors or managers and the budget projection for the next few years could be summarized and prominently featured in offerings, they maintain.
In the 70's, when noneviction conversions began while Louis B. Lefkowitz was Attorney General, the office used court-granted powers to inquire into the contents of offerings. It inspected buildings and evaluated the risks in plans. Plans that included excessive financing were rarely "accepted for filing," which permits sales to start.
When plans seemed to be an egregiously bad deal for buyers, an aggressive review office dealt directly, though privately, with sponsors, letting them know that these deficiencies would have to be prominently made known in the offering plan. That usually led to an amended plan before sales began.
Lacking such warnings, and influenced by the advancing sales market of the 80's, moderate-income people purchased apartments without a clear idea of the risks or the eventual fiscal requirements of their buildings. Ultimately, the sales market fell, and many sponsors could not overcome the shortfall between the regulated rents they were receiving from nonpurchasing tenants and the maintenance payments due to the co-op.
Many lenders ultimately "wrote down" their building loans to avoid foreclosures. These have been rare. Some knowledgeable people say there have been 10 foreclosures, others say five.
If the banking industry changes the method it uses to evaluate loans, the biggest risk to co-op shareholders will come in the refinancing of existing loans, financial intermediaries say.
"There are probably billions of dollars of loans outstanding on co-ops in the metropolitan area -- 5-year, 10-year, 15-year deals," said Kevin P. Maloney, the principal in Regional Appraisal Associates, which appraises buildings for co-ops seeking refinancing of underlying mortgages. "Banks will have to write down the value of hundreds of millions dollars of mortgages in an instant if D.H.C.R. uses any other formula than market-rate rents."
Dean Yep, chairman of the Appraisal Advisory Group, which appraised 160 West 77th Street for the National Cooperative Bank, said that the appraisal would have justified the refinancing of only 70 to 80 percent of the outstanding balance of the co-op loan if it had been based on shareholder-held apartments going back to a regulated rent.
Sheldon Gartenstein, vice president of the New York office of the bank, said that if rent-regulated rents had been applied to underwriting standards for the sold apartments, "I doubt whether we would have been able to refinance more than $600,000 of the $1.1 million that the co-op needed."
In general, the greater the outstanding loan amount, the more dramatic the negative impact on refinancing if regulated rent schedules must be used for evaluating shareholder-held apartments, Mr. Gartenstein said.
"The biggest impact would be in the strongest market areas -- Manhattan's Upper West Side, Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope, Forest Hills in Queens and Riverdale," he said. In those locations, high market rental values allow banks to refinance loans at existing levels.
Officials in the rent office of the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal said that the proposed regulations were still under internal review. They said there would be public hearings on the rules before they were promulgated, but they could not give a timetable.

HEADLINE: ENVIRONMENT;
Reviving Polluted 'Brown Fields' for New Industrial Use

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
Hundreds of urban acres that now lie dormant in Jersey City and Perth Amboy will soon be crawling with environmental engineers and local residents hoping to revitalize what heavy industry has spoiled.
They are plots once held by the American Smelting and Refining Company, Anaconda Copper Works, National Lead and other companies that have vacated what were vibrant industrial hubs, leaving vacant buildings, unknown contaminants and legal fears for developers who might consider building there. 
 The new activity is to be financed by $200,000 grants for each city from the Environmental Protection Agency, which has given 113 cities similar grants over the last three years as part of its "brown fields" pilot revitalization program. The money is used to institute studies of sites thought to be contaminated by heavy metals, acids and poisons, and to set up community awareness programs and train residents in dealing with environmental hazards.
The main goal is to attract investment by freeing developers from the environmental uncertainty and potential liability that can come from reusing these sites.
While the E.P.A. has not traditionally been in the business of seeding what are essentially development projects, this approach has turned around many polluted blocks, not only decontaminating what have been uninhabitable eyesores for decades but also fueling job growth and tax revenue. After only three years of trials, its successes have led to legislation now before the Senate that would turn the pilot into a permanent Federally financed program.
"While this is only $200,000, it is a catalyst to move things in areas that have long been abandoned," said Jeanne M. Fox, the E.P.A. administrator overseeing New Jersey's efforts. "Leveraged with local, state and private investment, this has brought jobs, tax revenue and hope back to communities all across the United States."
Ms. Fox noted that Cleveland, one of the first cities to receive a grant, had been able to attract $4.5 million in new private investment on such sites, created 170 new jobs and increased local payroll taxes by a million dollars.
The programs, locally controlled but overseen by the E.P.A., have also led to inventive new ways of dealing with urban pollutants and involving residents in the clean-up process. In Trenton, city contractors joined neighbors of a defunct felt-tip marker business in cultivating mustard plants at the site. The plants have leeched so much lead out of the soil that some tracts can now be used again.
Perth Amboy's Mayor, Joseph Vas, hopes to put similar ideas to use in his city, a major industrial center until the late 1960's. Noting that the city's 50,000 residents lost nearly 5,000 jobs to factory closings from 1976 to 1989, he said, "These companies abandoned their properties and left us with 677 acres that are now unusable because we don't know what pollutants might be in them."
The unused property has cost the city thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in potential tax revenue, he said, adding, "The grant will help us reclaim those properties, improving our economy while protecting our residents from whatever contamination might exist."
Like Newark, Camden and Trenton, the state's earlier brown-field locations, Perth Amboy and Jersey City plan to use the money to create inventories of polluted sites, conduct studies of how to clean them up and develop an insurance program to cover whatever liability may exist for those redeveloping them. They will also train some residents to help remove contaminants.
Enticing companies to return these old sites to commercial use also helps keep undeveloped land elsewhere from being turned over to industry, a benefit not lost on Federal officials. The Clinton Administration wants to add $50 million for the program next year to the current $37 million.
There is also a move under way to make the brown-field initiative a long-term program. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg has sponsored a bill that would set up a $75 million-a-year Federal fund to broaden the program. Among other things, it would reduce potential liability for buyers of contaminated properties and make $45 million in low-interest available each year to clean up brown-field properties.
"This is a public-private partnership that gets rid of the red tape and cleans up pollution," said Jeff Whelan, a spokesman for Senator Lautenberg. "Everyone agrees that it is good for jobs, the environment and urban revitalization. And we want to keep the ball rolling."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
Send Money, Court Says; Bootstraps Aren't Enough

BYLINE: By Brett Pulley; Brett Pulley reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Often when political conservatives are trying to show that we live in a society in which everyone has a fair chance, they love to trot out examples of people who defied the odds to achieve enormous success. There is the black kid who grew up fatherless and dirt poor in rural Georgia but went on to become a Supreme Court justice. Or the Bronx native and son of immigrant parents who rose to lead the country's armed forces.
But the problem with these boot-strap analogies is that they are too easily -- and too often -- used as excuses to avoid facing the realities of inequality that still permeate our lives. The truth is that people like Clarence Thomas and Colin Powell are extraordinary rarities. Their lives do not fairly represent what is likely to happen to most children who come from similar backgrounds. 
 As last week's New Jersey Supreme Court ruling on financing for education pointed out, the fact is, a child growing up in the state's poor cities in no way has the same chance at educational success that his or her counterpart growing up in a financially stable neighborhood has.
The state's 28 most impoverished school districts, the court ruling said, are islands of racial and economic isolation. Most students who attend the poorest schools are black or Hispanic, and in fact, only a small percentage of black and Hispanic children in the state have the privilege of going to school at any of the wealthier public schools.
According to a study cited in the court ruling, 53.7 percent of black children and 43.4 percent of Hispanic children attend schools with minority populations greater than 90 percent. However, when it comes to majority-white schools, only 26.6 percent of the student body at those schools is black, and only 27.3 percent is Hispanic.
"New Jersey has the fourth most racially segregated school system in the nation," the court's decision said.
At those urban schools, the barriers to receiving a quality education are enormous. Books are tattered, buildings are dilapidated, and navigating the social ills that surround and infiltrate the school walls are as challenging as any curriculum plan ever could be.
In devising her core curriculum standards, which stipulate that all New Jersey children receive the same basic level of education, Governor Whitman took a good first step toward equalizing the opportunities for the children of her state.
But by not providing the money to implement those standards fully in the schools that need them, the Governor's failed proposal was tantamount to telling the children in those struggling districts that if they want to succeed and compete with their wealthier counterparts, then they must do it with old textbooks, inferior equipment and crumbling facilities. You can make it, her plan said to those children in urban schools. But you must defy the odds. You must be extraordinary.
Well, the Supreme Court did not go for it. It ruled that simply giving underachieving schools guidelines to help them improve is not enough. The state must also give them more money to put the recommended guidelines to work and, more specifically, to create true parity between the rich and the poor districts.
"If all students are expected to achieve the same goals, educational resources should place them all at the same starting line," Associate Justice Alan Handler wrote in the decision.
But the court also recognized that simply throwing money at the problem will not solve it, either. The ruling requires the state to conduct a more thorough analysis of exactly what is needed to implement the core curriculum standards, and to take steps to insure that the additional money is not wasted but goes directly toward meeting the curriculum standards. Moreover, the court found that the Governor's plan also failed to address the "inadequacies of facilities" in the state's urban districts, thus requiring that more future resources be applied to things like school buildings, libraries, computer labs and athletic facilities.
After 27 years of debating the issue of parity between rich and poor schools, the state will now be forced by the court (and monitored by the court) to make sure it does everything in its power to help the 285,000 students who attend the poorer school districts. Race and politics no longer matter. Isolated bootstrap stories will no longer do. As Craig Stanley, the Democratic assemblyman from Irvington who opposed Governor Whitman's plan, said the other day: "This is a victory for students."
The problems in the areas where these schools exist are complex and numerous. Improving the schools won't instantly end crime, drug abuse, poor health or inadequate housing, but good education standards, modern schools and money to pay for it all are a good place to start.

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
Downtown Via Dublin

BYLINE: By ANNE SEIDLITZ 

 BODY:
ON a recent Sunday afternoon, Frank McCourt stood on a stage at the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center on Suffolk Street, reading from "Angela's Ashes," the Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir of his wretched, poverty-stricken childhood in Limerick. Behind him was the set for "Flaherty's Widow," a play by another Irishman, the acclaimed young novelist Colum McCann, just finishing a successful run at the resident Daedalus Theater Company.
Directly opposite the Soto center, Eamon O'Leary; his brother, Colm, Anto Howard and Karl Geary, all Dublin-born, toiled away painting and hammering, in a rush to get their Dublin Bookseller's Company, a combination theater, bookshop and cafe, in shape for its opening next month. Around the corner, on Stanton Street, Arlene Grocery, the club owned by Shane Doyle, also from Dublin, was gearing up for another night of new music, Irish and otherwise. 
 Irish culture is thriving on the Lower East Side.
"For the first three years I was here, in the late 80's, I don't think I saw one Irish person in the neighborhood, except for Shane Doyle," said Mr. Geary, who also owns the Scratcher, a pub on East Fifth Street, and the Lab, a music lounge on St. Mark's Place. "But then when Shane and I opened Cafe Sine in 1990, this whole crew of Irish people started coming out of the woodwork. For the first time, there was a center of activity belonging to the Irish, someplace where people could feel comfortable."
Immigration experts estimate that a decade ago, approximately 75,000 undocumented Irish lived in New York. Many had come here to escape a severely depressed economy in Ireland. Most were unable to gain legal status because, at the time, United States immigration laws restricted the number of visas going to the Irish.
The Irish-American political and legal circles in New York City rallied around new immigrants, successfully lobbying Washington for changes in the laws. A major result of their efforts was the 1990 Immigration Act, and its Diversity Program, which opened the doors to immigrants from many more countries.
Part of the Diversity Program was the Morrison visas, sponsored by Bruce Morrison when he was a United States Representative from Connecticut. These 54,000 visas were set aside for the Irish between 1991 and 1994 and were awarded by lottery. The Morrison visas, and before them the Donnelly visas, created a new pattern of Irish immigration in the first half of this decade. Since 1995, though, newer laws have blocked many would-be Irish immigrants to the United States.
"For the Irish, the most likely way to come over now would be reunifying a family, with somebody who's here already," said Frank Vardy of the City Planning Office. "But the Irish don't really have that connection because the immigration chain was broken for them after the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act, which abolished quotas favoring European immigrants."
The new immigrant is less likely to gravitate to neighborhoods established by the Irish in earlier decades. While previous generations headed straight to enclaves like Norwood and Woodlawn in the Bronx or Woodside in Queens and took jobs as construction workers or nannies, the recent group is younger and better educated and has a global sensibility that makes more unconventional destinations in the city, like lower Mahattan, especially appealing.
"The Irish are perhaps more intrepid than any other culture I know," said Colum McCann. "Whereas other people go and travel for two weeks, two months or maybe a year, the Irish go and stay. And now there's no specific need to be integrated into an Irish immigrant community. If you go down to the Lower East Side, you'll see that those Irish people will mix quite well with the Hispanic communities down there. You've got a newer, younger and more confident Irish population which feels comfortable in any area they find themselves."
Paul Finnegan, the executive director of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center, sees the growth of pubs downtown as a sign of the newfound sense of community.
"We're socialized in pubs," Mr. Finnegan said. "It's not about consuming alcohol. It's a social tradition in Ireland. To open a pub for an Irish person is really an indication that there's a community to work with, and now there are several pubs in the East Village and Lower East Side. That's a good indication that there's a strong community in those areas."
Most young immigrants working in Irish-owned establishments like St. Dymphna's restaurant on St. Mark's Place and the Scratcher on East Fifth Street are contributing to the art, film and music scenes in the city. Karl Geary has acted in several feature films including "Gold in the Streets," about the first year for a group of Irish newcomers to Manhattan. Shot in New York and Dublin, it is scheduled for release in the fall. His brother Mark works at the Scratcher, and is also a singer-songwriter with a loyal following, who is starting to catch the attention of music-industry people.
"If I open my mouth in Dublin, you can spot my working-class accent a mile off," Mark Geary says. "Here it doesn't seem to matter. Back home it as for a different kind of person -- a person who came from money, who could get a loan off his father -- to be creative, to have the gumption to get up and play music or be a partner in a really successful club at the age of 21. We were nobodies in Dublin. We were just a couple off 'Billy's kids.' "
The chef at St. Dymphna's, Conor Foran, is an actor with a leading role in the recently completed feature film, "Sheetrock," about Irish immigrant construction workers in New York. A waitress there, Ruth O'Sullivan, is training as an amateur boxer, and a bartender at Scratcher, Helen James, is a stop-motion animator and a textile designer.
The word on the street is that the fear of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, so prevalent in the 80's, has mostly disappeared, leading to a more visible Irish presence downtown. Though many social, economic and religious and economic barriers that once shackled young people in Ireland are also loosening, most who have decided to settle in New York say it is because the city still offers more creative opportunities.
"New York is as hard a city as any," Karl Geary says, "but it's a very liberating thing to come to New York as well. Once you get here, all the rules change, and you're really going along on your own merit. Your background isn't very important here, and the feeling is that you can really reinvent yourself so many times. If you fail, people aren't going to say 'I told you so.' They're going to ask you what you're going to do next."

HEADLINE: U.S. Hasn't Stopped Assaulting Other Cultures

 BODY:

To the Editor:
You suggest (Week in Review, May 11) that it has become harder to hold America responsible for assaults on cultures elsewhere in the world. Perhaps you should review recent news: 
 The United States wins a ruling in the World Trade Organization and forces Europe to accept American beef grown with hormones, although many European consumers are worried in the wake of mad cow disease. We hope the ruling will set a precedent for pushing other genetically engineered products on world markets despite local opposition.
With the support of the United States Embassy, a delegation of American investment bankers and mining executives arrives in Zaire to sign contracts with the rebel leader Laurent Kabila, although human rights officials charge his forces with atrocities against refugees.
American tobacco companies expand in Asia, with the support of American diplomacy. We force Thailand to repeal smoking regulations.
We force countries to open their markets to American agricultural exports. While this benefits some consumers, it ruins an impoverished countryside, accelerates migration to overcrowded slums and destroys food self-sufficiency just when global climate disturbance should prompt caution.
Although we preach globalism, we don't hesitate to impose our foreign policy on reluctant allies and trading partners. We threaten foreign companies that deal with Cuba and prolong the embargo of food and medicine to Iraq long after the U.N. has approved shipments, so that we can punish helpless civilians for their rulers.
You believe it is only local elites that oppose these policies, and that the rest of humanity welcomes them as a wave of democratic progress. In fact the elites from Lima to Bangalore are precisely our allies, eager to get on the Web, shop at Neiman Marcus and draw on our expertise in advertising, public relations and counterterrorism.
If we looked into the abyss, the true horror would be our own actions, not those of people who live often courageously in nearly impossible circumstances. Rather than make our ugliness universal, can we not share the essence of the American dream by ourselves learning finally to respect those who still believe in justice?

HEADLINE: When the Saviors Are Seen as Sinners

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
WHEN officers from a joint New York City Police Department-Federal anti-drug task force set up shop in Washington Heights and Inwood last September, The Bridge Leader, a popular local newspaper, was quick to offer support. The paper, which is published twice a month, contained articles praising the police effort, and each issue featured a box, in English and Spanish, on how to report drug activities, including the task force's special telephone number, 439-NARC.
Although drug-related and other crimes have declined significantly in the area since September, The Bridge Leader's support for the police ended abruptly with the April 6 shooting death of Kevin Cedeno, 16, of Washington Heights, by Officer Anthony Pellegrini of the 33d Precinct. Police officials said another officer had reported that Mr. Cedeno was shot as he charged at him. The youth died from a single wound to the back. An investigation by the District Attorney is continuing. 
 The Bridge Leader's owner, Jessica Brockington Cole, withdrew the phone number information from the April 9 issue. "Under the circumstances, there was so much pain attached to it that it was easier to pull it out than to run it," she said. The paper's current issue has an article with instructions on how to file a report of police misconduct. It includes the telephone number of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, the city agency that monitors police abuse.
"It's a really tough situation," Ms. Brockington Cole said. "We're living in a war zone with both sides coming at us with arms. We need the police so badly. But we also need to let them know the community needs them to be professional, whether they're dealing with an English-speaking person like myself or someone who doesn't speak the language at all."
Her ambivalence is shared by many residents and local advocates in northern Manhattan, an area long plagued by drugs and violence. While they welcome the reduction in crime locally and citywide, they are also angered by aggressive police tactics. With the same zeal with which they once helped the police to open doors in the community, they are demanding that officers strike a better balance between enforcing the law and respecting civil rights.
"This is not Vietnam," said Jose Pagan, chairman of the economic development committee of Community Board 11 in East Harlem. "You don't have to destroy these neighborhoods to save them."
It is a demand, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said, that has not been lost on him since he assumed command a year ago. "I came to the Police Department with the belief that we needed to fix this," he said in an interview last week. "That's the reason why the first thing I did was the C.P.R. strategy."
C.P.R., for courtesy, professionalism and respect, involves not only teaching officers to be sensitive in their dealings with the public, including members of hundreds of different racial and ethnic groups, but also evaluating them and their commanders on the number of complaints of offensive language, discourtesy, abuse of authority and the use of force.
"The reason that I put C.P.R. as a crime strategy is because crime strategies hold people accountable for what they do," the Commissioner said. "This is now becoming a measurable career-enhancing or career-hurting event." He also stressed the department's well-publicized use of undercover officer to check compliance with C.P.R.
"We put together members of the community who are very often on the opposite side of the issues and asked them to tell us what the community wanted," Mr. Safir continued. The answer, he said, was more officers on the street, better police treatment and a force that reflects more accurately the community it serves.
Increasing the number of officers has been an ongoing priority of the department, which has added 7,000 to its ranks since 1993, bringing the total to 38,000. And using a crime-reduction strategy that focuses on the city's most troubled areas with things like drug sweeps of apartment buildings, Commissioner Safir and his predecessor, William J. Bratton, have achieved what eluded previous administrations. In four years, major crimes like murder, rape and robbery have decreased citywide by nearly 40 percent.
A poll conducted in March by The New York Times showed that 54 percent of city residents think the police are doing an excellent or a good job, up from 48 percent in 1994. Many residents, especially the elderly say that the drop in crime has brought them a new sense of liberty and that they would rather live with the inconvenience of police searches than in fear of drug dealers.
"I have no problem with police officers stopping me to question me," said Sander Dulitz, a longtime resident of Washington Heights and chairman of Community Board 12 in Washington Heights and Inwood. "This community should be a community where people can walk safely on the streets. Commissioner Safir should be commended for the C.P.R. program. This is what the community deserves from the department."
Councilman Stanley E. Michels agrees. "You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs," he said.
But in their frequent touting of the drop in crime since 1993 -- and the concurrent rise in support for the Giuliani administration -- the Mayor and Commissioner Safir rarely mention another less-flattering statistic: that complaints of police misconduct have risen by 56 percent citywide in the past four years.
Community and civil rights advocates say the increase is more pronounced in predominantly minority neighborhoods like Washington Heights, Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant and East New York in Brooklyn and parts of the Bronx.
Analysis based on statistics provided by the Civilian Complaint Review Board showed that in Manhattan north of 59th Street, crime went down 39 percent there in the last four years, but the number of complaints of police misconduct rose by 38 percent, to 459 in 1996 from 330 in 1993. In contrast, while crime decreased by 38 percent south of 59th Street, complaints against the police fell only by 8 percent, to 390 in 1996 from 359 in 1993.
Commissioner Safir and other police officials played down the significance of the increase in complaints, arguing that aggressive law-enforcement tactics are bound to ruffle the feathers of some people, especially criminals.
But at community board meetings and other public forums in the past few months, anger has surged as people who live and work in upper Manhattan tell of their experiences with the police, especially undercover officers.
Her voice faltering, Gwendolyn Barton, who works as a pharmacist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, recalled the Sunday morning in February when, she said, a police officer whom she had gone to the 34th Precinct station house to complain about screamed racial epithets at her 16-year-old daughter. Ms. Barton said that earlier, the officer had used obscenities when Ms. Barton complained that she had received two unwarranted traffic summonses, for running a red light and failing to wear a seat belt.
Ms. Barton, who is black, said, the officer, who was white, told her daughter outside the station house, "We can't give no nigger no break," then stormed inside and threatened her with arrest.
"I felt so humiliated and so helpless in front of my daughter," she said, adding that she filed a formal complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
A board spokesman, Sherman Jackson, said state law prevents the board from disclosing its records publicly, but the Deputy Police Commissioner for Public Information, Marilyn Mode, said that once a case has been decided, the records concerning it are public.

'Wrong Guy': An Injured Man Sues the City After a Search
 Although it has been seven months since doctors removed 15 stitches from the head of Melvin Bullock, a Harlem cook, Mr. Bullock says the wound still pains him. He said a group of plainclothes officers from the Manhattan North Narcotics Division surrounded him late one afternoon last October as he stood in front of a building on 117th Street near First Avenue in East Harlem where he kept a pigeon coop. As the officers shoved him against the wall at gunpoint, Mr. Bullock said, he asked them why they were searching him. He said one officer let out a string of obscenities, ordered him to kneel on the ground and began to pistol-whip him. Mr. Bullock said the assault did not stop even when a sergeant was told over his service radio that the officers had "thewrong guy."
"As I was bleeding like a slaughtered hog, they tried to put handcuffs on me, took my pants down on the street and strip-searched me," Mr. Bullock said.
Before leaving, an officer wrote him a summons for disorderly conduct. But Mr. Bullock's lawyer, Earl S. Ward, who is also a member of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, said that a judge had dismissed the summons in December and that Mr. Bullock was suing the city for $2 million in damages.
A few blocks from where the incident involving Mr. Bullock occurred, Bishop S. N. Snipes, a minister at the House of Prayer Acts of the Apostles, sat recently and described the Sunday afternoon in late April when he and his family called for help to subdue an emotionally disturbed son. Officers from the 25th Precinct arrived with emergency medical workers, Mr. Snipes said, and refused to take the man to the hospital requested by the family. A melee ensued, he said, in which police officers punched him, threw his daughter against a squad car and gave another son a summons for disorderly conduct.
"The situation was already calm when they got here," said Mr. Snipes, who for the past 20 years has been well known in Harlem for working with the police. "The officers did not want to take my son to the hospital we wanted. When we insisted, they radioed for help, and 40 officers showed up here like they were going to a drug bust."
And there are those who, although not injured or abused, say the police have nevertheless violated their civil liberties.
A home care attendant, Carlos Feliz, said the police frequently chase residents of his Manhattan Valley block away from the sidewalk in front of their buildings. "I can understand why they want to chase drug dealers," Mr. Feliz said. "But why everybody? Where are we supposed to go? We live here."
Mr. Ward, the lawyer and Civilian Complaint Review Board member, said he was stopped by two plainclothes officers three weeks ago while driving in Harlem with his brother in their mother's gray-black 1993 Honda. "They opened the door and asked for our identifications," Mr. Ward said. "They became angry when I asked them for a reason. One of the officers said: 'You're nervous. Step out.' "
Mr. Ward said the officers had frisked him and searched his car, then let him go only after he revealed his board affiliation. The officers then told him they were looking for a robber in a black car, he said.
Moises Perez, executive director of Alianza Dominicana, the largest human services and community development agency serving the city's Dominican residents, said two social workers from an agency home-care program were detained recently while visiting a client's apartment in Washington Heights when the police took over the block, commando-style, looking for drug dealers.
"They froze the block," Mr. Perez said. "No one could come in or out. There were loads of police everywhere with their guns drawn. They took photographs of everybody in the area, innocent or guilty, and then the undercover officer came to identify the drug dealers they were looking for. It's never going to be comfortable when you are walking down the street and suddenly you are surrounded by police with their guns drawn. It's a traumatic experience, whether the drug dealers do that to you or the police."
Mr. Perez said the police were outraged when he raised the issue with representatives from the 33d and 34th Precincts during a regular meeting his agency has with precinct officials and community leaders.
"They said, 'It's not an important right you are giving up,' " Mr. Perez said. " 'We're making your community safer.' There is a group of police officers out there who believe that in order to do their job effectively, they must violate everybody's civil rights."
While acknowledging that the police have sometimes been aggressive as they searched neighborhoods and individual buildings for drug dealers, the department's Chief of Patrol, Wilbur L. Chapman, denied freezing the whole block at one time.
 
Civil Liberties vs. Safety; Reducing Crime, Not Respect
 The executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, Norman Siegel, said it is a violation of people's civil liberties to chase them from sidewalks or stop them for identification without reasonable suspicion that a criminal activity was about to take place.
"The police have done a very good job in reducing crime," Mr. Siegel said. "Now they need to learn to treat the people with respect."
Often, those who complain in public meetings of police misconduct also say their complaints effectively fall on deaf ears. Precinct representatives, they say, ask them: "Are you sure you didn't break the law?" or "Are you sure it's officers from this precinct?" or "Did you get their names?"
Many also say officers become more hostile when they are asked for identification or accused of rude behavior.
Adding to the confusion in many upper Manhattan neighborhoods are the numerous undercover units working in the area. Residents say they often mistake approaching undercover officers for criminals trying to victimize them and react in a way that can antagonize the police. They also say undercover officers often refuse to divulge their identities when asked, which makes it harder to substantiate complaints against them.
Mr. Bullock said the sergeant in charge of the officers who beat him refused to give his name, saying only, "What for?" As a result, Mr. Bullock said, he could complain only about the officer who signed his summons.
The police -- from beat officers to Chief Chapman -- say much of upper Manhattan remained a wholesale supermarket for cocaine and crack, defying countless attempts to clean it up. Officials point to old departmental rules that prevented uniformed beat officers from making drug arrests, thus encouraging the spread of drug sales and use.
That changed during the Giuliani administration. Officers can now make drug arrests, Chief Chapman said. And the department has also adopted a proactive stand that gives officers discretion to take action, with reasonable cause, before a crime is committed.
 
Complaints Decline, But Distrust Remains
 These days, many officers working in upper Manhattan say they view themselves as liberators who rescued the neighborhood from the reign of terror imposed by drug dealers.
Last week, walking past sunbathers near Montefiore Park, east of Broadway between 136th and 137th Streets, Chief Chapman, who began his 28-year career as a beat officer in the area, pointed proudly to his department's accomplishments.
"A few years ago, these blocks and the park were crowded with drug dealers," he said. "You couldn't sit around here at all."
Gone, too, were the drunks who had littered hallways and the deafening music that kept everyone awake.
But civil rights advocates and other residents, who champion the area's diversity and vibrancy, say that while they welcome the increased safety, it must not come at the expense of individual freedom. "What distinguishes us from a totalitarian society is that we address social problems with a commitment to protect people's constitutional and human rights, said Richard Perez, the national coordinator for the National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights, which works closely with local groups. "If we abandon that, we're on the road to totalitarianism. There was no street crime in Nazi Germany, and Mussolini made the trains run on time."
There is evidence that Commissioner Safir's C.P.R. strategy is slowly making a difference. Since it began last fall, complaints against the police citywide have decreased slightly, for the first time since 1992. Although the decline was only 2 percent between 1995 and 1996, the Civilian Complaint Review Board reports a more encouraging 17 percent decrease in complaints in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 1996.
But distrust remains. When Shirley Colon was found dead on a sidewalk of the Clinton Houses at 109th Street and Lexington Avenue last month, word spread rapidly that the police had pushed her from an 18-story building. The police said they had found a suicide note on her body, but Ms. Colon's friends still demonstrated outside the 23d Precinct station house. The Medical Examiner later ruled the death a suicide.
Residents of Harlem, especially, say that more than Commissioner Safir's C.P.R. strategy is needed if they are to recover totally from the feeling of police betrayal stirred up by the recent corruption scandal at the 30th Precinct. They repeatedly point to former Sgt. Kevin Nannery's guilty plea to charges of violating civil rights and perjury.
"When people brought up drug locations at the precinct and in community meetings, the commander always told them to tell Sergeant Nannery," said Vicky Gholson, who lives in Harlem. "He used to visit these people in their homes. How can the people trust the police?"

How to Complain
WITH more than 80 investigators and a $5.2 million budget, the Civilian Complaint Review Board is an independent city agency whose job is to monitor police misconduct.
Its role, said Florence Finkle, the deputy executive director in charge of investigations for the board, is to look into complaints of force, abuse of authority, discourtesy and offensive language. If the complaints are substantiated and warrant disciplinary action, it recommends such action to the Police Commissioner.
In 1995, according to C.C.R.B. reports, a total of 5,689 complaints were filed with the board. The New York Civil Liberties Union found that the board substantiated 269 complaints, although many may have been filed in earlier years. The large difference between the numbers of complaints filed and substantiated has led civil rights advocates to criticize the board for lackluster leadership and inaction.
"It's a little league team on a major league field," said Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition. "They're not hitting and they're not scoring."
Police officials, though, say the gap results from the large number of false complaints filed with the board.
Even if the review board does find that a complaint has merit, the Police Commissioner does not decide on what action, if any, to take until after a departmental trial. In 1995, 18 were held, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union, and seven officers were found guilty of misconduct.
Among the actions a commissioner can order against an officer found guilty, Ms. Finkle said, are retraining, loss of vacation days, reassignment, probation, suspension and dismissal.
Allegations of criminal wrongdoing by police officers, she added, are investigated by the District Attorney.
Ms. Finkle and other board officials and civil rights advocates outlined the proper steps to take if you feel you have been the victim of police misconduct:
1.) Get the officer's name, badge number and precinct. If not available, remember a physical description.
2.) If there are witnesses, try to get their names, addresses and telephone numbers.
3.) Document any evidence. If you are injured, have a photograph taken of your injuries. Ditto if your property is damaged.
4.) Report the incident to the board as soon as possible.
Reports may be made in person at the board, 40 Rector Street in lower Manhattan, between 8:30 A.M. and 9:30 P.M., Monday through Friday, or by calling 1-800-341-CCRB (341-2272) around the clock.
The board spokesman, Sherman Jackson, said complaint forms are also being prepared for circulation on the Internet.
Many civil rights organizations will also assist those with complaints against the police. Among them are the New York Civil Liberties Union (212-382-0557) and the New York Civil Rights Coalition (212-563-5636). JANE H. LII

U.S. Boom Plays Big In Politics Abroad

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
TONY and Cherie Blair abandoned their official car for a "Westminster walkabout" on their way to the Opening of Parliament last week, and The London Times approvingly noted the American inspiration of such politics, especially the way Mrs. Blair's scarf fell, like Hillary Clinton's, "with a length hanging down from the left shoulder."
Not to be outdone by the new British Prime Minister, President Jacques Chirac last week took a leaf from the Clinton political manual by departing for China with 55 leading French industrialists on a sell-France mission that has danced lightly over human-rights issues. With a parliamentary election just a week away, Mr. Chirac was betting that the president-as-global-salesman (as opposed to exalted statesman) is now a winning image even in France. 
 Whether it is sartorial style or commercial substance, the impact of America's sustained economic vibrancy, and the "whatever works" President identified with it, is now widely felt. From Canada through Europe to Japan, big government is out of fashion. The political left is lurching toward the center. And growth has assumed the status of a fully fledged political ideology, the foundation of electoral success.
The first thing Mr. Blair did was to grant control of monetary policy to the independent Bank of England, an extraordinary step for the leader of the British left, and one of the first things he made clear was that "high and stable levels of economic growth" would be a priority. The moves echoed Mr. Clinton's message on taking office in 1993 that he would not interfere with the Federal Reserve or be a big spender.
 
Global Shift
 A huge political shift is under way. It may be radical, as in Britain, faltering, as in France and Germany, or tinged, as in Canada, with dread of American economic Darwinism. But the sheer durability and extent of America's economic expansion -- a soaring Wall Street, inflation at 3 percent, joblessness under 5 percent, and only a brief blip in upward growth since 1982 -- has imparted what seems to be the single strongest political message of the post-cold war decade.
That message is: the areas where the state does things better than the market are extremely limited; fiscal discipline can be combined with strong growth and high employment if the right conditions for entrepreneurship are created, and successful politics in the absence of ideological enemies or pressing security threats amounts to the pragmatism of learning these lessons combined with sharp marketing -- exemplified by the Blairs' stroll and that billowing scarf.
Dissension remains. The best balance between state and market is still widely discussed, a debate that reflects the differing cultural traditions in America, Europe and Japan. American domination naturally meets resentment. Mr. Chirac, in China, pointedly embraces a "multi-polar" world, code for one not dominated by the United States. The Chinese applaud him.
But in a post-ideological and Webbed world, the insistent fact that America works seems, for now, hard to resist.
"I am struck when I travel by the way that Bill Gates of Microsoft and Andy Grove of Intel have become international heroes," said Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "They are seen as representing an entrepreneurial renaissance that has, at the same time, placed Clinton's America in the vanguard of international technology and created millions of jobs."
The age of Gates-Groveism is reinforced by the fact that their medium is their message: the technology that is linking and changing the world carries its own political and economic impact, reducing politicians' room for maneuver.
In Japan, once a bastion of regulation, it is now almost universally accepted that government interference in the economy is unhelpful. Parliamentary campaigning last fall was dominated by candidates calling for a freer economy, for in Japan the perception is strong that America leads in new technologies because of its flexible capital markets and Clintonian pragmatism.
In Canada, the central policy of the Liberal government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien has been deficit reduction; next budget year, for the first time in nearly three decades, the government may not need to borrow any money at all. Now ministers focus on when to cut taxes and by how much, and debate in the campaign for June 2 elections turns on not whether to shrink government but by how much.
 
Apolitical Revolution

At the depressed heart of the welfare state, in France, change is less clear cut and more contested. Nonetheless, amid coded signals and continuing taboos over endorsing "Anglo-Saxon" economic models, Mr. Chirac's Gaullist party and other members of his right-of-center coalition have been making clear that they believe the age of the government "fonctionnaire" is over. Jean Arthuis, the Finance Minister, went so far last week as to declare that he was delighted that "the welfare state is finished," adding that "too much state kills the state." In a country where the state's role as guarantor of welfare, engine of industry and nexus of society has long been assumed, and where the number of functionaries has risen to 5.5 million from 4.4 million during the past 15 years, such a statement was revolutionary in its audacity. But it is no longer blasphemy.
In response, France's Socialists talk about being a modern party and providing seed capital to small and medium-sized industry. But the party's discourse is still marked by a brand of socialism that promises 350,000 new state-sector jobs to fight unemployment of 12.8 percent. So far this message seems to have left voters unconvinced, and thus Mr. Chirac's government is favored to win the election despite its deep unpopularity during the past two years.
One interesting aspects of the campaign is the desire expressed in many quarters for an apolitical but effective Prime Minister; voters often voice a preference for Christian Blanc, the blunt, hard-driving, telegenic government employee who has wrested state-owned Air France from disaster and prepared it for privatization.
Mr. Blanc was a socialist, but now says, "I don't give a damn about ideology -- all I care about is effectiveness." He says he still values socialism's emphasis on human dignity, solidarity, the general interest and the need to fight injustice. But economic socialism is bunk.
The words could have come from Mr. Blair, who has not questioned Margaret Thatcher's sweeping privatizations but has put improvements in education and health care at the heart of his program. He has also proposed a "welfare-to-work program" financed by a levy on "the excess profits of the privatized utilities." The very notion of "excess profits" seems unthinkable in America.
It is in such matters where the critical test of the American-led global political revolution may lie. Without genuine sensitivity toward those on the wrong end of the changes, the seeds of upheaval could be planted.
The end of the last century brought a similarly sweeping revolution -- the cars, trains and industries that made nations whole and brought the masses closer to political life. Few imagined then how those trends would be exploited by fascists and Communists, leading to tens of millions of deaths. The American-led shift in civilization is full of promise; but its ultimate consequences remain unclear.

HEADLINE: Fitting In;
Another Kind of Middle-Class Squeeze

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
KARL MARX preached it. Last week, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York proclaimed it: Society's have-nots have finally converged with most of the haves into a single class.
Addressing a paramount concern of many New York City apartment dwellers, the Governor declared, "My plan to save rent control will insure that every middle-class tenant has the right to remain in their apartment for the rest of their lives if they choose." 
 And how did the Governor define middle-class tenants? As any household making up to $175,000 a year. That places a mere 1 percent of tenants at the mercy of the marketplace, protecting the other 99 percent as solid members of the middle class.
If this sounds more like Groucho than Karl, it's because in America the class struggle has meant trying to fit everyone into the middle. The designation itself seems more an abstract state of mind than a measure of hard currency. What Jefferson viewed as a stabilizing buffer and Tocqueville described as "eager and apprehensive men of small property" has evolved into a mythology of classlessness. "That which in England we call the middle class is in America virtually the nation," Matthew Arnold wrote a century ago.
 
Members Only
 The middle class is the club that everyone wants to join, despite the downsizing, dependence on more than one wage earner and record amount of consumer debt that make membership so tenuous.
"I never define it by money," says the social historian Paul Fussell, whose book, "Class" (Summit, 1983), skewered all but the abject poor. "The middle class is distinguishable more by its earnestness and psychic insecurity than by its middle income."
Robert Reich, the former Labor Secretary, roughly defines middle-class income as between $20,000 and $60,000. The average American household income is about $34,000.
For the first time since the early 1980's recession, more people are identifying themselves as working class than middle class. But when people are asked to choose among lower, middle and upper in most polls -- including surveys taken during the Depression -- more than 8 in 10 Americans describe themselves as middle class. That includes 2 in 10 of the people who make less than $15,000 (that's below the poverty line for a family of four) and more than 9 in 10 of those who make over $75,000.
"I'm not a wealthy man," said House Speaker Newt Gingrich last month, explaining why, despite his $171,500 salary, he needed a loan from former Senator Bob Dole to pay an Ethics Committee fine. "I'm a middle-class guy."
His former congressional colleague, Fred Heineman, Republican of North Carolina, said last year his combined congressional salary and police pension (as an officer in New York City and the chief in Raleigh) of $183,500 made him lower middle class. "When I see someone who is making anywhere from $300,000 to $750,000," Mr. Heineman was quoted as saying, "that's middle class."
More Americans may be better off today than in the 1950's. Back then, though, most toiled with the expectation that they would wind up better off. If some identified their parents with the blue-collar Kramdens, their own models were the white-collar Cleavers.

Money Always Helps
 "Americans, especially, have blurred strictly economic class boundaries by reason of their hopes, not necessarily their wealth," wrote the historian Loren Baritz.
Having wealth doesn't hurt.
Almost everybody today has a television set; more Americans have two or more cars than have one or none. But it often costs more to get well, go to college (a four-year degree has become a minimal middle-class standard) or buy a house.
The National Association of Realtors reported earlier this month that nearly half of America's families don't make enough to qualify for a mortgage on a $119,400 median priced home. And in New York City, a couple making $150,000 a year and budgeting 25 percent of their after-tax income on housing could afford about $2,000 a month for rent, which is a luxury rate but does not guarantee luxury accommodations. (Under Governor Pataki's proposal, the rent for many tenants who make more than $175,000 a year could be deregulated; that process, called luxury decontrol, now applies to people who make more than $250,000.)
"In order to be middle class as our culture is coming to understand the term," Barbara Ehrenreich has written, "one almost has to be rich."
And remain rich. Among working couples, if the lesser paid spouse were laid off, half the couples in the top one-fourth of earners would fall into the middle half (with middle-class incomes ranging from $20,000 to $60,000), according to a survey for The New York Times by the Program for Applied Social Research at Queens College of the City University of New York. Fully one-third of earners in the middle half would slip into the bottom quarter.
"The rising tide lifted all boats in the 50's, the 60's, the 70's," Mr. Reich said last year. "Since then, the rising tide has lifted the yachts."
High expectations increase frustration when people are working two jobs and falling deeper into debt. "That disillusionment feeds on itself," Mr. Reich says, "and becomes easy prey for politicians who want to place the blame on immigration, affirmative action, welfare and other things that are not the underlying cause."
Going back at least to Franklin D. Roosevelt, politicians described the middle class as forgotten Americans -- remembering them often enough, though, to enact tax deductions and other benefits that might be denounced as giveaways to the rich or handouts for the poor. Maybe that's because the middle class and the wealthy are more likely to vote than the poor.
Definitions of middle-class income depend on variables like the number of wage earners and dependents, the cost of living, whether food stamps are counted and how much wealth has been socked away. It's determined not only by disposable or discretionary income but by how it's spent, which also suggests social class, or to invoke an even more un-American term, status.
Professor Fussell devised a somewhat facetious "living room scale" to assess social class using various middle-class totems. Begin with a score of 100 and then subtract for items like original paintings by family members (minus four points each) and plastic covers on furniture (minus 6) and add points for others (6 for overflow books stacked on the floor and 3 for each family photograph in a sterling silver frame).
Which only goes to show that, as Mr. Baritz said, class may be determined less by Marx than by Flaubert. It's the difference between classlessness and no class at all.

HEADLINE: For Bosnia, Peace Is Coming Up Empty-Handed

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: BRCKO, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
Robert W. Farrand, the American diplomat who is this town's international supervisor under the Balkan peace accord, sat in his new office overlooking the Sava River recently talking about peace, brotherly love and tolerance. Down the street, at an outdoor rally to celebrate the Serbian Orthodox patron saint of the town, Bosnian Serb leaders issued calls for vengeance, war and annihilation.
The civilian administrators who arrived in Bosnia after the signing of the Dayton peace agreement in December 1995 were supposed to cajole local communities into rebuilding a multi-ethnic society obliterated by war. But the starkly different visions proffered by Mr. Farrand and the Bosnian Serb leadership here highlighted what many now see as the failure of the international diplomats to move the Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims one inch forward. And scenes like the outdoor rally have left NATO commanders, who successfully established a cease-fire and now patrol boundary lines with some 30,000 troops, in despair. 
 "It would be a mistake to say there is peace in Bosnia," said a top NATO commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We have only the absence of war. We gave the civilian officials the time and space to carry out the Dayton agreement, but they failed. Nothing has been accomplished. The moment we pack up and leave next year the war could well start all over again."
Mr. Farrand, a 31-year veteran of the State Department who was appointed to administer the disputed town of Brcko (pronounced BURCH ko) earlier this year, is typical of the small army of diplomats, bureaucrats and aid workers who descended on Bosnia with lofty goals but little idea of how to carry them out.
Mr. Farrand was appointed by the chief international civilian administrator for Bosnia, Carl Bildt of Sweden, to supervise Brcko until its fate is decided by international arbitrators sometime before next March. But he has no money to carry out reconstruction programs. He cannot force the Serbs to accept the return of the 20,000 Muslims driven from the town at the start of the war, and he has no technical staff to jump-start the furniture, shoe and palm oil factories that limp along at about 10 percent of prewar capacity.
When a senior member of Mr. Farrand's staff was asked what tools were available to the office to push through the demands of the Dayton accord, he answered, "Our wit."
Mr. Farrand said: "It is the responsibility of the entities here to meet their commitments under the Dayton agreement. I can only encourage them to fulfill these commitments."
Many civilian administrators, while acknowledging their failures, say the refusal by NATO leaders to arrest people indicted on charges of war crimes or to protect refugees who want to return, has left them without the coercive power to make the parties respect the peace agreement, which calls for all refugees to be allowed to go home. They also fault international-aid donors for refusing to provide adequate money and help to build a viable economy.
The World Bank has spent only one-third of the $1.8 billion it raised for Bosnia because of the failure by all sides to make economic reforms that the bank says are needed to insure responsible use of the money. And contributions to international relief agencies have plummeted because of "donor fatigue."
Brcko, a dilapidated collection of houses with terra-cotta roofs and boxy concrete apartment buildings on the banks of the Sava River, is in the three-mile-wide corridor that links the two parts of Serb-held Bosnia. If Brcko is handed to the Muslims, the Serbian entity in Bosnia created under the peace agreement will be cut in two. The Muslims, who made up 55 percent of the town before the war, want Brcko to gain access to the river traffic along the Sava, linking them to trade routes.
Each side in the conflict -- both the Serbs and the Muslims argued so bitterly over Brcko that its fate could not be decided at the peace talks -- has threatened to go to war again if the arbitration does not go its way.
The town is patrolled by American soldiers, who guard both ends of the bridge linking Brcko to Croatia across the river. The bridge is closed to civilians.
American troops, sweating under the weight of helmets and green flak jackets, moved slowly past a park along the riverbank the other day. Before the war, the park was the site of one of the town's three mosques. The building was dynamited into rubble in 1992, and the local Serbs removed every stone to obliterate any trace of the structure.
The Muslims fled at the start of the fighting to territory under their control, south of the town. Many now live in poor conditions just a few miles from their old homes. When a group of about 100 Muslims from Brcko arrived in buses in front of Mr. Farrand's office on May 1 to protest, seeking the return of their homes, jeering Serbs attacked them with bricks, stones and bottles.
"To destroy the mosques was not to destroy cultural monuments because Muslims have no culture," said Anica Savic, the local correspondent for Tanyug, the Serb-run Yugoslav news agency. "They are Serbs who were converted by the Turks during the occupation because they were weak. We just published a book of 200 years of Serb journalism. The Muslims couldn't fill a book with even two years' worth of journalism."
The rally for the Serbian patron saint, which took place under a cloudless sky and bright sun, was yet another opportunity for the Bosnian Serb leaders to display their disdain for the Dayton accords. Florid poems were read calling on all Serbs to hold back the "Muslim hordes" that threatened Serb freedom. Serbian folk singers performed, and military leaders vowed to defy any decision against them by the arbitration.
It is hard to believe that fighting could start again after a war that destroyed over 60 percent of all homes in Bosnia, wiped out most factories and businesses, created a million refugees and plunged tens of thousands of families into destitution and unspeakable grief.
But the stagnation, poverty and hopelessness that infect Bosnia, coupled with the hatreds whipped up by the savage fighting, leave many young people ready to pick up guns again. After 18 months, peace has not offered them much. Brcko is filled with destitute Serbs displaced from other parts of Bosnia. The war, in the end, gave many young men a purpose, a sense of self-worth and the intoxication of power.
Jakob Pejic, 32, a former Bosnian Serb soldier, and his friend Savo Markovic, 18, sat blinking into the bright sunlight not far from the rally. They said they had no work and little money.
"We just wait for the war to start again," said Mr. Pejic. "It's what the Muslims want."

Computer Bites Man

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
In the end it didn't make any difference whether Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess or not, because the press was going to send the same message no matter who won. Had Mr. Kasparov triumphed, the headlines would have read: "Man Beats Machine!" When he lost, commentators worked hard to recast defeat as a moral victory. Deep Blue is not human or intelligent, we were reassured, but just a big, fat, soulless number cruncher. Deep Blue can't write a sonnet. Deep Blue can't hug a baby. Deep Blue has no sense of humor. (As if Garry Kasparov were George Carlin.)
All true, and all beside the point. The desperate propping up of humanity that followed I.B.M.'s stock-stoking publicity stunt is a backhanded testament to just how much ground man is losing to computer. Print and TV, directly threatened by the Internet, are in a particular panic and especially defensive. "Computers do what we make them do, period," wrote David Gelernter in Time, summing up the circle-the-wagons defense of mankind. Yes, but the real story is that we increasingly do what computers make us do. Just think of the friends you once regularly saw or talked to on the phone but now encounter only in the virtual relationship of E-mail. 
 Such computer-driven changes in our culture, good and bad, big and small, are happening faster than we can calculate them, brought about not by 1.4-ton sideshow freaks like Deep Blue but by the ubiquitous P.C.'s at home, work and school. The great engine of our economy (and the bull market on which so many Americans or their pension funds have staked their futures) is the computer; Intel, The Economist reports, should surpass General Electric as the U.S.'s most profitable business by 2000. The Internet will also be a major purveyor of entertainment and journalism, needing only two inevitable improvements (faster connections, TV-quality video) to remake the entire information industry, from network news to movie rentals.
David Shenk, whose new book "Data Smog" is an indispensable guide to the big picture of technology's cultural impact, says that the press overcovered Deep Blue, "a story that doesn't affect mankind," because it "can be encapsulated into a man vs. machine drama." The subtler story of the computer's real effects on life, not chess competition, is "one of a slow creep, with the change being imperceptible from day to day."
"Data Smog" reports on some of the more negative changes, starting with a computer's ability to isolate its user and increase stress by glutting the brain with data and images. Mr. Shenk also questions -- as our Geeks in Chief, Al Gore and Newt Gingrich, never do -- the fallout of wiring every classroom. Though the computer can serve as a great library, it is hardly a foolproof instructional tool. Used improperly, it will decrease kids' attention spans and pump them full of information rather than teach essential skills.
Old media often miss the computer's cultural impact because we see stories in, well, linear terms, as morality plays with clear plots. As Deep Blue was overcovered, so are the size of Bill Gates's house and fortune, the spread of Web pornography (and the doomed legal efforts to censor it) and the technological travails of America Online (another man-bests-computer fable).
Among the important non-linear stories being missed is the coming impact of the computer on politics -- a story that has nothing to do with politicians' much-documented Web sites. As Mr. Shenk points out, cyberspace (and its corporate culture) is intrinsically libertarian Republican, a model of "highly decentralized, deregulated society." This is bad news for big-government Democrats, but not necessarily a bonanza for a G.O.P. keen to restrict immigration (a huge source of digital-industry talent) and regulate morality, on the Web and beyond. Nor is it clear who on the digital political landscape will help the swelling underclass of information have-nots.
We can address such questions faster if we recognize that the battle between man and computer is over, and the computer has won. Our task now is not to deny that victory -- or stomp off childishly in defeat like Mr. Kasparov -- but to seize the countless creative opportunities before us to bend the machine's power to our own ends as we negotiate the most humane truce possible.

HEADLINE: AIDS Onrush Sends Russia To the Edge of an Epidemic

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 17

 BODY:
Fueled by a convergence of surging drug abuse and increased sexual activity, Russia stands on the precipice of an AIDS epidemic every bit as explosive as the one that swept through Europe and the United States 15 years ago.
The nation's leading AIDS experts, fully aware after the fall of Communism that an open society would bring a rising risk of all sexually transmitted diseases, have long forecast that the number of reported AIDS cases would climb. Although the raw numbers are minuscule here compared with those in Africa or even the United States, officials routinely state that reported infections represent no more than 10 percent of the true figures. But even they tell a harrowing story of the rapid, exponential advance of the epidemic in a country whose health-care budget has far more in common with those of the third world than with the United States, where expensive new drugs have brought hope to many. 
 "This epidemic started slowly in Russia," said Aleksandr Goliusov, the Health Ministry's chief AIDS specialist. "But now it has caught on fire. Before we could talk about controlling it or limiting the damage. Now the catastrophe is real."
Last year, 1,500 new H.I.V. cases were reported in Russia, more than the official figure for the first nine years of the epidemic combined. For the first quarter of this year, according to preliminary data from the Health Ministry, the numbers have already outstripped those for 1996.
Taking into consideration the many cases that are never reported, federal health officials now say that by the end of 1997 there could be 100,000 people infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in Russia. And by 2000, they believe the figure will be 800,000.
There are many reasons for the huge surge of H.I.V. infection in Russia, and most of them are related. The vast majority of new infections are among Russia's 600,000 intravenous drug abusers -- who are most efficient at spreading the virus and least susceptible to counseling or education efforts of any kind.
Poor border control in the chaotic aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union has permitted the smuggling and abuse of narcotics to soar over the last five years. And a new era of complete freedom has caused sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, herpes and gonorrhea to spread more rapidly here than anywhere else in the world.
The prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases has always been an excellent barometer for the incidence of AIDS -- in part because those diseases can increase the possibility of H.I.V. infections, and in part because they provide a good way to measure the sexual activity of a population.
In 1996, according to Government statistics, 10 million people in Russia had some sexually transmitted disease. Russia had 217 cases of syphilis per 100,000 people, a rate that is more than 50 times those in the United States or Europe. Seven years ago the figure for Russia was only 6 cases per 100,000.
"How can there possibly be an enormous epidemic of diseases like syphilis and almost no spread of AIDS?" said Dr. Irina G. Savchenko, an epidemiologist at the Russian AIDS Center in Moscow. "There can't be. Either there are too many cases of syphilis or there are too few of AIDS. And, believe me, we are not overreporting syphilis."
The impact of the epidemic has been heightened by the almost complete lack of educational or preventive measures available. When AIDS was first reported here in 1987, the earliest victims were gay men and the illness was treated by Soviet authorities as the evil effect of a bourgeois, Western-style life.
By the early 1990's, when political instability became the central fact of Russian life, even tentative efforts to teach AIDS awareness came to a halt. In 1991, just at the moment when Russia's sexual freedoms became most obvious and pronounced, the Institute of Preventive Medicine stopped translating AIDS information booklets from foreign languages. Money for even the most basic treatment became difficult to find.
The situation has only become worse since then, because Russia is a country that has almost no money to spend on health care. According to the World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, a country should devote at least 5 percent of its gross domestic product to basic health care. Russia spends 2.2 percent. Health Ministry figures suggest that it will cost at least $5 billion a year to treat Russia's AIDS patients in the year 2000. Today the entire federal health budget for the country is only twice that.
"Do you think it's a coincidence that the death rate in Russia exceeds the birth rate by 70 percent?" said Nikolai Gerasimenky, chairman of the Health Care committee in the Parliament. "We do not invest in the health of our citizens. I think we should have learned from the experience of others that prevention costs less than treatment and that if we don't spend money on AIDS education people are going to die."
But that money is not going to be available soon. In 1995 the Health Ministry received less than half the money budgeted for its AIDS program, according to Dr. Goliusov. Last year, it received no money at all for education or prevention efforts. There is no drug or vaccine development effort here. This year the budget for AIDS prevention and treatment programs is $8 million. But so far, the Health Ministry has not received a penny.
The epidemic here has hit cities like Moscow -- with one quarter of all cases -- and other transit centers. Kaliningrad, the tiny Russian outpost on the Baltic Sea through which many narcotics are smuggled, also has a high rate of infection -- as do port and airport cities like St. Petersburg, Novorossisk and Nizhny Novgorod. In the last four months, nearly as many cases -- 325 -- have been registered in Krasnoyarsk as were registered in Moscow in the first five years of the epidemic.
Russia is not the only formerly Communist country to be deeply affected by the AIDS epidemic. While rates of H.I.V. infection are not nearly as high in Eastern Europe as they are in Russia, they are far higher than those of Western Europe.
And in the former Soviet republics of Belarus and Ukraine, where drug addiction has also surged in the last five years, the rates of infection in some cities may be even higher than those in Russia.
Liquid opiates have created a large part of the problem. Thanks to an enormous flow of poppies from Afghanistan to the West, opium is now often available as an inexpensive liquid. Smugglers often sample it and then stick used needles into large jars containing up to a gallon of the drug: a result is that the entire stock -- which will be used by scores of others -- becomes infected.
Ignorance about AIDS -- and reluctance to take precautions -- are still more the rule than the exception in Russia. The number of prostitutes working in Moscow has grown markedly in just the last year. They often line the streets at night, waiting for drivers to stop and make them an offer. Asked if they used condoms recently, three young women who had taken up their posts on the Ring Road -- one of the city's main thoroughfares -- laughed.
"This is my job," said one of them as she shrugged. "And those guys in the cars are my bosses. Look at all the other girls out here. Now do you think I can tell my bosses to wear a condom?"

HEADLINE: Where Welfare Stands

 BODY:
Nine months have gone by since the passage of the 1996 welfare reform law. Welfare rolls are plummeting across the country. Caseloads fell between 1993 and 1996 by 31 percent in Indiana, 30 percent in Wisconsin and 22 percent in Arizona. These are indeed startling numbers and the politicians, not surprisingly, are crowing. From President Clinton to Representative Clay Shaw of Florida, who led the House subcommittee that drafted the law, they are congratulating themselves and the reform act they supported. 
 Yet the 1996 law cannot claim responsibility for driving down welfare rolls. There simply has not been enough time for it to take effect. Its combination of sanctions, five-year time limits on welfare benefits and work requirements may someday reduce long-term dependency, but that day cannot arrive until states pass necessary laws and the five-year time limits come into play. The main forces driving down caseloads are a strong economy and the imaginative welfare-to-work programs devised by states well before the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994.
 
Early Initiatives
The recent history of welfare programs belies the notion that the Federal system was dysfunctional before Congress stepped in last year, or that it prevented states from designing innovative responses. President Johnson's War on Poverty, for example, brought forth Medicaid, food stamps and a national standard for disability payments. The poverty program helped to reduce poverty rates by about a third between 1965 and 1973, from 17 percent in 1965 to 11 percent.
But when the economy later went sour, Congress did little to help the states with rising welfare caseloads. Several of them therefore took matters into their own hands, applying to Washington for permission to experiment with welfare-to-work programs. By today's standard, these programs were modest, devoted almost entirely to low-cost assistance like providing welfare recipients with help in finding a job. But studies by New York's Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation showed that some of them managed to cut caseloads by a few percentage points, raise employment and save a few taxpayer dollars.
 
The 1988 Family Support Act
Alongside these positive findings came enlightening research by two future officials of the Clinton Administration, Mary Jo Bane and David Ellwood, who showed that the poverty population was split into two distinct groups that required different policy responses. Most recipients rotated on and off welfare in short bursts. A smaller group, with few job skills, made welfare a long-term life style.
This distinction provided the intellectual underpinning for the next big milestone in welfare policy, the 1988 Family Support Act. Sponsored by two New Yorkers, then-Representative Thomas Downey and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the act declared as Federal policy that state welfare offices were responsible for placing recipients in jobs, not just writing checks. Able-bodied recipients, in return for government aid, would engage in the training and job-preparation activities that the research had shown to be effective. Following the lessons of the Bane-Ellwood studies, the act also called for education and training for long-term recipients.
Unfortunately, Congress did little to support the act's sound architecture, providing only $1 billion, to be matched by the states, to pay for welfare-to-work programs. Yet the act performed a signal service. It told states to get on with the job of putting welfare enrollees to work, setting the stage for a new round of ambitious local initiatives.
Vermont, for example, now provides subsidized private-sector jobs and pledges that all recipients who obey the rules will get help. Wisconsin plans to put nearly every applicant into a job slot, including government-provided workfare. Utah emphasizes intensive case management. Oregon subsidizes private employers who hire welfare recipients and provides post-hiring help so recipients can hold their jobs, a wise strategy for helping those who habitually drop in and out of the labor force. Minnesota imposes mandatory work requirements and provides strong incentives to make sure that work pays more than welfare.
Early data show reductions in caseloads and poverty, suggesting that states can nudge down welfare through the balanced use of work requirements and assistance. But it is far from clear whether these promising infant programs can be beefed up to address the needs of the welfare population in big cities.
 
 The New Law
In 1996, President Clinton and Congress decided that small, steady progress was not good enough. Rather than adding teeth to the 1988 act, they added fangs. The act chops away about $50 billion by stripping some disabled children of cash assistance, legal immigrants of medical insurance and childless adults who cannot find work of food stamps -- provisions that have nothing to do with creating work but everything to do with balancing the budget by cutting programs for the poor. The act also discarded a 60-year-old entitlement that required Washington to share the cost of the basic program for needy parents and substituted a fixed annual grant that does not vary with the size of the poverty rolls. Finally, Congress mandated time limits that prohibit any state from providing Federal cash aid to any family for more than five years.
The states thus face a whole new set of challenges to their ingenuity, not to mention their compassion. Before the 1996 act, states that imposed time limits were required to exempt families that hit that limit and, for no fault of their own, could not find work. The new law strips away this protection, inviting a cash-starved state to throw long-term unemployed adults into the abyss.
Some governors, like George Pataki of New York, say they will not abandon enrollees who obey welfare rules. But many other states are designing welfare programs that impose time limits with no commitment to help those who hit the barrier without work. Another danger is that the new law allows states to fulfill Federal requirements either by whittling caseloads through tighter eligibility rules or by placing recipients in jobs, as if the two options were equally good. Once again, the cash-starved states may be tempted to kick needy enrollees off welfare.
The challenge for the states is to use the flexibility they have under the new law to create a system that compels able-bodied recipients to work but stands ready to continue help for those who cannot find work for no fault of their own. It is also important that states carefully monitor families dropped from welfare rolls, and prepare to change their rules if innocent people are hurt.
No person has hit the new Federal time limit yet. Nor are states, in today's economy, stretched to meet their welfare needs. But someday the economy will slow, and, for the first time, there will be no additional flow of Federal dollars. Only then will the measure of the new welfare law be taken. Only then will the country discover what it means for Washington to rip the Federal safety net and pray that the states preserve theirs.

HEADLINE: Burmese Officials Return Fugitive in U.S. Heroin Case to Thailand

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, May 17

 BODY:
The chief suspect sought by the police after the biggest heroin seizure in United States history has been captured in Myanmar and was returned today to Thailand, where he had jumped bail earlier this year, authorities in Myanmar said.
The suspect, Li Yung Chung, had been granted bail in Thailand in February despite a request from the United States for his extradition in connection with 1,070 pounds of heroin seized in a warehouse in Hayward, Calif., in May 1991. American officials estimated the street value of the drugs at more than $1 billion. 
 His release on bail had violated normal Thai procedures and drawn protests from American officials. Mr. Li was indicted a year ago in a New York court and could face life in prison on drug trafficking charges.
[On arrival in Bangkok, Mr. Li said he was prepared to be extradicted to face trial in the United States, Reuters reported.]
Mr. Li, who holds a Thai identity card under the name Phongsak Rogjanasakul, was flown to Thailand on the final day of a two-day visit to Myanmar, the former Burma, by the Thai Prime Minister.
A statement by Burmese authorities said he was being returned as a good will gesture to Thailand and as a contribution to the regional battle against drug trafficking.
The visit of the Prime Minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, comes one month after the United States imposed economic sanctions on Myanmar. It was a clear statement that Thailand, along with other nations in the region, would continue to promote ties with the Burmese.
The seven-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations appeared to be ready to accept Myanmar -- along with Cambodia and Laos -- as members this year, despite the human rights abuses that led to the American sanctions.
A joint statement today at the conclusion of Mr. Chavalit's visit affirmed the region's hands-off policy, stating that each nation has "the right to pursue its own path of national development and that outside interference is counterproductive."
Mr. Chavalit has been a longtime friend of the Burmese military junta and, as Defense Minister, was the first foreign official to visit Myanmar after a 1988 crackdown that left hundreds of pro-democracy protesters dead.
Thailand and other members of the Southeast Asian bloc -- which also includes Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Brunei -- have taken advantage of Myanmar's liberalized trade policies. They assert a policy of "constructive engagement," rather than public criticism and confrontation.
Today's communique affirmed Thailand's support for the admission of Myanmar into the regional grouping so that "Southeast Asia could become a truly united community of nations."
The return today of Mr. Li came in response to a request from Thailand, which had been embarrassed by his release on bail, a move that violated its own legal procedures. Officials have linked Mr. Li to other major heroin shipments, including one of 162 pounds that was recovered in Singapore last year and was that nation's largest seizure of the drug.
He had been freed on $200,000 bail on Feb. 7 by a Thai court without notification of prosecutors or higher officials and had failed to report for a court date one month later.
Mr. Li is believed to be linked to Khun Sa, a major drug producer in the Golden Triangle area of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos, which officials say is the source of 60 percent of the heroin in the United States. Burmese officials acknowledge that Mr. Khun Sa is now a free man in their country but they have rejected American demands for his extradition for trial.

HEADLINE: Robert H. Krieble, 80, Dies; Was Co-Founder of Loctite

 BODY:
Robert H. Krieble, a co-founder and former chief executive of the Loctite Corporation and a former vice chairman of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative policy research institute, died on May 8 at his home in Old Lyme, Conn. He was 80.
Mr. Krieble, a chemist, founded Loctite with his father, Vernon K. Krieble, also a chemist, in 1953. The company was originally called American Sealants, but was renamed in 1956 for loctite, a sealant developed by Robert Krieble that bonds metal to metal. 
 After his father died in 1964, Mr. Krieble was named president and chief executive, and in 1976 he became chairman. He served as chairman and chief executive from 1980 through 1985, and as chairman for an additional year until he retired.
In addition to loctite, the company, based in Hartford, produces other sealants, engineering adhesives, coatings, lighting systems and auto body repair materials for the industrial and domestic markets. Loctite became a subsidiary of Henkel, a German company, this year.
During his career, Mr. Krieble personally received more than a dozen patents for silicones, adhesives and a petrochemical processing method.
Mr. Krieble joined the board of the Heritage Foundation in 1978. He was named vice chairman of the foundation in 1985. He served as chairman of the institute's finance committee from 1987 through 1996, a period when the organization's budget grew to more than $25 million a year from less than $5 million.
Mr. Krieble formed the Krieble Institute in 1989 to promote democracy and economic freedom in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The organization now sends educators to former Soviet bloc and Eastern European countries.
Mr. Krieble graduated from Haverford College in 1935 with a degree in chemistry, and received a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1939. He joined the Socony Vacuum Oil Company, and then the General Electric Company in 1943. Mr. Krieble remained with General Electric, rising from research chemist to general manager of the chemical development department, until he left in 1956 to work full time at Loctite.
He is survived by his wife, Nancy Brayton Krieble, of Old Lyme; his son, Frederick, of the Turks and Caicos Islands; his daughter, Helen E. Krieble, of Marlborough, Conn., and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: ACADEMY'S REPORT SAYS IMMIGRATION BENEFITS THE U.S.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
Immigration produces substantial economic benefits for the United States as a whole but slightly reduces the wages and job opportunities of low-skilled American workers, especially high school dropouts, the National Academy of Sciences said today.
In an authoritative report on one of the more explosive issues facing social scientists and politicians, the panel concluded that immigration added perhaps $10 billion a year to the nation's economic output. "Those who buy goods and services produced by immigrant labor also benefit," it said, because prices are lower than they would otherwise be. 
 The panel said that the job prospects of low-skilled native-born workers were sometimes hurt by competition with immigrants and that the incomes of native-born workers tended to fall as a result.
But, it said, the effects are relatively small and are not concentrated in the areas where immigrants live. Rather, the effects are dispersed across the United States, in part because low-skilled native-born workers move to other areas of the country in search of jobs.
The academy's report is a sober, systematic assessment of the economic and fiscal effects of immigration -- the most comprehensive investigation of the issue to date. It concludes that immigration is neither a panacea for the nation's economic problems, as some suggest, nor a source of huge costs, as others contend.
The panel consisted of 12 experts in economics, demography and sociology, led by James P. Smith, an economist at the Rand Corporation, a research organization in Santa Monica, Calif. The study was requested by the United States Commission on Immigration Reform, which advises Congress on immigration policy.
Mr. Smith said: "It's true that some Americans are now paying more taxes because of immigration, and native-born Americans without a high school education have seen their wages fall slightly because of the competition sparked by lower-skilled, newly arrived immigrants. But the vast majority of Americans are enjoying a healthier economy as a result of the increased supply of labor and lower prices that result from immigration."
The panel said it was surprised by one finding: no evidence suggested that blacks had been especially hurt by immigration or by competition with immigrants.
To be sure, it said, "some black workers have lost their jobs to immigrants," especially in places like New York City and Los Angeles, where they compete for the same jobs. But immigration does not have a decisive influence on the economic opportunities of blacks because most blacks do not live in places with large concentrations of immigrants, it said.
Last year, Congress sharply cut back the Federal benefits available to legal immigrants, on the assumption that such immigrants cost the Government more than they paid in taxes.
The academy concluded that immigrants have "a negative fiscal impact at the state and local level but a larger positive impact at the Federal level, resulting in an overall positive impact for the United States" in the long run.
In fiscal terms, the panel said, immigrant households are costly at first, mainly because of the public education costs they impose on state and local governments. But in 15 or 20 years, it said, immigrants produce fiscal benefits as they finish school, start working and begin to pay income and payroll taxes.
The panel measured the fiscal burden of immigrants in two states. In New Jersey, it said, a native-born household pays an average of $232 a year in state and local taxes to cover the net cost of services used by immigrants, while the comparable figure for California is $1,178 a year.
But, the panel said, the fiscal impact of immigrants over all is positive because they tend to arrive as young workers and "will help pay the public costs of the aging baby boom generation."
Thus, it said, "state and local investments in education pay off in higher tax payments later in life." Those revenues include Federal taxes for Social Security and Medicare.
The report also made these observations:
*Immigration will play "the dominant role" in the United States' population growth in the next half-century. If immigration continues at current levels, it will account for nearly two-thirds of the expected population growth. The nation's population is expected to rise by 124 million, to 387 million in 2050 from 263 million in 1995. If immigration continues at current levels, immigrants and their descendants will account for 80 million of the increase.
*The gap between the wages of immigrants and the wages of native-born workers is widening. Many recent immigrants come from poorer countries where the average levels of education, wages and skills are far below those of the United States.
*Immigration has contributed to an increase in the number of high school dropouts in the United States, and this increase has "lowered the wages of high school dropouts by about 5 percent." That accounts for "about 44 percent of the total decline in wages of high school dropouts" from 1980 to 1994.
New Jersey and California both have many immigrants, but the effects differ. Thomas J. Espenshade, a panel member who is a professor of sociology at Princeton University, said that in the 1990 census, immigrants had accounted for 13 percent of the population in New Jersey and 22 percent in California. He said the typical immigrant in New Jersey was better educated than the typical immigrant in California.
In New Jersey, the panel said, the average household headed by an immigrant receives $1,484 a year more in state and local services than it pays in state and local taxes. In California, that figure is $3,463.
On the average, the panel said, immigrant households have more school-age children and lower incomes, pay lower state and local taxes and receive more state-financed social services than households of native-born Americans.
Describing the economic benefits of immigration, the panel said: "Immigrants increase the supply of labor and help produce new goods and services. But since they are paid less than the total value of these new goods and services, domestic workers as a group must gain."

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
Clinton Assembles a List of Kennedyesque Challenges

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
In a speech meant to echo John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to the nation to put a man on the moon "before this decade is out," President Clinton plans to use a commencement address on Sunday to call for scientists to develop an AIDS vaccine within the next 10 years.
Yet unlike Mr. Kennedy, who said the race into space could require billions of dollars, Mr. Clinton is not expected to call for a new infusion of Federal money into the research effort. 
 Instead, his aides say, he will announce during his speech at Morgan State University in Baltimore plans by the National Institutes of Health to open a new laboratory for researching a vaccine for AIDS and H.I.V., consolidating the effort now taking place at centers across the institutes' campus.
The mixture of Kennedyesque ambition and limited means shows the constraints that Mr. Clinton is under these days even as he seeks new issues -- ranging from scientific research to racial conciliation -- to invigorate his second term.
To be sure, these spring months have been a time of triumph for President Clinton. The Senate approved a chemical weapons treaty strongly supported by Mr. Clinton, and he was a driving force behind a pact between Russia and NATO that would allow NATO to expand into Moscow's former satellites.
The early months of his second term also produced a balanced budget agreement that concludes a 20-year debate between Democrats and Republicans over deficit reduction and the size of government.
Yet the successes have produced less a sense of momentous beginning for a new term than of a chapter closing in the Clinton Presidency.
Mr. Clinton has acted so quickly on the initiatives that his Presidential campaign promoted as the central goals of a second term that his supporters and antagonists alike are asking how he will fill his remaining years in office.
Will this ever-flexible President feel pressure to reinvent himself once again? Or will this leader of activist impulses settle in like Dwight D. Eisenhower and preside over a second term known less for innovation than for stability?
Even Dick Morris, the political strategist who helped Mr. Clinton define his 1996 platform, wonders about the next act.
"He's done enough to deserve his place in history, but what does he do in the White House?" Mr. Morris asked. "He has a real jeopardy of dangling in the wind like Reagan did in '87 and '88 after he had basically achieved everything he wanted to achieve."
White House officials say the President has presided over an unprecedented economic recovery and plans to stay his course, insuring deficit reduction, focusing on education and seeking step-by-step expansion of health insurance coverage.
His advisers caution that the President still has substantial work ahead of him this year to push NATO expansion through the Senate and to keep the balanced budget agreement from unraveling in Congress.
"There will be a lot of gnashing around on the details and probably will be some near-death experiences this summer," one White House official said.
But beyond that, the White House has been searching for subjects with heft for Mr. Clinton to explore, particularly as Congress gears up for hearings on campaign financing.
Public events are being planned so that Mr. Clinton can return to his bully pulpit crusades for the states to embrace education standards and for the private sector to hire welfare recipients.
And the White House has been searching for new domestic issues for the President -- such as the call for the AIDS vaccine -- in which he can mobilize the public but not run afoul of the fiscal constraints of budget balancing. Beginning in mid-June, Mr. Clinton is also planning to put an emphasis on race relations.
Yet can such issues be the stuff of legacy?
The strategy has drawn more measured assessments of what can be accomplished by such exhortation and reorganization.
Derek Link, a senior policy associate at the Gay Men's Health Crisis, an AIDS service organization, said that an AIDS vaccine needed to be a high priority and that "the first issue is to get a handle at what's going on at all the N.I.H. institutes" and to consolidate the various programs there. But he added that more Federal money was needed.
Similarly, some wonder what can come of Mr. Clinton's race initiative if it is not far more concrete than using the President's bully pulpit to challenge Americans to examine their prejudices and fears.
Some civil rights leaders have been urging the White House to put more money into civil rights and to focus on the urban poor.
Many policy analysts say that the most compelling way for Mr. Clinton to make a legacy for himself is to lead the way on refiguring Medicare and Social Security and keeping the programs from going broke when the baby boom generation retires.
But the President set little groundwork for a long-term overhaul of these popular entitlement programs when he presented himself as the defender against Republican attack of Medicare and Medicaid.
Although Mr. Clinton's aides have said the President wants to put in place a "bipartisan process" to find ways to change the entitlement programs, they have not put the issues on the front burner.
It may be that Mr. Clinton's ideology-blurring ways will lead to a new policy debate inside each party as the Republicans and Democrats look for ways to differentiate themselves.
The aftermath of the 1996 election left the Republicans sharply divided over cultural issues, over whether to cooperate or confront Mr. Clinton and over whether to revive their signature call for tax cuts.
The Democrats are split over whether Mr. Clinton has made the Democrats competitive again by erasing their image as spendthrifts and as out of touch with middle-class concerns or whether he has pulled the party away from its core beliefs and constituency.
"The most interesting fight will happen within each party, not between the parties," said William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative journal.

HEADLINE: 10 Residents Under Siege By Proposal For Big Mall

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HURST, Tex.

 BODY:
In a battle between homeowners and a shopping mall, it appears that the mall is winning in this city of 36,000 a dozen miles northeast of downtown Fort Worth.
The City of Hurst is using its power of eminent domain to force homeowners in the Richland Park East neighborhood to abandon their houses to make room for an expansion of the city's largest shopping mall. 
 Some legal experts said the case appeared to be the first of its kind in the United States. Although previous cases involved other kinds of commercial development, the experts said they could not recall another involving the condemnation of homes for a mall expansion.
All but 10 of the 127 homeowners in the neighborhood have agreed to sell their homes to the city. The 10 holdouts are fighting the condemnation in court, even as their neighborhood is torn down around them.
One morning in early May, Leonard and Donna Prohs, who are hoping to stay in their home in Richland Park East, watched as two houses across the street were demolished.
"It takes two or three months to build a house, and less than an hour to tear it down," Mr. Prohs said as he leaned on the hood of his Ford pickup and watched a backhoe reduce a neighbor's home into rubble.
More than a dozen homes in the neighborhood have already been demolished. Dozens of others sit vacant and forlorn, their windows, doors and other salvageable items stripped for reuse by Habitat for Humanity, a charity that builds affordable housing for the poor.
For Hurst, the $220 million expansion of the North East Mall means increased tax revenues. Built in 1971, the North East Mall, owned by the Simon DeBartolo Group of Indianapolis, is Hurst's biggest taxpayer. By doubling the size of the mall, said Allan Weegar, assistant city manager, the city will increase sales taxes by $11 million a year.
"We see the North East Mall as one of the backbones of our business community," Mr. Weegar said, "and we want to make sure that it remains a viable contributor."
He added that a small part of the land in Richland Park East would be used for the mall itself, while the rest would be used for streets and utilities to serve the mall.
Scott Moran, a lawyer for the homeowners, calls the Hurst case "a misuse of governmental power."
"We've always condemned land for police stations and roads," Mr. Moran said. "But now they are saying that economic development is a necessity." He said the mall expansion showed that "if you are rich enough and powerful enough, you can get municipalities to do your bidding for you."
Jordan Clark, the president of the United Homeowners Association, a consumer advocacy group in Washington, said the use of eminent domain on behalf of the mall was "a dangerous precedent." Mr. Clark added, "One has to wonder how much public good is being served."
Richard Collins, a professor of law at the University of Colorado, said state and Federal courts had been reluctant to restrict governments' power of eminent domain. Professor Collins said the courts had upheld a number of eminent domain cases involving the transfer of land to private ventures, including a 1981 Michigan case in which a neighborhood was condemned to make room for a General Motors plant expansion.
Professor Collins said landowners had tried to prevent the seizure, but the Michigan Supreme Court then said the government had the right to take the property. "And a shopping mall is not categorically different from a G.M. plant," he said.
Richard A. Epstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago who has written a book about eminent domain issues, agreed with Mr. Collins. Though he sympathized with the homeowners who are fighting the mall expansion, Mr. Epstein said, "I don't expect they are going to win."
Billie Scott, a spokeswoman for Simon DeBartolo, the country's largest mall developer, said the company had negotiated in good faith with the homeowners, offering up to 150 percent of the value of their houses. Richland Park East is "completely surrounded by commercial development," Ms. Scott said, adding, "It's inevitable that area would go commercial at some point."
In a court hearing on the condemnation case held earlier this month at the Tarrant County Justice Center, Hurst's city attorney, George Staples, urged Judge Fred Davis of State District Court to give the city the right to take over the final 10 homeowners' properties.
"There's no neighborhood left; it is completely destroyed," said Mr. Staples, who told the judge that the city needed to get the remaining homeowners out so that construction on the mall expansion can move forward.
Despite Mr. Staples's request for a quick decision, Judge Davis did not rule on the case and asked both sides to submit additional briefs. Attorneys said they expected a decision before the end of May.
Leon Lopez, 62, one of the homeowners who have sued the city over the mall expansion, moved his family into a modest home on West Cheryl Avenue 30 years ago. Mr. Lopez said he was fighting for principle, not money, and added, "The American dream is being shattered by a mall, of all things."

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Lay Foundation for Compromise on Rent Rules

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 17

 BODY:
While it is far from clear that state lawmakers will be able to reach a deal on rent regulations before the current laws expire on June 15, they are privately discussing ways out of the impasse, including an end to protections for wealthy tenants, a limited system of deregulation and a major construction program to ease the housing shortage.
For months, as rent regulation has overshadowed state government, top lawmakers have publicly painted one another as extremists rather than hold any real negotiations on the issue. After all, Democrats and Republicans were so far apart that there seemed to be little worth talking about. 
 But in the last week, while the invective has continued, hot as ever, lawmakers and their aides in both parties have quietly begun to assemble what may be the pieces of a compromise.
Aides to Gov. George E. Pataki and the leaders of the Legislature are expected to hold their first negotiations on the rent laws within a few days.
Much of the talk has been about ways to soften the impact of vacancy decontrol, a system that preserves rent protections for people as long as they remain in their apartments but deregulates the units as soon as they become vacant. One modified version of vacancy decontrol being discussed is used in Los Angeles.
But so far, most Democrats insist that any form of the system goes too far, while most Republicans say that if it is watered down, it does not go far enough.
Mr. Pataki, a Republican, supports vacancy decontrol. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, also a Republican, has called for a quick end to the regulations, but appears ready to accept the Governor's proposal. The Assembly, controlled by Democrats, has passed a bill that would keep the current rules more or less intact, and the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, says that remains his aim.
If the current laws are allowed to expire, the owners of more than one million apartments, most of them in New York City, will then be able to raise rents to whatever the market will bear.
With the deadline looming, it appears that the Democrats may agree, at least in part, to Republican demands to remove rent controls for some rich tenants and to require renters to deposit their rents in escrow accounts while disputes with landlords are resolved in Housing Court.
One area of potential agreement -- one that Democrats say would have to be a part of any deal -- is a major new housing construction program to increase the supply of apartments, which would presumably lower their price. The current system is descended from price controls imposed on a wide range of commodities, including rents, during World War II, when New York City began to experience a housing shortage. Over the last half century, a complex web of city and state rent laws have taken effect, and the assumption of rent controls has become a sacrosanct part of the city's political and economic culture.
While Democrats point to the continued housing shortage as evidence of the continued need for rent regulation, Republicans say rent regulation has inhibited new construction, perpetuating the shortage.
The rent laws state that if the vacancy rate for apartments in New York City rises above 5 percent -- it was about 4 percent in the most recent survey -- there will no longer be a shortage in the city, and the controls for most apartments will end. That means, according to several lawmakers, Democrat and Republican, that housing construction could be a way out of the impasse.
Mr. Silver has proposed tax abatements and other measures to make it easier for builders to erect new buildings and renovate dilapidated ones. Last December, Mr. Bruno suggested much the same thing.
Assemblyman Vito J. Lopez, chairman of the Housing Committee, has proposed a more direct approach, having the state spend $150 million a year for four years on construction of new, affordable housing. He says that would produce about 80,000 new units, equal to about 4 percent of the current supply.
"You increase the housing supply for the people who need it the most, that helps push rents down, and the laws expire all by themselves, and you don't have to keep fighting this fight every few years," he said. Some parts of the city, he said, would have to be rezoned from manufacturing to residential.
Mr. Lopez's ideas are attractive to some of the downstate Republican senators who have been made uncomfortable by Mr. Bruno's hard line, though it may not appeal to Mr. Bruno and Mr. Pataki.
"The big question is whether you can reach an agreement on what order to do things," one senator said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "One side says, build first, deregulate later. The other says, deregulate first and build later. It's not immediately obvious where the compromise is."
Independent experts and legislators say that to spur new construction, the city must change laws that discourage building. Current rules, they say, make it difficult to raze small buildings, combine lots and build something larger or to force a tenant out of a building that a landlord wants to demolish, even if replacement housing is provided.
"You can't increase the housing supply with laws like that," said Michael H. Schill, director of the New York University School of Law's Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy.
Some lawmakers are also looking at ways to soften the impact of vacancy decontrol.
One way would be to adopt the system used in Los Angeles, which allows landlords to charge whatever they can get when an apartment is vacant, but caps the annual increases once a tenant is in a unit. Democrats and their tenant allies are generally hostile to that approach, because it begins with vacancy decontrol.
Another method would be for the city, which sets the allowable rent increases each year, to set two: one for continuing tenants and a somewhat higher one for vacant units.
Take, for example, a 3 percent increase each year for continuing occupants and a 5 percent vacancy increase each year. For a tenant who stayed in an apartment for five years, the rent would rise 15.9 percent with compounding. But if the unit became vacant, the allowable rent would rise 27.6 percent over the same time period.
Such a system would let vacancy rates eventually rise to market levels, although more slowly than outright vacancy decontrol, making it an attractive alternative to some Democrats but not to Mr. Bruno or to landlords, who have already complained that vacancy decontrol would change things too slowly.
"That could work very well because it would move you along incrementally," said Elliott D. Sclar, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University. "The current system is a mess, but big, sudden changes almost always have disastrous unintended consequences."

COMPUTERS
I.B.M., Giddy at Last
Garry Kasparov pushed a pawn to h6 last week and, soon after, history was made: machine beat man. Big deal, you might say: a century ago, cars could outrace the fastest humans; a generation ago, computers could outcalculate the fastest math whizzes. But chess was a final digital frontier, a programmer's Mount Everest. And while it is not clear that Deep Blue's victory will give I.B.M. more than a symbolic lift, I.B.M. stock did a little celebratory jig, rising 6 points the day after the match, to $173.50. The next day it traded as high as $177 -- higher than its peak a decade ago, before it began its long trek to oblivion and back. So you could say, it would seem, that Big Blue has returned -- but then again, look at how the Dow industrials have soared in the last decade. If I.B.M. had kept pace, it would be selling for around $500 a share.
 
LIQUOR
Sharing a Smaller Glass
There was a distinct if-you-can't-lick-'em, join-'em quality to the announcement last week that Grand Metropolitan and Guinness were joining forces in the fifth-richest merger in history. Those two, after all, are the world's biggest distillers, with many of the top liquor brands -- Johnnie Walker, Dewar's, Smirnoff, Gordon's, you name it. But people are drinking less, and especially less hard liquor. And while this may be considered good news for society, it is bad news for liquor makers. So these two giants are, essentially, admitting that the market is shrinking and trying to find ways to turn a profit anyway -- by, for instance, creating a "premium" image for more of their products to lure snobbish baby boomers.
 
CASHING IN
Those 'Seinfeld' Salaries
An alarming number of people -- whether on basketball courts or in corner offices -- earn sums that are alarming even if you knock off a couple of zeros. But when the "Seinfeld" co-stars agreed to grace Thursday night with their continued presence for a reported $600,000 each an episode -- more than $10 million a season -- it hit a special nerve. Why? Well, the likes of Michael Jordan and Michael Eisner seem to inhabit some alien planet, but Elaine, George and Kramer not only seem to perch, like batty friends, right in our living rooms, they also seem to perch in the battier corners of our subconscious. It makes us itchy to have people so close making such faraway sums. One could argue, though, that since "Seinfeld" earns NBC more than $200 million a year, and since those actors are key to the show's magic, of course they should cash in. One can only hope that the show's other geniuses, the writers, are also cashing in.
 
DRUGS AND DOLLARS
Does Prison Pay?
Assume, for a cold-blooded moment, that the issue of drug sentencing is a purely economic one. Does it make economic sense to mandate draconian minimum sentences? Absolutely not, says a study released last week by the Rand Corporation. The study calculates that spending $1 million on long mandatory sentences reduces cocaine consumption nationwide by less than 29 pounds a year, while spending it on discretionary sentences would have twice the impact. And spending that same million on treating heavy cocaine users would cut consumption by up to 220 pounds a year. Why are mandatory sentences so costly? Simple. It costs $20,000 to $30,000 a year to lock someone up. In New York State alone, prisoners put away under the Rockefeller drug laws cost $260 million a year. That could cover a lot of drug treatment.

DRIVING HABITS
From Cliche to Cliche
"I wanted my own identity," a Michigan woman said defiantly as she traded in her mini-van. A reasonable request. The cliche dispensers had tagged her a "soccer mom," lumping her with the armies of suburbanites ferrying the nation's little darlings around in blimps on wheels. And when she ditched her mini-van, she was not alone: after soaring for a decade, mini-van sales are finally slumping -- though they still outsell station wagons (remember them?) 5 to 1. But if this seeker of individuality, this fearless pioneer, thought she was breaking free of cliches, she didn't quite make it. What she bought instead was a sport utility vehicle, trading yesterday's cliche for today's.
 
WELFARE WAGES
Can Workfare Add Up?
It's always been easy to say that welfare is in a mess and has to be fixed. The hard part is making the numbers add up. If, say, lots of people lose jobs to make way for welfare recipients who are required to work, that's no solution. And many people, including governors of all political stripes, have long maintained that there's no way that welfare-to-work programs can pay the minimum wage and stay afloat. In addition, some say, paying minimum wage would reduce the incentive to step up to private-sector jobs. Last week, though, the White House decided that the overriding principle should be a living wage for all, saying that most workfare participants should get the minimum wage: $4.75 an hour.
 
NEW YORK CITY
The Great Rent Divide
New York is a city ripe with extremes -- of wealth and poverty, of creative energy and rage. No wonder, then, that one of the city's favorite political battles, that over rent limits, should be waged with such apocalyptic pronouncements on both sides. Those on the tenant side say the ending of rent limits would reduce the city to a wasteland, banishing the middle class and any remotely creative types, while landlords and their allies envision a different wasteland -- of ever more abandoned buildings. Last week Gov. George E. Pataki plunged into this perennially polarized debate with some suggestions for (gasp) a compromise: lifting controls now for some wealthy tenants and ending rent protection on vacant apartments. He didn't quiet the voices of apocalypse, though, as tenants voiced fears of landlord harassment.
 
LAWSUITS
Digital Vs. Goliath
Well, you can't accuse Digital Equipment of not thinking big. When it sued Intel last week, it was no narrow patent-infringement complaint. No, Digital, a faded Goliath in the computer game, was aiming at the heart of today's personal-computer industry. Intel, it asserted, stole some Digital designs when it created its Pentium chips, which just happen to be the nerve centers of more than 85 percent of the world's PC's. What does Digital want? It didn't say. But Intel, today's Goliath, earned $5.2 billion last year, and Digital could certainly use a few pennies of that. Although Digital's stock rose and Intel's fell on word of the suit, it's a wide-open question what Digital could win. The only certainty is that lawyers will have their usual feeding frenzy.
 
BANKING
'To Pay Fee, Press 4'
On the telephone these days, it's often a mercilessly multiple-choice world. "Hello, this is your friendly computer. If you're happy, press 1. If your feet hurt, press 2. If you're going bald, press 3. There are no other choices. Have a nice day." When you call your bank, you're likely to face a similar stinginess of options, but with luck they'll fit your needs: your account balance, say, or determining whether a deposit has cleared. And the consolation of being treated like a microchip is that, well, at least it's free. It was, at any rate. Banks -- which seem to think up new fees by the day -- are starting to charge you to converse with the computer, with First Union hitting you for 50 cents a call after five monthly calls. That's a bargain, though, compared with talking with a human: after two calls in a month, First Union will charge you $2 a chat.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Bonds May Be Just the Port In the Storm of Uncertainty

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON

 BODY:
EXPECTATIONS are widespread that the Federal Reserve will again raise interest rates, perhaps as soon as Tuesday. But most investment advisers expect higher rates to do more damage to stock than to bond prices.
Just look at what happened after the Fed's last upward move. As J. P. Morgan Securities recently noted in a market advisory, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 5 percent of its value in the five trading days after the March 25 rate increase, while the long bond lost only about 1.5 percent. 
 Bonds, then, may be a haven in this time of uncertainty.
"There's a limit to the returns stocks can generate over time, and the more they move up, the more attractive bonds look," said Lewis J. Altfest, a financial planner in Manhattan. "In accounts that are normally 20 percent in bonds, they are now over 40 percent" because of market conditions.
Investors in bonds and bond funds are being urged to be selective, however. The extra yield generated by bonds of lower credit quality or longer maturities is minimal. So advisers recommend short- and intermediate-term portfolios of Government bonds, the safest kind.
"This is not the time to buy junk, and it is not the time to extend out on the yield curve," said Daniel Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, a newsletter published in Potomac, Md. "I think the way to make money is to buy Ginnie Mae bonds or bond funds. They generate above-average yields with much less volatility than Treasuries."
Last week the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was very close to the magic 7 percent level. "The only time the public gets interested in bonds is when the yield goes over 7 percent," said David J. Corcoran, president of York Securities, a discount broker in Manhattan. Especially if stocks falter, piercing the 7 percent barrier could cause individual investors to look at the bond market for the first time in a long time, he said.
But to earn that coupon, investors take on considerable rate risk. At a yield of 6.89 percent, the long bond trades at $96.59 for every $100 of face value. If interest rates were to rise to 7.50 percent, that would drive down the price of the bond 7.07 percent, to $89.76. Thomas Sowanick, chief fixed-income strategist for Merrill Lynch, foresees just such a rate increase by the fall.
In the opinion of many bond market analysts, the Federal Reserve -- having already raised short-term rates a quarter-point in March -- will be compelled to raise them further. There are two reasons: a surprisingly strong economy will put upward pressure on inflation and foreign rates, especially Japan's, will probably rise this year, luring investors away from United States bonds.
Foreign demand for Treasuries is a key underpinning of the credit markets and United States economic policy. Foreigners, including other central banks, own $1.125 trillion, or just under a third, of the $3.755 trillion of American debt not held by Government agencies.
"We just can't afford in the United States to lose any demand, and I think the Fed knows that," said John Breazeale, president of Weiss Money Management in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. "If demand doesn't go up, we've had it."
If 30-year rates rise to 7.50 percent by September, as Mr. Sowanick expects, holders of 30-year bonds will suffer a net loss of 4.16 percent, after taking their coupons into account.
For protection, investors can look for shorter maturities. "It seems to me that the two-year Treasury is an excellent hiding place," said James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a newsletter. "It's offering a yield of 6.20 percent, which is a pretty fancy yield in the global scheme of things for next to no risk."
Slightly higher yields, in exchange for a little more interest-rate risk, can be found in securities maturing in four or five years. Five-year Treasury bonds are now yielding about 35 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, less than their 30-year brethren, making the yield gap 96 percent.
Steven J. Bohlin, a fund manager with Thornburg Management in Santa Fe, N.M., said, "We run short- and intermediate-term bond funds, because that arena gives you 90 percent to 95 percent of the income return, and only one-third of the volatility."
Usually, the Thornburg Limited-Term Income fund is 30 percent to 35 percent invested in corporate bonds, which have a higher yield than Government issues. But the fund has only 6 percent in those issues now. "You're not being paid for the credit risk you're taking," Mr. Bohlin explained. Whereas corporate bonds normally yield 140 basis points over Treasuries, the spread is now only about 40 basis points.
A bit more yield can be eked out in the Ginnie Mae market, where home mortgages are pooled into securities backed by the full faith and credit of this Federal housing agency.
"We're seeing yields anywhere from 7.50 percent to 7.75 percent," said Roger Bayston, manager of the Franklin U.S. Government Securities fund, which invests primarily in Ginnie Maes. That is an unusually tight spread, he said, echoing Mr. Bohlin's comments about the corporate market.
Because they are linked to home loans that may stretch as long as 30 years into the future, Ginnie Maes appear to be long-term bonds, but they are not. Borrowers have the right to prepay their notes, and can be counted on to do so, typically by refinancing, if rates fall significantly. So Ginnie Maes tend to behave like intermediate-term bonds, liquidating in 10 years or less. The effective duration of Mr. Bayston's portfolio is 4.25 years.
Predicting the direction and magnitude of changes in interest rates has proved difficult even for professionals. John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors, says investors should not try. He recommends a ladder of maturities of individual bonds from one to 10 years, so that one-tenth of the portfolio is rolling over at current rates each year. "That way you don't have to worry about interest rates," he said.
Mr. Bohlin's portfolio is run in a similar way. "We try to keep the average at five years, with 10 percent coming due from now till 10 years from now," he said. Right now, though, he has taken a slightly defensive posture, with a duration of slightly more than four years in his portfolio.
Wherever you come down on the risk gauge, valuations seem to favor bonds. "Treasuries are relatively about as cheap as they get to corporate securities, and the stock market is about as expensive as it has ever been," Mr. Grant said. "No matter how you look at the bond market, you're bound to be impressed by what it has to offer."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Less Flying Up Front Means Fewer Ego Trips

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW

 BODY:
ROGER A. ENRICO, the chief executive of Pepsico, can do it anytime he wants. Ann D. McLaughlin, the former Labor Secretary, not only does it, she occasionally has General Motors pay for it. Chris Evert won't say whether she does it. And at I.B.M., managers can do it only if they are going to do it for a long time.
So what's this deadly sin? 
 Flying first class.
With companies slashing travel budgets in recent years, executives who once flew first class are now routinely sequestered in the rear. The exodus has made the first-class ticket one of the last perks of corporate success, on a par with country club memberships and access to the corporate jet.
"Being able to sit up front is the last sign of achieving high rank in the company," said one director in the Amdahl Corporation's London office, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's a form of segregation, really. Your boss is in front and you're in the back. It causes a lot of frustration. Some executives in our company, when they hear they can't fly first class, get so annoyed they won't even take the trip."
Such fragile egos may have cause to be upset. Restrictions on first-class air travel have not only been swift; they have even lassoed chief executives and their boardroom colleagues. In 1988, according to a survey by Runzheimer International, a business travel consulting firm, only 23 percent of American companies that allowed employees to fly first class placed limits on which employees could do so. By last year, that number had climbed to 41 percent.
The carnage in the executive suite was just as severe. In 1988, 59 percent of top officers -- chief executives, presidents and the like -- at companies in the survey had special travel perks including first-class tickets and rooms at luxury hotels. Only 48 percent still had such perks last year.
The loss of privileges is part of a drive by corporate boards to bolster their companies' stock prices. The idea is to slash expenses, thus giving a lift to earnings and impressing Wall Street's fickle analysts. The strategy has worked: many companies have been notching record earnings, and the bull market in stocks has roared ahead.
"Our executives only fly first class on rare occasions," said John Hoey, vice president of Sylvan Learning Systems in Baltimore, an education services company. "We don't want our shareholders to be unhappy with us. First-class air fare, country club memberships -- those things sound really extravagant. There are better things we can invest our money in."
CORPORATE America's move to save bucks hasn't depleted the world's first-class cabins, but it has made a dent. First-class travel accounted for 10.8 percent of all international tickets sold in 1993 to corporate clients, but only 6.3 percent last year, according to Topaz Enterprises, a travel auditing and consulting firm in Portland, Ore.
Much of the decline can be traced to the growing popularity of business class -- which has many of the amenities of first class and now accounts for 35.7 percent of all tickets sold to companies, according to Topaz Enterprises -- and the airlines' push to capitalize on it. Several airlines recently reconfigured their jets, taking seats from first-class cabins and adding them to business class -- making first class holier turf.
Few people have wallets deep enough to buy admittance into first class. A first-class round-trip ticket on United's flight from Newark to London, for example, goes for $7,845 -- enough to pay your child's tuition at Stanford for one quarter. A ticket for that flight in business class, which United calls Connoisseur Class, costs $4,959, while unrestricted coach fare is $1,333.
Despite the high prices, first class is not considered a profit generator by most airlines, according to Wall Street analysts, in part because many first-class passengers, using upgrades from frequent-flier programs, don't pay for the privilege. But Brian Harris, an airline analyst at Lehman Brothers, said first class had "a subtle but powerful impact on airline revenues."
"The correct way to look at first-class service," he said, is as "a place to upgrade business travelers." That builds brand loyalty.
Many people who pay for first class are celebrities, who would rather die than slum in public; top-ranked corporate officers, mostly from large companies, and some sales department stars, who bring in so much money for a company that they demand -- and get -- anything they want.
Filling up the rest of the cabin, however, are frequent fliers who have earned coupons to move up to first class at little or no extra cost. It's not that they are extremely welcome in first class; airlines would love to fill those seats with full-fare passengers. And many well-heeled travelers, who are pros at the art of eating caviar, can spot impostors three aisles away.
These "slummers," as they're known in country club lingo, aren't to be taken lightly. Virtually any serious traveler can compile enough miles to land a first-class seat. And many common folks are doing just that. A 1996 survey by Frequent Flyer Magazine showed that only 5 percent of its readers bought first-class tickets, while 32 percent regularly flew first class with upgrades.
Alarmed by these numbers, the airline industry invented business class several years ago, not only to regain lost corporate accounts, but as a cheaper place to park upgraded frequent fliers. The strategy has worked, at least for now. Some companies that had scrapped first-class travel now allow employees to sit in business class on some international flights.
The trouble, of course, is that business class is second-hand stuff compared with a good first-class pampering. It's only natural that executives would want to hobnob with celebrities and sample the same dishes and drinks offered to the likes of Princess Diana and Kevin Costner.
Today's first-class luxury, however, pales next to that of the early days of aviation, when airlines offered separate sleeping berths and dining areas. But airlines are gradually beefing up their amenities.
Fly first class on Virgin Atlantic and not only will a masseuse pound out your tensions but a manicurist will file your nails into shape. British Airways recently introduced a first-class seat that folds down to a 6-foot, 6-inch bed, while United began offering passengers a day room in a local hotel to shower and freshen up after the flight. The luxuries not only coax curious coach travelers into paying the extra fare, but help establish first class as cherished ground.
THE differences between classes can be shocking. On United's Flight 906 from Newark to London, economy passengers sit in tiny 18.5-inch-wide seats, pay $4 to watch the movie, and chomp on teriyaki pot roast or tortellini Mornay. Order wine and you're out another $3 -- exact change is appreciated.
Business-class passengers, though, kick back in 20-inch-wide reclining chairs and spend the seven hours sampling a selection of cocktails and wine or watching "Fargo" or "Jerry Maguire" on individual screens. When it comes to dinner, they have three choices: filet mignon, filet of Dover sole or linguini with leek and bell pepper sauce.
But step into first class and a flight attendant immediately hands you a tray of Russian caviar and a tall glass of Dom Perignon. If that doesn't suit your fancy, there is always an appetizer of lobster tail, sorbet or a green salad. You can also eat dinner whenever you want and gorge on four entrees or seven buffet courses, served on fine china.
But taking advantage of such amenities is becoming more difficult. And executives are frustrated that the rules of landing a first-class ticket have seldom been so varied from company to company. At General Motors, for example, top-ranked executives and directors can fly first class -- as a director, Mrs. McLaughlin, the former Labor Secretary, qualifies -- while middle managers cannot. However, any employee who flies 75,000 miles in one calendar year can fly first class all the next year, a company spokesman said. I.B.M. allows its executives to sit up front only on long flights.
It should come as no surprise that chief executives have plenty of travel options. Most, like Mr. Enrico of Pepsico, fly first class only when the corporate jet is not available. The super-rich follow the same policy. Doris Duke owned an elaborately furnished 737 to travel from one of her estates to the next, and she employed several pilots full time.
Some celebrities, however, believe their method of travel is private information, on a par with whom they're dating. Affable on most matters, Ms. Evert didn't respond to questions about where she sits on the plane because, her spokeswoman said, it could endanger her security.
Ready for more confusion? Dean Witter Reynolds allows department heads to decide who flies where, and a quick tabulation shows that most of the company's gurus travel in coach. At Whirlpool, flying first class is not unheard of for top executives; the only problem is that one of the company's 28 elected officers has to sign off on the trip. Lately, they appear to be stingy. According to a company spokesman, only 1 in 1,000 tickets the company buys is in first class.
Even the gods at the nation's travel magazines aren't flush with royal treatment. Thomas J. Wallace, editor of Conde Nast Traveler, can fly first class, as can Elizabeth W. Henriques, the magazine's publisher, but the privilege stops there.
"Flying first class is definitely a perk that comes with my job," Mr. Wallace said. "It's the only place on the airplane where you can get horizontal."
He added: "What would happen if I could no longer fly first class? I'd weep."
One rule appears paramount, however. The lower you are on the ladder, the less chance you have of ever tasting free Dom Perignon at 40,000 feet.
"What executives get to fly first class still comes down to how high they are on the ladder and their job function," said Valerie Estep, president of Topaz Enterprises. "But it also depends on their industry. Financial-market companies are much more likely to buy a first-class ticket than manufacturing firms, for example."
The size of the company also matters. Only 32 percent of vice presidents at small companies included in the Runzheimer survey can fly first class, compared with 78 percent at very large ones.
First class may sound like the Holy Grail, but it is obtainable -- at least by one middle-level employee. "I get no rest if I fly in the back," said M Carling, a senior systems architect for P&L Systems, a technological consulting firm in Bucks, England. "If the company's paying, everyone sits in the back, including the chief executive. But I sit in first class. I bring in more money than he does, and if they want me to work well, they should pay to see that that happens."
 
There's No Class Like First Class of Days Gone By
EVEN though you've made it to the front of the plane -- whether you're a celebrity or simply a pretender on a frequent-flier upgrade -- you still haven't seen flying at its most luxurious.
When commercial flights began in the 1920's, airlines provided nothing but first-class service, and it was, by anyone's definition, extravagant. Dinner on an Air Union flight from Paris to London in 1927 consisted of seven courses -- including crayfish Parisienne and plum ice cream -- along with the choice of champagne, whisky, red or white Bordeaux, coffee or mineral water.
Soon, lavish meals were not enough. In 1936, a Douglas Sleeper Transport -- a plane flown by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, among others, to carry 16 people from Europe to the Far East -- offered a full pantry, several toilets and large sleeping berths comparable to those of Europe's finest rail cars.
The compartments also had seats that were larger than those in first class today.
The elaborate service was deemed necessary because the airlines' clientele included some of the world's most powerful people. Britain's Prince George routinely took Imperial Airways' London-to-Paris flight in 1928, often flying in disguise, while Mistinguett, a French actress, was a regular passenger on Air Union on the same route. To have such people complain about service could have put an airline out of business.
American film stars, however, did not begin flying until 1935. Convinced that air travel was unsafe, Hollywood's studio heads put clauses in actors' contracts that prevented them from boarding planes, regardless of the distance. When stars finally began taking flights, they expected, and received, royal treatment.
The first treats from Pan Am included socks with cardboard soles, to prevent passengers' feet from swelling during flight.
During these years, however, United States carriers still didn't coddle first-class passengers as much as the European airlines did. American executives apparently preferred convenient flights over lavish meals and bottles of vintage Bordeaux, and the airlines delivered. DAVID J. MORROW

HEADLINE: Chinese Christians Face No Persecution

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A. M. Rosenthal (column, May 13) repeats the charge that Christians in China "who try to worship openly and freely" are being tortured and persecuted, and he asks readers to support Congressional legislation that "would put an economic price on the persecution of Christians." 
 But many scholars familiar with the situation in China find this claim exaggerated. In the April 25 issue of Commonweal magazine, for example, Richard Madsen, whose book on the Chinese Catholic Church will appear shortly, argues that a vigorous revival of Roman Catholicism has taken place recently in China and that Catholics are permitted to worship publicly. The previous persecution, it turns out, only strengthened the church.
The danger now is not from external persecution but from divisions within the church that arose when the Government did not permit the Vatican to exercise religious authority. Although Catholic churches must be properly registered, the Government has relaxed its attempts to interfere in liturgical matters.
Last month when I was in Wuhan, I also learned about a similar resurgence of Protestantism. Recently there have even been invitations extended to scholars in Judaism to lecture in China. Sadly, one cannot say the same about Tibetan Buddhism, although Buddhist temples not associated with the Dalai Lama are also thriving.

Beijing goes for the benefits of financial news without any of the downside.

BYLINE: By Seth Faison 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
WHEN Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, met recently with China's senior leaders, he delivered what was essentially a primer on fundamental characteristics of a market economy, a topic of endless fascination for the engineers of this nation's half-achieved shift from a state-run to a market system.
One of the elements Mr. Greenspan raised, United States officials said afterward, was the critical importance of free-flowing financial information for the development of capital markets, which China is in the midst of starting up. 
 Mr. Greenspan specifically warned about the damage that could be caused by China's plans, not yet in force, to control the distribution of financial information by international news organizations. His Chinese hosts listened carefully, but apparently did not respond in detail.
Information flow in China has followed economic and trade growth -- sharply upward -- over the last decade, so the New China News Agency stunned news organizations when it announced in January 1996 that it would assume new powers to supervise the content and sales of international news organizations that offer financial information here.
Now, after 16 months of negotiations, the issue is at a critical stage. The New China News Agency recently demanded that news organizations agree to its restrictions or lose the right to sign up new customers.
The issue of access to financial information cuts to the root of concerns among leaders of developing nations, who are interested in the benefits of the market but afraid of its limits on the role of government.
Chinese leaders seem especially perplexed by this. They are enthralled with the way capital markets raise money, but are nervous about the free-flowing information that comes with markets.
In recent years, however, the amount of available news and financial information has risen exponentially. There has not been the challenge to the legitimacy of the Communist Party that many old-school leaders feared, but its authority over the day-to-day lives of ordinary people is gradually diminishing.
By early 1996, Reuters and Dow Jones Markets, a unit of Dow Jones & Company, already had several hundred customers each, mainly Chinese banks and financial institutions that trade on international commodity, currency and other markets.
Executives at these news companies were shocked at the way the New China News Agency was trying to become both a regulator and a competitor -- last year it started its own financial news service, New China Financial Information -- in an era when China's leaders continually proclaim their determination to separate government from business.
The agency's officials apparently won approval from the Government to expand their role by portraying themselves as a necessary lifeguard at the swelling pool of electronic information available in China.
But during subsequent negotiations, foreign executives said, agency officials seemed most interested in learning about the commercial and technological operations, apparently for use at New China Financial.
In addition to wanting to learn who exactly the customers were and how much they paid, and how software and hardware operated, the press agency also asked Reuters and Dow Jones to pay a large percentage of their revenues in China.
Unfortunately for the New China News Agency, China's leaders are intent on joining the World Trade Organization, and the agency's desire to restrict rather than free the operations of international companies seem to go against W.T.O. principles.
By late last year, foreign executives believed their negotiations with the New China News Agency would effectively be postponed during China's efforts to gain entry to the organization this year.
But last month agency officials informed Reuters and Dow Jones that they would have to accept the agency's new regulations, or they would be denied any new customers.
"This issue is now larger than Xinhua and a few foreign information companies," said James McGregor, chief representative for Dow Jones in China, referring to the New China News Agency by its name in Chinese. "It's a W.T.O. issue. We don't want to do anything that would hurt China's chances of getting into the W.T.O."
Mr. McGregor said he and Reuters executives accepted the desire of China's leaders to check the information that foreign companies bring into the nation. But he held that the New China News Agency's double role as a regulator and a competitor goes against every principle of fair business competition.
The New China News Agency has modified its stance, dropping its original demand to be paid a percentage of each news agency's revenue in China. The initial request of 40 percent dropped to 15 percent, and later to 7 percent, and last month was dropped altogether.
It is even questionable whether the central Government would again approve the news agency's request for an expanded role if the decision were to be made today, a measure of how the political and technological atmosphere has changed in China over the last 16 months.
When the restrictive regulations were announced in early 1996, Chinese leaders were alarmed that the arrival of the Internet in China was threatening to bring in information they could not control.
Yet after blocking many Web sites of international news organizations last year, including The Wall Street Journal but not The New York Times, the authorities lifted the ban around the first of the year. Although some Web sites with politically sensitive content remain blocked, most news sites are openly accessible.

HEADLINE: Rains Come to Wall Street And With Them, Godzilla

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN 

 BODY:
Several hundred somberly dressed people, black umbrellas bobbing over their heads, splayed across the steps of Federal Hall and into the intersection of Wall and Broad Streets. In an instant, they turned, screamed, dropped their umbrellas, bumped into one another, fell to the pavement or scrambled away in terror. A few stared, wild-eyed, into the empty sky, as though they saw something there.
"O.K., O.K.!" Greg Hale shouted to them through a cloth-covered bullhorn on Saturday afternoon. "That was good. Listen, people. We need to be safe. We don't need to be running people over." 
 Mr. Hale, an assistant director on the new American version of "Godzilla," reassembled the throng of a dozen stunt people and several hundred extras. The production spent Saturday and yesterday on Wall Street, filming scenes of "mayhem, lots of mayhem," said Dean Devlin, a producer and co-writer of the film.
A hundred yards down Broad Street, the director, Roland Emmerich, and a dozen sound and video technicians sat beneath a blue tent watching the rehearsal. Just out of camera range, specialists in mechanical special effects caused a line of taxicabs to bounce with each Godzillan footfall.
Two 170-foot Condor cranes held aloft a pair of rainmaking grids, ready to drench the set. A 72-foot crane held a camera at its tip, shooting what would eventually be Godzilla's point of view as he stomped toward the Stock Exchange, swooping down for a closer look at the fleeing extras.
A production assistant explained to a car-driving extra what was expected of him: "You drive up, see all the people running past your car, stop, look over your shoulder out of the window, see Godzilla, register it, then get out of the car, look up, turn and run away. Got it?"
He got it.
Location filming began in early May in Jersey City (where actors stared across the harbor toward what will be a Godzilla-ravaged lower Manhattan), moved to the Fulton Fish Market (boat crashes into pier, debris falls from sky) and the busy intersection at the foot of the Flatiron Building on East 23d Street (soldiers and armored vehicles blasting away) before moving to Wall Street. Beginning today, they will shoot on the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, on the Manhattan Bridge and in Central Park before moving to Los Angeles.
As with other recent Hollywood productions in New York, the movie drew complaints, this time from residents near the Flatiron building, concerned about the congestion, noise and lights. The production had permits to film for three nights at the site, from the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, which expects Godzilla to bring more than $500,000 into the New York economy.
On Thursday, sensitive to the complaints, the film makers decided to fire a blank round from one of the tanks in Madison Square Park near 23d Street, to see how loud it was.
"It was really loud," Mr. Devlin said. "It was too loud."
So the film makers shot the scene without firing from the tanks. "We'll just add a computer-generated muzzle flash later," Mr. Devlin said.
Godzilla will not make an appearance at any of the New York locations. Instead, said William Fay, another producer, he will be added later, too, a combination of computer-generated images, mechanical animatronics and a fellow in a Godzilla suit, whatever will work best.
As with other extraordinarily expensive Hollywood action films, many of the details are being kept under wraps. The plot? "Well," Mr. Devlin said. "Obviously, Godzilla attacks New York." Other than that, it's a secret. Godzilla's size? A secret. His look? A secret. The names of some of the characters? Secret. The actual shooting budget, variously reported to be $90 million to $100 million? Also secret.
All of this secrecy has spawned several Web pages dedicated to Godzilla rumors, forcing Mr. Devlin and Mr. Emmerich to create their own rumor-bashing Web page, with a flashing headline that reads: "Jennifer Anniston is not in Godzilla!"
Is the new Godzilla only as tall as a man? No, they say. Will he change size and shape? No again. Do laser beams fly from Godzilla's eyes? "If you see one laser beam shoot out of Godzilla's eyes in our movie," the Web answered, "you can mail us your ticket stub and Dean and Roland will come over to your house and bake you a Key lime pie."
Not everything can be secret, though. Matthew Broderick will star as Nick Tatapolous, a biologist. He will be joined by Jean Reno as Raymond, an insurance investigator; Michael Lerner as the beleaguered Mayor of New York, Hank Azaria as a television cameraman named Animal, Harry Shearer as a nasty television newsman and Maria Pitillo as an aspiring young reporter.
The movie will be dark and wet and smoky, taking place largely at night and during an unrelenting rainstorm. "It pretty much rains most of the time in the movie," Mr. Devlin said. The extras on Wall Street were all dressed in dark clothes, the umbrellas all black. A smoke truck passed back and forth along the set, maintaining a proper level of murk.
Hoping to elbow aside the competition for 1998's summer movie season, Tri-Star Pictures announced it would release "Godzilla" on the Wednesday before Memorial Day.
The film-making team, which made the 1996 summer hit "Independence Day," inherited "Godzilla" from Jan De Bont, the director of "Speed" and "Twister." Mr. De Bont left the project a year ago when Tri-Star balked at the $130 million budget. Mr. Devlin and Mr. Emmerich had already turned down an earlier version of "Godzilla," fearing that it would be too campy. This time, though, they accepted, keeping the notion of Godzilla's attacking New York while rewriting the script in a darker direction.
"We didn't want to do a 'Mars Attacks!' " Mr. Devlin explained. "We felt it could be done straight and still have a lot of humor and a lot of thrills."
Godzilla made his first screen appearance in 1954, in the Toho Films production "Gojira," its name a combination of "gorilla" and the Japanese word for whale. The radiation-breathing, 400-foot, dinosaurlike creature has appeared in 22 films.
Despite the inevitable difficulties, the film makers decided they had to shoot some scenes in Manhattan.
"New York has a very specific look and a very specific energy that you really can't duplicate from some other location," Mr. Fay said.
Mr. Emmerich gave the producers his "wish list" of locations and it was whittled down, depending on what was available and what was possible.
Under the tent on Broad Street, Mr. Emmerich decided there had been enough rehearsal. One last water truck moved up Broad Street, spraying the cars and the buildings. The smoke truck moved through again. "We need rain," a production assistant shouted and a drenching downpour fell from the grids.
"Action," Mr. Emmerich said.
Footfall: Thump! The taxis jumped. Thump! The crowd raced up Broad, slipping on the water, clambering over one another, umbrellas flying. Thump! The crowd at Federal Hall dissolved in terror.
"O.K., cut," Mr. Emmerich said. Assistant directors shouted into bullhorns: "Cut!"
But the extras kept running.
"They can't hear us with all the noise from the rain machines," Mr. Fay shouted. "Somebody stop them before they get to Greenwich Village!"

Left for Last: Overhauling Welfare

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
THESE are critical days for New York's welfare system. At least in theory.
The state has just six weeks, or until July 1, to revamp its entire welfare system to bring it into compliance with the new Federal law. This means it must come up with a plan to identify the fathers of children on welfare, to find work for an increasing proportion of the adults and to nudge almost all of them off the rolls within five years. 
 Practically every aspect of the new Federal law poses an enormous challenge for New York, which is, after California, home to the largest welfare population in the country. And no matter what shape the state's eventual plan takes, it is bound to be one of the most consequential pieces of social legislation to come out of Albany in a generation.
And yet, welfare is a virtual nonissue here these days, a victim, it seems, of the can't-walk-and-chew-gum syndrome that so often afflicts state government.
At the start of the year, welfare was expected to dominate this legislative session. But then the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, announced his plan to scrap New York's rent laws. The Capitol has talked about almost nothing else since.
By the time Gov. George E. Pataki and the legislative leaders do finally get around to focusing on welfare, presumably sometime after the rent issue is resolved, it will be crammed into the usual end-of-session crush, when hundreds of bills are slapped together in a few frantic days.
As one lobbyist who closely monitors the issue lamented: "You are talking about the greatest overhaul of our social services since they were created 60 years ago. But we could get a welfare law written in two days by people who have had very little sleep. That's a little frightening to think about."
ALL the delaying comes at what is actually an unusually opportune moment for New York to be reconsidering its welfare policies. For along with the new Federal requirements comes a huge gift of cash.
This cash, known in Albany as the "windfall," stems from the formula the Federal Government is using to distribute welfare dollars for the coming year. The formula bases payments on states' welfare caseloads in 1995, but since that time caseloads in most states have significantly declined. In New York, the difference translates into a surplus of $730 million.
Advocates for the poor contend that the windfall should be used to insure genuine welfare reform rather than mere welfare reduction. It should be spent, they say, to educate welfare recipients, improve child care and provide effective job training.
"Here's a chance to really make some major investments, to make sure every kid gets high-quality child care and every mother who is supposed to get off welfare has the wherewithal to do so," said Anne Erickson, legislative coordinator for the Greater Upstate Law Project.
The Democratic-controlled Assembly is urging much the same thing, proposing that most of the windfall be reinvested in the system. But the Governor has taken a different tack, recommending that more than half the windfall be used for what he calls state and local "fiscal relief" and what really amounts to general spending. The Republican-controlled Senate, meanwhile, has yet to take an official stand on the windfall, or for that matter, on any other welfare-related issue.
The question of how to use the windfall is expected to be enormously contentious -- once, that is, negotiations actually get under way.
ALBANY'S dilatory attitude is very much in keeping with past practice.
While many other states, including New Jersey and Massachusetts, have spent the better part of the last decade moving aggressively to redesign their welfare systems, New York has mostly confined itself to incremental steps. So riven has state government been by partisan and geographical disputes that bolder initiatives barely seemed worth the paper they were printed on.
Indeed, the state's one real effort at innovation, the Child Assistance Program, or CAP, has largely stalled.
The program, instituted as a pilot project under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, is supposed to encourage welfare recipients to work by, among other things, allowing them to keep more of their earnings. According to a five-year study of the program that the Pataki administration reluctantly released a few months ago, CAP has been a solid success in the handful of counties where it has been tried.
But the administration has shown only marginal interest in expanding CAP, arguing that it has little relevance in the new world of welfare. And so New York finds itself, with the deadline looming, scrambling to catch up with the changing times.
As Gary Burtless, a labor economist at the Brookings Institution, put it: "Even little old Arkansas has been thinking about this since the early 80's. New York does seem way behind."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: DIGITAL COMMERCE;
Profiting as a business-to-business middleman on the Internet is tricky.

BYLINE: By Steve Lohr 

 BODY:
THE idea seemed to be a winner. An on-line shopping mall for manufacturers, using the power of the Internet as a low-cost medium of communications to link industrial buyers and sellers. It was a classic application of technology to an economic inefficiency -- the often Dickensian business chore known as procurement. It still means thumbing through hulking directories for part numbers and product specifications and consumes millions of hours and billions of dollars a year.
A company deploying the Internet to streamline the procurement process would be tapping a gold mine. That was the vision that attracted Jim P. Manzi, the former chairman of the Lotus Development Corporation, to Nets Inc. in early 1996. Last summer, Fortune magazine selected the Internet commerce service as one of "25 cool companies" to watch. 
 Ten days ago, Nets filed for bankruptcy protection. The business had clearly not developed as quickly as Mr. Manzi had hoped, the private company was losing money at a torrid pace and a scramble to secure additional capital was unsuccessful.
The Nets bankruptcy, it seems, carries two lessons. First, playing the middleman role on the Internet is going to be a tricky way to make a living. The essence of the Internet, after all, is that it enables people and businesses to connect directly -- sidestepping intermediaries like distributors and retailers.
Second, the early opportunities for Internet market makers are going to be defined narrowly in specific industry sectors as opposed to the across-the-board manufacturers' mall formula of Nets.
"Nets was way too broad," said Bill Doyle, a senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., who worked briefly at Nets. "They bit off a lot more than a start- up can chew."
In recent months, Mr. Manzi had tried to narrow the focus of his company's on-line service, called Industry.net. Since February, Nets focused on the basic goods used to run businesses from office supplies to mops -- called maintenance, repair and operations, or M.R.O. -- instead of the more complicated parts and components used in products made by manufacturers.
Yet the multi-industry on-line malls will probably be the bailiwick of a few major companies with deep pockets and patience. The General Electric Company and Thomas Register, a leading publisher of industrial parts directories, are working jointly on an Internet commerce offering.
Someday, the Internet will be able to handle on-line blueprints and even allow industrial buyers to test how parts perform using simulation software distributed over the Net. But not yet.
"Someone like G.E. has a shot at creating a broad Internet mall for manufacturers, but everyone else is going to have to satisfy themselves with smaller vertical market communities," Mr. Doyle of Forrester said. "To run a successful on-line mall, companies are going to have to capture the gestalt of a market segment, really narrow stuff like plastic injection molders."
This, of course, is not to say that business-to-business commerce on the Internet is going to be insignificant or grow slowly. Just the opposite will be the case, analysts predict. Business-to-business sales on line, estimated at $600 million last year, are expected to reach roughly $66 billion by 2000, Forrester projects.
Most of the early traffic is businesses dealing directly with each other, with no intermediaries. Cisco Systems Inc., for example, is selling $5 million a day worth of its networking gear from its Web site to corporate customers. The savings in paperwork and labor costs, Cisco estimates, are running at $535 million annually. The Dell Computer Corporation has just begun Internet selling and is making sales of more than $1 million a day on line. Eighty-five percent of Dell's customers are corporations, and its goal is to handle nearly all its sales on the Internet eventually.
"It's going to be very difficult to make money as a middleman on the Internet, as opposed to using the Net to cut costs," observed Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a technology newsletter.
The kind of electronic mall with the best chance of success is probably one like Digital Market Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif. The start-up was founded by Scott Hammond, a 35-year-old electrical engineer who worked at Xerox, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle. The company grew out of his frustration with inefficiency in finding and buying electronic components over the years.
Digital Market, with 30 employees, focuses only on electronic components. It is a field, Mr. Hammond explains, that is deep and fast-changing -- his service tracks 1.5 million different electronic components whose prices and availability change constantly. He believes the field should be ripe for the application of Internet technology, which makes it easy to quickly update a data bank.
The Government apparently agrees. Last November, Digital Market received a grant from the Government's Defense Advanced Research Project Agency to develop electronic commerce technology.
The problem at Nets, as one analyst said, was that it was "a mile wide and an inch deep." Digital Market will not take the same tack, Mr. Hammond said. "We're an inch wide and mile deep," he said.
Even the International Business Machines Corporation, a deep-pocketed company familiar with many industries, is cautious about trying to be an Internet middleman. Beyond selling software for business-to-business commerce, I.B.M. is becoming a hub for information and on-line transactions. Yet it focuses on industry niches like one for oil-exploration engineers, Petroconnect.
"We're going to be very selective about stepping into the middleman role," said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, general manager of I.B.M.'s Internet division.

HEADLINE: Dana C. Creel, 84; Headed the Rockefeller Brothers Fund

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
Dana C. Creel, whose philanthropic hand helped mold the Rockefeller Brothers Fund into an eclectic charitable organization, died last Thursday night at his home, Haisdan Farm in Sharon, Conn.
He was 84, said Fraser P. Seitel, an adviser to the Rockefeller family. 
 Mr. Creel, who headed the Rockefeller Brothers Fund from 1950 to 1975, began his career as a banker after graduating from Emory Law School in 1939. He quickly found a calling in philanthropy when representatives for the Rockefeller family invited him to become the fund's financial adviser later that year.
During his tenure as president and director of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Mr. Creel dispersed $150 million to a variety of causes, many of them contentious at the time.
Among the biggest beneficiaries were groups working for integration in the South. Money was given to the Southern Regional Council to study ways of integrating communities and to the National Urban League for the development of the Skills Bank, which recruited blacks for industry and government. Grants were also set up for members of minority groups wanting to attend law school.
He also gave to groups that furthered women's education at a time when many people opposed it, and he championed birth control and cancer research. His choices of charities and his low-key style made him a maverick among directors of groups like the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Endowment.
A $6 million donation helped create the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
Mr. Creel, who was born in Smyrna, Ga., and also attended Harvard Business School, joined the Army in World War II, becoming a second lieutenant in a counterintelligence unit in Asia. Economic development programs in devastated areas of Asia, Latin America and Africa also benefited from his largesse.
"Dana Creel was an innovative giver who directed money to places that were not particularly prominent or popular at the time," Mr. Seitel said. "These were not the typical interests of wealthy people, and he helped change the focus of giving."
Mr. Creel is survived by his wife, Jane Haislip Creel of Sharon; a sister, Virginia Creel Clark of Tucson, Ariz., and a nephew, David Clark of Concord, Mass. Mr. Creel had no children.
