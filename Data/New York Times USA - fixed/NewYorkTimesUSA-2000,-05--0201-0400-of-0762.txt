HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Gives Firmest Support Yet for China Bill

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
As the Congressional vote on permanent normalized trade relations for China draws closer, Vice President Al Gore is stepping up his activities to promote it. 
 He spoke more forcefully yesterday for the agreement than he usually does. And today he plans to attend a White House meeting with President Clinton and former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, among others, to lobby for the measure, which Congress is to vote on later this month.
Mr. Gore has been tepid in his support so far for the agreement, largely because organized labor, which backs him, opposes it. But speaking up for it serves Mr. Gore's political purposes now by helping to counter the impression, reinforced during the controversy over Elian Gonzalez, that he does not take principled stands and instead panders to those whose support he seeks.
At the annual meeting of Associated Press publishers and editors yesterday in New York, Mr. Gore did not raise the China issue, but was asked about it in a question-and-answer session. Uncharacteristically, he delved into the reasons he believed the trade bill should pass; normally, when he mentions the issue at all, he gives it fairly short shrift.
"This doesn't reduce any U.S. tariffs; it only reduces Chinese tariffs," he said at the Associated Press meeting, which was held at St. Bartholomew's Church in Midtown Manhattan.
"If we turned it down," he added, referring to the World Trade Organization, "it wouldn't keep China from coming into the W.T.O.; China would come into the W.T.O. anyway."
Failing to approve the trade agreement, he said, would not hurt China but would put the United States at a "severe disadvantage" with its own trading partners.
Today, the vice president will appear in the East Room at the White House with President Clinton, former Presidents Ford and Carter, and two former secretaries of state, Henry A. Kissinger and James A. Baker III.
A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said that former President George Bush, the father of Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, was invited, but "due to a scheduling conflict, he is not able to attend." Governor Bush supports the trade agreement.
Mr. Gore's commitment to the matter has been in some doubt since he won the endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last fall. He said then that he supported it, leading two of the organization's most powerful members, the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, to withhold their endorsement of his candidacy.
Mr. Gore has tried to win over James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union, but Mr. Hoffa, who is up for re-election and faces his own internal politics, has recently expressed more interest in the third-party candidacy of Patrick J. Buchanan, who also opposes the treaty.
Mr. Gore has said he has called some members of Congress to push them to support the treaty, but has not said how many. Aides say he has made calls from his campaign plane and from his office and that if the vice president did not want to appear in the East Room today, he would not do so, suggesting that he sees some political benefit in standing with President Clinton on an issue that the administration has advanced as important to the economy.

HEADLINE: State Dept. Faults U.S. Aid For War Refugees as Inept

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Although the Clinton administration has made "humanitarian intervention" a centerpiece of its foreign policy, it has done a poor job of delivering emergency aid to the people who need it, an internal State Department report says.
The "humanitarian factor has become central to senior policy makers' deliberations over U.S. foreign policy priorities," the report states. But the officials who are responsible for easing human suffering in foreign crises have little influence over high-level decision making, and in some cases are deliberately shut out, the study says. 
 The report, written by a top adviser to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, chronicles the billions of dollars in emergency assistance that have been sent to Afghanistan, Kosovo and Sudan to help people whose lives have been disrupted by war and to Honduras in the aftermath of a big hurricane in 1998.
Last year, when Serbian forces began expelling ethnic Albanians from Kosovo several days after the start of the NATO bombing campaign, senior administration officials publicly insisted that they were prepared for Serbian actions. Despite that, there was little food and shelter on hand as hundreds of thousands of refugees flooded into Macedonia and Albania.
The report describes the administration's main funnel for assistance to the expelled Kosovars, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as suffering from "weak leadership" in the region and adds that the administration was unable to change this.
In Sudan, where the United States has spent more than $1 billion in the last 10 years trying to ease suffering in longest-running civil war in Africa, the report says the assistance has become so routine that it now appears to act as a substitute for peacemaking efforts to resolve the conflict.
The report, initiated by Morton H. Halperin, director of policy planning at the State Department, and based on interviews with senior administration officials, is an unclassified document. But it was not made public until now.
It was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the National Security Archive, a group that specializes in collecting government documents through requests and suits. The report was completed in January and has been submitted to Dr. Albright's office.
In outlining options for improving response, the report suggests that the relief programs run by the Agency for International Development could be folded into the State Department.
This is one step short of what Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been recommending since he took charge of the panel in 1995.
Mr. Helms, who favors abolishing the agency as an independent entity and putting it into the State Department, said he believed "bringing A.I.D. into the State Department will mean more effective use of the aid," his spokesman, Marc Thiessen, said.
On the campaign trail, the two presumptive presidential candidates have differing views of the "humanitarian intervention" policy. George W. Bush Jr. has said he would be much more selective in deciding where and when the United States would intervene. Vice President Al Gore supported the interventionist policy in a recent major speech. Mr. Gore was instrumental in preventing the agency from being melded into the State Department years ago.
In its account of how unprepared the administration was to meet the needs of the Kosovo refugees, the report points to shortcomings by American intelligence officials.
Instead of anticipating an outpouring of refugees, the administration was expecting the opposite, that nearly a million people would be displaced in Kosovo in the bombing.
"The prevailing worst-case scenario was that one million Kosovars would be displaced internally, prohibited from exiting, and remain largely inaccessible, in the context of an ongoing air war and a NATO determination not to launch a ground invasion," the report said.
As for Sudan, the report added, many in the administration believed that top officials had exerted too little effort to resolve the conflict. That has been partly caused by deep divisions in the administration on Sudan, with some favoring total isolation and even more help to rebels in the south. In addition, officials responsible for the large assistance expenditures have been excluded from crucial decisions.
Officials from A.I.D. and the State Department who managed the assistance program were not consulted when the administration decided to shut the American embassy in Khartoum in the mid-1990's because of security concerns. The closing undermined Washington's ability to talk to Khartoum about helping civilian war victims, the report said.

HEADLINE: Year Later, China's New View of U.S. Bombing

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 8

 BODY:
One year ago today, university students were hurling bricks at the American Embassy in a rage over the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade that killed 3 people and injured 20. Today, they spent a balmy Monday attending classes or playing soccer.
The Chinese government, which last year railed against American perfidy and imperialist ambitions, commemorated the bombing in a low-key manner, as well. A government spokesman restated China's position that the American explanation that the attack resulted from targeting errors remains inadequate. An editorial in the People's Daily called on Chinese to channel their continued anger into strengthening the economy. 
 Many Chinese say they still believe that the bombing had to have been intentional, meant to warn or punish China, and resentment persists. But now, the government and people want most to see the China trade bill pass Congress this month.
Conversations with students at People's University here today found no sentiment for renewed rock throwing in any case.
Zhou Jiubo, 21, who is studying management, was at the American Embassy in May heaving bricks. "We were all hot-headed and angry," he recalled. "But now we've taken to heart the government's advice to study hard and make China strong. We need to make our country stronger so it won't be subject to bullying any more."
Zhao Bingling, 22, a law student, said, "We haven't forgotten about the bombing."
What worries her more today, she said, is the Congressional trade vote, which many here see as a litmus test of American attitudes. If the bill is defeated, she said, "I think there will be a very strong reaction."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
America's Labor Pains

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
What's going on with the American labor movement?
In March the Teamsters started lobbying the Clinton White House to award one of the Teamsters' largest employers, UPS, a much sought after new air route for landing cargo planes in China. At the same time, the Teamsters have been lobbying against the administration's effort to grant China permanent normal trade relations or entry into the World Trade Organization, which would actually spur U.S.-China cargo trade. "It seems that the Teamsters want us to have more cargo flights to China, but no cargo," said one U.S. official. They want more trade in empty boxes. 
 This is almost as interesting as the dockworkers' union marching in Seattle against more globalization and free trade, which is like the milkmen's union coming out against cows. No trade, no dockworkers. No milk, no milkmen. But then you also have the United Auto Workers opposing the trade deal with China, which is strange since today virtually no U.S.-made car can be sold in China, but under the Clinton-negotiated W.T.O. deal all U.S.-made cars can be sold, financed and distributed in China.
And then, of course, there was the lovely scene during the recent anti-I.M.F. protests in Washington when that hate-mongering isolationist Pat Buchanan joined forces with the Teamsters and their boss James Hoffa. Mr. Buchanan told cheering Teamsters that as president he would tell the Chinese to either shape up or "you guys have sold your last pair of chopsticks in any mall in the United States," and that he would appoint Mr. Hoffa as America's top trade negotiator.
How did the U.S. labor movement go from being a progressive force to being the leading opponent of free trade and pal of Pat Buchanan? I posed that question to the former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, now a Brandeis University professor.
His short answer is that U.S. labor unions have come to totally distrust U.S. business, and are convinced that free trade is simply a vehicle for moving manufacturing jobs abroad.
"I believe the labor leaders today are being pushed by their rank and file, who never liked Nafta and who do not trust American business to keep jobs in this country," said Mr. Reich. "Even though the business cycle in recent years has improved things for the country as a whole, labor does not feel that it has really shared fully in the expansion. It feels that manufacturing jobs are still vanishing -- whether because of technology or globalization and free trade."
Labor's response, therefore, has been to try to slam America's doors shut, even though it is obvious that globalization and free trade have contributed mightily to America's economic expansion. What to do? Congressman Sander Levin's thoughtful proposal for better monitoring of China's worker and human rights behavior is laudable, but I don't think labor really cares about either.
What we need is a business-government-labor summit that tries to defuse at least some of labor's real concerns in return for a tempering of its opposition to trade.
"If the business community is really serious," says Mr. Reich, "it should combine the China trade deal with legislation that would give labor a ban on the permanent replacement of striking workers, something labor has sought for years, and it would also treble the fines against any company that illegally fires workers for trying to form unions. In recent years more companies have been using the threat of permanently replacing striking workers, and the practice of illegally firing workers for trying to form unions has been on the rise, because the penalty structure is just a slap on the wrist."
This is worth considering. Free trade and the new economy have been very good for the U.S., but the gains have been unequally distributed, particularly when it comes to blue-collar workers. My attitude toward labor is: Tell us what we can do to ameliorate that -- short of putting up walls and closing doors that will only hurt us all in the long run. Sure, we could redistribute income through tax policy, but that isn't going to happen. So why not try Mr. Reich's idea: Strengthen workers' ability to negotiate wages, severance and security on their own behalf within the new economy.
Pie-in-the-sky? Maybe. But some way has to be found to persuade labor to loosen its grip on the door, and one way could be this bargain: You let go of the door and we'll empower you to better thrive with it open.

HEADLINE: Ground Broken for Light Rail Between Camden and Trenton

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 8

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman officially broke ground today on a much-debated light rail line between Camden and Trenton that will initially carry about 4,150 riders a day.
The $603 million cost of the project is to be paid entirely by the state. 
 Officials said they helped keep the cost down by designing the line to share all but 4 of its 34 miles of track with Conrail at a cost of $67 million. Conrail will continue to use the track from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., when the light rail line will not operate.
Officials estimate ridership could double within 20 years.
The project, expected to be finished in 2002, was promoted more as an economic development tool for Camden and Trenton -- largely bypassed by nearly a decade of economic growth -- than as a solution to heavy commuter demands in Mercer, Burlington or Camden Counties, where trains are to run on a route roughly along the Delaware River.
Mainly because of its high cost relative to the modest number of passengers it is estimated to serve, the project has attracted widespread criticism in its several years of planning. Local officials and citizens groups in Delanco, Riverton, Pennsauken and other communities along the route have had concerns about safety and property values.
Unlike a light rail line in Hudson County, where an initial phase linking Bayonne and Jersey City was completed last month, the Trenton-Camden project is not receiving any federal financing, nor did the state ask for it.
The reason, said Penny Bassett Hackett, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit, is that officials did not want to jeopardize financing for the Hudson-Bergen line.
But a transportation professional who is close to the project said the Trenton-Camden line would not be likely to meet criteria for federal help because of its cost per rider.

HEADLINE: Nationwide Drop in Murders Is Reaching to Small Towns

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
High Point, N.C., has not had a drug- or gang-related murder in the past 18 months, after a stunning surge in homicides in the years before that. 
 In Natchez, Miss., the number of murders dropped to one in 1999, after reaching a dozen a few years before.
And in Oceanside, Calif., where there were as many as 25 homicides as recently as 1995, there were 7 last year.
These drops in murders are an important indication that the decline in the nation's murder rate since 1991, long driven by decreases in homicide in the big cities, is now starting to take hold in small cities, suburbs and rural areas across the country.
This trend was underscored by the release on Sunday of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's preliminary crime report for 1999, which showed that while homicides dropped 2 percent in cities with a population of half a million or more, they declined 10 percent in cities of 100,000 to 250,000, 12 percent in cities of 50,000 to 100,000 people and 14 percent in communities of 10,000 to 25,000 people. Over all, in suburban counties, the number of murders fell 12 percent, and 14 percent in rural counties.
In fact, the smaller the community, the bigger the decrease in murders, according to the F.B.I. study, known as the Uniform Crime Report, which is based on figures supplied by police forces around the country.
Just as in big cities, officials in these smaller communities attribute the decline to a mix of factors, including their own innovative programs, an improved economy and longer prison sentences.
In High Point, a city of 76,000, federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, drawing on a program pioneered in Boston, worked together to focus on drug dealers who had moved in from as far away as Los Angeles and Mexico. In Natchez, an antebellum tourist town of 19,000, officials say a strategy of community policing and four new officers financed by a Clinton administration program helped cut crime.
In Oceanside, a community of 160,000 north of San Diego, the waning of the crack cocaine epidemic, a healthy economy that reduced unemployment and California's "three strikes and you're out" sentencing laws all contributed to a reduction in crime, local officials say.
The reason behind the trend, said Prof. Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, is related to the reason the murder rate first increased in the mid-1980's. It was the major cities that were initially hit by crack cocaine, and then by the infestation of semiautomatic handguns and gangs that accompanied the crack epidemic, he said. The smaller cities and rural areas were slower to become involved in the crack problem, and just as they lagged behind in the growth of crime, "they are slower to come down," Professor Blumstein said.
In fact, some smaller cities and rural areas have been victims of the success the larger cities had in suppressing crime. This led drug dealers and gangs to move to the small communities.
"What we saw in North Carolina, as law enforcement picked up the pressure in the big cities in the mid-1990's, was that the gangs purposely moved out to smaller places," said Walter Holton, the United States attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, in Greensboro.
Mexican gangs arrived at the same time as an influx of Hispanic families moving to North Carolina to work in the state's rapidly expanding industries, disguising their illicit activities, Mr. Holton said.
In addition, some gang members traveled back and forth from Los Angeles to High Point, bringing drugs to sell. "They infiltrated the local market, becoming the major suppliers, and in the process used violence for intimidation to take over the city," Mr. Holton added.
But while the sharp decline in homicide in smaller communities now is seen as a positive sign, several experts said they were concerned that the slowing of the decrease in murder in big cities could mean the country is nearing the end of the remarkable fall in murder after eight consecutive years. "The big cities are signaling the end of the downturn is near," said James Allen Fox, Lipmann professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
Professor Blumstein has calculated that with the huge reduction in murder in the past few years, "If the trend continued, we would have a negative homicide rate, and that would occur in 2007."
Equally worrisome, the experts said, several big cities actually had increases in murder in 1999 for the first time since 1991, including San Diego, up 35.7 percent, St. Louis, up 15 percent, Phoenix, up 14.6 percent, Milwaukee, up 11.7 percent, and New York, up 6 percent.
"We have been getting at the easy problems, so now that we've gotten the easy gains, there should be a flattening out" in the overall decline, Professor Blumstein said. Among these gains, he said, were a shrinkage in the crack market and successful police tactics aimed at persuading young people not to carry guns.

The Muted Effect So Far Of Rate Rises

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The cost of financing is on the rise for consumers and companies.
The benchmark fixed interest rate on 30-year home mortgages, at 8.65 percent, is the highest since early 1995, and the yields on junk bonds, at an average of 12.79 percent, are well above their levels then. Corporate bond yields, at 8.89 percent, are also approaching early 1995 marks. 
 These are all signs that the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, five moves of a quarter-point since last June, are beginning to have an impact on the financial markets.
But the higher rates have not yet led to a significant drag on the overall economy, in part because market rates have risen to their five-year highs very recently and in part because stocks have been strong enough that consumers have not been discouraged. Although growth has slowed somewhat since the fourth quarter of 1999, the economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2000. And in the most significant data since then, 340,000 jobs were created last month as the unemployment rate fell to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent, the government said on Friday.
This lack of bite in monetary policy, even more than recent suggestions of some inflationary pressure in wages, has led many analysts to predict that the Fed will push up its target for short-term interest rates much further then the current 6 percent before the economy will slow to an acceptable pace. With Fed policy makers scheduled to meet next Tuesday, the debate has shifted to whether they will raise their target rate by half a percentage point instead of the familiar quarter-point steps.
A recent rise in the yield on the futures contract of federal funds shows that many investors expect the central bank's target rate to be 7 percent by November.
The Fed has moved cautiously until now partly because it saw few signs of inflationary pressure other than the spurt in crude oil and gasoline prices.
Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, said in a speech last month that "the current episode is the smallest and most gradual tightening" since the late 1960's. "So the modest effects on aggregate demand to date," he said, "perhaps only confirm the relatively modest and extremely gradual nature of the current tightening."
In addition, Mr. Meyer said, "some developments suggest that the recent policy moves may have had a more limited effect on aggregate demand than would have been expected."
To measure the impact of monetary policy, one has to look at what effect a rise in the federal funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans between banks, has on broader financial conditions including interest rates, stock prices and the dollar's exchange rate. Mr. Meyer said one gauge, the Goldman Sachs financial conditions index, "is not only at the very low end of historical experience, but is nearly unchanged" since June.
"So a second conclusion about the current experience," Mr. Meyer said, "is that the increase in the funds rate, to date, has had a smaller effect than usual -- nearly zero -- on overall financial conditions and hence on aggregate demand."
Comparisons to the Fed's last episode of tightening help make the point. From February 1994 to March 1995, policy makers raised the federal funds rate target to 6 percent from 3 percent. By December 1994, new mortgage applications had fallen 20.3 percent from their year-earlier level, according to John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service.
Rather than slowing, the rate has increased recently. New applications rose 9.2 percent in the 12-month period ending in April, despite the increase in the interest rate on a 30-year Fannie Mae mortgage to 8.65 percent from 6.90 percent during that time.
Even though mortgage and corporate rates are rising, they have not yet reached the high points of the 1994-95 Fed tightening. The Fannie Mae 30-year rate reached 9.29 percent in December 1994. The rate on long-term industrial company bonds rated by Moody's as Baa, its lowest investment-grade rating, reached 9.37 percent in November 1994. (But the yields on bonds below investment grade -- junk bonds in market parlance -- are more than three-quarters of a percentage point higher than their 11.98 percent peak in January 1995, according to Chase Manhattan's high-yield index.)
Probably the most important reason that the Fed's interest rate increases have had little impact is that stocks in general have not crumbled, another factor noted by Mr. Meyer. "Equity prices have been unusually resilient in this episode," he said, "rising by an amount near the maximum during the first nine months of significant tightenings over the period studied." While the Dow Jones industrial average is down 3.3 percent since the end of June 1999, the Nasdaq composite index is up 36.6 percent, and the Wilshire 5000, which includes all domestic stocks, is up 5.4 percent.
William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, said yesterday that the central bank would have to raise the Fed funds target to 7.5 percent next year, which means an additional 1.5 percentage points, to slow the economy. Like several economists, he raised his projection last week.
Mr. Dudley said the Fed's moves so far have had so little impact because "the bond and stock markets are so trusting" of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman. Investors, he said, believe that the Fed will keep inflation in check, but not push interest rates so high as to cause a recession. "So they are not worried about inflation and they are not worried about a hard landing," he said.
Neil M. Soss, chief United States economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said, "we haven't seen much effect in the real economy yet" because consumers, who have powered much of this record economic expansion, have not received a signal from the financial markets to slow down.
But the surge in mortgage rates in the last two weeks, to 8.65 percent from 8.09 percent, he said, may show that the Fed's message is finally coming through.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
More Offense Bringing More Fans to the Park

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Stop. Just stop. Cease and desist. Enough already. Let the concern and consternation over the increase in home runs and runs end here and now. Instead of tearing out the hair and gnashing the teeth, sit back and relax and enjoy what we have. It's a new era for baseball.
It has happened before. The advent of Babe Ruth marked the beginning of an era that made baseball the country's sport of choice. Without Ruth and the home runs he produced, baseball would have withered and died eons ago. If an escalation of the Ruthian experience is occurring now, let it be. Don't look for ways to stifle it. 
 Fans evidently don't find fault with the outbreak of scoring. Attendance is up 5.8 percent over last year, and they may attend games this season in record numbers. That possible development is what Major League Baseball anticipates, at least, so why would anyone want to do anything to take away from the fans something they appear to like.
"Our fans are enjoying it," Commissioner Bud Selig said yesterday. "Did we design this? No. We aren't that smart. We ought to watch it and analyze it, but is it necessarily bad? No."
Last Friday night about 39,000 fans sat at The Ballpark in Arlington and watched a game that could become the signature event of the new era. Oakland led Texas, 15-7, after six and a half innings, but the Rangers won the game, 17-16, scoring 10 runs in the last three innings. The fans who were there were ecstatic and will talk about the game for months, if not years, to come. No one asked for his money back. It was 4 hours 1 minute of great entertainment.
The purists, of course, cringed. The purists, however, are not paying the players' inflated salaries.
Teams played 457 games in the first five weeks of the season. They averaged 10.76 runs and 2.59 home runs a game. Pitchers compiled a 4.96 earned run average in that period.
Conspiracy theorists suspect that the ball has been doctored to make it easier for batters to hit it out of the park. The fact is home runs and runs have increased nearly every year since the first of two expansions that added four teams in the 1990's. In 1992, the year before the first expansion, teams averaged 8.39 runs and 1.45 home runs a game, and pitchers compiled a 3.80 E.R.A. in the first 457 games.
With the postexpansion proliferation of scoring and home run hitting, new standards have to be established. The new era, for example, needs a new E.R.A. A 3.00 earned run average used to be considered good for a pitcher. With the average E.R.A. up by about a third, that standard has to be raised to 4.00.
Last season the American League had only eight starting pitchers at 4.00 or lower. Pitchers are the players who are affected most adversely in the new era. For the most part, they are fodder for hitters who have become stronger and in parks that have become smaller.
Roy Halladay is supposed to be a good young pitcher for Toronto, but in seven starts this season he has an 11.53 E.R.A. Jose Lima, a 21-game winner for Houston last year, has a 9.53 E.R.A. in seven starts and has been battered for a major league-high 16 home runs.
It is middle relief pitchers, though, who deserve hazard pay for their efforts. With pitching staffs short on talent generally, if the starter is knocked out early, his departure triggers a parade of ineffective relievers who should still be learning their craft in the minor leagues or who never demonstrated enough ability to pitch in the majors.
Tanyon Sturtze is a reliever for the White Sox whose professional career spanned the 1990's. In that decade, he spent all but 110 playing days in the minors. This season, in eight relief appearances and one start (last night against Boston) he has a 10:43 E.R.A. covering 142/3 innings.
Home run standards, too, must be raised because of inflation. From 1976 until 1995, excluding the strike seasons of 1981 and 1994, the American and National League home run champions averaged 42 home runs. In the last five seasons, their successors have hit an average of 53 home runs a year. Using that 26 percent inflation rate, if 30 home runs had been considered a benchmark for sluggers, that number should now be at least 38, if not 40.
Baseball's new era, however, has not eliminated low-scoring games. This season has already produced seven 1-0 games and 14 2-1 games. Boston has lost a pair of 1-0 decisions; Los Angeles suffered two 1-0 losses in consecutive games with different teams. Cleveland lost two consecutive 2-1 games to different teams. The Mets have won three 2-1 decisions.
Each day or set of days can still produce vastly different results. Colorado scored 43 runs in three games against Montreal last week, then went to San Francisco and was shut out twice in two games.
A premium is placed on good pitching more than ever in the new era. But the success of Pedro Martinez (1.22), Randy Johnson (0.93), Tom Glavine (1.73) and some others shows that hitters haven't assumed command completely.
"Are Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson using a different ball?" Selig asked. "Of course not."
Baseball officials are nevertheless studying developments in the new era. They are having the balls tested, they will go to Costa Rica and tour the Rawlings factory where the balls are made, they will study bats, they are considering raising the mound in a couple of rookie minor leagues to see what effect such a change could have on hitting.
Officials met yesterday with Rawlings people, who for the 972nd time vowed that they had made no change in the balls. If that is so, let the new era continue and take baseball wherever Mark McGwire and friends lead it. Just leave a few 1-0 games around for old times' sake.

HEADLINE: City's Rent Board Recommends Increases of 4% and 6%

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Clearing the way for the highest rent increases since 1996, the New York City Rent Guidelines Board gave landlords preliminary approval last night to raise one-year leases by 4 percent and two-year leases by 6 percent for the one million apartments covered by rent stabilization.
Leaders of both landlord and tenant groups voiced dissatisfaction with the action and vowed to press the board to revise the numbers at its final vote on June 22. But historically, the board rarely makes major changes in its initial position. Once the increases are final, the new rates will apply to leases renewed between Oct. 1, 2000, and Sept. 30, 2001. 
 For five of the last six years, the board had reflected the low-inflation era by adopting increases of 2 percent for one-year leases and 4 percent for two-year leases. The exceptions, after a spike in fuel oil prices four years ago, were increases of 5 percent for one-year leases and 7 percent for two-year leases.
"It's much too high," said Michael McKee, associate director of the state's largest tenant group, the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition. "It's going to greatly overcompensate landlords more than they need, and it's going to increase their net income."
Tenant advocates argued that only a minimal increase was called for. Owners are making record profits, they said, because inflation is low, rent collections are up and the rent increases granted in recent years have been greater than needed.
But the landlords, whose advocates had requested increases of 9 percent for one-year leases and 15 percent for two-year leases, said they were still recouping from the lean years of the recession. They called for higher rents to offset rising operating costs.
"The vote today is in the right direction, but a higher increase is justified," said Joseph Strasburgh, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the biggest organization of owners of rent-stabilized buildings.
Noting that the two tenant representatives on the board voted for the compromise, he said: "I'm surprised, honestly surprised, because tenant members have never voted for increased rent guidelines before. They recognized that a higher rate was justified."
Although Mr. Strasburgh said his group would appeal to the board for higher increases, he conceded, "I do not have high expectations" of succeeding.
The focal issue was a 54.8 percent rise in the last year in fuel oil costs for heat and hot water, which the landlords said justified their call for sharply higher rents. But tenant leaders said the rise in oil prices was temporary and should not be the basis for permanently higher rents.
According to studies by the rent board's staff, general operating costs had undergone almost no increases for two years -- 0.13 percent in 1997 and 0.03 percent in 1998 -- but last year jumped by 7.8 percent, mainly because of oil prices. Another board study, however, also showed that net income, from which profits are drawn, had risen to its highest point in the 10 years that those statistics had been compiled.
The impending rent increases would have been higher, Mr. McKee said, had it not been for organized tenant pressure that included numerous calls to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's office in recent days.
"It's all a political process anyway," Mr. McKee said, "and thank goodness he's been running for the Senate." He said the mayor was balancing his popularity among renters with the desires of his landlord campaign contributors.
Putting their political views on display, a few dozen protesting tenants carried signs at the board meeting, in Lower Manhattan, with slogans like "Rudy Giuliani, the Landlords' Candidate for Senate" and "Rudy, Don't Raise Our Rent."
Before its final vote, the board is to hold its annual public hearing on June 15 at Cooper Union, at Seventh Street and Third Avenue. Testimony on apartment rents will be from 1 to 5:30 p.m. and 8 to 9:30 p.m. Testimony on residential hotel rents will be from 10 a.m. to noon and 7 to 8:30 p.m.

HEADLINE: Republicans Debate Gently In Senate Race

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 8

 BODY:
After languishing for months in the shadow of their better-known, better-financed Democratic rivals, New Jersey's four Republican candidates for the United States Senate had their first debate today, with all four brandishing their conservative credentials while avoiding the harsh attacks they had leveled at each other in recent campaign mailings.
With only regional political bases and limited name recognition, the four used the forum to make broad appeals to the 300,000 voters expected to decide the June 6 primary, describing their views in favor of tax cuts, free trade and severely limiting the use of American military troops abroad. 
 The format did not allow for give-and-take during what was largely a genial debate, with the candidates mentioning each other's names only when they agreed on various issues. Their only critical words were aimed at Democrats, specifically President Clinton and New Jersey's two Democratic Senate contenders, Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine.
Representative Robert D. Franks, a four-term congressman from Union County, called himself a common-sense conservative and said that he and fellow Republicans in Congress deserved credit for the robust economy because they had helped "to drag Bill Clinton kicking and screaming down the path to fiscal responsibility."
James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, described himself as an "unabashed conservative" and proposed replacing the income tax code with a flat tax.
William L. Gormley, a state senator from Ocean County, said he was a fiscal conservative because he had voted for 37 tax cuts since Gov. Christine Todd Whitman took office in 1994. In an unusual move for a contestant in a Republican primary, however, Mr. Gormley also said he had become a target for the National Rifle Association because he was the only Republican state legislator to vote for New Jersey's assault weapons ban in 1990.
The most conservative candidate in the race is Murray Sabrin, a college finance professor who ran for governor as a Libertarian in 1993. Mr. Sabrin called for the abolition of affirmative action, the Departments of Education, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development, the capital gains tax and the estate tax. When asked whether his platform might be too extreme for New Jersey's historically moderate Republican voters, he beamed. "That's what they said about Ronald Wilson Reagan in 1980," Mr. Sabrin said.
The debate, sponsored jointly by The New York Times and The New Jersey Network, was taped at 1 p.m. and broadcast at 9 p.m. The Democratic candidates are scheduled to hold their first debate on Thursday, and both debates will be broadcast back-to-back on Sunday at 2 p.m. The Democrats have agreed to four debates before the primary. The Republicans are scheduled to hold two more.
The tranquil tone of today's debate was a departure from the increasingly heated campaign. In recent weeks, Mr. Gormley's campaign has called Mr. Franks a "Clinton Republican," saying that the congressman voted to impeach the president but days later urged the Senate not to remove him from office. Mr. Franks has branded Mr. Gormley a "Florio Republican," and accused him of cooperating too closely with Mr. Florio during his four years as governor.
As if bracing for such a criticism, Mr. Gormley began the debate with a one-minute opening statement in which he described his votes against Mr. Florio's tax increase. But an attack from Mr. Franks never came. Instead, Mr. Franks talked of his own efforts, when he was a state legislator and Republican state chairman, to block Mr. Florio's 1990 income tax increase and deny his re-election.
Mr. Treffinger predicted that Mr. Corzine's programs would bankrupt the country. Referring to Mr. Florio's $2.8-billion tax increase, he said, "There are at least 2.8 billion reasons not to vote for Jim Florio."
However, most of the debate emphasized the similarities between Mr. Treffinger, Mr. Gormley and Mr. Franks. All three said they favored limited gun control, campaign finance reform, expanding trade relations with China and federal tax credits to help working families afford health care and higher education.
Mr. Franks and Mr. Gormley described issues in which they broke ranks with their party leadership. Mr. Franks said he defied Republican leaders in the House of Representatives when he voted to support campaign finance and the patients' bill of rights.
Mr. Gormley described his vote for Mr. Florio's assault weapon ban as an act of conscience.
"I had the opportunity as a United States marine to fire an M-16, and I know what damage they can do," Mr. Gormley said. "We need to send a message to the N.R.A., and the special interest groups who don't care about our children and don't care about the future of our state, to tell them we're not going to stand for it."

An article yesterday about the first debate by New Jersey's four Republican candidates for United States Senate misidentified the county represented by one of them, State Senator William L. Gormley. He is from Atlantic County, not Ocean County.
The article also misstated the year in which another candidate, Murray Sabrin, ran for governor as a Libertarian. It was 1997, not 1993.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
A Temple of Modern Art and Spectacle

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
What are people going to say in 100 years about all these new museums for modern art that we're building, which seem to be getting almost as big as the Met?
The latest behemoth is the new Tate Modern, across the Thames from St. Paul's Cathedral in the former Bankside power plant. The fashionable Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron have done the renovation -- lovingly preserving the brick exterior with the big chimney in the middle -- at a cost of $200 million, half in government grants, half private money. Queen Elizabeth II inaugurates the place on May 11. The next day the public arrives. 
 First things first: the museum is of course a contribution to contemporary art not just here but throughout Europe; a boon to Southwark, the run-down borough of London that it is in; and a major achievement by Sir Nicholas Serota, the quietly subversive Tate director who miraculously overcame decades of reluctance among stodgy British officials to finally establish a proper modern art museum.
Proper but problematic. The Tate is in part a temple to vanity, the vanity of a culture that equates spectacle with substance, with half the building devoted to a vast entranceway, the museum's deeply gloomy signature space -- and with an installation that is occasionally eccentric to the point of distraction.
To Britons who for decades got admirable but tepid Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth when they went to the old Tate for modern art, the new Tate must seem like a revolution. Dozens of living artists of different generations and nationalities (Bruce Nauman, Matthew Barney, Juan Munoz, James Coleman, Ilya Kabakov, Tatsuo Miyajima, Rebecca Horn -- the list goes on) are mixed in among the British. No doubt the choices will cause grumbling because such choices do, but they seem fine. All this comes when London is suddenly vying with New York as the mecca for contemporary art. British art's rising fortunes in the 1990's helped the Tate come about. Now the Tate will surely raise those fortunes more. Whether there will be enough money to run the museum is an open question, which is partly why the Tate has just begun a for-profit on line collaboration with the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But that is another matter.
You may recall that the old Tate upriver mixed British and modern art. The arrangement made no sense. Renamed Tate Britain, the old building, a handsome gallery, has become a museum just for British art. Gainsborough has been liberated from Duchamp.
This solves one problem, but museums of national art are suffering identity crises in the new global culture. Contemporary art, a global phenomenon, exists uneasily in a traditional nationalist context.
So Tate officials, evidently trying not to prejudice the public against one museum or the other and wanting to make living artists and their audiences feel at home in both places, have settled on strategies to mix new art and old art. Mona Hatoum, a young British star, has enormous sculptures (a giant vegetable grater the size of a truck, among them) in the main hall at Tate Britain -- ridiculous work but new and conspicuous, which is the point.
At the same time, both Tate Britain and Tate Modern are showing works not chronologically but according to themes, as the Museum of Modern Art in New York has been doing lately but with art from much more limited periods of time. Contemporary work is cheek by jowl with early 20th century art here.
"Landscape, matter, environment" is the title of one section at Tate Modern, "nude, action, body" another. The pretentiousness of the titles should tell you something. The museum says the goal is to avoid the old "isms," but it's also, no doubt, to disguise gaps. At this, the strategy is a failure. Compared with the holdings of the Modern or Pompidou in Paris, the Tate collection is spotty before 1975, the legacy of previous British unease about modernism. Much of the best of what's on view comes from the last 25 years.
There are some clever conjunctions that do result from the thematic installation: a room called "Subversive Objects" mixes Salvador Dali and Hans Bellmer, early Surrealists, with living artists like Sarah Lucas and Rosemarie Trockel; another room, "Structures for Survival," puts together Andrea Zittel, Mario Merz and Franz West, unusually.
But it's a parlor game trying to figure out why a Monet hangs next to a Richard Long, art being forced to play second fiddle to curatorial concept. A Cezanne is orphaned beside Minimalist sculptures. Kandinsky is demeaned in a room titled "Manifestoes."
And a room of nudes by Picasso, Lucian Freud, Bonnard and others is upstaged by Sam Taylor-Wood's video of a naked man dancing to Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings in the next gallery, the collision of media inevitably skewing the relative impact of the works.
Suffice it to say that the collisions are even more startling at Tate Britain, where the 16th century and the 20th century meet. Museums should make it easier for people to stand in front of a work of art unencumbered. The Tate's installation makes a case for a return to the old chronological approach, or for a blend of old approach and new, time being a cruel master but at least a reliable way to get a handle on the past.
And the building itself? A London journalist joked that the new Tate is the Millennium Dome for the educated class -- a nasty remark considering that the dome has become a $1.3 billion joke, but looked at a certain way, not wrong. Both are celebrations of national pride, colossal and populist, the Tate being more upscale but still based on the economy of tourism and on a cocktail of boosterism, urban renewal, youth culture and unexceptionable programs of cultural uplift. Art is part but only part of what the new Tate is about.
There is sheer theatricality, for example. Modern art museums serving among other things as highbrow amusement parks these days, Tate officials working with Mr. Herzog and Mr. de Meuron have made sure to provide the expected thrill. The lobby, the former plant's turbine hall, entered from the west down a 75-foot-wide ramp, is nearly two football fields long and 12 stories high, an industrial St. Peter's with the original cherry-picker cranes left overhead.
Awesome. Memorable.
And dour. The natural point of comparison, the Orsay in Paris, also an industrial conversion and a museum with its own problems, is airy, not austere. But this is England and that is France. No frills here.
Perhaps the impression that the place is grim is exaggerated by the presence of several giant new sculptures by Louise Bourgeois: a spider and three 30-foot steel spiral staircases, like prison guard towers with enormous mirrors on top, plunked at the east end of the hall. The sculptures are awful. Previously a neglected artist, Ms. Bourgeois is now vastly overrated.
The quality of art improves episodically in the galleries. Tate officials (who can blame them?) have generally avoided art that would be too controversial. No decapitated cows. Nothing really risque. Nothing that might overshadow the experience of wandering fresh galleries for the first time.
Occupying three floors on one side of the building, these galleries wrap halfway around escalator landings, a layout akin to the Modern in New York. Wending from one end of a floor to the other can feel like going through a rat's maze. Time will tell whether the choice of unfinished wood floors (they will become increasingly marked up by footprints) will seem smart or lunatic.
The rooms otherwise are minimal boxes, varied in size. Plain, clean and useful, they won't please acolytes of Frank Gehry, but artists should like them. They are not temporary and partitioned, as at the Pompidou, or precious, as at the Getty.
It's only too bad more of them don't have natural light, although a few have great views of St. Paul's and the river, the views breaking up the monotony of consecutive white spaces. Towering galleries suit enormous sculptures. Others do for drawings, photographs and documentary material. (There's an excellent Fluxus room, for example.) Much of the inaugural display consists of recent installations and videos, big works that had been difficult to show off in the old building.
Two of the three floors of galleries will be for the permanent collection, sandwiching a floor for temporary exhibitions; this is less space for temporary shows than at the old Tate, apparently, gallery space having been sacrificed to the lobby. The exhibition rooms are nonetheless much better. At the moment they have sculptures and videos from the permanent collection: works by two dozen artists getting a room apiece, more or less. A few rooms on the permanent collection floors, interludes in the thematic display, are monographic, too.
This is where the value of the new Tate becomes clearest. British artists, including Bridget Riley, Anthony Caro and Anish Kapoor, are stressed, but there's plenty of room for foreign artists like Mr. Nauman, Mr. Kabakov and Mr. Coleman to be prominent. Mr. Kabakov's Soviet hallway is a miracle of nostalgic re-creation, deeply ironic, and Mr. Coleman's video about a photographer is alarming, vivid and very funny. They stay in the mind.
The new Tate's capacity to accommodate different art flexibly is its asset at a time when contemporary art seems to be moving in divergent, unpredictable directions.
But the question lingers: Must a museum of modern art be quite this gigantic? Is the tradition that begins with Cezanne so important historically that it demands a building as big as the National Gallery?
Maybe this seems odd to ask. The more room the better, especially for previously underprivileged new art. But the question might be asked differently: Will the tradition of art post-Cezanne still seem coherent in a century? The kind of person who became an artist 100 years ago is not the same person who becomes an artist today. What is defined as art and the people who make it are changing all the time.
Maybe video and installation will come to belong to different stories, disconnected from Cezanne. Maybe Cezanne will no longer seem like a beginning of anything but a middle, or an end. Maybe, God forbid, no one will want to show Richard Long or Louise Bourgeois in 100 years.
One thing is certain. This moment, the turn of the 21st century, will be remembered as a time when a rich and egocentric culture saw fit to memorialize itself on an incredible scale.

A Symbol Issue

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
You could argue that the question whether to grant China "permanent normal trade relations," or P.N.T.R., is mainly a procedural issue. The United States won't be reducing any existing trade barriers; all the concessions in terms of opening markets will come from the Chinese side. Nor will we in any way be dropping our guard against Chinese espionage, abandoning our commitment to the defense of Taiwan, or otherwise pretending that the Chinese government is any better than it is.
But the debate over P.N.T.R. isn't about the literal content of the measure itself; it's about the symbolism. For labor, blocking P.N.T.R. would be a demonstration of clout -- even though the trade arithmetic suggests that union members as a group would if anything benefit from China's offered concessions. For those who understandably abhor China's current rulers, blocking P.N.T.R. would be a slap in the face of undemocratic regimes everywhere -- even though nobody really thinks that a rejection would drive those rulers from power. 
 There is nothing wrong with taking symbolic stands in politics -- and China's government has done nothing to merit kid-glove treatment. The trouble is that whatever symbolism a defeat for P.N.T.R. might have here in the United States, it would have even more powerful symbolism elsewhere -- and in a way that would ultimately hurt the very causes the opponents of trade normalization say they hold dear.
The reason I support P.N.T.R. -- not with a completely clear conscience, but because the alternatives seem so much worse -- is that I remember what the world was like a couple of decades ago. Back then, the tide seemed to be running against everything we stand for; khaki-clad dictators, who ruled their nations' economies as well as everything else with an iron hand, seemed to be the men of the hour. The idea that by the year 2000 Western ideas -- not just the ideology of the free market, but the principle of liberal democracy -- would have spread farther than ever before would have seemed implausible. But it happened, largely because governments in the developing world became aware of how well some countries had done by opening themselves to the world market.
After all, Deng Xiaoping didn't decide to liberalize China's economy because he was a nice guy, or a secret admirer of Adam Smith; he looked at Taiwan and South Korea and realized that their export-led, market-driven growth was delivering something Maoism never could. And post-Deng China -- for all its ham-handed repression -- has become a far freer, more open society than anyone could have imagined 25 years ago, mainly because all-out totalitarianism and a market economy don't mix. You don't have to be a disciple of Friedrich Hayek to believe that free markets and a free society have some affinity, and that the world has become more democratic over the last two decades partly because it has also become more market-oriented.
So think what a rejection of normal trading relations with China would in effect say to governments -- China's government and others -- that are still wavering in their commitment to freer economies and their willingness to accept the loss of political control that such economic liberalization usually brings. It would be as if the United States, the home of the free-market/free-society ideology, were to say "Sorry; markets and democracy work for us, but we aren't letting any more countries into our club."
Of course, the opponents of normal trade relations insist that they don't mean to convey any such message. Of course, they assure us, the door remains open to countries with sufficiently democratic regimes and with adequate labor protection. Give us a decent government in China, they say, one that lets labor unions organize, and we'll open up the door. But few people in the developing world -- or for that matter in Washington -- think that such assurances are sincere; they believe that anything short of political perfection will be used as an excuse to block exports, that any labor protection that does not price developing countries out of world markets will be deemed inadequate.
So the opponents of normal trade relations with China are right -- it's an issue whose symbolic importance is much larger than its direct economic implications. But that symbolism is a reason to vote for normalization, not against it.

HEADLINE: Profits Posted By Wal-Mart Beat Forecasts

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BENTONVILLE, Ark., May 9

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said today that its fiscal first-quarter profit rose 19 percent and that earnings this quarter would be near the highest Wall Street forecasts.
Net income in the quarter that ended on April 30 rose to $1.33 billion, or 30 cents a share, from profit from operations of $1.11 billion, or 25 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 24 percent, to $43 billion, as international sales more than doubled. 
 Sales at United States stores open at least a year, a key indicator for retailers, rose 9.1 percent in the first quarter, and Wal-Mart said it did not expect consumer spending to slow.
First-quarter profits were a penny higher than the 29-cent average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks earnings.
In the corresponding quarter a year earlier, a charge of $198 million, or 4 cents a share, for an accounting change, resulted in net income of $916 million, or 21 cents.
"Wal-Mart is a good, solid growth company that could gain a lot of attention in an uncertain market," said Dan Eagan, manager of BlackRock Inc.'s Select Equity Portfolio, which held 868,900 shares as of September.
The company's shares have tumbled about 25 percent from a high of $70.25 in December on concern that five increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve since June, higher oil prices and rising inflation would crimp consumer spending in the second half. Its shares rose $1.125, to $53.4375 in midafternoon trading.
Wal-Mart is expected to earn 33 cents to 36 cents in its fiscal second quarter, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. In the period a year earlier, it had profit from operations of 31 cents a share.
"Looking ahead, I believe Wal-Mart's going to be a riskier proposition," Bob Buchanan, an A. G. Edwards & Sons analyst, said on Monday, after he cut his rating on the stock to "maintain position" from "accumulate."

HEADLINE: Bethlehem Journal;
For Palestinians, O Little Town of Business Plans

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: BETHLEHEM, West Bank, May 6

 BODY:
With scores of pinstriped businessmen milling about the hotel ballroom, it looked like any other shareholders meeting.
Auditors from Arthur Andersen hovered in the background, while stockholders called brokers on mobile phones and scrutinized the figures in the glossy annual report. 
 But when the meeting was called to order, the first piece of business was a song. A sheet of lyrics in Arabic was distributed for the few who did not already know the words. Everyone rose, and with swelling emotion sang every verse of "My Homeland," the unofficial Palestinian national anthem.
"This is our first annual meeting on Palestinian soil, and I tell you it is giving me goose bumps," Munib Masri, the dapper chairman of the Palestinian Development and Investment Company, or Padico, the fastest-growing Palestinian business conglomerate, whispered before the assembly began.
The hotel ballroom opened onto the elegantly reconstructed rear plaza of an Ottoman merchant's villa, which in its century-long life has also served as a school, a hospital, and a tear-gassed battleground between Israeli forces and rock-throwing Palestinian youths. The building, long known to Bethlehemites as the Jasir Palace, has been transformed by Padico into an Intercontinental hotel, the first five-star hotel owned and operated by Palestinians on Palestinian-governed territory.
"This hotel is not just for this company, but for all of our people," Ahmed Qurei, the former Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla leader better known as Abu Ala, proclaimed to the Padico stockholders. Now the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council and one of Yasir Arafat's closest confidants, Mr. Qurei joined the board members on the dais and praised Padico for "imposing its private sector style on the development of Palestine."
Evidence of the company's endeavors was everywhere around him. The ubiquitous cell phones operated on a network run by Paltel, a private telecommunications monopoly that is 25 percent owned by Padico. The investors assembled in their new hotel were a cross-section of the emerging Palestinian business elite, some of whom had traveled from Jordan, the United States and the Persian Gulf. (Padico's biggest stockholder, Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, the Saudi mega-billonaire, who did not show up, is one of the few non-Palestinians.) They have made Padico and Paltel the largest companies on the nascent Palestinian stock exchange -- which itself is one of Padico's several subsidiaries.
This was perhaps not the Palestine of the future envisioned by either critics or champions of the P.L.O. when the Palestinian National Authority came into being six years ago. But in what Mr. Masri proudly described to shareholders as "a partnership" with Mr. Arafat's state-in-waiting, he and his colleagues have turned the autonomous Palestinian territory into the most privatized economy in the Middle East. The phone company, the airline, the new power company, the banking and insurance industry -- all are privately owned, and most have some connection to Padico.
Despite flat profits, it was been a good year for Padico. Share prices climbed steadily after a stock split. The number of shareholders doubled, to 1,700. New enterprises got under way, ranging from housing projects to factories to a Gaza Strip power plant. But when executives reported on those ventures they stressed not profits and losses but their contribution to the creation of a Palestinian state. And while shareholders quizzed board members on what they saw as the peculiarities of Padico's dividends policy, discussions dealt as much with politics and national aspirations as with finances.
Mr. Qurei particularly congratulated Padico on its expanding network of industrial parks, noting that they have been built as close as possible to the green line -- the boundary between Israel and the then-Jordanian West Bank before the 1967 war. "Putting industrial zones on the borders of the green line creates political and economic facts," he said.
The Bethlehem Intercontinental, just minutes from Israeli West Jerusalem, is the company's latest showcase. Previous stockholder meetings were held in Amman, Jordan -- in part because of Israeli visa difficulties for some Palestinian investors, and in part because the company did not believe that it had an adequate local site. This was the first chance to show off the new hotel to investors.
Inside the cool interior plaza, with a new fountain burbling beneath ancient shade trees and waiters serving Middle Eastern sweets, the memory of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule seemed almost impossibly distant. But immediately behind the hotel -- within full view of its $200-a-night rooms -- are the rutted roads and ramshackle dwellings of the Ayda refugee camp, long a locus of Palestinian unrest. Just down the street is Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish pilgrimage site heavily guarded by Israeli soldiers in one of their few remaining enclaves in Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem.
This combustible combination still occasionally erupts into confrontation, sending wafts of pepper spray past the Jasir Palace's sand-blasted stone facade.
The classic third-world contrast of a deluxe hotel abutting an impoverished neighborhood seems not to faze local residents, for whom the project provided construction jobs, or the Palestinian leadership, who laud it as a symbol of national achievement. A bit behind schedule -- Mr. Arafat once hoped to be host to the pope here -- the partly opened hotel was the scene of a reception last month for Jiang Zemin, the president of China. "This creates a good impression for Palestine among world leaders," Mr. Qurei said.
The company's next luxury hotel project is a beachfront resort in the Gaza Strip, not normally thought of as a tourist destination. As in Bethlehem, the hotel will rise next to a United Nations-administered Palestinian refugee camp.
"I hope to welcome you all there in two years," Mr. Masri told his shareholders.

HEADLINE: Official Defends Call for Breakup of Microsoft

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Responding to Microsoft's public criticisms of the plan to break it in two, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division said today that the actual result would be "exciting new products, with more choices and lower prices for consumers."
The official, Joel I. Klein, added that Microsoft's key argument "is wrong as a matter of fact, and wrong as a matter of history as well." He was speaking at a forum on the new economy at the University of California at Berkeley. 
 Late last month, the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general asked a federal judge to break Microsoft into two companies. One would hold the Windows operating system, the other everything else, including the Office suite of application programs like Word and Excel.
Over the last 10 days, Microsoft has responded publicly with blistering criticism of the plan. On Wednesday, its legal response is due in federal court.
Microsoft has asserted, among other things, that the integration of its operating system and applications software divisions into one company produces efficiencies that bring innovation. Mr. Klein said that argument "is wrong as a matter of fact, since the two companies would be free to exchange technical information, as long as that information was made available to third parties."
He added that Microsoft "has long claimed that it provided third-party applications developers all the information about its operating system that those developers could need" to write software programs for Windows. If that is true, he said, "there is no real loss of efficiency in the reorganization."
Mr. Klein also said that opponents of the breakup of AT&T in 1984 "made the very same claim, arguing that the divestiture would imperil the efficiency of the telephone network." He said "that argument has failed the test of time."
Elaborating on the AT&T comparison, Mr. Klein disputed another Microsoft argument: that it was not the breakup that freed AT&T to compete, but the order to deregulate it.
But Mr. Klein noted that AT&T and the Baby Bells were left with restrictions prohibiting them from entering one another's markets. Under the plan to break up Microsoft, he said, "the separated companies would be entirely free to compete with each other in all lines of business."

Shares Drop Amid Concerns About Technology Issues

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks dropped yesterday on continued concern that technology issues were overvalued and on fears about the impact on earnings growth of an expected increase in interest rates next week.
Volume remained light, and analysts warned against making too much of Wall Street's moves before the Federal Reserve decides whether and by how much it will raise borrowing costs at a meeting next Tuesday as it seeks to head off the threat of accelerating inflation. 
 The Nasdaq composite index dropped 84.37 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,585.01, after dropping 147 points, or 3.86 percent, on Monday.
Technology stocks rolled back nearly across the board, also dragging the Dow Jones industrial average lower. It closed down 66.88 points, or 0.6 percent, at 10,536.75. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 12.03 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,412.14.
Investors also were on the sidelines ahead of economic data expected at the end of the week and quarterly earnings reports from Cisco Systems, which was released after the market closed, and from Applied Materials and Dell Computer, which will be released later in the week, traders said.
"There are valuation concerns, which was brought on by Cisco, the granddaddy of all valuation concerns," said Barry Hyman, market strategist at Ehrenkrantz, King Nussbaum Inc.
Cisco failed to recover from its decline of more than 7 percent on Monday, ending unchanged at 62 3/4. Last weekend, the financial weekly Barron's published a report questioning whether the network equipment company's large market capitalization was warranted.
Among the technology stocks to slip most was the online auctioneer eBay, which dropped 7 5/16, to 12 13/16.
Banks and other financial issues contributed to the weakness amid concern that rising interest rates would cut into loan demand. American Express dropped 4 1/16, to 148, and Citigroup slipped 7/8, to 59 5/16.
"There is no appetite for stocks right now; we are just kind of drifting," said Larry Wachtel of Prudential Securities.
Analysts said Wall Street was in a defensive mode, preparing for what could be a full-scale assault on inflation by the Fed. Many strategists and economists now expect the central bank to raise interest rates by half a percentage point next week.
"Investors are marking time in front of the meeting," said Mike Feeney, an editor at the independent research firm Wall Street Strategies. "It seems that the wisdom on the Street is that a 50-basis-point hike is a lock." A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
The menu of economic data was light early this week, with more key figures on retail sales and inflation pressure at the wholesale level due out on tomorrow and Friday.
But several Fed officials spoke yesterday. In one speech, Robert Parry, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said he saw inflation threats from strong domestic demand and a tight labor market, and Fed inaction on those threats would be risky.
Edward Gramlich, a Federal Reserve governor, said the central bank was not trying to influence stock market levels.
"We're not explicitly targeting for any set of stock market values," Mr. Gramlich told a group of accountants. "Most of us think that we're managing the whole economy and we're trying to target inflation, unemployment. Period."

Treasuries Post Gains
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as yields at three-month highs lured investors who seemed confident the Federal Reserve would slow growth and curb inflation.
The yield on the most actively traded 10-year note dropped to 6.52 percent from 6.56 percent on Monday. The bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 8/32, to 99 27/32.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 15/32, to 100 19/32. The bond's yield fell to 6.21 percent from 6.24 percent on Monday.
The five-year note rose after the Treasury sold $12 billion of the security at a yield of 6.789 percent, above the 6.772 percent expected by bond dealers before the bidding deadline. The bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, was 1.98 times the amount of notes sold, above that of the last seven sales.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
The World Bank gauges the toll travel takes on employees and looks for ways to soften the effect.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey; Business Travel appears each Wednesday. Joe Sharkey's e-mail address is jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
MY husband missed our son's high school graduation due to business travel. None of us has ever forgotten."
A lot of words were spoken at the World Bank's two-day symposium late last month Stress, the Business Traveler and Corporate Health in Washington. But those two declarative sentences, among the many responses elicited by World Bank managers who surveyed traveling staff members and their spouses, packed real wallop. "None of us has ever forgotten." 
 Corporate America, which often prides itself on the supposed invincibility of the legions of men and women it dispatches around the world, could learn a few things about employee health and welfare from the World Bank. The last two years, the bank has sponsored seminars intended to make employers think more responsibly about the effect ever-increasing travel has on employees and on the people closest to them.
The World Bank, an international organization based in Washington, sends nearly 5,000 employees on international business trips each year, for a total of more than 250,000 days away from home. In 1997, the World Bank sponsored a detailed clinical study that discovered that significantly higher rates of health insurance claims were filed by employees who traveled compared with those who did not. Even more remarkable, frequent travelers, who typically regard themselves as tough and resilient, also account for three times the claims for treatment of stress, anxiety, depression and other psychological-adjustment disorders attributable directly to the demands of being on the road.
This year, prompted by that 1997 study, the bank convened health professionals and managers from 50 corporate and government organizations to discuss follow-up research that was commissioned to examine more closely the psychological impact of frequent business travel.
"We asked our colleagues what's going on?" said Bernhard H. Liese, a senior health adviser and the former medical director of the bank.
The answer that came back, Dr. Liese said, was that adverse effects from travel were "mirrored in the family" as well as in the workplace.
The 1997 clinical study compared health insurance claims filed by 4,700 World Bank managers and professional workers who had taken international business trips with claims filed by 6,000 World Bank employees who did not travel. Across the board, the survey showed a strong correlation between frequency of travel and higher reports of respiratory infections, gastrointestinal distress, skin disorders and back pain -- all understandable, if somewhat surprising, consequences of heavy travel to a wide variety of places.
But the survey's findings of far higher rates of treatment for psychological disorders were especially startling, Dr. Liese said. That is because only about a third of the World Bank's employees in Washington are from North America. The rest come from countries where there is far greater reluctance "to seek treatment from a psychologist," he said.
The follow-up survey on the risks of that psychological stress was by the same team of clinical researchers, which reported: "As international business travel grows, increasing numbers of travelers will be exposed to health risks, including widely varying physical and psychological stressors." In the their report, published in the scientific journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, they added that "business travel is a unique challenge to the health of employees, which to date has not been studied extensively."
High on the list of emotional stresses for heavy business travelers is worry about personal and family lives, including adjustment problems suffered by spouses and children of an employee who is often away from home. Anxiety about the workload piling up back at the office also ranked high on the stress list.
Typically, the researchers said, traveling employees are disinclined to take time off to rest from a tiring business trip. "Although most respondents think it is necessary, very few of them reported that they actually take rest days after business travel," the study said.
Of course, some corporations and bosses pride themselves on instilling a gung-ho workplace culture that presses worn-out corporate travelers to hit the road on demand and show up at the office bright and early on return, no matter where they flew in from the night before.
"Two-thirds of all respondents reported that their managers rarely or never formally grant" a day off after a long trip, reflecting a perceived lack of sanction for taking rest.
Participants at the symposium heard a lot of practical advice on making life easier on traveling employees: train managers to be aware that changing travel dates at the last minute can adversely affect people's lives; be more flexible in allowing travelers to make their own arrangements and to exercise more control over their lives when they are on the road; compensate traveling employees for their weekends; let them call home daily on the company's nickel.
But the most resonant message came from Dr. Liese, who said more attention must be paid to "corporate responsibilities" in employee travel, an area that lies beyond the reach of any governmental workplace or health-and-safety regulator.
Corporations should be accountable, Dr. Liese said, "to their most valuable resource -- their staff."

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: Breaking Out of the Back Room;
Chief Information Officers Get New Respect and Power

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
For years, H. John Lochow felt as though the word "techie" were practically branded on his forehead. As a computer systems manager at the AT&T Capital Corporation and at the CNA Insurance Companies, and later as the chief information officer for a succession of corporations, he says he was never allowed to run other departments, let alone serve on high-level management teams at these firms.
For him, things have turned out well. But Mr. Lochow's lurch up the corporate ladder is not an isolated case. In corporate America, an increasing number of chief information officers -- basically, they are the folks in charge of the computers -- are amassing greater power as top bosses and company boards realize how crucial technical expertise is in staying ahead of the competition. 
 Mr. Lochow (pronounced LUCK-oh) got his chance to break loose from the techie label last year. Opportunity called in the form of a mini-crisis at his current employer, the Tech Data Corporation in Clearwater, Fla., a giant computer distributor that was growing so fast it could not hire enough people to keep up with orders. Its warehouses were bulging with products that could not be shipped.
Mr. Lochow, whose main responsibility as C.I.O. until then had been to maintain the smooth functioning of the company's computers in 35 countries, believed he was the man to break the logjam. So he asked Tech Data's chief executive, Steven A. Raymund, to put him in charge of the company's supply division. After all, he told Mr. Raymund, he had already turned around the information technology operations to make them more efficient, and at no additional cost to the company.
He got the assignment and threw himself into it with tasks like picking apart and mapping every process that Tech Data used in its warehouses to receive and ship its products.
He emerged a hero: within three months, Tech Data had almost doubled its shipments and had trimmed inventory. Now Mr. Lockow reports directly to Mr. Raymund, and earlier this year he was given responsibility for managing yet another department, the one that assembles the company's products.
Mr. Lochow clearly savors his new role at Tech Data. "Now my responsibilities cross many lines of business," he said. "Before, I felt like I was up against a glass ceiling."
A recent survey by Egon Zehnder International, an executive search firm, found that companies are increasingly looking to a new generation of chief information officers to be business strategists, and that these "new" C.I.O.'s spend at least half their time outside the information-technology department on efforts like developing and incubating new prospects for electronic commerce.
The survey found that 15 percent of new chief information officers now serve on the boards of their companies and 70 percent are on their companies' high-level management teams. Those numbers are up sharply from a decade ago, industry specialists say, when 0 percent and 10 percent would have been more likely figures.
The information officers are reveling in their elevation from back-room tinkerers with fancy titles to strategic thinkers on an equal footing with corporate presidents, chief operating officers and chief financial officers.
"We're in the third generation of C.I.O. now," Mr. Lochow said. "The first generation was made up of techies, like data center directors. And although the second generation was more vocal in terms of becoming part of corporate planning, its members were still one level below directly reporting to their chief executives. Now, however, thanks to the Internet, C.I.O.'s are moving directly into corporate decision-making."
Executive recruiters say the trend is the inevitable fallout of the Internet revolution, which has recast the dynamics of the marketplace of almost every industry overnight and forced companies to react with equal speed or face extinction.
"It used to be that companies would say, 'Find us a C.I.O. who will take care of our computer systems,' " said S. Ross Brown, the director of the high-technology and telecommunications recruiting practice at Egon Zehnder. "But now they're calling to say, 'We need a C.I.O. who can help us define our whole way of doing business.' "
Those new responsibilities require new duties, of course, including spending more time with both the corporate brass and customers.
Cecilia Claudio, the chief information officer at the Farmers Group, the Zurich Financial Services subsidiary based in Los Angeles, says her new travel schedule takes some getting used to. In March, Ms. Claudio spent three days crisscrossing Indiana to meet with more than 60 sales agents, something that chief information officers like her would never have done five years ago.
"People don't look to me as just being a C.I.O.," she said. "I'm expected to bring wisdom, to understand all aspects of our business, as well as not work in isolation."
Before Ms. Claudio joined Farmers two years ago, she said, her job at a former employer was focused entirely on the information systems. But now she is asked almost daily for her views on questions like whether to increase the company's sales staff and how to sell multiple products to existing customers.
Because technology now touches every corner of almost every company's business, Ms. Claudio said, chief information officers are probably better prepared than other top managers to assume new responsibilities -- including the mantle of chief executive. "I know of quite a few situations where this has already happened," she said.
Patrick J. Zilvitis, the chief information officer of the Gillette Company, says his expertise is sought out because technology touches every aspect of Gillette's operations, even product design. "I tend to be involved in change management in everything I do," Mr. Zilvitis said.
It is not as though C.I.O.'s are on an unstoppable march to the top at every corporation in America, of course. One school of thought is of the opinion, in fact, that as a group they retain a detail-oriented mentality that can miss the big picture.
Paul Bernard, who founded his own consulting firm in Manhattan, for example, says that for all the changes wrought by the Internet, too many chief information officers continue to "worship" technology, while all but ignoring both the strategic and the customer-service aspects of their jobs.
"The issue for C.I.O.'s and their staffers is that no one has articulated to them how much their jobs have changed," he said.
Some do grasp those changes, of course, and are leveraging their new stature to shop themselves around.
Chris Hjelm left his job as chief information officer at Federal Express in January to become chief operating officer at the Zoho Corporation, an Internet vendor in Sunnyvale, Calif., that caters to hotels and casinos.
After 14 years at Federal Express, Mr. Hjelm said, he had become tired of endlessly reinventing the giant company's computer systems and yearned for a more expansive role.
"I was ready to try something different, as well as be a part of the Internet economy," he said. "Now, I'm creating something new, as well as an entire business model in an industry that's ripe for it. That's why a lot of chief information officers like me are leaving."

HEADLINE: Coke to Advertise on Channel Owned by Lawyer in Bias Suit

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Adding a new twist to the already complicated racial discrimination lawsuit brought against Coca-Cola by a group of its black employees, Coke said yesterday that it was becoming a major advertiser on a cable channel owned by a Florida lawyer who last month began representing four of the plaintiffs.
Coke signed a five-year agreement with the Atlanta-based channel, MBC Network, which plans to broadcast children's shows, movies, cartoons and sports programs specifically for black families 24 hours a day, according to a statement from MBC. 
 The channel, owned by Willie D. Gary, was formed in 1998. It is backed by Evander Holyfield, the boxer; Marlon D. Jackson, one of the original Jackson Five; Cecil Fielder, formerly of the Detroit Tigers; and Alvin D. James, a longtime broadcaster, as well as Mr. Gary.
Coke's name will appear on print and electronic announcements connected with the channel, which will advertise all Coke brands, according to the statement.
Mr. Gary represents four of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Coca-Cola, which was filed 13 months ago and contends that the plaintiffs were denied promotions, raises and other advancement at the company because of their race.
The deal with Coke could raise questions about a conflict of interest between Mr. Gary's role in the lawsuit and Coke's support of his business venture. Mr. Gary could not be reached last night for comment.
Cyrus Mehri, the lawyer who originally represented the four and continues to represent four other current and former Coke employees in the lawsuit, said the arrangement "is an issue between Mr. Gary and the four individuals he represents."
"My team's focus is on fighting for the best possible resolution for the class," Mr. Mehri added.
A Coke spokesman said the company's discussions and final negotiations occurred before Mr. Gary announced his intention to get involved in the lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status for as many as 2,000 Coke employees,
"We're making the ad buy because it gives us an opportunity to support what we believe is some very meaningful programming and connect our advertising with African-American consumers on a frequent and consistent basis," said the spokesman, Ben Deutsch.
Mr. Gary, who is best known for obtaining a $500 million award in a 1995 case against the Loewen funeral home company, was introduced to Coke's former chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Gary is Mr. Jackson's lawyer. The Loewen award was eventually settled at $175 million.
Coke and the employees named in the lawsuit began court-ordered mediation last month.

HEADLINE: South Carolina House Debates Options for Moving Rebel Flag

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., May 9

 BODY:
On the tense opening day of what may be the final debate over flying the Confederate battle flag on the Statehouse dome, an all-white majority of the South Carolina House of Representatives appeared to be willing to accept a compromise that would move the flag to a Confederate monument in front of the Capitol.
The final vote on the proposal, which passed the State Senate last month, will probably come on Wednesday. But in a preliminary vote, 72 of the 120 House members accepted an amendment that would move a smaller version of the flag on July 1 to a pole in front of the Capitol's main entrance. Supporters of the flag, all but 11 of whom were white Republicans, succeeded in passing the amendment, which would make the flag more prominent, raising the size of the pole to 30 feet from the 20 feet proposed by the Senate. Another amendment passed today provides for illuminating it at night. 
 But in a sign of the body's deep racial divisions, none of the House's 26 black members supported the amendments. Many black members already opposed the Senate's proposal, saying that it kept the Confederate flag in a position of prominence, and were even more vehemently against the idea of making the flagpole taller and lighting it up. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which is conducting an economic boycott of the state, also opposes the plan to move the flag to the Confederate Soldier's monument.
Black members, joined by many white Democrats, did support two plans that were voted down by the majority: one to put a bronze relief of the flag on a granite slab near the monument, and the other to fly the flag on an "avenue of flags" adjacent to the Capitol along with other flags that have flown over South Carolina.
White supporters denounced the bronze-relief plan as an "insult" to their heritage, and mustered the votes to defeat it, 65 to 43.
"The Civil War was a big part of the history of the state, not a small part, but huge," said Representative William F. Cotty, a Republican from Columbia. "But this tombstone monument type of bill, you might as well lower it down and give it perpetual care. You're saying, 'Bury that baby, get rid of it.' " About 40 white members were opposed to moving the flag at all, and one member, Representative John Milton Knotts Jr. of West Columbia, said he would prefer that the Confederate flag fly above the United States and South Carolina flags.
Black legislators, all of whom are Democrats, said it was clear that the Republican leadership of the House was doing everything possible to make the flag extremely prominent once it came down from the dome, making the entire exercise of moving it essentially meaningless. They said that putting a symbol of slavery at the entrance to the Capitol was nearly as offensive as flying it on high.
"They voted down every suggestion we made to put it in historical context, and they're just trying to ram it down our throats," said Representative J. Todd Rutherford of Columbia. "If they try to pass this without any of our votes tomorrow, it will once again be a case of the great white fathers knowing what's best for the African-Americans of this state."
Speaker David H. Wilkins, a Republican, said it appeared that the House was moving toward the 30-foot-flagpole provision, which he supported. But Mr. Wilkins said Republicans in the House would not bear all the weight of moving the flag; they will not support it in a final vote if Democrats, and particularly black members, remain opposed, he said.

Behind Painting Sold Online Was a Partly False Story
The man who sold a painting on the Internet for $135,805 acknowledged that he concocted part of the story he used to describe the work, which bore the initials "R.D.," creating speculation that it was painted by the California artist Richard Diebenkorn.
Far from being a married homeowner who cleaned the painting out of his garage, the man is a single lawyer who has sold paintings on eBay before. But he said that he did not fake the painting or add the signature and that he would cancel the sale if experts determine that the canvas is not by Diebenkorn. Page A1.

When Bestfoods rejected a takeover offer from Unilever last week, it seemed emphatic.

The executives' position hints that Bestfoods would consider a merger at the right price, analysts said. Shares of Bestfoods fell $1, to $63.50. C2.

HEADLINE: PATAKI PROPOSES A FISCAL BAILOUT OF NASSAU COUNTY

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, N.Y., May 9

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki went to Nassau County today offering a $100 million state bailout to help one of the nation's wealthiest counties avert financial ruin.
In return, the debt-ridden county has to allow the state to monitor its finances and future budgets and agree to make large spending cuts over the next four years. 
 If the county fails to make the required spending cuts -- $50 million this year and an additional $70 million in each of the next three years -- the state will withhold the aid and impose a more powerful financial control board with the power to tell the county what cuts to make and even to abrogate civil service contracts.
"It is a carrot and stick," Governor Pataki said as he announced the plan, which he said could restore the county to fiscal stability without raising taxes. His proposal requires the approval of county officials and the State Legislature; leaders of both parties on both levels of government reacted favorably to the plan today and said they expected it to pass.
The governor took the extraordinary steps of intervening in the affairs of a local government -- and of pledging millions in state aid to the wealthy county -- after years of unbalanced budgeting left Nassau County running out of money during one of the longest periods of economic prosperity in the nation's history.
The plan would include $100 million in state aid spread out over five years and would set up a financial authority with the ability to sell new bonds, guaranteed by the county's sales tax revenue. That would allow Nassau County to borrow money at a lower interest rate than the county, whose bonds are hovering just above junk status, can now get on its own. The arrangement is intended to buy the county time while it makes severe, long-term spending cuts.
In announcing his fiscal recovery plan, the governor said that he wanted to ensure that a county of vital economic importance to the state did not go bankrupt. Credit rating agencies have already threatened to reduce the county's bond rating to junk status if it does not put a financial plan in place by June 30.
Wall Street reacted guardedly. "This gives them more time, but it highlights the necessity to come up with real, ongoing changes in the fiscal operation of the county," said Steven Murphy, a managing director at Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency.
But the governor's actions have a political impact as well: the fiscal crisis already led Nassau County, long one of the state's most solid Republican bastions, to elect a Democratic majority to its County Legislature in November. And Republicans fear that continuing anger over the county's finances could mean more losses this November in races for the State Legislature, the United States Senate and the presidency.
The plan that was announced today has been in the works since March, when Governor Pataki appointed Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the group that runs the Nasdaq stock exchange, as his special adviser on Nassau County. Mr. Zarb found that the county's 2000 budget of $2.2 billion was $178 million short, and that if no action were taken the deficit would balloon to $233 million next year and $321 million by 2003.
Mr. Zarb painted a grim portrait of Nassau's fiscal practices, noting that the county had become increasingly dependent on selling off its assets and borrowing money through bonds to meet its expenses, which have grown drastically as its spending far outpaced the rate of inflation. The county is now $2.7 billion in debt; Mr. Zarb found that the county spent roughly one out of every five dollars servicing its debt.
And he noted that Nassau's antiquated property tax system -- the county has already agreed to overhaul it -- had forced it to borrow $800 million to pay refunds to people who successfully challenged their taxes, and to pay interest on that money.
To put the county back on its feet, the governor proposed the creation of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, which would sell new bonds backed by the county's sales tax at a lower cost to the county and refinance the county's existing debt so that it could be paid back in smaller installments over a longer time.
In return, the authority would have the power to monitor the county's finances.
If the county met its obligations, it would get $100 million in state aid over the next five years, and the state would give the county an additional $5 million to hire lawyers and assessors to help the county reduce its backlog of tax refund claims.
But if the county failed to immediately cut $50 million in spending and adopt a balanced four-year financial plan, the state would appoint a control board with the power to tell the county what cuts to make.
Just where the county's cuts would come from -- $260 million over four years -- was far from clear. In recent days Democrats and Republicans have met to discuss possible cuts, including $10 million to the county's Police Department, reductions of county contracts, the abolition of one county agency and the mergers of others.
Such plans are unusual. Noting how rare it is for a state to bail out a foundering local government, David Liebschutz, an adjunct professor at Rockefeller College at the State University at Albany, invoked the other famous case of a wealthy suburb in distress: Orange County, Calif., which went bankrupt in 1994 after losing $2 billion on bad investments. "They asked for help and the state basically said to them, 'Tough, you work it out, you have the resources,' " he said. "That tends to be the approach."
New York State came to the rescue of New York City in 1975, Yonkers in 1975 and 1984, and Troy in 1994. But the scale of the assistance proposed for Nassau County is unusual, and it is even rarer for the state to establish a fiscal monitor and create a new agency to help the county borrow money.
Mr. Pataki's plan was generally welcomed today by the Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, and both Democrats and Republicans on the County Legislature.
Nassau County Democrats have called for a fiscal monitor for more than a year, even after they won control of the County Legislature in November. This year, at their urging, the Democratic-controlled State Assembly passed a bill that would have created a fiscal monitor with powers similar to the finance authority the governor proposed today.
Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat who is the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said that while she would still need to see more details of the plan, she approved of its broad outlines and expected it to pass.
"It gives us good outside help putting Nassau County back on sure footing, but it doesn't remove from us the responsibilities of good government," she said of the proposal.
Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican leader, said unequivocally that his caucus would support the plan. And Mr. Gulotta, the county executive, said that if he were given one word to describe the plan, the word would be "perfect."
Once the County Legislature and the executive formally ask the state to adopt a proposal, the plan will go to Albany for approval.
Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who is the Assembly speaker, said he was favorably disposed to the plan, noting its similarities to a bill calling for oversight that the Assembly had already passed. And he said that while the prospect of giving $100 million to a wealthy county might raise eyebrows, he thought it could be worked out.
"Obviously, there are other parts of the state that are in need of assistance as well," he said, "but we pull together for people who are in need."
State Senator Dean Skelos, the deputy leader of the Republican majority, praised the plan as well.
Privately, some county leaders wondered where they would find $260 million in recurring spending cuts over the next four years.

HEADLINE: Montana Town Grapples With Asbestos Ills

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: LIBBY, Mont.

 BODY:
When W. R. Grace & Company sold them the 21-acre site along the Kootenai River seven years ago, Mel and Lerah Parker were ecstatic. They finally had a tract large enough to build new quarters for their thriving nursery business and a new home.
Now, the business is closed, and bulldozers will soon raze everything on the land, forcing the Parkers to find a new place to live and work. In recent months, tests have revealed that their property is contaminated by a toxic form of asbestos called tremolite, the result of years in which Grace used the site as a transport center for the vermiculite ore the company mined nearby. 
 Tremolite, a microscopic fiber that causes lung disease and several forms of cancer, occurs naturally in vermiculite, which is used in insulation and dozens of other products.
"Katie, my 7-year-old granddaughter, is asking me if I'm going to die," Mrs. Parker said, sobbing. "Why should children that age be thinking about things like that?"
The Parkers knew of lawsuits linking the mining operations to illness. But Mrs. Parker said no one from Grace ever told them that ore dust -- all over the property when they bought it -- posed any lingering health threat from asbestos.
As a result, the Parkers are among a growing list of Libby residents reeling from the medical, psychological and financial consequences of the mining operation, which over its 67 years provided desperately needed high-paying jobs here in the vast stretches of northwest Montana.
Though Grace shut it down in 1990, the mine is being blamed for scores of cases of respiratory illness and death from exposure to the tremolite. The problems in Libby, a town of 2,700, represent the "most significant single source of asbestos exposure" in the nation's history, said Paul Peronard, a coordinator for the Environmental Protection Agency.
The area contaminated by the mining operation is now the agency's first priority for cleanup, which will probably take six months and cost $3 million, Mr. Peronard said. Who will pay for the cleanup is still in dispute, but the agency said it would proceed while negotiating with Grace.
In the last 15 years, scores of local residents, armed with medical opinions linking their relatives' deaths to asbestos exposure from mining, have filed lawsuits against Grace, charging negligence and deceit.
Without acknowledging any deliberate wrongdoing, Grace has settled dozens of cases out of court, largely to avoid expensive litigation, company lawyers said; other cases are still pending. Meanwhile, the company has also offered medical coverage for people who were exposed.
Aside from exacting a human toll, the mining operation has raised questions for people here concerning how much Grace knew about the dangers of asbestos and whether state supervision was too lax.
The story has also caused deep divisions in Libby. Some residents welcome the recent publicity and governmental attention, but others fear they are the new millennium's version of the 1970's environmental disaster in the Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls, N.Y. The story here, they say, might do irreversible damage to a town struggling to share in the nation's economic good times.
While acknowledging the problem, Grace executives said that little was known at the time about the effects of asbestos, and that as knowledge grew, they did their best to comply with the safety standards of the day.
"There is no question in my mind that if the company knew how to do it, if anybody knew how to do it, it was done," said Harry Eschenbach, the company's director of health and safety for 20 years, through 1997.
Mr. Eschenbach insisted that Grace violated no laws, provided annual chest X-rays and updated technologies in Libby. "Sure, the state would come in and tell us to do more," he said. "But do what? The technology wasn't always there. If it was, we'd have used it."
Mr. Eschenbach also denied that Grace hid anything. The workers, he said, had "a right to know the hazards to which they are exposed. I always told them, one on one and in groups of one on two or three."
For the most part, the rising incidence of illness and the ensuing legal battles have played out in relative obscurity. Then, in November, articles by The Daily Inter Lake in Kalispell, Mont., and The Seattle Post-Intelligencer brought new focus to the mining operations and caught the attention of the E.P.A. Tests of air and soil since then found several areas still contaminated by asbestos.
As a result of the review and lawsuits, a fuller picture of the operation and its effect on Libby has emerged.
For as long as the mine operated -- 40 years under the now-defunct Zonolite Company, its last 27 under Grace -- workers, as well as company and state officials, recognized illness as an occupational risk. Nor did anyone especially fear any deadly impact of asbestos in the early days.
In fact, the residue containing asbestos was so abundant and powdery that Libby children were invited to play in it. Many did. Other people took bags home to use as insulation, mulch and cat litter.
Joan Runyan, 73, a former office secretary for Grace, said she used the dust as filler in recipes for muffins and bread and ate it. "At the time, nobody made the connection to any problems," she said, adding that she suffered no ill effects.
But as the years wore on, the mine workers suffered various respiratory illnesses, and deaths from them slowly rose. By the early 1980's, doctors were seeing the same illnesses in the workers' wives and children; family members had been exposed when the miners returned home, still wearing dust-covered workclothes.
Nearly 200 deaths were attributed to asbestos exposure by lawsuits and newspaper studies of medical records and death certificates; no one disputes the figures. And more could be coming. Research shows that asbestos-caused diseases like asbestosis, a fatal scarring of the lungs, can take 30 years or more to develop.
As the pattern became clear, the first of scores of lawsuits was filed in the mid-1980's, asserting that company officials ignored warnings by state agencies to clean up the mining operations. By Grace's own count, it is now a defendant in 121 cases from people exposed in Libby. In 72 previous cases, Grace paid $15.6 million through 60 settlements and 4 jury verdicts against the company. Eight other suits were dismissed.
For Grace, a giant chemical and packaging company based in Columbia, Md., this is another unwanted environmental fight. The company was the focus of the book and film "A Civil Action," about lawsuits by eight Massachusetts families accusing it of dumping chemicals that leaked into wells and caused leukemia.
Indeed, Grace is a defendant in asbestos-related lawsuits from 105,000 plaintiffs around the country, including those in Libby. But company officials contend that Grace did nothing wrong in Libby.
Jay Hughes, a lawyer for Grace, said he believed that many of the lawsuits had been filed at the urging of personal injury lawyers. Grace, he said, offered to settle cases to avoid "the risks of a trial."
Some lawsuits, however, include as evidence extensive material -- much of it from Grace's own files -- that shows state and federal agencies warned the company often, and as early as the 1960's, that conditions at the Libby mine, the transport center and Grace's processing plant posed health hazards.
More than 15 years ago, one local doctor, Richard Irons, was so alarmed by the growth in nonoccupational cases of asbestosis that he traveled to a Grace division in Cambridge, Mass., to request money for pulmonary equipment to study the impact of the disease in Libby.
"He was told to leave it alone," said Dr. Brad Black, who was Dr. Irons's partner at the time. "They just dismissed him and did nothing."
Mr. Eschenbach, who met with Dr. Irons, said Grace had already undertaken the study he was suggesting.
Grace has pledged $250,000 a year "for the foreseeable future" for a screening program in Libby and proposed a long-term health care plan.
But local health officials, residents and their lawyers have criticized both as inadequate; many contend the health care plan enables people to qualify only after they have grown seriously ill or close to death. Dr. Black, who is trying to help establish a trust fund in Libby for asbestos victims, claimed the plan's eligibility requirements would exclude 85 percent of people who are now affected.
Nor have state and federal agencies been especially helpful to Libby, according to the lawsuits. In response to a 1983 inquiry, from Representative James A. Courter of New Jersey, an E.P.A. official, Don R. Clay, said that tests of the mine found only minor problems with asbestos and that the vermiculite industry had improved worker safety.
As a result, Mr. Clay wrote, the agency would turn its efforts against asbestos elsewhere.
Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, a two-term Republican who grew up in Libby, said the apparent lack of oversight by governmental agencies over the years mirrored times when the country knew little of the hazards of asbestos and when workers happy to have good-paying jobs rarely complained about the inconveniences of any respiratory ailments.
For many years, Mr. Racicot said, state inspections included confidentiality agreements that no information could be made public.
Additionally, by the 1980's, a new era arrived in Washington, a pro-business, anti-regulatory attitude championed by the Reagan administration that believed government should get out of people's lives.
"For many of these people, working was more important than safety," said Mr. Racicot, who recalled playing in piles of asbestos dust as a child. "And in all the conversations I had with family and friends in Libby I've known for years, I never heard one complaint about asbestos."
That all changed in November. The E.P.A. announced a plan to test air and soil samples well into this year and found, initially, two "hot spots" -- the Parker property and the area around what was then the ore processing plant near downtown.
The agency has pledged to clean those sites first, but is also conducting tests in other states where Grace shipped vermiculite over the years.
The growing realization about the damage left by the mines has stirred anger and resentment toward Grace among many local residents. But it has also inspired sympathy for the company from residents who recall how it once made the town thrive.
Some also complain that news coverage has scared off companies that might have relocated here. "I've literally had people on the phone say to me that their doctors have told them it would be suicidal to move here," said Russell S. Barnes, president of the Lincoln County Economic Development Council.
Mr. Peronard, the E.P.A. official, said the area was generally safe. By year's end, he predicted, all remaining problem areas will be eliminated.
But legal fights will not go away. "It's depressing," said Roger Sullivan, a lawyer who has handled 150 Libby suits, "because none of these stories really has a happy ending."

Education and the Economy

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
UNEMPLOYMENT is now only 3.9 percent, its lowest level in 30 years. A dozen years ago the economy was in bad shape, with widespread unemployment. The United States could not seem to compete with other industrial nations.
Schools were widely blamed. The prevailing view was that high unemployment was mostly due to high school graduates who lacked the skills of German or Japanese workers. 
 Today the crisis is a dim memory, and America's economy is the world's envy. Yet schools are, at best, only marginally better, so prosperity cannot be the result of school reform. That means schools were not to blame for the nation's earlier doldrums.
If we had recognized sooner the limited role schools play in determining economic success, would we have embarked on identical reforms? Or would education policy have been less politicized, with more tolerance for experimentation?
As late as 1994, unemployment was still over 6 percent, and the dropout rate was twice that. Black and Hispanic workers were most severely affected.
At the time, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, insisted that schools were the problem. He said those without jobs lacked the skills employers need.
Most economists then feared that attempts to lower unemployment would spur inflation. President Clinton's first appointees to the Federal Reserve, Alan Blinder and Janet Yellen, supported Dr. Greenspan's tighter money policies, aimed at keeping joblessness from falling.
Their logic was this: some workers had left jobs and were seeking new ones, but would find work soon. Faster growth could not eliminate such transitions. Other workers wanting jobs were too poorly educated to be hired. Growth could not help them either, because they lacked minimum skills.
Because, the reasoning went, no adequately educated workers were left when joblessness fell to 6 percent, efforts to create new jobs would only cause companies to bid for those already employed, by offering them higher wages. Inflation, not more jobs, would follow. Unemployment could drop further only if schools improved to make graduates more attractive hires.
Today, with unemployment less than 4 percent, many formerly jobless high school dropouts have found jobs. Unemployment has plummeted, even for the most vulnerable, black teenagers.
Perhaps America has now reached a point where growth should be slowed. But it was a huge mistake to have believed that 6, not 4 percent unemployment (or less) was the target rate. Some three million Americans suffered prolonged joblessness because policy makers wrongly assumed they were too poorly schooled to work.
Economists attribute today's growth with mild inflation not to improved schools, but to factors like greater efficiency, downward price pressure from growing imports and a willingness to experiment with lower interest rates.
But Dr. Greenspan has not wavered. Before initiating the current round of interest rate increases last year, he told the Congressional Joint Economic Committee that "we fall far short" in public education. The nation cannot maintain prosperity, he said, if schools do not improve. Nobody asked why the chairman's earlier "blame the schools" approach was flawed, and whether the error was now being repeated.
A decade ago, the views of Dr. Greenspan, Dr. Blinder and Dr. Yellen were commonplace. In 1992, Prof. Lester C. Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published the best-selling book "Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, America and Europe" (William Morrow). It predicted that Europe would "own the 21st century," partly because poor schools make America uncompetitive. "To create the productivity that can justify high wages," Dr. Thurow said, "American K-12 education will have to improve."
But since then, American productivity has soared, wages have recovered and America's economy has left Japan's and Europe's in the dust. It seems that today's productivity growth stems from years of accumulated innovation, and that American schools do, after all, produce a work force with adequate skills to use new technologies.
Those who blamed schools for earlier economic stagnation were well meaning. But curiously, reputations of mistaken analysts have not been sullied, while the damage they did to the reputation of education's role in the American economy has endured.
Perhaps we would have wanted similar cures, even after diagnoses were altered. Even in a healthy economy, we should improve the ability of less advantaged students to compete for better jobs. But we might have approached reform differently had we known we were trying to raise achievement beyond levels required for economic growth alone.

$30 Million Upgrade Set For a 42nd St. Building

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
The owners of the Lincoln Building, a 1.2-million-square-foot structure diagonally across 42nd Street from Grand Central Terminal, have had a close-up view of neighborhood improvements in recent years. Now they are beginning their own renovation, a $30 million program that includes preparing space to attract office users larger than the small tenants who have long occupied most of the building.
The program includes wiring for the Internet, replacing all single-pane windows with more energy-efficient double-pane units, adding computer controls for the elevators and remodeling the interiors of the cabs, adding new bathrooms and air-conditioning the hallways. 
 The intention is to make the 70-year-old building, which has 600 tenants at 60 East 42nd Street, attractive to tenants who want all the amenities and services of a much newer building. Some small tenants in the building who occupy just a few hundred square feet may be forced to look elsewhere; the owners are assembling blocks of 5,000 to 10,000 square feet of space that could attract larger tenants who may be better able to pay annual rents that are now about $50 a square foot.
The investment in the Lincoln Building was prompted by a $300 million renovation of Grand Central Terminal and the general improvement of the neighborhood, said Peter L. Malkin, the chairman of Wien & Malkin, a law firm and real estate asset manager, and the general partner in the syndicates that own the building and the master operating lease. Mr. Malkin, who is in a legal dispute with Helmsley-Spear, the building's manager, is acting as the owners' representative. "We want to reposition the building to be No. 1 in an area that is a hub of transportation," said Mr. Malkin, noting that plans are under way to have Long Island Rail Road trains stop at Grand Central.
In fact, the building has underground access to both the rail terminal and the Lexington Avenue and Times Square shuttle subway lines. The door between the building and the passages leading to Grand Central and the subway was reopened about a year ago after having been closed for 25 years, said Kevin J. Driscoll, the building's general manager. Mr. Driscoll said the decision to open the door came as crime and the number of homeless people living in the area were both reduced.
Mr. Malkin, whose office is in the building, had something to do with the changes in the neighborhood. He was one of the founders of the Grand Central Partnership, a business improvement district that provides cleaning and security services on the streets and offers consulting to small businesses in the district.
Mr. Malkin quoted his late father-in-law, Lawrence A. Wien, as saying the law firm believed in "enlightened self-interest." When Mr. Wien led the group that bought the building in 1954, he installed a law library that was available to anyone in the building and has a full-time librarian. Not surprisingly, 92 lawyers and law firms are tenants.
Part of the renovation is to move the library from a lower-level concourse to the lobby level and combine it with a conference center equipped with advanced communications equipment. The conference center will be on the Madison Avenue side of the building, which has an entrance on the avenue as well as on 42nd and 41st Streets.
Since rents in the building have risen to about $50 a square foot from the high $20's and low $30's per square foot annually as recently as five years ago, Fred C. Pozniak, director of marketing for Wein & Malkin, said some tenants may want to economize by eliminating seldom-used conference rooms in favor of renting the center as needed.
All bathrooms in the building are being renovated at a cost of $80,000 each, Mr. Driscoll said. Because of the building's age, much of the plumbing had to be replaced.
Security is also being improved with the installation of a computerized system that will read coded cards issued to tenants and their employees. The system will record the names of people entering or leaving the building and how long they were inside.
Mr. Malkin said the building's managers had been coordinating the expirations of leases so that those on each floor of the 55-story structure will roll over at the same time. The seventh floor on the Madison Avenue wing has been assembled into an 11,000-square-foot space. "When the time comes we will evaluate the market for 5,000-, 10,000- and 15,000-square-foot units, and we will be free to do that if appropriate," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PRIMARIES;
West Virginia And Nebraska Chose Slates For Elections

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: OMAHA, Neb., May 9

 BODY:
Attorney General Donald B. Stenberg of Nebraska took the first step today toward reclaiming Senator Bob Kerrey's seat for the Republicans, easily defeating the secretary of state and two other candidates in the Republican primary.
With 38 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Stenberg had 43,168 votes, or 50 percent, far more than Secretary of State Scott Moore's 20,737 votes, or 24 percent. 
 Mr. Stenberg will take on Ben Nelson, a popular former governor, who left office in 1999 after two terms. Mr. Nelson easily beat his only opponent in the Democratic primary for M
r. Kerrey's seat.
Mr. Kerrey, the only Democrat in Nebraska's congressional delegation, decided not to run for a third term and will instead become president of New School University in New York City.
Mr. Stenberg recently defended Nebraska's ban on what it calls partial-birth abortions before the United States Supreme Court. He beat Mr. Moore despite the secretary of state's edge in fund-raising.
In other primaries today, Tom Osborne, a former University of Nebraska football coach, routed his two opponents in a Republican congressional primary. Mr. Osborne is adored in Nebraska, though the struggling farm economy and other issues have dominated his campaign.
With 64 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Osborne had 32,303 votes, or 71 percent. John Gale, a longtime state Republican leader, followed with 7,993 votes, or 17 percent, and Kathy Wilmot, a member of the state Board of Education, had 5,489 votes, or 12 percent.
There were presidential primaries in Nebraska and West Virginia, but both were essentially meaningless since Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore have sealed their parties' nominations.
Gov. Cecil H. Underwood of West Virginia, who was elected to his first term as governor in 1956 and to his second term in 1996, easily won the Republican nomination for his third term. At 77, Mr. Underwood is the nation's oldest governor. He is also the only Republican in a statewide office in West Virginia. He will face Representative Bob Wise, who won the Democratic primary.
Four Democrats vied for Mr. Wise's seat, including Secretary of State Ken Hechler, 85, who spent 18 years in Congress, from 1959 to 1977. Mr. Hechler finished third, well behind the winner, Jim Humphreys, a lawyer who spent $3 million of his own money.
Mr. Hechler spent about $300,000 of his own money and said spending anything over $1 million in a primary was "overkill."
With 43 percent of precincts reporting, Humphreys had 14,861 votes, or 41 percent, while State Senator Martha Yeager Walker had 10,744 votes, or 30 percent. Mr. Hechler had 8,704 votes, or 24 percent.
West Virginia is a heavily Democratic state so whoever wins that race will be favored to beat Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, this fall. Ms. Capito, a member of the state House of Delegates, is the daughter of a former governor, Arch Moore Jr.

Aid on New Jersey Exports

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Under an agreement signed yesterday, New Jersey businesses could get more help selling their products to foreign countries.
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and the Export-Import Bank of the United States formalized a relationship that, over the last five years, has helped bankroll $2.2 billion worth of business in New Jersey. 
 The agreement basically says the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission will work with the bank to make businesses more aware of export opportunities.
The Export-Import Bank is a federal agency that guarantees loans made to other countries so they can buy American-made products. The bank also lends money to other countries to buy American goods.

HEADLINE: Transforming Theater Row;
An Unlikely Urban Drama Heads for a Happy Ending

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Some of the prostitutes had Actors' Equity cards. That, at least, was a point of connection for the theater people and other dreamers who 25 years ago thought they could reclaim perhaps the seediest sex strip on wild West 42nd Street.
There was another link to culture. The International Body Rub Institute, the French Palace and other massage parlors that lined the block between 9th and 10th Avenues were decorated with murals: nudes, many painted by a quixotic Israeli artist who waited on tables down the block at the Hello Deli. 
 "It was like the Bloomsbury Group goes porn," recalled Andre Bishop, artistic director of the Lincoln Center Theater and one of the founders of Playwrights Horizons, a pioneer in the ultimately successful effort to turn the block into the flourishing Theater Row, which prefigured the far larger revival of 42nd Street and Times Square.
Now the eastern half of the enclave, between Ninth and Dyer Avenues, is poised for its own transformation. With the stroke of a pen -- lots of strokes of lots of pens, actually -- the biggest Off Broadway theater redevelopment project in New York City history has taken final form.
Contracts for a new 499-seat Shubert theater, five new or rebuilt smaller theaters and a 40-story apartment tower overlooking the Dyer Avenue exit from the Lincoln Tunnel were signed on April 14, supercharging a renewal that until now has been makeshift.
There was no self-congratulatory announcement but relief that the complex series of closings had survived. Participants looked back at what some called an unlikely urban drama, largely unscripted, with (so far anyway) a happy ending. In all, from pornographic past to high-rise future, the resurgence became, quite literally, a groundbreaking story of urban renewal through the arts.
It even drew praise from an unlikely quarter: Martin Hodas, known in his heyday in the 1970's as "the peep show king" and the entrepreneur behind many X-rated storefronts that have since been driven from the area.
"I think it's a wonderful thing they did," said Mr. Hodas from his home in Queens. "I never liked the idea of massage parlors."
The strip, a theater locale in decades past, entered the 1970's so tawdry that some visitors preferred to come and go walking down the yellow line in the middle of West 42nd Street, far from the soliciting women and the string of menacing sex boutiques and grungy groceries.
The "Live Burlesque" house, where women strolled around talking off their clothes and pointing absently to parts of their anatomy, ignored its electrical bills, so Con Edison finally ripped up the street and disconnected the power cable to the building.
The cellar of another club was home to a reclusive old woman with an enormous wardrobe who emerged intermittently in full makeup and laden with jewelry to roam the block shrieking at passers-by.
Into this mix in 1975 stepped Playwrights Horizons, a four-year-old company that had just lost its home in the West Side Y.M.C.A. Its artistic director, Bob Moss, took one look around and decided, "Sometimes you have to do things that don't make any sense, and this is one of them." He took quarters in an abandoned pornographic movie house at 422 West 42nd Street for $1,200 a month and rechristened it the Judith Anderson Theater, then soon expanded Playwrights' stake on the block by moving down the street to the former burlesque house at No. 416, at twice the rent.
The company appealed for help from Broadway luminaries, among them Richard Rodgers. Instead of cash he sent a contribution more to the point: $500 worth of paint, Lysol and cleaning equipment.
Even the streetwalkers pitched in, Mr. Bishop recalled, with those holding union cards asking for parts. "There was an odd camaraderie on the block," he said, "particularly when the fleet was in."
The company soon put itself on the map with hits like "Vanities."
A second brave troupe, the Lion Company, arrived, and others, including the South Street Theater, Intar and the Acting Company soon followed. Mr. Moss, who left Playwrights to become artistic director at Syracuse Stage, a leading outpost of regional theater, dated the turnabout from the day in 1975 when he looked out of his window and saw strangers, including one out-of-place interloper in a business suit, surveying the strip for who knew what.
They included Fred Papert (the suit), who had founded the nonprofit 42nd Street Development Corporation during the successful effort to save Grand Central Terminal on East 42nd Street from the wrecker's ball. (His compatriot in the effort, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, later wielded a shovel in the Theater Row groundbreaking.)
Mr. Papert's group had bought the block of West 42nd Street between 9th and 10th Avenues from desperate landlords who had been losing money and faced mounting tax bills while playing reluctant host to sex establishments. By holding a mortgage on the properties of the nonprofit group, they at least had a chance for some financial recovery if the renewal took, which is in fact what happened.
Looking at the unsightly buildings, Mr. Papert wondered what it would it would take, short of demolition, to turn the neighborhood around.
Mr. Moss told him: "I have a better idea. This can all be turned into theaters."
By picking tenants who changed the "urban vibrations," as Mr. Papert put it, his group turned the trickle of new theaters into a boomlet, which he hoped to advance with his relentless promotion of a 42nd Street trolley line.
The failure of the new Manhattan Plaza housing towers across West 42nd Street to draw sufficient tenants to the wasteland produced another opportunity: 80 percent of the units were earmarked for low-paid people in the performing arts. That idea proved a bonanza.
"I remember the first lights going on in the apartments," Mr. Bishop said. "It was an outstanding moment. Suddenly we didn't feel as desolate."
Now the last links with the gritty past are about to be severed. Demolition for the new apartment tower and theaters began last week by the builders, Daniel Brodsky, Robert Quinlan and Michael Field. They said the $75 million job, which includes 260 rental apartments, 20 percent of them for low- and moderate-income tenants, could be completed in 18 months.
The Shubert organization is spending $6 million or more on its new theater, its 17th wholly owned establishment in the city and the city's first commercial stage built specifically as a transfer house for productions that start modestly off or off Off Broadway and then, on the strength of reviews, seek to make the leap to theaters large enough to earn money or even, if lightening strikes, to Broadway. The new theater will be run by Ben Sprecher, who owns the Variety Arts and Promenade Theaters and manages the Lucille Lortel.
The project also includes two theaters with 99 seats and one with 199 seats on a 41st Street parcel acquired from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. They will replace three 99-seat theaters that now occupy the Shubert site. Two other theaters of 83 and 99 seats, the Harold Clurman and the Samuel Beckett, will be rebuilt in place, and support space, including new rehearsal studios, will be provided.
In addition Playwrights Horizons, which sold its air rights and made it possible for the new Shubert theater to be unobstructed by columns for the apartment tower over it, is expected shortly to announce the rebuilding of its two theaters of 141 and 72 seats. This makes a total of eight new or rebuilt theaters seating 1,291 patrons. The number of seats in each theater is determined by contract provisions setting minimum union pay scales for houses of various sizes.
The work, designed by the architect Hugh Hardy of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, is to be financed entirely with private money, said Mr. Papert of the 42nd Street Development Corporation.
A project has yet to be developed for the western half of Theater Row, between Dyer and 10th Avenues. The site includes the Douglas Fairbanks and John Houseman Theaters, among others, and the National Video Center in the former West Side Airlines Terminal. The block, bought for its tax deductions by investors nearly 25 years ago for $500,000, is now worth $60 million to $80 million, said Mr. Papert, whose group is a minority partner.
After paying its costs, the 42nd Street group expects to emerge with about $2 million for its foundation, which supports early music education from kindergarten to second grade. Mr. Papert's group will also do the bookings (but not determine the content) for all the theaters except the Shubert house and Playwrights, a role that had been envisioned for Art New York, a service organization for nonprofit theaters. It and Mr. Papert's group, however, could not agree on terms for a deal.
Among those looking back in wonderment is Jean-Claude Baker, proprietor of Chez Josephine, the restaurant at 414 West 42nd Street, between Playwrights Horizons and the Clurman Theater. Mr. Baker, who was adopted by Josephine Baker, the flamboyant black entertainer, plans to buy its building from the 42nd Street group and turn part of it into a museum of black entertainment.
While the building, once a coffee roasting business, housed a restaurant when he took it over in 1986, it also used to be home to the French Palace, which beckoned customers with a window sign promising, "$10 Complete Satisfaction." One of the nudes painted by the women at the massage parlor survives in the restaurant, covered by a slightly less revealing painting of Josephine Baker wearing bananas.
Mr. Bishop, too, marvels at the developments. "This story is so small time," he said. "Modest theaters, modest budgets, modest aspirations, but big time in terms of human richness."
"Urban renewal," he added, "was the last thing on our minds."

HEADLINE: When Peace Is Worse Than War

BYLINE: By William Reno; William Reno, who teaches political science at Northwestern, is the author of "Warlord Politics and African States."

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
Sometimes it is better to wage war than to agree to an unstable and unworkable peace, a proposition that the current crisis in Sierra Leone bears out.
A peace agreement signed in July 1999 was supposed to help rebuild Sierra Leone by installing a coalition government, composed of the current president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and Foday Sankoh, the ruthless leader of the main rebel group. 
 Under the accord, Mr. Sankoh became a vice president and commissioner of diamond resources, the country's main source of income. Three of his lieutenants became ministers of government. All were offered a blanket amnesty for past crimes. In exchange, United Nations peacekeepers were to take the weapons of all combatants. Instead, the rebels have captured and disarmed 500 peacekeepers, and the country is in chaos once again.
This agreement failed for several related reasons. It mistakenly assumed that the rebels were interested in peace, let alone had an interest in real governing. It assumed that there was a civil war and treated Mr. Sankoh as a legitimate champion of the rural poor, whose interests he claimed to represent. In reality, Mr. Sankoh is not rebelling in any political sense. He has been interested only in taking advantage of a corrupt state that had collapsed.
So, from the rebels' point of view, why have peace when it is the absence of law and order that enables one to loot? Why let peacekeeping troops enter the country's diamond mining area if one is profiting from the sale of these riches on the black market?
In fact, the rebels never had any intention of honoring the peace accord; they were only interested in waging war and looting the country. The United Nations, so reflexively attached to the mantra of peace at any price, sent peacekeeping troops when there was no peace to keep. The United Nations and the State Department, which helped negotiate the peace accord, should have known better. As recently as March 1999, the United Nations Security Council had threatened to prosecute Mr. Sankoh for war crimes. Earlier, a State Department report on Sierra Leone had noted the discovery of civilian mass graves in areas where the rebels had attacked.
Why would the United Nations and the United States agree to a power-sharing agreement with Mr. Sankoh, whose forces have killed, raped and maimed tens of thousands of men, women and even children?
The answer can be found in President Clinton's statement during his April 1999 visit to Rwanda, when he lamented the lack of United States action to stop the genocide there. After this speech, the Clinton administration wanted to show that it cared about human rights in Africa. Engineering a peace accord in Sierra Leone, however slapdash, sent the desired message.
In the last few days, Nigeria has agreed to send its own forces back to Sierra Leone, provided the West pays their costs. The West should jump at this, not only because these soldiers are likely to be better equipped and trained than the United Nations forces, but because they can fight back.
Unconstrained by the rules of peacekeeping, the Nigerians can wage war against the rebels. And Nigeria, unlike the West, has national interests at stake. Trouble anywhere in West Africa is a threat to its stability.
The peace agreement in Sierra Leone was quick and cheap, but doomed. Let us hope that the West now recognizes this -- and doesn't opt for a second try at an accord.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Agency Takes Over Camden's Troubled Finances

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 10

 BODY:
New Jersey's fiscal oversight agency today formally took over the financial operation of Camden, the state's poorest city and one that has for years, over several mayoral administrations, defied efforts by the state to correct fiscal abuses.
Camden's municipal lawyers complained halfheartedly that the state, too, was to blame for the city's ills. But the Local Finance Board, an arm of the Department of Community Affairs, brushed those objections aside. Instead, it voted without dissent to invoke a Depression-era state law that allows the state to assume supervision of cities that demonstrate a high level of mismanagement, including recurring deficits, and that fail to fully collect taxes because of that mismanagement. 
 More than 70 percent of Camden's income is derived from state aid, and its managers have for years been found by state investigators to have failed to keep coherent fiscal records, while engaging in questionable spending.
This spring, Camden's mayor, Milton Milan, was indicted under federal racketeering and corruption laws, becoming the city's third mayor in 20 years to be indicted. The federal action, part of a continuing investigation into mob influences in Camden and Philadelphia, spurred New Jersey officials to take a harder stand on Camden's management style.
On Friday, Judge Francis J. Orlando Jr. of Superior Court ruled that Camden met the standard for state supervision, and today Jane M. Kenny, commissioner of the Community Affairs Department, told the Local Finance Board that it was time to act.
"The court has recognized that the state needs to have a more direct role in the city's operation," she said. "We stand ready to take a proactive approach to managing the city's finances and setting the city on a course of economic recovery."
Al Steinberg, chairman of the Local Finance Board, said state auditors would spend the next few weeks "surveying the landscape" of Camden's fiscal condition, including reviewing staffing levels and personnel qualifications, and determining whether any current fiscal managers need to be replaced or new ones hired. The law gives the state one year to complete its supervision.
East Orange is the only other city now under state supervision, and the state was all but welcomed there by Mayor Robert L. Bowser, a civil engineer who was elected in 1997 in a campaign to reform the city. The mayor said in a recent interview that his city had to get state approval for any spending over $4,500, and that the state moved swiftly to pare the city payrolls.
"They've laid off about 70 people, which saves us $455,000 this year and about $1.7 million next year," Mayor Bowser said.
In contrast to East Orange officials, Camden's leaders have fought Trenton's takeover at each step.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Aided by Auction And a Flight From Equities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were up sharply yesterday, lifted by a successful government note auction and steep losses in the stock market.
The Treasury sold $8 billion of new 10-year notes, an auction that market participants said had results in line with expectations. The notes were awarded at a price to yield 6.475 percent. 
 In when-issued trading leading up to the sale, the notes were being offered at a price to yield 6.48 percent, down from 6.52 the previous day. The actively traded 10-year note was yielding 6.42 percent yesterday, down from 6.52 percent on Tuesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, increased 23/32, to 100 18/32.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was up 26/32, to 101 13/32. The bond's yield fell to 6.15 percent from 6.21 percent.
Kim Rupert, economist at Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm, said "the weakness in equities gave a boost to Treasuries."
With most participants expecting a tightening of half a percentage point next week by the Federal Reserve, Ms. Rupert said the market will quickly turn its speculation to the June and August meetings. A tame Consumer Price Index report next Tuesday could diminish thoughts of a similar increase in June.
Eric Cheung, vice president at the Asset Management Departmant/ Fixed-Income Division of Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Del., said the bond market had incorporated an aggressive Fed move into its rate structure. "Equities have pretty well passed the height of earnings releases and are likely to seek a trading range while waiting for the Fed to hand out its next batch of medicine," Mr. Cheung said. "We will just have to wait to see if it is a single dose or a double shot."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
Price: 100.153
High Yield: 6.475%
Low Yield: 6.400%
Median Yield: 6.450%
Total applied for: $24,010,987

HEADLINE: Horse-Trading (and Pork) on Trade Bill

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
There are 10,000 miles and not much trade between China and the anthracite coal region of eastern Pennsylvania, but for Paul E. Kanjorski, a House Democrat, the two are inseparable.
Mr. Kanjorski said he told President Clinton and House Republican leaders that he would support extending permanent trading rights to China if they would offer "assurances" that his proposed tax breaks to encourage investment in Pennsylvania's distressed coal region will become law before Mr. Clinton leaves office. 
 "It's a very tough vote for me and these issues must come together," Mr. Kanjorski said flatly this week. "It's not a vote I'm just going to throw away."
President Clinton has stressed for months that Congress must grant China permanent trading rights or risk damaging the competitiveness of American companies and relations with the world's most populous country. But not unlike other high-profile trade votes, this one also involves a host of issues that are purely local, like job retraining and development aid.
Administration officials warned early this spring that they could not dole out favors for votes, not at the end of Mr. Clinton's term and with Republicans in control of Congress. Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, who is leading the administration's lobbying effort, said lawmakers must make a straight choice or, as he put it, "walk the plank."
But that has not stopped members of Congress from demanding life preservers. With the administration still short of the 218 votes it needs in the House two weeks before the scheduled vote, at least some of the Democrats and Republicans who remain officially uncommitted want pet projects financed.
The requests may be one reason that 30 lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been coy about how they will vote, a remarkably large number of undecideds given that Congress has had to choose whether to renew China's trade privileges annually for two decades. The administration is now asking Congress to give up that annual review, fulfilling a promise it made to Beijing last year when it negotiated the terms for China's accession to the World Trade Organization.
Several Democrats who represent districts with a heavy trade union presence have been especially demanding. They argue that they need some political cover to vote for a measure that unions steadfastly oppose. The administration, if not yet making firm commitments, is at least listening, they say.
"The industrial unions are vehement about this," said Representative James L. Oberstar, a senior Minnesota Democrat. "They say they'll picket me. I'll take the heat if I can get something done for the people I represent."
Mr. Oberstar says he wants the administration to amend the Trade Act of 1974 so that imports of steel slabs can be treated as a direct threat to the taconite miners of northern Minnesota. With Russian and Brazilian slabs flooding the market, Mr. Oberstar said, American blast furnaces no longer use as much taconite, a low-grade iron-ore, to produce raw steel. Several thousands jobs are threatened, he said.
"Now they have something they really want," he said, referring to the China trade bill. What he is asking now, he said, is that the law be modified "to serve the needs of these people who are hurt."
The requests for aid come as the administration and Republican leaders in Congress are locked in a furious battle with opponents of the China trade measure, including senior Congressional Democrats and politically powerful labor unions.
The House majority whip, Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, warned today that he would have to engage in "traditional hand-to-hand combat" to round up enough Republican votes to pass the measure, dismissing reports that his party already had 150 secure votes. Another Republican leader said that a recent head count of House Republicans found only 120 solid supporters, though administration officials said they still expected at least 20 more Republicans to vote in favor.
The pendulum swung slightly in favor of opponents today when Representatives David D. Phelps of Illinois and Gene Green of Texas, both Democrats, declared they would vote no. The administration says that it needs a minimum of 70 House Democrats to vote in favor and that it remains 10 to 15 votes shy.
Whips on both sides of the aisles have been publicly discouraging their caucuses from using the close vote as a chance to extract benefits for their home districts. Asked about Republican pork barreling today, Mr. DeLay said sharply, "We don't do that."
Represenative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat and his party's chief supporter of the bill in the House, also urged lawmakers to make their decision on the bill's merits. "You can't get cover from labor from a bridge project," he said.
Another of Mr. Clinton major trade priorities, the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Congress approved in 1993, became a political pinata when scores of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle demanded -- and often received -- benefits in exchange for their votes, administration officials acknowledged.
The China trade measure is not Nafta. It does not require that the United States open its markets wider to imported goods, as Nafta did, and the Congressional demands for district-by-district benefits are much less intense this time, many people involved in the lobbying process said.
But the lobbying, if less high profile, is hardly invisible. Commerce Secretary Daley flew to Texas late last week to hear more about Representative Ruben Hinojosa's proposed Cross-Border Institute for Regional Development, a plan to create a Silicon Valley in southeastern Texas.
Mr. Daley and Mr. Hinojosa, a Democrat who has yet to say which way he is voting on China trade, declined to comment on the trip. But a Congressional aide said that Mr. Hinojosa hoped that a public-private partnership could bring high-tech businesses and jobs to the area.

HEADLINE: The Tangled Web in the Murder of a Rabbi's Wife

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: CHERRY HILL, N.J., May 8

 BODY:
For nearly four years, as the innuendo and accusations mounted about Rabbi Fred J. Neulander's role in the slaying of his wife, a burly, talkative man would buttonhole reporters, strenuously proclaim the rabbi's innocence and offer his own theories about who might have beaten Carol Neulander to death in the living room of her suburban Philadelphia home.
Calling himself the rabbi's private investigator, a congregant and a close friend, Leonard Jenoff would alternately tell reporters that the 1994 murder was the work either of a bumbling burglar or an ill-trained terrorist. "Russians or Israelis," he once whispered to a reporter for a local newspaper, The Jewish Exponent. "That's all I can say." 
 Now he is saying a good deal more.
According to the long-winded confession he made to prosecutors last week, Mr. Jenoff was the man Rabbi Neulander recruited to kill his wife. In September 1998, the rabbi was charged with planning his wife's murder.
Mr. Jenoff told prosecutors that after confronting Ms. Neulander in the driveway of her home one evening, he choked on his fear, asked to use the bathroom and then slinked away. Instead, he told them, he paid his roommate, Paul Michael Daniels, to help carry out the killing a week later.
On May 1, shortly after Mr. Jenoff made his confession, he and Mr. Daniels were arrested and charged with murder and conspiracy. Mr. Daniels, who is unemployed and who says he is mentally ill and a longtime drug addict, has told the authorities that he was paid for his role in the crime.
The Camden County prosecutor has said he may seek the death penalty for all three defendants.
Rabbi Neulander, who is free on bail, calls Mr. Jenoff's tale a fabrication. In an interview today, he emphatically proclaimed his innocence. "His story is entirely baseless," he said, sitting in the same room where the murder took place. "I had nothing to do with the death of my wife."
To those who live in the amorphous subdivisions that sprawl east of the Delaware River in Camden County, last week's revelations added yet another layer of intrigue to a sensational crime. Ms. Neulander's murder has fascinated residents and traumatized those who know the 58-year-old rabbi, a charismatic figure who guided South Jersey's largest congregation.
"It just keeps getting more and more surreal," said Pam Rosenblum, a mother of two young daughters who lives across the street from the Neulander home. "We just wish this whole thing would come to an end already."
As detailed by prosecutors, the killing of Carol Neulander, 52, is a convoluted tale of deception that seems to defy common sense. Rabbi Neulander, they say, wanted his wife of 29 years dead so he could continue his affair with another woman, the host of a radio talk show in Philadelphia.
Prosecutors say he feared divorce proceedings would bring out his infidelity and threaten his position as the leader of M'kor Shalom, the synagogue he and his wife had started two decades earlier.
Although Mr. Jenoff says he wielded the first of four blows that killed Ms. Neulander, he claims he, too, is a victim, saying the rabbi took advantage of his weaknesses. The lawyer for Mr. Daniels says the same thing about Mr. Jenoff: that he exploited someone he knew had limited mental capabilities.
The conspiracy, as laid out by investigators, brings together three men seemingly with little in common: Rabbi Neulander, a community leader who was cherished by his congregation; Mr. Jenoff, 54, a recovering alcoholic bruised by a string of personal and professional losses; and Mr. Daniels, 26, a troubled soul who has spent his adult life addicted to cocaine and heroin.
Rabbi Neulander's trial was originally scheduled for next month, although it has now been postponed until the fall. It was the impending trial, Mr. Jenoff said, that prompted his confession. With an absence of hard evidence, Mr. Jenoff said, he feared that the rabbi might be acquitted.
"He just wanted to do the right thing," said his lawyer, Francis J. Hartman. "The truth was just eating away at him."
Last Friday, he summoned a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter, the Camden County prosecutor and a detective to a local diner to hear his story. Over coffee and a cup of fruit salad, he said the rabbi had lured him into the scheme with promises of $30,000 and help in getting a job with the Mossad, Israel's secret service.
Although details of his account have changed twice in the last week, he now says he was initially lured into thinking his target was an enemy of Israel. Only later, after he had agreed to carry out the killing, did the rabbi reveal that the proposed victim was his wife, he said.
Rabbi Neulander and his lawyers say Mr. Jenoff's story is pure fantasy. One lawyer, Dennis P. Wixted, described Mr. Jenoff as "an oddball and eccentric," so desperate for attention he would make up a tall tale for 15 minutes of fame.
He said Mr. Jenoff thought he could have his notoriety and escape prosecution through an immunity deal. So far he has not been offered a reward for his cooperation, although the prosecutor has not ruled out leniency.
Despite the confessions of Mr. Jenoff and Mr. Daniels, Mr. Wixted said there was nothing to link the rabbi to his wife's death, "no weapon, no fingerprints, no evidence," he said. As he had in the past, he described Ms. Neulander, the owner of two bakeries, as the victim of a robbery gone awry.
Those who know Leonard Jenoff said his buoyant personality and relentless self-promotion masked a battered ego. In recent years, they said, he endured a stormy divorce, the collapse of his business, the loss of his home and alcoholism. In a town where most people own spacious colonials surrounded by well-fed lawns, Mr. Jenoff lived in a succession of modest rented apartments.
In 1993, when Mr. Jenoff's life was at its most chaotic, a social service agency referred him to Rabbi Neulander, who provided financial assistance and spiritual guidance, lawyers for both men said.
When Mr. Jenoff complained about having to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings at a church, Rabbi Neulander established a 12-step program at the synagogue. Both men were smokers who would stand outside the synagogue for cigarette breaks.
In 1997, when Mr. Jenoff was married a second time, the rabbi offered his house for the ceremony. "The rabbi did great things for my client, but on the other hand it seems as if he was grooming him for this terrible crime," Mr. Hartman said.
The rabbi and his lawyers play down the relationship, saying it never rose to the level of friendship. "The guy's life was broken down, a mess," Mr. Wixted said. "He came in for spiritual advice. That's how it started, and that's how it remained."
Even if the affections were not mutual, Mr. Jenoff became the rabbi's most vocal defender soon after Ms. Neulander's death. When the rabbi was mobbed by reporters after his arrest in 1998, Mr. Jenoff bravely escorted him through the crowds.
"He may be guilty as sin of adultery," he announced to reporters at the time, "but there's no evidence he hired anybody to kill his wife."
Rabbi Neulander has said he thought Mr. Jenoff's detective services were free, and either way, he never requested them in the first place.
Mr. Wixted has suggested that Mr. Jenoff's decision to go to the authorities may be retribution for not receiving more money for his work. Mr. Wixted described his investigative efforts as farcical.
"He once went to a psychic and came back with a sketch of what he said was the killer," Mr. Wixted said. "I gave him a check for $750 and showed him the door."
The main thing Mr. Jenoff and Mr. Daniels shared, it seems, were their battles with addiction. They met at a substance abuse clinic and later attended 12-step meetings together. In 1995 and 1996, they shared an apartment at the Landmark, a collection of white-brick high-rises in Cherry Hill.
Mr. Daniels is a paranoid schizophrenic who has struggled with cocaine and heroin addiction since he was 16, said his lawyer, Craig Mitnick.
He said Mr. Daniels had few friends and many demons. "He lives the existence of very simple things," he said. "He's very vulnerable and easily manipulated."
Mr. Jenoff has said he paid his roommate $7,500 for his participation in the crime, a sum Mr. Mitnick said he could not confirm.
According to lawyers for both men, Mr. Jenoff posed as a deliveryman on the night of the killing, Nov. 1, 1994. Once inside the home, they said, Mr. Jenoff knocked Ms. Neulander unconscious with a lead pipe. He then called in Mr. Daniels, who hit her twice more. Before the pair fled in his car, Mr. Jenoff delivered a final blow, lawyers for both men said.
Shortly afterward, Rabbi Neulander came home from the synagogue to find his wife dead in a pool of blood. When detectives arrived, they noted that there was no blood on him, something they found unusual. The lack of blood suggested that he had not touched the body to check for a pulse or determine a condition, they said.
Suspicions grew when the woman who was pressuring Rabbi Neulander to leave his wife told investigators about an exchange they had before the killing.
"Trust me, something will happen by the end of the year," she told prosecutors. She also told them that after the murder the rabbi said, "See, I told you to trust me."
In the five and a half years since Ms. Neulander's death, Rabbi Neulander said he has struggled to lead a normal life. Although he was forced to resign his position at M'kor Shalom, he still presides over the occasional funeral and wedding. Most days he works as an educational consultant or spends his time on a book about his experiences in the rabbinate.
Sitting in his living room this afternoon, wearing shorts and loafers, Rabbi Neulander appeared relaxed as he spoke about several topics, from his immigrant parents and the difficulties of maintaining a front lawn to bouts of loneliness, fear and humiliation.
Scattered around the room were religious books, photographs of his three grown children and a harmonica he recently began learning to play.
Many friends and former congregants have abandoned him, he said, but others have rallied to his side, including his children. "They have been terrifically supportive," he said.
He described the last few years as "devastating and isolating," and said he was eager to go to trial.
"I know it will be vile and embarrassing, but when it's all over, I'm sure the truth of my innocence will emerge," he said. "Then the healing can begin."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Microsoft's Response to Plan to Break Up Company

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from documents filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Washington by the Microsoft Corporation in response to last month's proposal by the government to split the company in two:
 
MICROSOFT'S MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF ITS MOTION FOR SUMMARY REJECTION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S BREAKUP
 
PROPOSAL 
 As a matter of law, the Court's Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law do not justify the government's radical request to split Microsoft into two separate companies -- what the government euphemistically refers to as a simple "reorganization." That the government would request such structural relief is particularly inappropriate given the manner in which the case was tried. The Court dramatically accelerated the trial of this action, and consolidated it with the hearing on the government's motion for a preliminary injunction, in part because the final relief requested by the government in its complaint was essentially the same as the relief requested in its preliminary injunction motion. That relief dealt primarily with distribution of Netscape's Web browsing software, the crux of the case the government brought. Now, in stark contrast to the relief sought in its complaint, the government seeks to rip apart the company that until recently had the largest market capitalization in the world -- an extreme remedy not even hinted at in the government's complaint. The law and the facts do not support such a radical step.
1. The evidence at trial did not establish, and the Court did not find, a clear causal link between the conduct held to be anticompetitive and Microsoft's current market position. The government has never contended here or in any other case that Microsoft obtained its market position unlawfully. To the contrary, the government's own economist in 1995, Nobel Laureate Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, acknowledged that Microsoft "achieved its dominant position in its market as a consequence of good fortune and possibly superior product and business acumen." Nor did this Court find that, but for the conduct held to be anticompetitive in this case, Microsoft would have lost its leading position in Intel-compatible PC operating systems -- in fact, the Court expressly disavowed such a finding. Given the absence of a proven causal connection between the conduct found to be anticompetitive and Microsoft's continued leading position in operating systems, the only appropriate remedy is an injunction against continuation of such conduct. The record in this case simply does not support the government's efforts to dismember Microsoft and reshape the software industry in a speculative effort to weaken Microsoft's market position.
2. Courts are not authorized in civil enforcement proceedings to punish antitrust defendants. Instead, relief may extend no farther than is necessary to redress the conduct found to be unlawful. Even the government acknowledges that "the remedy must be reasonably related to the wrong." Enjoining Microsoft from conduct held to be anticompetitive would redress all of the antitrust violations found by the Court. As a result, there is no basis to split Microsoft into separate companies with all the attendant risks, costs and complexities.
3. The extreme remedy proposed by the government is particularly inappropriate given the unsettled legal standards applicable to the government's claims. The conduct that was the cornerstone of the government's case -- Microsoft's inclusion of Web browsing software in Windows -- was not clearly barred by the Sherman Act under existing case law. Although this Court has now concluded that Microsoft's design of Windows violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, the Court acknowledged that the Court of Appeals and a number of other courts have articulated a different standard for "technological tying." Under this more deferential standard, Microsoft's conduct did not violate the Sherman Act. In fact, the Court expressly stated that its conclusion that Microsoft is liable for unlawful tying "is arguably at variance with a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in a closely related case." Under controlling Supreme Court precedent, conduct that could reasonably have been thought permissible at the time it occurred calls for a more lenient remedy under the Sherman Act.
4. The public has reaped substantial benefits from Microsoft's development of Windows and other software products. Many of these benefits would not have been possible but for Microsoft's unified structure, which enables Microsoft to conceive and implement new ideas that span operating systems and applications. There can be no dispute that Microsoft has played a leading role in the personal computer revolution that has helped fuel this country's unprecedented economic growth. As the government's own experts admit, no one can predict with any degree of reliability what effects the government's breakup proposal will have on the two resulting companies, the software industry or the Nation's economy. Indeed, much of the government's submission on remedies is based on sheer speculation. For example, Ernest von Simson states in a three-page declaration without any empirical support that his "personal view" is that "structural separation" of Microsoft into separate companies "would increase competition and innovation" and "would not cause significant inconvenience to large enterprises." Such musings hardly provide a legal justification for ripping Microsoft apart.
5. No court has ever ordered significant structural relief in a contested case where the defendant obtained its leading market position through internal growth rather than through acquiring its rivals. The fact that no court has ordered the breakup of a unitary company like Microsoft demonstrates the extreme nature of the relief requested by the government. Even two of the plaintiffs in this case -- Illinois and Ohio -- agree that the government's breakup proposal is unwarranted.
In the cases of AT&T and Standard Oil, the defendants were a regulated holding company and a trust, respectively, that had separate operating units (often obtained through acquisitions) that could be separated from one another without massive disruption. In contrast, Microsoft does not have free-standing operating units devoted to particular regions or types of products -- it has one headquarters, one set of sales and marketing subsidiaries around the world, one sales and marketing force, one product support organization, one basic research unit, one finance department, etc. In addition, because its business is based on intellectual property, Microsoft's most important assets are its people, who may leave the company in droves if draconian structural relief is imposed. Contrary to the government's blithe suggestion, a breakup of Microsoft would be hopelessly complex and difficult to administer.
For these reasons, which are discussed in more detail below, Microsoft respectfully requests that the Court summarily reject the government's proposal to split Microsoft into two separate companies. By rejecting forthwith the government's improper request for structural relief, the Court will spare itself and the parties the burden of extended proceedings addressing a remedy that cannot be imposed here as a matter of law.
Microsoft also should not be forced to suffer the disruption to its business that will inevitably result from having the threat of a breakup hang over its head like the sword of Damocles while this Court conducts proceedings on remedies. Not only may Microsoft lose irreplaceable employees, but third parties may be unwilling to enter into routine business agreements with Microsoft while its continued corporate existence remains in doubt.
 
PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT
 
4. OEM License Agreements Microsoft is enjoined from:
a. canceling or refusing to grant a License Agreement to any OEM because the OEM ships or promotes non-Microsoft Platform Software or exercises any of the options provided in paragraph 4.b of this Decree, provided that the OEM does not infringe Microsoft's Intellectual Property Rights in exercising those options;

 Microsoft is enjoined from entering into a contract in which Microsoft agrees to promote any product or service of the other party to the contract on the Windows Operating System desktop, in a folder on the Windows Operating System desktop, in the Active Desktop or in the initial boot sequence of the Windows Operating System in exchange for the other party's agreeing to limit the amount of any non-Microsoft Platform Software distributed by that party.
6. ISVs' Access to Technical Information Microsoft is enjoined from:
a. denying any bona fide ISV timely and complete access to such Technical Information as is provided through any software development program that Microsoft makes available to the software development community at large to assist in the creation of applications for Windows Operating Systems, subject to space limitations (in the case of events like design previews and professional developers conferences) and to the ISV's complying with normal and customary terms (such as payment of applicable fees and observance of conditions protecting Microsoft's Intellectual Property Rights); and
b. in the event that Microsoft furnishes Technical Information to an ISV in addition to that referred to in paragraph 6.a, conditioning the release of such Technical Information on the ISV's agreeing not to write Platform Software, or applications for such Platform Software, that compete with any Microsoft software, provided that Microsoft may condition the release of Technical Information to an ISV on the ISV's agreeing not to infringe any of Microsoft's Intellectual Property Rights and agreeing to commercially reasonable measures (including reasonable confidentiality agreements) for protection of such rights.
7. Release of Products for Non-Microsoft Platform Software
 Microsoft is enjoined from conditioning the timely release of a software product that is designed to run on non-Microsoft Platform Software and that is ready for commercial release on an agreement by the vendor of that Platform Software to limit the development, manufacture, distribution or promotion of Platform Software that competes with Platform Software offered by Microsoft.
8. Licensing of Predecessor Operating Systems
 Microsoft shall, when it releases a major Windows Operating System such as Windows 95 or Windows 98, continue for three years to make the predecessor Windows Operating System available for licensing at a royalty no higher than the existing royalty to any OEM that desires such a license.
9. Effective Date
 Microsoft shall begin to comply with the provisions of this Decree within 45 days of its entry, provided that Microsoft may seek a stay of this Decree pending any appeal of this Court's judgment.
10. Monitoring of Compliance To determine or secure compliance with this Decree, duly authorized representatives of the plaintiffs shall, upon written request of the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, on reasonable notice given to Microsoft at its principal office, subject to any lawful privilege, be permitted:
a. access during normal office hours to inspect and copy all books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda and other documents and records in the possession, custody or control of Microsoft (which may have counsel present) relating to any matters contained in this Decree;
b. subject to the reasonable convenience of Microsoft and without restraint or interference from it, to interview officers, employees or agents of Microsoft (who may have counsel present) regarding any matters contained in this Decree; and
c. to require Microsoft to submit written reports, under oath if requested, regarding any matters contained in this Decree.
No information or documents obtained by the means provided in this paragraph shall be divulged by any of the plaintiffs except in the course of legal proceedings to which one or more of the plaintiffs is a party, or for the purpose of securing compliance with this Decree, or as otherwise required by law. Nor shall anything in this paragraph require Microsoft to waive any applicable privilege or immunity, including, without limitation, the attorney-client privilege and work product protection. . . .
11. Costs and Attorneys' Fees Microsoft shall pay the plaintiff states' reasonable costs and attorneys' fees.
12. Term This Decree shall terminate four years from its effective date. Until termination, jurisdiction over this case is retained for the purpose of enabling any of the parties to apply to this Court at any time for such further orders and directions as may be appropriate for the correction, construction or carrying out of this Decree, for the earlier termination of the Decree, or to set aside the Decree and to conduct further proceedings if future developments justify that course in the appropriate enforcement of the Sherman Act.
 
MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT
Microsoft's proposed final judgment fully redresses the conduct found by the Court to be anticompetitive. Unlike the government's requested relief, Microsoft's proposal is based on the evidence received at trial and the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of the Law entered by the Court. As Microsoft explains in its other submissions today, with (i) no proof of a casual link between Microsoft's conduct and its current market position, (ii) Microsoft's reasonable belief that the conduct at the core of the government's case was legal at the time it occurred, and (iii) Microsoft's significant contributions to consumer welfare and this Nation's economy, the remedy imposed here must be focused and not punitive.
1. OEM License Agreements Paragraph 4 of Microsoft's proposal addresses the Court's conclusion that Microsoft improperly induced OEMs to distribute Internet Explorer rather than Netscape Navigator and did not give OEMs sufficient latitude to modify Windows. Paragraphs 4.a and c of the proposal would ensure that Microsoft will not cancel or refuse to grant a Windows license agreement to an OEM because the OEM ships or promotes non-Microsoft platform software and that, before canceling any of the top twenty OEMs' license agreements, Microsoft would give the OEM thirty days' written notice and an opportunity to cure any breach.
Paragraph 4.b would ensure that OEMs are free to include on the Windows desktop as many icons for non-Microsoft platform software as they like, thus permitting OEMs to promote and distribute competing platform software. Under Microsoft's proposal, the icons added by OEMs could be of any shape or size that the OEM wants so long as the OEM's icons do not cover any of the icons supplied by Microsoft.
Paragraph 4.b also directly addresses the Court's concerns about OEMs' ability to modify Windows to promote competing Web browsing software -- a central issue in this case. In particular, this paragraph would ensure that OEMs can (i) offer end users "browser choice" during the initial Windows boot sequence, (ii) remove the Internet Explorer icon from the Windows desktop and Start menu, and (iii) configure non-Microsoft Web browsing software to be the "default browser" on the personal computers they sell. Accordingly, paragraph 4.b fully redresses the Court's finding that Microsoft prevented OEMs from removing the ready means of accessing Internet Explorer and from promoting Netscape Navigator during the initial Windows boot sequence.
Paragraph 4.b also addresses the Court's conclusion that Microsoft violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by tying Internet Explorer to Windows. It does so in a manner consistent with the approach advocated by the government and its experts, namely, removal of the predominant means of access to Internet Explorer rather than removal of the software code in Windows that provides Web browsing functionality. As the Court recognized, the latter approach is unworkable because it would result in the removal of APIs on which third-party software developers rely. By providing OEMs with the ability to remove the Internet Explorer icon, offer "browser choice" during the initial Windows boot sequence and configure non-Microsoft Web browsing software to be the "default browser," Microsoft's proposed remedy affords OEMs complete flexibility to distribute and promote any Web browsing software they choose, while at the same time protecting the integrity of Windows as a stable and consistent platform for software development.
2. Promotion on the Windows Desktop Paragraph 5 of Microsoft's proposal addresses the Court's conclusion that Microsoft improperly induced IAPs to distribute and promote Internet Explorer rather than Netscape Navigator, as well as the Court's concerns about Microsoft's dealings with ICPs. Specifically, paragraph 5 responds to the Court's finding that Microsoft's agreements with ICPs, ISPs and OLSs improperly traded promotion on the Windows desktop for third parties' agreement to limit their distribution of competing Web browsing software-another central issue in this case. This paragraph would prohibit Microsoft from agreeing to promote another party's product or service on the Windows desktop itself or in a folder on the Windows desktop in exchange for that party's agreement to limit in any way its distribution of non-Microsoft platform software.
In addition to these provisions, which address the Court's conclusions with respect to the OEM and IAP channels and tying, Microsoft has included in its proposed final judgment a number of prophylactic provisions that relate to other issues in this case.
1. ISVs' Access to Technical Information Paragraph 6 of Microsoft's proposal would ensure that ISVs have timely access to the APIs needed to write Windows applications. Specifically, paragraph 6.a would ensure that any bona fide ISV has access to all technical information that Microsoft provides to ISVs generally to assist in the creation of Windows applications. And paragraph 6.b would prohibit Microsoft, in the event that it furnishes technical information to an ISV in addition to that referred to in paragraph 6.a, from conditioning the release of such technical information on that ISV's agreement not to write platform software or applications for non-Microsoft platform software. Paragraph 6 therefore addresses the Court's apparent concerns regarding Microsoft's dealings with ISVs, including Microsoft's dealings with Netscape prior to the release of Windows 95.
2. Release of Products for Non-Microsoft Platforms Paragraph 7 of Microsoft's proposal addresses the Court's conclusion that Microsoft's agreements with Apple "diminished the usage of Navigator on the Mac OS." This paragraph would prohibit Microsoft from conditioning the timely release of a software product designed to run on a non-Microsoft platform (such as Mac Office) and ready for commercial release on an agreement by the vendor of the competing platform to limit its development, manufacture, distribution or promotion of non-Microsoft platform software.
3. Licensing of Predecessor Operating Systems Paragraph 8 of Microsoft's proposal would require Microsoft, after the release of a major Windows operating system such as Windows 98 or Windows 2000 Professional, to continue to license the predecessor operating system at a royalty not higher than the existing royalty for three years. This provision therefore would permit OEMs to pre-install such operating systems on their computers if they do not like the features and functionality of Microsoft's new operating systems. Like paragraph 4.b, this paragraph would address the Court's conclusion that Microsoft unlawfully tied Internet Explorer to Windows. . . .
4. Term & Monitoring of Compliance Microsoft's proposed final judgment also includes appropriate provisions regarding the term of the decree and the means by which the government can monitor Microsoft's compliance. First, paragraph 12 of Microsoft's proposal provides that the decree will terminate four years from its effective date. In contrast, under the government's proposal, the decree would remain in force for ten years (assuming the Court rejects the government's breakup proposal). Nothing in the record justifies such a lengthy term for relief in this case. Most of the conduct challenged by the government occurred over a two- or three-year period, and much of that conduct stopped long ago.
Given the lightening pace at which the software industry moves, Microsoft's proposed term of four years is reasonable. No one can predict with reasonable certainty what effect the government's proposed relief would have on Microsoft and the software industry today. Indeed, the government's own experts equivocate, declining make such a prediction. To impose stringent restrictions on Microsoft that would apply for more than four years is unnecessary and would risk impeding technological advancement in ways that cannot now be anticipated.
Microsoft's proposed final judgment also would provide the government with sufficient means to determine and secure compliance with the Court's judgment. . . .
In contrast, the rights of access sought by the government are unreasonably broad and not limited to ensuring compliance with the Court's judgment. Indeed, the government seeks authority to conduct perpetual, essentially unbounded, investigations of Microsoft, without any of the protections to which Microsoft would otherwise be entitled under the law.
 
POSITION AS TO FUTURE PROCEEDINGS ON REMEDY
In its proposed final judgment, the government has asked the Court to break Microsoft up and then actively regulate the two resulting companies, impairing their ability to develop new products for consumers in the highly competitive software industry. As Microsoft explains in its memorandum in support of summary rejection of the government's breakup proposal, such radical relief is unprecedented and wholly inappropriate given the antitrust violations found by the Court -- which relate principally to Microsoft's development and distribution of Web browsing software in competition with Netscape. Should the Court not summarily reject the government's breakup proposal, then substantial discovery, adequate time for preparation and a full trial on relief will be required.
In addition to its attempt to rip apart Microsoft's integrated operations, the government seeks to impose other relief that, although characterized as a "disclosure remedy," would constitute a wholesale confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property -- the company's crown jewels. Microsoft has spent billions of dollars creating operating systems like Windows 2000 and Windows 98, and it is entitled to the fruits of those research and development efforts. It is not a proper purpose of the remedy in this case to enable leading software companies like IBM, AOL/Netscape, Novell, Oracle and Sun Microsystems to appropriate Microsoft's inventions and innovations free of charge.
If the Court intends to consider giving Microsoft's competitors open access to Microsoft's enormously valuable intellectual property -- by requiring Microsoft to disclose the inner workings of its operating systems as well as other proprietary information such as codecs, file formats and protocols -- then substantial time for preparation and a lengthy evidentiary hearing will still be required. There can be no rush to judgment granting such unprecedented relief in light of the importance of the interests at stake, and the government has offered no justification for highly expedited procedures in seeking to impose its requested relief.
The need for deliberate procedures is especially strong because much of the intellectual property the government seeks to confiscate relates to products and technologies, such as Windows 2000, that were not even mentioned at trial. (As the Court is aware, Windows 2000 is the successor product to Windows NT 4.0, not Windows 9x.) There is no evidence in the record to support a de facto taking of these products and technologies, and if the Court intends to consider such draconian relief, Microsoft is entitled to address these new issues fully and deliberately.
Even if the Court rejects both the government's proposed breakup and confiscation of Microsoft's intellectual property, the remaining "conduct" relief requested by the government -- which includes several provisions regulating the design of Microsoft's operating system software -- is severe and unwarranted in the circumstances. . . .

HEADLINE: Corzine Gains After TV Ads Assailing Florio

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 10

 BODY:
On the eve of the first senatorial debate between former Gov. Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine, new polling data suggest that Mr. Corzine's million-dollar-a-week television advertising campaign is having the desired effect, narrowing the race and driving up Mr. Florio's unfavorable ratings.
Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company who is breaking all records for spending in a United States Senate primary, began running television commercials on March 15, the earliest start in memory. For the last two weeks his advertisements, which are becoming familiar interruptions to news programs, talk shows and even sporting events on the New York and Philadelphia stations, have been increasingly critical of Mr. Florio, who cannot afford to run his ads so early. 
 Now, with 26 days left until the June 6 primary, a Quinnipiac College Poll has found that fully 30 percent of registered Democrats view Mr. Florio unfavorably -- exactly twice as many as in the college's last survey, before Mr. Corzine's attack ads began running.
Aides to Mr. Florio acknowledged that there has been a swing away from their candidate since Mr. Corzine's ads began, but they said their own television advertising in the last two weeks of the primary campaign would make up any gap.
The Quinnipiac poll, conducted May 1 through 8, also found that Mr. Corzine had zoomed ahead in the race, from 24 points behind on March 29 to a lead of 15 points, or 48 to 33 percent. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.
But aides to both candidates disputed that finding, noting that Quinnipiac, in Hamden, Conn., surveyed 347 randomly selected people who identified themselves as registered Democrats. It did not, they noted, sift out those Democrats who would be most likely to vote in the primary.
"Florio's base is the most hard-core, activist group of primary voters, a very narrow sliver of the electorate," said one adviser to Mr. Corzine. "So Jim Florio polls best with that group, and less well the broader the sample is."
Still, the Corzine campaign released partial results of its own most recent survey, taken May 3 and 4, showing that the wide lead Mr. Florio once had over his rival, a political newcomer, had dwindled to just 6 percentage points among Democrats considered certain or very likely to vote -- a finding that aides to Mr. Florio said essentially matched their own surveys.
"Let me make spin history by fully acknowledging that our own internal polling shows our opponent to be running stronger than the Quinnipiac Poll indicates -- and in fact, shows Jim Florio ahead, which is what we believe," said Steven Goldstein, a co-manager of Corzine's campaign. "Jon Corzine remains the underdog in this race. But any way you look at it, the momentum is in Jon's direction."
As for the Republican primary, the Quinnipiac poll showed that 46 percent of registered Republicans remained undecided. United States Representative Robert D. Franks had the most support, with 18 percent, but his lead over State Senator William L. Gormley was less than the margin of error.
Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac, defended its polling methodology, saying that the election was too far away to identify likely voters reliably. But even he suggested that the wide lead his survey attributed to Mr. Corzine could evaporate quickly once Mr. Florio began running his own television ads.
"It's not the amount of Corzine ads, it's the fact that they're unanswered," he said. "An ad in response to Corzine's would help Florio a lot. Also a good performance in the debate tomorrow. The Democratic debates are now all the more crucial."
Mr. Corzine and Mr. Florio will appear in Trenton at a debate sponsored by The New York Times and the New Jersey Network, which will broadcast it on Thursday at 9 p.m. More debates are scheduled for next Monday, Tuesday and Thursday on other broadcast outlets.
Mr. McLean also noted that 55 percent of the Democrats surveyed said they still had not heard enough about Mr. Corzine to form an opinion. "This primary is going to be decided based on who's got the deepest loyalty of voters, and who can get voters out on Election Day," he said. "Even though Corzine has the lead, his support is very soft. There are a lot of people who are planning to vote for Corzine who are also saying they haven't heard enough about him. They've come to support him in the last 30 days. Florio's supporters have been with him for 30 years."
Douglas Schoen, Mr. Corzine's pollster, disagreed. "In our polls, Jon's support is just as firm as Jim's support," he said. "We're seeing, when we ask people whether they'll change their minds, as many of Florio's as Corzine's say they might."
But undisputed by Mr. McLean or aides to both candidates was that whatever the change in the dynamics of the Democratic race, it could be traced to Mr. Corzine's ads. His commercials attacking Mr. Florio remind voters of Mr. Florio's 1990 tax increase of $2.8 billion and associate the former governor with the 1989-90 recession that crippled New Jersey's economy and the nation's.
"Jon Corzine has run an extremely negative and nasty campaign," said Jim Lanard, a Florio spokesman. "He has torn down the reputation of Jim Florio, and understandably, some people have switched from supporting the governor to supporting Jon. But the support is so weak that we are very confident the voters will come back to our column."
Mr. Florio has been left to attack Mr. Corzine's record through frequent news conferences. Today, his aides again tried to link Mr. Corzine to two companies doing business with the Sudanese government, which has killed and enslaved thousands of its citizens.
Several major pension funds have already divested their shares of one such company, Talisman Energy, including that of New Jersey's public employees. But when Mr. Corzine was co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, it underwrote a bond issue for Talisman, and it is now promoting a stock offering for another company involved in a Sudanese pipeline.
In a call arranged by Florio aides, Adam Pener, senior analyst at the William J. Casey Institute, said that as a major shareholder in Goldman Sachs, Mr. Corzine should speak out against the firm's role in the stock offering. "Why would any Wall Street company even bring such an offer to market?" he said.

HEADLINE: House Votes to Extend Ban on New Internet Taxes

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
In a Republican bid to woo the high-technology industry and please taxpayers, the House today rushed to the floor and then handily passed a bill to extend the current moratorium on new Internet taxes until 2006.
The moratorium, which is due to expire in October 2001, forbids states to try to find new ways of taxing Internet use, like imposing taxes on monthly access charges for Internet service providers. 
 The legislation passed today, which faces an uncertain future in the Senate, does not directly address the question of sales taxes; it would not stop states from trying to collect taxes for goods sold on the Internet.
By failing to address sales taxes, however, the measure alarmed some traditional retailers, as well as state governments that say they have found it nearly impossible to collect taxes for goods sold online.
"The single largest contributor to our economic prosperity has been the growth of information technology -- the Internet," said Representative John R. Kasich, an Ohio Republican. "Why would we try to tax something, why would we try to abuse something, why would we try to limit something that generates unprecedented growth, wealth, opportunity and unprecedented individual power?"
Critics of the bill say the moratorium, while seemingly benign, ignores the thorny question of how state and local governments can best collect taxes on the billions of dollars of merchandise sold over the Internet each year. These taxes are expected to provide a crucial future source of revenue for states, especially as more consumers buy goods online.
The bill's opponents -- a consortium of retailers, small-business groups and governors -- say that consumers who buy merchandise over the Internet can easily circumvent the sales and "use" taxes that would be collected automatically if the same merchandise were bought at a bricks-and-mortar retail store.
The National Governors' Association is working on the best way to collect electronic sales tax. Estimates have put the loss in sales tax revenue to the states at $8 billion a year by 2004.
Retailers and small businesses have complained that the current system unfairly places at a disadvantage the traditional retailers that do not sell their wares online and must charge sales tax.
"It's easy to imagine how these kinds of losses can affect state and local governments' ability to provide essential services," said Representative William D. Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, citing the concerns of many governors. "They will be compelled to cut back local services or raise income taxes or property taxes."
The bill even drew criticism from a few Republicans. Representative Ernest Istook of Oklahoma circulated a letter stating, "The Internet should not be singled out to be taxed, nor to be freed from tax."
Still, the House voted overwhelmingly, 352 to 75, to pass the bill. A number of Democrats approved the measure after they received assurance that Congress would hold hearings concerning sales taxes and would try to come up with a solution.
The moratorium "has absolutely nothing to do with the sales tax -- we will have the opportunity to have that debate," said Representative Robert Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican.
The House bill faces a murkier future in the Senate. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Commerce Committee, who advocates a permanent tax moratorium, canceled a hearing on the bill last month after Republican senators, some of them former governors, expressed reservations about extending the moratorium.
The legislation also faces opposition from the Clinton administration, which signaled support today for a two-year moratorium. The full House today rejected a two-year extension in a separate vote.
Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has said he will support an extension of the moratorium. But the governor must tread carefully around the issue because Texas, which does not have a state income tax, would stand to lose substantial revenue if sales taxes are not made workable on the Internet.
A spokesman for Al Gore said the vice president supported a two-year extension of the moratorium "at a minimum." If a five-year moratorium is put into place, "it should include flexibility" to adjust federal policies on Internet taxation "to take into account the fast-paced change in the Internet world."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC SCENE;
Government's role in the new economy is not a cheap or easy one. But it is crucial, a la Adam Smith.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick 

 BODY:
COULD we be hearing right? The Treasury Secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, gave a speech in San Francisco yesterday that made some economic sense and did not focus solely on assuaging the financial markets.
Yes, Mr. Summers again pushed the lines that open markets around the world were essential to future growth and that fiscal discipline remained paramount. But he also broached a more sensitive subject: some of those Treasury surpluses should be used to pay down debt, but, as I read him, maybe they should also be used to buttress the so-called new economy. This may prove to be one of the more important economic speeches of the Clinton administration. Better late than never. 
 Behind Mr. Summers's point is that the new economy requires spending on education and research because it is based not on big factories and distribution systems but on ideas and innovation. He is essentially right, in my view. Maybe more right than he realizes or truly wants to concede.
This economy is not any more "new" than the economic transformations of the 1920's, 1950's and 1960's were in their day (and surely no more revolutionary than changes around the last turn of the century). In fact, for all the raves from Washington and Wall Street, economic growth even in the late 1990's was not equal to the fastest growth rates of those eras.
But an unmistakable rise in the rate of economic growth that began in the mid-1990's has just about confirmed that a similar transformation is under way. In my view, this transformation is less potent than those in the past, but potent it will be.
To maximize its potential, however, will require more effort than most Americans and even Mr. Summers generally acknowledge. Every such economic transformation in the past was accompanied by enormous increases in spending on education, transportation, communications and, ultimately, technological research. Much of this was undertaken or subsidized by the government.
Take education. In the 1800's, Americans developed a free, mandatory primary school system. In the early 1900's, high school education spread rapidly. And after World War II, aided by the G.I. Bill of Rights and the expansion of public universities, Americans went to college in droves.
Or take transportation. In the 1800's, first canals and then railroads were built. In the early 1900's, roads followed. And in the 1950's and 1960's, Washington, under the guise of national defense, paid to build the Interstate highway system.
In communications, the telegraph gave the nation its first instantaneous connection and soon helped create a global economy. Then came the telephone, followed by television. Now, it's the Internet. And just as the telegraph reduced inefficient transportation requirements -- after all, a person didn't have to get on a horse to deliver a message anymore -- the Internet may reduce transportation needs as well by, among other things, encouraging more shopping from home.
But every economic transformation has unique characteristics as well. Enter Mr. Summers. He says the new economy requires more innovation. In fact, all such economic transformations were based principally on new ideas and exciting innovation, as Joseph Schumpeter, the economic exponent of creative destruction, so clearly pointed out.
I think Mr. Summers is right that the demand for innovation has increased drastically. This didn't start only a few years ago, however. The innovation economy began in the mid-1970's when Japanese manufacturers, led by Toyota and Honda, learned how to make varied and high-quality cars far more productively than their Detroit counterparts. Suddenly, many more types of cars were on the road, at affordable prices. Standardized markets were replaced by fragmented ones, and the rate of introduction of new products soared, not only for manufactured goods like packaged food and appliances but also for services like airline trips and cable television and financial products like mutual funds. None of this could have happened without the computer.
Thus, new products, marketing ideas, financial strategies, innovative salesmanship and constant change became the keys to competitive success. As Mr. Summers says, a new product rushes in, captures the market and is quickly displaced by a still newer one. This is far from a new model, and Mr. Summers does accept too readily some of the exaggerations of the new-economy enthusiasts. But the pace of new-product introduction is faster.
The implication is that an educated and sophisticated work force and aggressive investment in technological research are now more important than ever before.
How does American society make the most of this? As in the past, it will require government funds. Not for everything, especially in the modern age, which has so many more capable people and developed private institutions than in the past. But it was New York State that first built the canals; the federal government that subsidized the railroads and paved the highways; local government that built the nation's schools; land-grant universities and the military that generated a lot of our technology.
Some will demur. Indeed, private industry built the communications infrastructure in this century and is now building the Internet. But the Pentagon, as every schoolchild apparently now knows, developed the Internet in the first place.
And there is strong economic theory to support a role for government. Let me quote from Adam Smith, no raving liberal:
"The third and last duty of the sovereign or commonwealth is that of erecting and maintaining those public institutions and those public works which, though they may be in the highest degree advantageous to a great society, are, however, of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual or small number of individuals."
Most economists now recognize that some investments of crucial benefit to society as a whole will not be made by business because no single company, or even industry, will reap all the benefits.
The remarkably prescient Adam Smith had it right 225 years ago. The fear is that Mr. Summers will retreat into fiscal discipline. Only if he renews our faith in public investment, however, will he truly be following in Smith's footsteps.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT:THE STRATEGY;
Microsoft, Responding, Offers Stark View of the Future

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The legal protest that Microsoft filed yesterday in reply to the government's plan to break up the company is an essay of grim futurism.
Microsoft calls the government plan a "draconian" and "speculative" proposal that would bring "uncertainty and chaos." Employees, the company says, would leave in droves. Its business would be destroyed, and the industry and consumers would "suffer enormous harm." 
 The apocalyptic passages seem intended to warn Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that splitting up Microsoft would be a dangerous gamble to take with a company that is a pillar of the nation's high-technology economy. Such a step would be particularly risky, Microsoft insists, because it is "legally baseless" -- out of all proportion to the evidence in the antitrust trial and even to Judge Jackson's ruling that Microsoft is a monopoly that illegally used its market power.
The remedy phase of a Federal antitrust trial is far more art than science. The enforcement provisions say simply that the sanctions should "prevent and restrain" the monopolist from violating the law. The court's first task is to restore competition, but the remedies should not entail unacceptable costs.
Economists, lawyers and technical experts can all offer their views. But in the end, the court must make a difficult judgment -- both about what may happen in the future and about the corporate character of Microsoft. What will it take to restrain the monopolist? Slice it up? Shackle it with harsh curbs on its conduct? Mandate more modest conduct remedies?
"The judge has to make an informed hunch about how things are likely to play out," said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Iowa law school. "It's not really some exact science."
Microsoft's filing, in a sense, is the latest salvo in its long-running legal battle with the government to define the scope of the antitrust case. Much of Microsoft's future will hinge on whether the courts eventually lean toward the software maker's narrower definition of the case or the government's broader one.
In Microsoft's view, the case against it is quite limited. The suit, as the company sees it, centers on its product-design decision to fold Internet-browsing software into its Windows operating system, and on some of its contracts with industry partners and rivals. Judge Jackson ruled that Microsoft illegally tied its browser to its monopoly product -- its Windows operating system -- and that some of its contracts were an illegal use of its monopoly muscle.
The company intends to appeal Judge Jackson's ruling against it.
In the government's view, the "browser war" that pitted Microsoft against the Netscape Communications Corporation, an Internet pioneer now part of America Online, is a central portion of the case yet one episode among many. When the suit was filed by the Justice Department and state attorneys general in May 1998, it spoke of Microsoft's tactics against Netscape as part of a "pattern of practices."
Before the case went to trial in October 1998, the government added evidence involving dealings with Intel, Apple, Sun Microsystems and others. Microsoft protested that the new evidence should not be admitted, but Judge Jackson allowed it.
Microsoft, the government asserted, was a repeat offender of the nation's antitrust laws. When the government submitted its proposed remedies two weeks ago, it warned that Microsoft was again on the march. The government said Microsoft was trying to use its monopoly in personal computer desktop operating systems to unfairly gain an advantage in the markets for handheld devices like Palm digital assistants and for big server machines that power computer networks.
"The government's main argument for a breakup," said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor at New York University law school, "is that we can't trust Microsoft -- that it has squeezed out competitors in the past and it will continue to squeeze out competitors."
Microsoft cried foul again yesterday, saying the government's comments on handheld devices and server computers were beyond the scope of the trial. If the court was going to consider a breakup or severe sanctions on its conduct, the company said it would need months to gather new evidence and testimony.
Microsoft offered its limited compromise proposal. But it was a selection of items -- and not the complete list -- that the company had offered in its periodic settlement talks with the Justice Department and the states over the last two years. Microsoft proposed to open its contracts with personal computer makers to give them greater freedom to alter the Windows desktop screen; to limit its use of exclusionary contracts, and to share widely with the computer industry the technical information on Windows.
The Justice Department and the states dismissed the Microsoft offer as less than the company had put on the negotiating table in the past to no avail. "It's a step back from where we were," said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general. "Microsoft is still in denial."
In its filing yesterday, Microsoft warned that consumers and the software industry would suffer if the company was split up and its programmers from various product groups could no longer collaborate freely. The government has proposed breaking Microsoft into two companies -- one with the Windows operating-system business, while the other would get the Office application programs like Word and the Excel spreadsheet software, as well as most other operations including the MSN Internet business.
Microsoft executives describe a series of examples of teamwork across the Office and Windows divide. The Office group first developed the tool bar feature, the bar at the bottom of the Windows desktop with icons for starting different software applications, in 1991. But the company's executives decided that feature should be on all Windows machines. So the group was transferred to the Windows side of the company.
In April 1999, 25 programmers from the Office group were moved over to the Windows 2000 development team, after they came up with technology code-named Darwin. The technology reduced the cost of installing and managing software across networks of desktop PC's in corporations and business.
"That sort of cooperation would be impossible if the government got its way," a senior Microsoft official said. "The result is that the cost to users would be higher."
Some benefits of being an integrated software company, computer experts say, might be lost if Microsoft was split up. But they also note that the company's Windows business has also bought and borrowed freely from non-Microsoft software developers.
From Internet software to data compression to multimedia, the computer experts note, Microsoft has acquired the basic intellectual property from outside the company and then refined and improved it. Each of the two successor companies proposed by the government would certainly have ample resources to continue to acquire new technology, as they would split Microsoft's $21 billion nest egg of cash.
"If Office and Windows were separate companies, it's not obvious that there would be huge efficiency losses," said Scott Winkler, an independent technology consultant in Fairfield, Conn.
Indeed, some analysts say Microsoft may have a difficult time in court explaining the case for the overriding benefits of being an integrated company.
Hal Varian, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said: "Microsoft has always said that it is totally open with non-Microsoft developers and does not discriminate in favor of Office. Yet now it is arguing that the two businesses are highly interactive, and we achieve these efficiency gains by close communication. It's hard for Microsoft to have it both ways."
But analysts also question the government argument -- that a breakup is needed because Microsoft, left unchecked, threatens to use its desktop monopoly to capture the markets for servers and handheld devices. Microsoft, they note, has made some inroads into the server market, but it has been unable to compete effectively against Sun, Oracle and I.B.M., whose industrial-strength software is the preferred choice of large companies.
Similarly, they add, Microsoft has been unable to dent Palm's dominance in handhelds, even though those machines must work smoothly with Windows PC's.
"Microsoft has proven over and over that owning the desktop does not guarantee success in adjacent markets," said Mr. Winkler, the technology consultant. "Palm, Sun and Oracle are crushing Microsoft in other markets."
 
What Happens Next
The proceedings from this point could be simple and short, or long and complex, depending on decisions by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. A government counterresponse to Microsoft's filing is due next Wednesday. Otherwise, the only scheduled event is a hearing on May 24 at which both sides are to present arguments on the remedy question.
But Microsoft has requested months for preparation and witness testimony, while the Justice Department says the remedy stage can be wrapped up in a week after the May 24 hearing. The judge, at the hearing or in a chambers conference, will decide how much time he is willing to devote. Previously, he has said he wants to complete the remedy phase by the end of May.

Chart: "Microsoft's Proposals"
While continuing to assert that it had not violated antitrust law, Microsoft offered a series of steps yesterday that it said would be more appropriate than the government's plan in addressing the court's findings of fact and law. Under the company's counter-proposal, the Justice Department would enforce the following restrictions for four years:
 
Microsoft may not refuse licenses to computer makers who also use competitors' software.
 
Microsoft must provide any independent software vendor with timely access to technical information available to the software community at large for creating Windows programs.
 
Microsoft may not make the release of software for non-Windows systems (like the Macintosh) contingent on limiting non-Microsoft software for those systems.
 
Microsoft may not prohibit its licensees from displaying icons for non-Microsoft software, from favoring a non-Microsoft browser, or from deleting the icon for Microsoft's browser.
 
Microsoft may not sign contracts to promote a product or service in exchange for limits on the other party's use of non-Microsoft software.
 
When it releases successor versions of Windows, Microsoft must continue to make the previous version available to computer makers for three years at no increase in royalties. (pg. C7)

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE OVERVIEW;
MICROSOFT OFFERS ALTERNATIVE PLAN IN ANTITRUST CASE

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
While continuing to reject the antitrust findings against it, the Microsoft Corporation today offered a series of narrow restrictions on its behavior that it said would be more appropriate remedies than breaking up the company.
Microsoft also asked the judge to throw out the government's breakup proposal immediately, arguing that "the laws and the facts do not support such a radical step." 
 Microsoft's counterproposal is a four-year plan largely governing its relations with computer makers and software developers.
In its court filing, Microsoft said that if the government's breakup plan were adopted, its employees might "leave the company in droves."
If that were to happen, Microsoft continued, "the company's entire business would be destroyed." Excerpts, Page C6.
Such passages seemed clearly intended to warn Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that splitting up Microsoft would be a dangerous gamble to take with a pillar of the nation's high-technology economy. News analysis, Page C1.
"We believe there is no basis for the government's unprecedented breakup proposal," said William H. Gates, the company's chairman, "and we are hopeful that the court will dismiss this excessive demand immediately."
The motion for summary rejection was added unexpectedly to the company's formal response to the remedy proposal offered last month by the Justice Department and 17 states. In the motion, Microsoft argued that since the company achieved its monopoly position by legal means, the government had no right "to dismember Microsoft."
After four years of investigation and 19 months of litigation, the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general proposed on April 28 that Microsoft be broken into two companies. One would hold the Windows operating system, the other everything else, including the Office suite of application programs like Word and Excel. Two of the 19 states joining in the suit -- Ohio and Illinois -- advocated steps short of a breakup.
Judge Jackson ruled on April 3 that Microsoft was in wide violation of the nation's antitrust laws. But if he chose to break up the company, it would be one of only a few instances the last hundred years when a major national company was broken apart as a result of an antitrust case -- and the only one resulting from court order rather than a consent decree.
Next Wednesday, the federal and state governments are entitled to reply to today's filing from Microsoft. And then during a remedies hearing on May 24, both the government and Microsoft will offer arguments in support of their proposals.
In a statement today, the Justice Department said that "Microsoft's proposal is ineffective and filled with loopholes." Among the loopholes, the department added, the proposal would not prevent "attempts to divide markets with competitors; retaliation against personal computer manufacturers and software developers that support non-Microsoft technologies; or tying to require PC manufacturers to ship other Microsoft products with Windows."
And Attorney General Tom Miller of Iowa, who leads the states that are joining in the suit, said: "The remedies proposed are inadequate. These measures would not have prevented the serious violations of law found by Judge Jackson, and they are not adequate remedies to assure that the law is not broken in the future."
In the past, Microsoft's leaders repeatedly said there was a "church and state" separation within the company between the Windows group and the others that develop applications programs like Office.
But in today's filing, Microsoft said: "Cross-pollination between engineers working on different products such as Windows and Office has led to numerous innovations."
It added that the company's success and attendant benefits for consumers "would not have been possible but for Microsoft's unified structure, which enables Microsoft to conceive and implement new ideas that span operating systems and applications."
As part of today's filing, Microsoft offered its own proposed remedies, a collection of rules that would modify the company's conduct, while reiterating its conviction to appeal the case, even if its remedy proposal were accepted.
Many of the company's proposals are similar to those in the government plan, though they are more narrowly focused on specific complaints raised in the trial. Along with the breakup plan, the government wants to impose about a dozen rules intended to moderate Microsoft's conduct.
Microsoft's proposed conduct restrictions fall far short of the government's, and the company explained: "Courts are not authorized in civil enforcement proceedings to punish antitrust defendants. Instead, relief must extend no farther than is necessary to redress the conduct found to be unlawful."
Still, the proposal included several significant concessions. Among them, the company would have to take the following steps:
*Agree not to discriminate in the release of technical information about Windows to outside software developers.
*Allow computer manufacturers to make "non-Microsoft Web browsing software the default browser on a new personal computer."
*Agree not to threaten to withhold a license for Windows from a computer maker featuring products by a Microsoft competitor.
*Enter into no exclusive deals that offer other companies favored treatment in Windows in exchange for agreements to feature only Microsoft products.
*Agree not to condition the release of its software intended for non-Microsoft operating systems, like Apple Computer's, on the other company's agreement not to distribute or promote competitors' software.
 The Justice Department complained in its statement that Microsoft's remedies would not "prevent the company from using its monopoly power in the future to engage in the same kind of illegal behavior to crush new innovations." And the department promoted its own plan, saying it would "address the serious violations found by the court" by "stimulating competition and innovation, leading to better products and lower prices for consumers."
Among the government's additional remedy proposals are a requirement that Microsoft, if it adds certain new programs or features to Windows, sell a version of Windows at a discount with that new feature hidden or removed; a requirement that Microsoft publish a uniform price list for Windows; and a ban on design strategies that are intended to compromise or disable other programs that run on Windows.
Microsoft also offered a schedule for remedy hearings, a sliding scale that calls for longer proceedings if the judge chooses to consider the government remedy proposals that Microsoft considers most onerous.
If Judge Jackson chooses to consider the government's plan to break up the company, Microsoft said it would need six months to prepare for an extensive remedies trial that would begin in early December.
Other options -- accepting some parts of the government plan but not others -- would bring delays of weeks or months, under the Microsoft plan.
While attending a convention in New Orleans today, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, said: "Our company will not be broken up. It will not happen."
Judge Jackson has said he wants to complete the remedy phase by the end of this month. But Microsoft lawyers made clear when Judge Jackson proposed his fast-track timetable last month that the company could not agree until it had seen the government plan.
Microsoft cited one government demand as one justification for its proposed delays: a proposal requiring Microsoft to share technical information about Windows with other software companies that is far more sweeping than Microsoft's plan.
"The need for deliberate procedures is especially strong because much of the intellectual property the government seeks to confiscate relates to products and technologies, such as Windows 2000, that were not even mentioned at trial," one of the company's briefs says. "If the company intends to consider such draconian relief, Microsoft is entitled to address these new issues fully and completely."
Mr. Gates said, "The government's proposal would take away Microsoft's property" even though "Microsoft spent millions of dollars to develop these products."
Throughout the Microsoft documents, the company makes the case that it is a national asset, central to the nation's economy, so that disturbing Microsoft would be unfortunate for both the American people and the economy.
"The public has reaped substantial benefits from Microsoft's development of Windows and other software products," the company said. "Indeed it is no exaggeration to say that the entire United States economy has benefited from Microsoft's efforts. Such benefits would be put at risk were this court to order that Microsoft be broken up into separate companies."
 Before the filing, Microsoft's stock fell $1.625, to $66.1875, on the Nasdaq market. In after-hours trading, the shares dipped as low as $65, reaching the company's 52-week low, before rising slightly to $65.50.

Chart: "Microsoft's Arguments"
Asking the judge in the antitrust trial to reject the government's breakup proposal out of hand, Microsoft yesterday made these arguments:
 
Its market position was not illegally obtained.
 
Courts are not authorized to punish antitrust defendants, only to redress violations.
 
Under a standard established by appellate courts, incorporating Microsoft's browser into Windows -- a focus of the government's case -- did not violate antitrust law.
 
Consumers have reaped benefits possible only because Microsoft was a single company.
 
Cases that ended in the breakup of AT&T and Standard Oil were not comparable because those companies became dominant as regulated monopolies or through acquisitions. (pg. C7)

HEADLINE: Russia's New Prime Minister: A Tested Economic Liberal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 10

 BODY:
President Vladimir V. Putin named as prime minister today a chief foreign-debt negotiator and a liberal economics expert. The long predicted move, some experts said, bodes well for efforts to tame Russia's feral style of capitalism.
That view was bolstered by a separate report today that Mr. Putin might abolish the Fuel and Energy Ministry as he reorganizes the cabinet. The immensely powerful agency has often been attacked as a seat of corruption and a brake on capitalist reforms. 
 Since January, when Mr. Putin became acting president, the new prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, has held the post of first deputy prime minister, which was the government's No. 2 position. He frequently stood in for Mr. Putin as the acting president campaigned for the full four-year term that he won in elections in March.
But Mr. Kasyanov, 42, is best known as the pragmatic and savvy negotiator who persuaded private Western creditors in February to agree to a reduction of nearly $32 billion in Russian debt.
The creditors, known as the London Club, agreed after months of talks to accept bonds worth as little as 62.5 cents for every dollar owed. That now seems an exceptionally good deal for Russia, which was -- and is -- reaping an unexpectedly large income from a rebounding economy and high-price oil exports.
Klaus Regling, who negotiated with Mr. Kasyanov as the German Finance Ministry's chief international officer in the 1990's, called him an extremely tough bargainer who won the respect not just of the Germans, but also of the Americans in the Treasury Department, as well.
"When he signed off on something, you knew it was really a done deal," Mr. Regling, now a finance expert in London, said. "There are always all these advisers around. But he didn't need that. You could really do it with just two persons in the room."
The nomination of Mr. Kasyanov, a tall, beefy man with a gravelly voice and a crushing handshake, goes to the lower house of Parliament, the Duma, which plans a vote next Wednesday. The speaker, Gennadi Seleznyov, a Communist, predicted that he would be confirmed easily, even though the Communists have serious questions about the Kremlin's economic bent.
"Most Duma members are not allergic to Kasyanov," Mr. Seleznyov said.
The consensus among experts was that Mr. Kasyanov would continue to have a strong hand in fiscal policy, pushing to streamline tax and regulatory codes.
The chairman of the Budget Committee in Parliament, Aleksandr Zhukov, said in a radio interview the government was preparing "drastic changes to some of the main taxes," including the income and excise taxes and the payroll tax for welfare funds, which could change the landscape of the budget and economy.
Separately, the semiofficial Interfax news service quoted a government source as having said Mr. Putin is considering eliminating several cabinet-level agencies, including the Economics and the Fuel and Energy Ministries. Their duties would be folded into the Finance Ministry and other departments.
The Fuel and Energy Ministry has been marked by liberals as a test of Mr. Putin's willingness to confront entrenched interests.
Although much of the oil industry is in private hands, natural gas remains more or less a government monopoly. And the ministry wields enormous influence -- much of it for the benefit of special interests, critics say -- through its control of pipelines and the pricing of oil products.
In recent weeks, the critics have demanded the ouster of Energy Minister Viktor I. Kalyuzhny, who they say has imposed new production quotas and tariffs that insiders can easily manipulate.
Mr. Kasyanov hedged when asked about a cabinet shake-up. "It is necessary to make some adjustments in the structure of the federal organs of power," he said, adding that those changes "will not be global ones."
Some express doubts -- similar to those expressed about Mr. Putin -- as to whether Mr. Kasyanov is willing to free the economy from the grip of the financial-industrial combines that dominate several industries and their government regulators.
Some racier muckraking newspapers have called Mr. Kasyanov "Misha 2 Percent," contending that as Finance Minister he gave well-connected bankers inside information about the terms for the resale of old Soviet-era debts. Mr. Kasyanov has flatly denied that.
Like Mr. Putin, Mr. Kasyanov is also pegged by Moscow's rumor mill as close to two tycoons, Boris A. Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, who have amassed huge stakes in Russia's oil, metals and media industries.
This year, the two have cornered 70 percent of the aluminum industry with the blessing of the government.
Mr. Berezovsky and Mr. Abramovich raised eyebrows by showing up at invitation-only events that surrounded Mr. Putin's inauguration on Sunday.
One of the best-known liberals of President Boris N. Yeltsin's government, Boris Nemtsov, warned this spring that Mr. Kasyanov's elevation to prime minister would mean a continuation of the robber-baron capitalism that helped ruin the economy. Mr. Kasyanov scoffs at that. "I don't have any concrete ties to any particular financial-industrial group," he said last month. "I maintain contacts with everybody. I meet with Berezovsky very rarely, perhaps once every six months."
In fact, Mr. Kasyanov is credited with supporting a one-third increase in oil-export taxes and a requirement that oil companies pay their taxes in cash rather than through barter, two measures opposed by the so-called oligarchs.
He rose the hard way. A graduate of the Moscow Automobile and Road College, he worked at the old Soviet central planning committee before switching, with the government, to a free-market economic philosophy after the Soviet Union died in 1991.
Mr. Kasyanov spent two years at the Economics Ministry before joining Mr. Yeltsin's Finance Ministry, where he held several posts before becoming finance minister.

HEADLINE: Saline Breast Implants Win U.S. Approval After Studies

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Seven years after it first questioned the safety of saline breast implants, the Food and Drug Administration decided today to permit the two largest makers of implants to continue marketing the devices, despite new scientific evidence that they pose a significant risk of infection, tissue hardening and pain in the breast, as well as repeat surgeries.
The government's approval of implants made by the McGhan Medical Corporation and the Mentor Corporation, both of Santa Barbara, Calif., came after five studies of more than 9,000 women documented what the drug agency described as relatively high rates of complications and rupture. The agency said it would require the companies to inform women of the risks. 
 "Although there is benefit to some women from having breast implants available, there is now a much clearer understanding of the risks involved," said Dr. Jane E. Henney, commissioner of food and drugs, in a statement announcing the agency's decision. "With the data that has been presented, women and their physicians will be able to make informed decisions about whether the benefits are worth the risks."
Saline implants have been sold in this country without Food and Drug Administration approval for more than three decades, long before the passage of a 1976 law that gave the agency authority to regulate medical devices. They have been the only type of implant commercially available since 1992, when the agency took silicone implants off the market amid great controversy about whether they caused autoimmune disorders. (An Institute of Medicine study concluded last year that they did not.)
The saline implants were generally presumed safer than silicone implants, because they leak only salt water, as opposed to silicone gel, when they rupture. But while there has been an abundance of anecdotal evidence that all breast implants can cause hardening of breast tissue and other problems, until now there has been little scientific data about the extent of the risk from saline implants. So in 1993, amid questions about their safety, the drug agency announced it would require the companies to study the implants and apply for government approval.
The studies by McGhan and Mentor made clear that many women who have saline implants will have to undergo additional surgeries because of rupture or other complications. McGhan's primary study involved 901 women who received saline-filled implants for cosmetic reasons, and, like all the studies, looked at the various short-term or "local" complications that have long been known to be associated with breast implants.
After three years, 689 women were still in the study. About one-fifth, or 21 percent, required additional surgeries; 9 percent suffered a hardening of the tissue around the implant (a condition known as capsular contracture); 16 percent experienced breast pain; 8 percent asked for their implants to be removed and 5 percent experienced leakage or deflation of the device. The rates of complications were roughly the same in a study of 1,264 women who received Mentor implants.
But the risks of complications were higher for women who received implants for reconstruction after breast cancer surgery or other medical problems, in part because the lack of an intact breast makes it difficult for doctors to put the implants in. Among 416 women receiving Mentor implants for breast reconstruction, 40 percent needed additional surgeries, 27 percent asked that the implants be removed and 9 percent experienced leakage and deflation. In all the studies, some women experienced more than one complication.
An estimated 150,000 women obtained saline implants last year; McGhan, a subsidiary of the Inamed Corporation, and Mentor, sold the vast majority of the devices. Three smaller implant manufacturers are also seeking agency approval.
Officials at Mentor declined to comment on the agency's action today. But Scott Eschbach, the president and chief executive of McGhan, said he was pleased with the agency's decision, and characterized it as a determination by the government that the implants are "safe and effective." Mr. Eschbach said, "I think they made a wise decision."
But Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a Washington advocacy organization that had petitioned the agency to regulate saline implants, said the studies conducted by McGhan and Mentor hardly prove safety and effectiveness. He strongly criticized the agency's action today.
"One can't think of any other medical device that has been allowed to stay on the market with such a high failure rate," Dr. Wolfe said. "It is yielding to the device companies and guaranteeing harm to women."
Dr. David Feigal, director of the agency's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, defended the decision today, saying women are capable of reviewing the data and making their own choices.
"This is a product that there is a strong consumer interest in," Dr. Feigal said. "If you look at the kinds of problems that we have characterized as complications, they are cosmetic complications. That's not to say that they aren't important or distressing. But now we have the ability for people to actually see what they are getting into, and make the choice in that light."

HEADLINE: China Arms Expert Warns U.S. Shield May Force Buildup

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 10

 BODY:
China's chief arms negotiator said today that the American proposal to build an anti missile defensive shield posed an unacceptable threat to China's security and could force Beijing to significantly expand its own nuclear forces in response.
The Chinese find it hard to believe American claims that the proposed "national missile defense" is intended only to counter threats from small "rogue" states like North Korea, said the official, Sha Zukang, in an interview. But whatever the intention, he said, the systems under discussion would destroy China's ability to deter nuclear attack by neutralizing its relatively small force of nuclear missiles. 
 That would leave China dangerously vulnerable to bullying or attack, said Mr. Sha, the Foreign Ministry's director general for arms control. If that appears likely, he added, "we will not sit on our hands."
Mr. Sha and other Chinese officials have frequently voiced their strong opposition to American missile defense plans, but in the interview today, Mr. Sha, who spoke in English, gave the most detailed public warning yet of China's possible military responses, ranging from producing more nuclear warheads to devising ways to undermine the American missile shield.
"How can we base our own national security on your assurances of good will?" he asked.
Mr. Sha said that a "balance of terror" had kept nuclear peace for decades and remained the only realistic course until such weapons are phased out. The American proposal, he said, would spark a new global arms race and possibly what he called a "nightmare scenario" of weapons proliferation.
Although the feasibility of the shield is not yet proved, President Clinton is under pressure to decide soon whether to embark on a crash program costing tens of billions of dollars to develop and deploy a system of sensors, missiles and futuristic weapons that could destroy a small number of incoming missiles.
The proposal has been vehemently opposed by Russia, which like China fears the system would blunt its power and, like China, wants to avoid a costly arms race. In the debate in Washington so far, the Russian objections have received far greater attention than those from China, in part because deploying the defensive system would violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union.
The Clinton administration has tried to persuade Russia to accept changes in the treaty that would permit a limited missile defense even as the two countries negotiate deeper, money-saving cuts in their huge nuclear arsenals.
American officials have also sought to convince Russian military planners that the system contemplated, while adequate to stop a few missiles from a nation like Iraq or North Korea, could quickly be overwhelmed by Russia's missile forces.
But the Americans cannot make that argument convincingly to China. Since China developed nuclear weapons in the 1960's, it has avoided trying to match American and Soviet arsenals, instead keeping a small number of missiles as a minimal deterrent, able to retaliate in the event of attack. Western experts believe that China has no more than about two dozen land-based missiles, with one warhead each, capable of reaching the continental United States -- compared with thousands of warheads the United States could deliver by land- or sea-based missiles or bombers.
American officials have not said how, in the event the missile defense plan goes ahead, they will deal with Beijing's objections or any major changes in its nuclear forces.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman restated today the American position that national missile defense is not directed against China, but rather against the threat from countries with developing or potential missile programs, like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.
"We've held meetings with the People's Republic of China," said the spokesman, Philip Reeker. "They have expressed their concerns. We will continue our dialogue and efforts to explain the basis for any decision to deploy national missile defense."
Western intelligence agencies say that China is already developing newer, mobile ballistic missiles and improved warheads, but that they do not know whether it already plans a major expansion of forces.
If the American missile defense plan proceeds, Mr. Sha said, "We'll have to do something." The options, he said, include a significant increase in the number of nuclear warheads that China would field, improvements in the accuracy and other traits of warheads, and the development of methods to destroy or frustrate the missile shield.
He said that China and Russia were discussing possible cooperation in developing techniques "to restore strategic stability," including methods "to defeat your system," but he declined to be more specific.
"To defeat your defenses we'll have to spend a lot of money, and we don't want to do this," Mr. Sha said, adding that China's greater priority is economic development. "But otherwise, the United States will feel it can attack anyone at any time, and that isn't tolerable."
China's equally fervent opposition to American and Japanese research on a "theater missile defense" for East Asia, which China fears might be extended to protect Taiwan, which it views as a breakaway province, has received considerable attention among Western military experts.
Less widely understood, Mr. Sha said, is that an advanced missile defense in Asia would also serve as a forward line for the continental defensive shield. Putting long-range radars and other advanced devices in East Asia would give the United States the ability to detect and destroy Russian or Chinese missiles as they were launched, he said.
"So this theater missile defense could be even more dangerous for Russia and China than the national missile defense," he said.
Mr. Sha described American fears of nuclear attack from countries like North Korea and Iraq as "ridiculous." He said China estimates that it will be at least 15 years before North Korea can develop a missile able to reach the United States. He said that North Korea has no nuclear weapons and that strong diplomatic efforts can keep it that way -- and that in any case, North Korea would never launch an attack while it faces the certainty of massive retaliation.
"The U.S. is a huge superpower and you're afraid of little North Korea?" he said. "Is it convincing?" What is more plausible, he said, is that "American strategic thinkers may have China in mind" as they promote the missile defenses.
Mr. Sha noted that even Washington's European allies are against the apparent American effort to insulate itself from nuclear dangers, fearing it could divide the alliance. "Not a single significant country in the world supports this plan," he said.
"We hope you'll give this up," Mr. Sha said. "If not, we'll be ready."

HEADLINE: S. Carolina House Backs Plan to Move Rebel Flag

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., May 10

 BODY:
The battle flag of the Confederacy, which has divided South Carolina from its perch atop its Statehouse since 1962, will come off the dome on July 1, under a tentative compromise reached late tonight by the state House of Representatives.
The bill, which the House passed by a vote of 63 to 56, has already been approved with minor differences by the Senate. It calls for a smaller, square version of the flag to be placed on a flagpole near the front of the Capitol, adjacent to a Confederate soldiers' memorial. House leaders and senators predicted few difficulties in ironing out the differences, and Gov. Jim Hodges has said he will sign the bill. 
 But the bill will by no means end the racial acrimony that had created such pressure for a compromise in the first place. Only 3 of 26 black members of the House voted for the bill, and many denounced it furiously as a plan that would make the flag an even more prominent feature of the state's official landscape. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which since last summer has been conducting an economic boycott of the state to get the flag moved, has said the plan is unacceptable, and has vowed to continue the sanctions.
Once the flag comes off the dome and out of the spotlight, however, it is unclear how effective the boycott will be. The N.A.A.C.P. had originally said the boycott would continue until the flag was lowered from the dome, and its opponents are now accusing it of changing its goals because it was not a participant in the compromise.
Many of the flag's longtime supporters said the move was a historic step forward for the state, which saw its reputation severely tarnished by the flag's presence in such a prominent position.
"This is a defining moment for our state, a giant step forward," said Speaker David H. Wilkins, a Republican, who had pushed hard for a compromise.
"This plan received support across party and racial lines," said Governor Hodges, a Democrat who was clearly relieved that the support for the plan in the House was not entirely white. "I believe South Carolinians will join together and embrace this compromise as an honorable way to resolve this debate once and for all."
He said he could not control what the N.A.A.C.P. did, but highly praised to the three black legislators who supported the bill.
Six of seven black senators had originally supported the bill, and one of their leaders, Senator Darrell Jackson, predicted that their votes would not change once the differences with the House bill were worked out. But Representative J. Todd Rutherford, a black House member who opposed the bill, predicted another debate over the new flag in next year's legislative session, vowing to propose legislation himself to move the flagpole away from the entrance.
"It's a historic occasion, no doubt about that," Mr. Rutherford said, after tonight's vote. "I'm just sorry that something this momentous has to occur without African-Americans being in the compromise."
The bill failed to get much black support precisely because it was designed to win the votes of white Republicans who had previously refused to even consider a vote on moving the flag. On Tuesday, Republicans angered black legislators by voting to make the flag even more prominent, raising it to 30 feet from the 20 feet in the Senate bill, and illuminating it at night. Those changes made it into the final House bill tonight, along with a provision mandating stiff penalties for anyone who vandalizes the flag or the monument. (This morning, officials had to remove spray-painted graffiti from the monument.)
The bill also removes the Confederate flags from the House and Senate chambers, where they have appeared next to the United States and South Carolina flags for decades.
The vote today came after nearly 10 hours of debate that starkly revealed the deep mistrust and animosity between the races in the House. Black leaders had hoped to support a plan that would move the flag from the Confederate memorial, but would also erect flagpoles bearing military banners to honor soldiers who fell in four 20th-century wars. Republican leaders would accept the plan only if it would fly the flag from the dome on Confederate Memorial Day every year, which by coincidence was today.
Hardliners on each side found those aspects unacceptable.
"To fly that flag for a day, even for an hour, even for a minute, is unacceptable to us," said Representative Joseph H. Neal, a black Democrat who said he would have supported the plan if not for the one-day-a-year provision. "It is not a sovereign flag, and it is an insult to people of color."
White Republicans who want to keep the flag on the dome picked apart the plan from the other end of the spectrum, criticizing it for not honoring soldiers in the Revolutionary War, or for being vague on which flags which symbolize certain wars. The majority leader, Richard M. Quinn Jr., a Republican who supported the proposal, said it was hurt when black members compared the Confederate flag to a swastika, and when a protester burned the flag in front of the Capitol shortly after noon.

 BODY:
SUSAN MAC TAVISH BEST, a Webmaster in San Francisco, had a routine for paying her bills. She let them collect in piles, then dealt with them when the spirit moved her.
"I am incredibly unorganized and always pay my bills late," Miss MacTavish Best said. But she knew that she could not indulge her penchant for disorganization and procrastination during a three-month trek to India that began last September. 
 Then she heard a radio advertisement promoting a bill aggregator, a term that is coming into use to describe services that receive customers' bills, display them online for their customers to view and pay them from the customers' bank, savings or investment accounts.
Miss MacTavish Best used the advertised service, Paytrust, while she was away and continues to use it now, receiving an e-mail message when each bill comes in. She can look at any bill online, but she has told the service to pay some of them whether she looks at them or not, provided they are below a figure she has set for each. Other bills she reviews, then pays according to her old routine: when the spirit moves her.
"They send reminders, 'Bill due in three days,' 'Bill due in two days,' 'Bill due today,' " Miss MacTavish Best said. "Then -- I am so lazy -- I figure I'd better take care of it. I hit the link, and it's paid." Despite toying with fate, she said, she has not incurred a late fee since joining.
Bill-paying services are a step toward the day when everyone will receive and pay all their bills electronically. That day once seemed a long way off, when the concept of electronic billing was caught in a kind of economic Catch 22. Companies did not offer it because they did not see customers lining up to sign on. Customers did not sign on because there were no services offered. While online banks and other Web-based services developed to offer bill payments, most just write and mail checks in response to a customer's request that a payment be sent to a particular place. Few actually receive the bills for the customer.
Aggregators are taking the risk to develop the market. Companies like Paytrust (www.paytrust.com), PayMyBills (www.paymybills.com) and CyberBills (www.statusfactory.com) arrange to receive a client's bills, which they scan so clients can see them on the Web. They then organize the bills and pay them as directed. The companies charge users a monthly fee that ranges from $3.95 to $29.95, depending upon the number of bills paid.
Even with the fees, the companies are not yet making money. Handling people's bills is expensive; an army of employees opens envelopes by hand, puts the bills on a scanner and converts them into digital images. The companies are calculating that if they can deliver the customers, more merchants will automate the way they send out bills and collect payments, and the cost to provide the service will come down.
That possibility is enticing enough that online financial service providers like Quicken and portals like AOL say they plan to offer bill aggregation before the end of the summer. Others, like Spectrum EBP, a joint venture of Chase Manhattan, First Union and Wells Fargo, are working to develop a closely related service called bill presentment. In bill aggregation, paper bills are mailed to agencies; in bill presentment, all incoming bills are handled electronically.
Bill services' customers, like Miss MacTavish Best, can pay any bill at any time from anywhere. "I was in Delhi and I couldn't remember my password," Miss MacTavish Best said, "so I sent an e-mail and got an immediate response. I was sitting there in the cafe and we were e-mailing back and forth, having a conversation. There is a 12-hour difference so I was thinking, 'It's like 4 in the morning.' "
Bill-paying services do have their critics. Because the services need access to users' bank accounts, banks have raised privacy concerns. Union Trust once filed suit against an aggregator, Paytrust, to keep it from asking bank clients to share their online identification and passwords.
"If they have an unscrupulous employee, they could execute a trade, move your money, they could wipe you out," said Kellie Scott, senior vice president and director of eChannels, the e-commerce division of Union Trust. The suit was dropped, and now many banks and aggregators are working together to establish safe procedures for sharing information.
As with any new technology service, there are glitches. When a San Francisco public relations firm, pr@paiz.com, failed to put the proper code on a bill a client wanted to pay through PayMyBills, the firm never received the money. "We called over there and the bill was just sitting there," said Damon Paiz, a part-owner of the agency. "They didn't try to call us to say our bill was just sitting there. It was just very unprofessional." Since then, Mr. Paiz said, there have been no problems. A PayMyBills spokesman said the company had added a research team to handle payments for bills with incorrect codes.
The sites are not completely seamless for consumers. There are only about 30 companies -- most of them utilities and phone companies -- that accept electronic payments so to pay any other bill, the user must authorize the aggregator to make the payment at least five days in advance to give it time to go through the mail.
And although banks and bill-paying services are working on ways to share information, few arrangements have been set up. Most people who use an aggregator's services still have to visit their banks' Web sites if they want to check their balances before they approve a payment.
"I can't check my balances real time," said Brad Winney, who banks with Citibank and pays bills through Paytrust. "I have to go to my banking application." Mr. Winney said he was satisfied over all because he estimated that the service was saving him more than $1,000 in late fees each year.
Aggregators and banks say they are trying to make it easier for people to use bill-paying services.
"This is taking off faster than anyone expected," said Ms. Scott, of Union Trust. "I think it will all be pretty seamless by the end of next year."
Signing up with a service is fairly simple and takes about an hour overall. Most require a user to fill out an online form with information like the billing address, the bank account number and a password. Most then send a package in the mail with a form to sign that will allow the aggregator to take money from an account at a bank, savings and loan or brokerage. Most services allow multiple accounts, and payments can be drawn from any of them.
Paytrust has an accelerated sign-up system that lets users download a permission form and fax it back.
In a test, the form was processed and the account activated online in about four hours. Users can determine which bills are to be paid through the site.
Some companies say they have a similar automated system to change the address back if a client wants to go back to receiving bills at home.
Others, like CyberBills' Status Factory, leave it to the customer to alert billers to a change of address.
To save the user keystrokes, sites have compiled lists with the addresses and payment information for many banks and savings and loans, credit card companies and insurance and mortgage companies; those names can be added to a consumer's list with a few mouse clicks.
Paytrust notifies the companies sending bills that they should send them directly to the site. Some sites require users to mail change-of-address notices to billers, using stickers and envelopes included in the sign-up packages, to tell them to send bills to the aggregators.
The sites let users set up rules for paying each bill. For instance, a user can tell the site to pay the phone bill automatically on the 25th of each month if the amount due is less than $100. If it is more, the system will alert the user, who can then manually authorize a payment.
Check writing is not limited to financial companies. People can have checks sent to anyone by typing in the relevant information, just as they would for online banking.
"That lets us be the 100 percent solution for your monthly bills," said Tom Lazaroff, marketing director for PayMyBills.com. "You can pay your gardener, your dry cleaner, or send a check to Aunt Sally in Minnesota."
When a bill arrives, the user gets an e-mail notice. Reminders are sent by e-mail for unpaid bills that nearing their due date. A confirmation is sent by e-mail when a payment has been made.
Check information can be exported from the Web site into financial management programs like Quicken and Microsoft Money, as well as directly to spreadsheets.
The sites also archive payment information. Most said they would keep two years' worth of records on hand. And at the end of each year, the sites offer to sell clients their records on a CD. The CD's have scans of all the bills, a summary of billing categories and in some cases, feature a rudimentary ability to search for specific bills or information. The CD's are usually priced at $15 to $30.
The sites are sometimes a little quirky. The Paytrust site could not find an address for USAA Savings Bank, with USAA capitalized, but it found the name when it was lowercased. Also, the site would not allow two transactions in which the same amount was to go to the same biller on the same day so a user could not make two car payments with separate checks in one day.
The services are popular with technophile "early adopters," but they are still far from ubiquitous.
Paytrust, which says it is the largest of the aggregators, said it had 30,000 active members. PayMyBills and Status Factory declined to cite customer numbers.
Some potential customers may be concerned about security. "I was leery of Paytrust because you have to send to the bank letting Paytrust take out money," Mr. Winney said. To calm those qualms, Paytrust and PayMyBills are both insured by the Travellers Insurance Group Safeweb program, which protects users against unauthorized transactions up to $100,000. Status Factory, the retail Web site of CyberBills, promises to refund twice the amount of any loss to any customer using a 128-bit encrypted Web browser, like recent versions of Netscape's Navigator or Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
If payments are late because of the sites's errors, the companies will pay any late fees and get in touch with creditors. CyberBills' Status Factory will pay up to $1,000 for any bill that is late due to its error.
If nothing else, the sites offer one attractive and unadvertised bonus: they handle those advertisements that are sent along with your bills. "They are shredded," Mr. Lazaroff said, "and you don't have to look at junk mail."
 
What Does It Cost?
Bill-Paying Services Offer Consumers A Variety of Plans
Users like to say that bill aggregation services cost less than the stamps they used to mail out payments each month. That is not quite true -- but it is close. Here is what some services charge:
 
PAYTRUST: www.paytrust.com
Users can get started within hours. The cost is $8.95 a month for 25 transactions, 50 cents for each additional transaction and an optional $14.95 for a year's financial records on a CD.
 
PAYMYBILLS: www.paymybills.com
In addition to paying their bills, users can also analyze their spending habits, a big help when budgeting. PayMyBills charges $8.95 for 25 transactions a month, 50 cents for each additional transaction and $24.95 for a year's financial records on a CD.
 
CYBERBILLS: www.statusfactory.com
CyberBills offers double your money back for an unauthorized transaction, provided you use a secure browser. It offers three levels of service, starting at $3.50 a month for five transactions. The mid-level service costs $8.95 for 30 transactions and 75 cents for each additional transaction. Basic plan users who exceed five transactions are automatically switched to the mid-level service. The premium service is $29.95 a month for unlimited transactions. A year-end CD is $49.50 for the low- and mid-level service, and free with the premium service.

Barkless Puppy In Tree's Place

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel 

 BODY:
Rockefeller Center is famous for the 100-foot Christmas tree it installs every year. Now, over the next few weeks, another large but definitely cuter silhouette will take its place: a 43-foot terrier puppy made of flowers will go up in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in the same spot where the tree stands.
"Puppy," by Jeff Koons, the 1980's art star, was created in 1992 for a temporary exhibition in Arolsen, a small town about 40 minutes by car from Kassel, Germany, where it stood in the center of a courtyard of a Baroque palace. It was shown in Sydney in 1996, and an identical puppy (with different flowers suitable to its climate and location) stands in front of the Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain as part of the permanent collection. 
 "Puppy" has never been seen in New York until now. The installation, -- a three-week process that involves about 100 people, ranging from riggers to planters and engineers, all directed by Mr. Koons -- begins early next week. "Puppy" will be on view through Labor Day.
"We continue to look for ways to enhance the public space at Rockefeller Center," said Jerry Speyer, president of Tishman Speyer Properties, which is co-owner and manager of Rockefeller Center. "It's a great work of art, and I thought it would be wonderful to show it here."
Last year Rockefeller Center presented an outdoor exhibition of Rodin sculptures. It has also had a car show and a flower show. "This is a different kind of flower show," said Mr. Speyer, adding that he expected about three million visitors to view "Puppy."
Putting the sculpture together is no easy task. Rockefeller Center asked the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit group that puts together exhibitions around the city, to organize the project. "Puppy" had to travel by ship and train from Sydney, a journey that took about a month and a half.
The installation is so complex because the work is formed from a series of stainless-steel armatures built to hold more than 25 tons of soil. An internal irrigation system waters more than 70,000 flowering plants, including marigolds, begonias, impatiens, petunias and lobelias from different nurseries on Long Island.
"We think this is one of the great sculptures of our time," said Susan K. Freedman, president of the Public Art Fund. "Rockefeller Center is the perfect backdrop to show it."
 
The Mass MOCA Boom
When the $37 million Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, known simply as Mass MOCA, opened about a year ago on a 13-acre campus in the depressed town of North Adams, in the northwest corner of the state, it was understood that the project would create about 100 new jobs and attract scores of visitors to a blue-collar town that had always been overshadowed by neighboring Williamstown. But a year after its opening, the boom created by the arts center has far exceeded expectations.
"This is certainly an example of how a cultural institution can lead the charge," said Joseph C. Thompson, director of the museum. Besides attracting more than 100,000 visitors, the interdisciplinary art center has created more than 200 jobs, he said.
When Mass MOCA opened, the site, once the home of the Sprague Electric Company, was so large that the institution could develop 20,000 square feet of office space, which it has rented. It has added 15,000 more square feet of office space over the last year. Because its tenants, primarily fast-growing technology companies, are attracting like-minded businesses to the Berkshires, it is renovating an additional 34,000 square feet, all of which has already been leased. Rents have more than doubled.
"Berkshire County has become a hotbed for e-commerce," Mr. Thompson said. "It's known as Silicon Village." One attraction, he said, is that these office spaces were purposely outfitted with what he described as "plug and ready" equipment to attract e-commerce companies. Downtown has benefited from Mass MOCA's presence, too. The business district had a 70 percent vacancy rate before the museum opened; now, the rate is 30 percent, Mr. Thompson said. Developers plan to take some of the land adjacent to the museum and erect more offices and a hotel.
All the tenants on the museum's campus are helping to raise revenues, which are channeled back into the arts complex. That is the difference between Mass MOCA and other cultural institutions that have helped economically depressed areas, like the Guggenheim Bilbao, which has given a boost to the Basque region of Spain, or Dia Center for the Arts in Manhattan, which has contributed to the boom in Chelsea. "The difference is that we benefit directly from our real estate," Mr. Thompson said. "It's our endowment."
 
Tony Smith Estate
Tony Smith died 20 years ago, but his estate still holds a significant body of his work. Smith, best known for his huge black modular sculptures, began to exhibit these works in the mid-1960's, when he was 48. Before that, he was both an architect and a painter.
For years Paula Cooper represented his estate, but it will now be handled by Matthew Marks, the Chelsea dealer, and Lucy Mitchell-Innes, whose gallery, Mitchell-Innes & Nash, is on the Upper East Side.
"Jane Smith felt it was time for a change," said John Silberman, the estate's lawyer, speaking for the artist's widow. Mr. Marks and Ms. Mitchell-Innes also represent the de Kooning estate, which he handles.
"Considering he was not a prolific artist and died relatively young, the estate is surprisingly rich in top-quality work," Mr. Marks said of Smith. He organized a show of the artist's drawings five years ago. "There are lots of wonderful paintings, some dating from the 1930's, and a surprising number of sculptures, too."
Both galleries plan to organize shows over the next two years.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Declined 0.2 Percent Last Month

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Sales at the nation's retailers fell in April for the first time in a year and a half as consumers took a breather after three months in which they spent at the fastest rate in 17 years, government figures showed today.
Retail sales decreased 0.2 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted $266 billion, as gas stations, clothing stores and building material suppliers reported declines in purchases, the Commerce Department said. The drop, the first since August 1998, came after a 0.5 percent increase in March that was stronger than the government had estimated. 
Still, April sales were 9.7 percent higher than those in April 1999, suggesting that consumer spending will continue to power the economy in the months ahead.
Federal Reserve policy makers have expressed concern about the strength of consumer demand and are expected to raise the overnight bank lending rate by half a percentage point when they meet on Tuesday.
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic output in the United States and has fueled an expansion that is now in its 10th year. Spending has been bolstered by a 30-year low in the unemployment rate, by consumer confidence close to record levels and by rising incomes.
A separate Labor Department report today added evidence that jobs are easy to find. The number of workers filing new claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000, to 297,000, last week after rising 22,000 the previous week.
In another report today, the Labor Department said that prices of imported goods fell 1.6 percent in April, the first decline in 10 months, paced by lower oil costs. Prices of imports excluding oil rose 0.1 percent. This is the first of three price reports to be released before the Fed meets, and it suggests that declining oil costs could start to ease inflation concerns.
The April decline in retail sales was a surprise to economists, who had forecast a 0.5 percent increase. Still, the level of sales was close to the $267 billion analysts had expected.

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth of 4.5% Projected in 2000

BYLINE: AFX News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
In its annual review of the nation's economy, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said today that it expected annual growth of 4.5 percent this year -- above the 3.5 percent pace that it said the economy could grow without leading to higher inflation.
A number of indicators have already suggested that price increases are picking up, including higher import prices and labor costs, the organization said. 
 Because of this, it said that the Federal Open Market Committee should raise short-term interest rates by at least 1 percentage point by the end of the summer to avoid sending inflation higher.
"With demand growth remaining well above the enhanced rate of growth potential, some further tightening of monetary policy is needed," the organization said.
It said it expected the Federal funds rate, the benchmark interest rate on overnight loans between banks, to rise to 7 percent from 6 percent by the end of the summer. But the organization noted that it was still uncertain how high interest rates would need to rise to slow the economy, given that gains on investments continue to provide incentives for businesses to borrow.

Report on Retail Slowdown Calms Nerves of Investors

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks rose broadly yesterday after a report of a slowdown in retail sales calmed investors who have been selling stocks amid fears about rising interest rates. Blue chip shares led the advance.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 178.19 points, or 1.7 percent, to 10,545.97. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 114.85 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3,499.58. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 24.76 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,407.81. 
 But volume remained light, leaving market analysts unconvinced of the rally's underlying strength.
"We had a really rough start to the week," said Bob Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at Dain Rauscher Wessels. "So at this point, calling this an oversold bounce is about as bullish as we can get."
Still, the market's gains were sparked by good news on the economic front. Stocks rose after the Commerce Department said retail sales fell 0.2 percent in April. Economists had expected an increase of 0.4 percent.
Analysts were quick to cite bad weather in April that kept many Americans out of the stores. But the decline raised some hopes that the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate increases is succeeding in slowing consumer spending.
The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates again at its meeting on Tuesday. Economists are divided on whether the central bankers will stick to their strategy of raising rates by a quarter-percentage point at a time or whether they will opt for an increase of half a percentage point this time.
The retail sales report alone will not dissuade the Fed from the half-point increase, analysts said.
"It appears that the volatile stock market and higher interest rates have started to slow consumer spending," said Stan Shipley, senior economist at Merrill Lynch. "However, this one-month slowdown should not derail the Fed."
Rate-sensitive stocks rose after the retail sales report was released. J. P. Morgan increased 5, to 127 5/8, and Citigroup rose 2 1/2, to 58 15/16.
Intel, which fell sharply on Wednesday, rebounded, with the strongest gain among all 30 Dow components. Intel soared 9 1/2, to 115 9/16.
Bargain-hunting opportunities lured some investors into the technology sector, which has been battered in recent sessions.

Treasury Prices Mixed
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32, to 101 16/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.14 percent from 6.15 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 10-year note rose 3/32, to 100 22/32. The bond's yield fell to 6.40 percent from 6.42 percent on Wednesday. The two-year note fell 1/32, to 99 7/32, while its yield rose to 6.80 percent from 6.79 percent.

HEADLINE: Union Leader Warns Gore On Support For China Bill

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
The president of the United Steelworkers of America, one of the nation's most powerful trade unions, said today that organized labor's support for Vice President Al Gore could be hurt by his recent lobbying for the China trade deal.
George Becker, the Steelworkers' president, who played a pivotal role in getting the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to endorse the vice president, said he was angry that Mr. Gore was lobbying hard for the China deal after telling labor leaders that his views on trade would differ from President Clinton's. 
 "We are not going to be forgiving on this," Mr. Becker said. "Our members are not."
Mr. Becker declined to say what action, if any, his union might take because of its unhappiness with Mr. Gore's trade stance, but he said the vice president's position might alienate many supporters in his union.
Most labor leaders have not publicly criticized Mr. Gore's support of the deal, which calls for permanently normalizing trade relations with China. Many labor leaders say that while they disagree with the vice president, they agree with him on most other issues and do not want to undercut his chances in November.
Organized labor has made defeating the bill its top legislative priority, arguing that it would be wrong to normalize relations with a country where there are widespread human rights and labor rights violations.
Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said the vice president is sympathetic to the Steelworkers' concerns and plans to continue working with the labor movement on a range of issues that affect working families. "At the same time, he's been very clear about his position on this issue from the day he was endorsed by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last October," Mr. Hattaway said. "He believes the agreement is good for workers and good for the economy."
Mr. Becker made his remarks on a day when President Clinton predicted that the House would approve the China deal. Mr. Clinton told a radio interviewer, "I think we'll get the votes, because I think it's the right thing for the country."
The House is scheduled to vote on the China bill the week of May 22, and the Senate, which lawmakers say will easily approve the measure, is expected to vote next month.
Republican leaders in the House sought yesterday to bolster support for the bill by saying they were likely to back a bipartisan proposal that would set up a commission to monitor human rights in China. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican, and Majority Leader Dick Armey, a Texas Republican, said they were close to a deal that would enable them to support the proposal.
Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, working closely with Representative Doug Bereuter, a Nebraska Republican, proposed such a commission as a way to secure more backing for the trade deal.
Mr. Becker said he believed that the China bill would have a far more difficult chance of gaining House approval if Mr. Gore were not lobbying for it. "This is a pretty close vote, and if he makes the difference in this, and we lose, I think there'll be a hell of a price to pay," Mr. Becker said.
At the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention last October, he said, many labor leaders felt more confident about endorsing Mr. Gore after he promised, if elected, to place more emphasis on worker rights in negotiating trade agreements than President Clinton has.
"I would have expected him under the circumstances to keep out of the way on this," Mr. Becker said. "He's twisting arms. He's putting himself in a position where he's directly opposed to where we're going."
Mr. Becker voiced a concern that many labor leaders have been murmuring for weeks. Many say they are finding it hard to excite union members to vote for and campaign for Mr. Gore when he is battling them on labor's No. 1 legislative issue.
One House Democrat whom Mr. Gore has lobbied, Bob Clement of Tennessee, announced today that he would vote against the China bill. Another Democrat, Juanita Millender-McDonald of California, also announced her opposition. But Representative Ken Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, announced his support for the bill, saying he was encouraged by a White House plan to set up a commission that would study the problems of displaced workers.
Some opponents assert that Mr. Gore is lobbying so hard to show that he is willing to take a stand unpopular with many supporters.
In an interview with Diane Rehm, a Washington-based talk-show host, Mr. Clinton said yesterday that Mr. Gore's stance on China would help the vice president politically.
"Even though some of the strongest elements of the Democratic Party and some of our best friends are on the other side of this fight, it shows he's willing to take an independent stand to do what he believes is right," Mr. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Rental Tower Seeks to Ride Times Square Wave

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
When leasing begins tomorrow for the 921 rental apartments at the 40-story brick-and-glass tower at 42nd Street and the Hudson River, it will be a milestone in the 16-year journey Larry Silverstein has been on since he first envisioned the project in 1984.
Mr. Silverstein, president of Silverstein Properties of Manhattan, is developing the $225 million building -- the first of two towers planned for his River Place development on the full block between 11th and 12th Avenues -- in anticipation of the renewal that he expects to wash over the stretch of 42nd Street west of Eighth Avenue. Mr. Silverstein always anticipated that the redevelopment of Times Square, now awash with millions of square feet of new and proposed office space, would ignite the need for housing nearby. 
 "The site's proximity to the river and to the planned office space three blocks east propelled this development," Mr. Silverstein said. "Little did I know it would take until 1999 to get started." In the intervening years, the developer waited out a rezoning of the site from industrial use, an unsuccessful lawsuit concerning the change, the recession and the political debate over proposals to use the site for expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
The waiting ended last July when the developer, using financing from a consortium of lenders led by the Bank of New York as well as his own equity, started building the first tower, 1 River Place. Because the developer is receiving a 20-year tax abatement from the city under its 421a tax abatement program, 20 percent of the units will be for tenants with maximum annual incomes of $25,545 to $47,770, depending on family size.
The building, where occupancy will start in July, is the first rental project for Mr. Silverstein. Though his company is best known as a commercial developer, it has also either built or converted at least 3,000 co-op or condominium units. The company's office buildings include 7 World Trade Center, with two million square feet of space, and 140 Broadway, with 1.2 million square feet
Mr. Silverstein is stocking 1 River Place with smaller apartments: studio, one- and two-bedroom units with 360 to 1,202 square feet. Because Costas Kondylis, the Manhattan architect, designed the building with multiple angles and ribbon windows, the units have unusual layouts and clear city and river views.
Mr. Silverstein said he also stressed amenities, including valet parking for 200 cars, 40,000 square feet of retail space, a cafe and high-tech wiring. There will also be a 34,000-square-foot fitness center, including a gym, an Olympic-size pool, two outdoor tennis courts, a slightly-smaller-than-regulation indoor basketball court, a 2,500-square-foot special events room and three sun decks.
Monthly rents for the market-rate units will start at $1,650 for studios, $2,100 for one-bedroom units and $3,300 for two bedrooms, said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a rental brokerage firm in Manhattan and the project's leasing agent. Monthly rents for the moderate-income units will be $639 to $822.
While 1 River Place is the largest residential project in the four-block West 42nd Street area -- now a hodgepodge of buildings, including warehouses and parking lots -- it will not be the last. At least four more apartment towers are planned, helping to restart the area's revival.
The proposed projects include a 40-story apartment building with 260 rentals over six theaters at 42nd Street and Dyer Avenue, between Ninth and 10th Avenues, that the Brodsky Organization in partnership with Quinlan & Field Inc., both of Manhattan, expects to start next month. Twenty percent of the units will be for tenants with limited incomes. The project also calls for the development of a new 499-seat Shubert theater and five new or rebuilt smaller theaters.
In 10 months to a year, the Durst Organization together with the Brodsky Organization also plans to build a rental tower, with 200 to 250 mixed-income units, at the northeast corner of Ninth Avenue and 42nd Street. And the second tower at River Place "will probably be residential," Mr. Silverstein, said, adding that construction could start as soon as 2001.
The new buildings will join the New Gotham, a 374-unit mixed-income rental that led the way for the current residential surge when it opened two years ago between 10th and 11th Avenues and 42nd and 43rd Streets. The building was fully leased in seven months, according to the Gotham Organization of Manhattan, the developer.
The far west 40's is still on the edge as a residential area, said Cathe LeBlanc, managing director of the rental division at the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage firm. "And beyond 10th Avenue, which is farther away from the necessary residential services tenants require, such as food stores and restaurants," she added, "new construction must offer units that are priced to draw people there and have amenities within to service them."
Mr. Silverstein is upbeat about the project's prospects. "There is more than enough demand given the influx of professionals to take all the planned apartments," he said, "and we will get our share."

HEADLINE: Denver's Newspapers, Long at War, Now Plan to Publish Jointly

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
After losing $123 million since 1990 in an unsuccessful effort to win the country's fiercest newspaper war, the owners of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver announced yesterday that they intended to combine their business operations with those of The Denver Post, effectively ceding victory to The Post's owner, William Dean Singleton.
The agreement ending the war would leave the Denver area with two newspapers that would compete journalistically but split their profits equally. To gain its 50 percent share, the E. W. Scripps Company, the owner of The News, is paying $60 million to Mr. Singleton's MediaNews Group, the owner of The Post. 
 The proposed joint operating agreement is subject to Justice Department approval, under the terms of a 30-year-old law that allows newspapers to skirt antitrust provisions to maintain two editorial voices in a community. If approved, the Denver arrangement would be the first new joint operating agreement in the country in 11 years.
Kenneth W. Lowe, president and chief operating officer of Scripps, said at a news conference yesterday that the losses, averaging more than $12 million a year, were "not a situation Scripps could sustain." Scripps is a public company with broad interests in newspapers, broadcast television stations and cable television channels like the Food Network. MediaNews is privately held.
The two newspapers together employ more than 3,600 people, with 1,785 at The News and 1,870 at The Post. In a news release , Scripps said, "It is currently anticipated that any need to eliminate positions will be done primarily through attrition."
The announcement, made after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, brought gloom to the newsroom of The News, an upscale tabloid. In recent years, the newspaper has expanded its business coverage and competed fiercely on breaking news like the killing of JonBenet Ramsey, last year's killings at Columbine High School and the sale of a local sports arena. "People are upset," one reporter said.
Each newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for Columbine coverage last year. The Post won in the breaking news category, The News for breaking news photography.
The aggressive editorial competition was matched, or exceeded, by an economic competition that led both newspapers to lower their subscription prices to as little as a penny, cutting circulation revenues by as much as two-thirds.
The low prices, which began almost three years ago, helped pump up the two newspapers' circulations. The latest daily figures -- 446,465 for The News and 413,720 for The Post -- put both in the ranks of the country's top 25 daily newspapers.
But The News could not translate its circulation gains, including a 25 percent increase in the most recent report from the Audit Bureau of Circulations, into profits, Mr. Lowe said yesterday. He said the paper had enjoyed only "a modest increase in advertising." Scripps also, he said, has "not been able to turn circulation gains into operating profits."
William R. Burleigh, Scripps' chief executive, was to travel today to Washington to give the Justice Department a statement declaring The News "in probable danger of financial failure," Mr. Lowe said.
Both The News and The Post would continue their current daily publication schedules. On Saturday, The News's editorial staff would produce a broadsheet newspaper under both nameplates. The Post's newsroom would produce the Sunday newspaper, the best-read newspaper of the week.

HEADLINE: Clinton Asks Congress to Raise the Limit on Visas for Skilled Workers

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Racing to keep up with a booming economy, President Clinton today proposed an increase of more than 85 percent in the number of skilled foreign workers who could be admitted to the United States to fill job openings in high-technology industries.
Mr. Clinton asked Congress to provide 200,000 visas for such workers in each of the next three years. The existing law, adopted in 1998, limits the number of such visas to 107,500 in 2001. After that, under existing law, the ceiling will fall back to 65,000 a year, the level in effect before Congressional action in 1998. 
 In January 1998, the Clinton administration said it did not support an increase in the number of visas. But the president, under pressure from Congress and the computer industry, agreed to support a modest increase six months later. Since then, technology companies say, the demand for computer programmers, engineers and other skilled workers has outstripped the supply and exceeded official expectations.
Many in Congress favor an even bigger increase than the one Mr. Clinton proposed today. Congress therefore appears likely to approve a substantial increase in the number of visas, known as H-1B visas, for high-technology workers.
Robert Cohen, senior vice president of the Information Technology Association of America, an industry group, welcomed the president's proposal.
"It's very encouraging that the White House sees the need to raise the cap," Mr. Cohen said. "The administration understands better now than in 1998 that information technology gives an incredible push to the overall economy. But the number of visas proposed by the administration is probably not adequate. We would be pleased to see the cap eliminated, so the marketplace could decide how many people are needed to get the job done."
Nations in Europe and Asia are competing for the same pool of high-technology workers. And Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, said some American companies would "move their operations overseas, taking American jobs with them," if they could not get the workers they needed here.
India provides by far the largest number of skilled foreign workers under the H-1B visa program. Its citizens received 47 percent of such visas issued in the last year. The next largest share went to China, with 9 percent.
Gene Sperling, the president's economic policy adviser, set forth Mr. Clinton's proposal in a letter to Congress.
The best way to increase the supply of skilled workers is to improve the education and training of United States citizens and other people already in the country, Mr. Sperling said.
"However," he said, "at times, U.S. businesses need additional access to the international labor market to maintain and enhance our global competitiveness, particularly in high-growth new technology industries and particularly in tight labor markets."
Mr. Sperling said the previous increase in the number of H-1B visas had proved inadequate because "our economy has grown beyond anyone's most optimistic predictions."
Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who heads the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, was skeptical, saying, "There is still no objective, credible study that documents a shortage of American high-tech workers."
Michael W. Gildea, a policy analyst in the professional employee division of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: "We would have preferred no increase in the number of visas. We see no credible evidence of widespread shortages of information technology workers."
Mr. Sperling said technology companies appeared to have difficulty finding workers with the necessary skills. But he added, "The lack of clear data suggests that it's best to offer a temporary solution, and to make that solution contingent on an increase in spending for the education and training of American workers."
Mr. Clinton proposed a sharp increase in the fees charged to employers who use the foreign worker program. He said the fee for an H-1B visa, now $500, should be raised to $2,000 for most employers, with a visa fee of $3,000 for companies that depend heavily on skilled foreign workers.
The president said he would use the fees to help pay for the training of American workers, especially those who are underrepresented in the information technology industry, like women, blacks and Hispanics.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Computer Model on Auto Pollution Is Flawed, Study Says

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency's computer model for predicting how much air pollution comes from cars and trucks underestimates emissions and may overestimate the benefits of some pollution-control strategies, the National Academy of Sciences said in a report today.
The report did not say how far off the model is, but it said the model "substantially" underestimates emissions of unburned fuel from cars and nitrogen oxides from trucks, both major ingredients of smog. And the model may overestimate the value of dashboard lights to warn of pollution control problems and of the value of ethanol and gasoline additives intended to reduce emissions, the study said. 
 "The decisions that rely on the results of this model are of tremendous importance to human health, the environment and the economy," the report said in explaining the value of accurate computer predictions.
One member of the committee that wrote the report, Dr. Laurence S. Caretto, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at California State University at Northridge, said the investigators questioned whether the Environmental Protection Agency was "looking at the right things" in creating a model. A more accurate model would indicate which pollution-control strategies to pursue, he said.
The agency developed the program, the Mobile Source Emissions Factor Model, known as Mobile, in 1978 and has revised it intermittently since then. The study said it was "the central tool used by environmental and transportation agencies to estimate on-road mobile-emissions and to assess national, state and local air-quality programs for controlling such emissions."
A spokesman for the agency, David Cohen, said the study was "constructive, fair and balanced," and made good recommendations. Agency officials noted that they were sometimes accused of setting emissions rules that were too stringent, but that the study seemed to say they might be too lax.
The committee said the environmental agency was in the dark on some crucial issues, like the reaction of drivers to what is colloquially known as the "idiot light," the federally required warning light on the dashboard that illuminates when a car's computer senses a problem.
"The committee is unaware of any studies conducted to assess the motorist response to illuminated malfunction indicator lights, although this response rate is one of the most important factors for determining the effectiveness of on-board diagnostic systems in reducing emissions," the report said.
The agency, the report said, also needs to know more about "high-emitting vehicles" -- cars and trucks with smoking tailpipes -- that are believed to be the source of a large portion of pollution.
Pollution regulators should also pay more attention to off-road sources of emissions, the report said.

Ford Acknowledges Risks Of Sport Utility Vehicles
Ford Motor, which depends on sport utility vehicles for much of its profits, acknowledged that they cause serious safety and environmental problems. Ford said that the vehicles contributed more than cars to global warming, emitted more smog-causing pollution and endangered other motorists.
Ford said that it would keep building them because they are so profitable but would seek technological solutions and look for alternatives to the big vehicles. William C. Ford Jr., the company's chairman, depicted the company's statements as a combination of altruism and long-term business planning. Page A1.

The agreement, which would end the nation's fiercest newspaper war, would leave the Denver area with two newspapers that would compete journalistically but split their profits. A21.
 
Stocks Climb, With Nasdaq Up 3.4%
Stocks climbed after a report of a slowdown in retail sales calmed investors who have been selling stocks amid fears about rising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 178.19 points, or 1.7 percent, to 10,545.97. The Nasdaq composite index jumped 114.85 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3,499.58, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 24.76 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,407.81. C8.
 
Profit Rises 21% at Dell Computer
Dell Computer posted a 21 percent increase in first-quarter profit, beating Wall Street expectations, as it benefited from a richer mix of products, with particular strength in sales of servers and storage devices for Internet use. Before Dell reported its results, its shares closed down 25 cents, to $44.6875. After hours, Dell rose as high as $47.625. C6.
 
In Spain, Olive-Fueled Electricity
In Spain, olives are being transmuted into a fuel. For the last three years, farmers around one olive-growing hamlet have delivered the residue of olive oil production to a specially designed power station, where it is burned to produce electricity, thus reducing Spain's reliance on imported oil.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Parallel Universe

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
When the Industrial Revolution came along it shaped the contours of several U.S. elections. Although our current election comes at the dawn of the information and biotech revolutions, you'd never quite know it from the presidential campaign, which has been almost a parallel universe, operating on its own news and historical logic. It has been characterized either by the arcane -- the Confederate flag and Bob Jones -- or by the evergreens -- Social Security, campaign finance reform, abortion and gun control. There is a general sense that not much is at stake in this election, and that we have entered an era of good feelings and tiny differences.
This is an illusion. My gut tells me that by 2008 we will look back at the Clinton years as a fool's paradise -- the quiet interlude after the cold war and before all the forces unleashed by e-commerce, the biotech revolution, the information revolution and global integration reached their critical mass and ushered in a period of radically new political choices and issues in U.S. and global politics. 
 Look at the headlines on the eve of this 2000 election: The "love bug" virus, launched by a student in the Philippines, wipes out in a few hours millions of dollars' worth of files on 10 million computers all over the world.
The next day we read that the Internet is giving way to the Evernet, meaning that anything with electricity is having chips embedded in it -- from pagers to toasters to cars -- and connected to networks. The new Mercedes 500 has more computing power in it than the 747-200. Not only will this mean that you will always be able to surf the Web everywhere, but it is also going to mean that the Web will be able to surf you, and know where you are, and what you are consuming, everywhere all the time. And the faster and more diffused networks become, the more vulnerable we all are, not to Big Brother but to the Little Brothers -- the Web site, the video store, the hacker, the credit card company that can amass and sell your personal data with little government restraint. This is going to raise huge privacy issues.
And if, as The Times reported Wednesday, "Freenet" technology really comes about it will be possible to acquire or exchange any kind of digitized music, book, video, software or data over the Internet, without paying any royalty to any publisher, filmmaker or anyone. It could mean the end of copyright.
The next day we read that we are soon going to have a single, global 24-hour stock market. Regulated by whom? And the next day we find that the 10-year project to decode the human genome, the operating manual for how human beings are constructed, is about to be completed, giving us the ability not only to cure disease in a new way but also to design offspring and change human nature.
"The biotech revolution raises big moral issues that scream out for international governance and a common agreement on rules," notes Francis Fukuyama, author of "The End of History." We don't want to just leave this to the market and have people designing babies in the Cayman Islands, he adds, but there is no global means to regulate this yet.
Indeed, what all these issues have in common is that we will all be affected by these radical changes, and they can really only be regulated through global institutions, but none exist today. We are all increasingly connected, but nobody's quite in charge. And when everyone is more tightly connected, but not everyone is more tightly governed, small units can wreak large havoc -- the love bug. Which is why this new era is going to actually demand more global governance, not less. But how and in what form?
These issues have not quite ripened into hard political choices yet, so one can't fault the candidates for not discussing them frontally. But as society is reshaped by these forces, and the future becomes the present, this era of small differences will burst right open.
Maybe we could have three debates this season. One would be called "Mudslinging," during which both candidates could unleash any lie, exaggeration or personal attack against the other. The next could be called "Golden Oldies," which would focus on the still relevant evergreens, from Social Security to abortion. And lastly, we could have the "Tomorrowland" debate, in which each candidate would have to present his thoughts on the new issues that will actually be shaping his presidency before it's over.

HEADLINE: South Carolina Acts on Goals, but N.A.A.C.P. Isn't Happy

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., May 11

 BODY:
In the space of a remarkable month, South Carolina has made three momentous strides in its race relations, voting to remove one symbol profoundly offensive to black residents and creating two new ones to honor the achievements of black Americans. But without exception, those actions have been opposed by the state chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., which objected to the method necessary to achieve them.
It was the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People that first engendered national criticism of the Confederate battle flag that flies on top of the State Capitol, which the General Assembly has now agreed to remove. 
 But the association's refusal to accept the compromise has brought criticism from the black and white moderates who have always been the core of the N.A.A.C.P's national support and raises questions about the continuing effectiveness of its economic boycott of South Carolina, which was originally intended to get the flag off the dome.
Just after 10 p.m. on Wednesday, the House joined the Senate in voting to remove the flag from the dome and the legislative chambers, a goal that black leaders had sought for decades. But to remove the flag, lawmakers had to agree to the demands of white supporters of the flag that a smaller Confederate battle flag fly on a 30-foot pole in front of the Statehouse, near a monument to soldiers of the Confederacy.
Last month, after years of refusal, the state enacted an official holiday to observe the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., becoming the last state to do so. But to get the votes of reluctant white legislators, the General Assembly at the same time created a state holiday on Confederate Memorial Day.
And this morning, a large group of state leaders broke ground for a monument celebrating African-American history on a Capitol greensward strewn with memorials to Confederate heroes, a few feet from a Statehouse built of granite quarried by slaves. But no officials of the N.A.A.C.P. were present for the event, and several black legislators, annoyed by the group's absence, said it was because a staunch flag supporter, State Senator Glenn F. McConnell, Republican of Charleston, had been a leader in getting the monument approved.
The group's leaders later said that was not the reason for their absence, but they did not explain why they were not there.
Although the flag is now scheduled to come down on July 1 -- assuming the Senate and the House iron out minor differences in their bills -- James Gallman, president of the state N.A.A.C.P. conference, said today that the economic sanctions against the state would continue. The group's executive board will meet soon to discuss the extent of the sanctions, Mr. Gallman said, but he predicted that some form of boycott would remain.
"We had some satisfaction that the flag will be coming off the dome, and, of course, we do take credit for that partial victory that we have won," he said in an interview today. "But there is still a missing piece, because the flag will still be in a position of sovereignty on the grounds. It's going to be so prominent that I've even had some people tell me it would have been better to leave it up."
The group's absolutist position -- joined by 23 of 26 black House members who voted against the flag compromise on Wednesday night -- has exasperated white moderates and many other black officials, particularly the six black senators who helped broker the compromise.
Walter Edgar, director of the Institute for Southern Studies at the University of South Carolina, who was at today's groundbreaking, suggested that the boycott might begin to lose steam once the flag came down and it was no longer featured on newscasts showing the Capitol dome.
"Yes, it will still be on a flagpole, but taking it off the dome is what's significant," Dr. Edgar said. "Once the flag is down, I think the criticism will have less impact."
That clearly is the hope of Gov. Jim Hodges and the state's business leaders, who are now hoping to convince tourists and conventions that have canceled their bookings in the state that it is now acceptable to return.
Opponents of the flag compromise have known that this moment was coming, of course, but they say the risk of now being marginalized is less important than the principle of standing up for what is right.
"We don't believe in finding the easiest way out of a problem, the quickest compromise," said Lonnie Randolph, president of the Columbia branch of the N.A.A.C.P. "There's always an attempt to do that when dealing with black-and-white issues, but that's not what the N.A.A.C.P. is about. We are going to stand on principle, even if that makes things more difficult."

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Finds Malathion Poses Low Risk

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
A new federal review of the health effects of malathion, the insecticide sprayed around New York City last year to kill disease-carrying mosquitoes, has found "suggestive evidence" that high doses of the chemical may cause cancer in laboratory animals, but no evidence that it poses a threat to people when used properly.
The Environmental Protection Agency, in more than 1,000 pages of preliminary analysis of malathion issued yesterday and posted on its Web site, found no evidence that would indicate a need for tighter restrictions on the chemical, which is widely used in agriculture, consumer backyard products and mosquito control. 
 In particular, the agency concluded that when malathion is sprayed in the very low concentrations that are used to kill mosquitoes, there is no health threat to people. The agency did conclude that an independent scientific advisory panel should take a closer look at studies in laboratory mice and rats hinting that malathion might cause some kinds of tumors when consumed in high doses, but the report also noted that malathion is rarely encountered in concentrations beyond a trace.
In some city neighborhoods, the spraying operation last year caused more public concern than the West Nile virus, the disease it was aimed at eliminating. The virus, which is transmitted by some mosquitoes, can in rare instances cause deadly encephalitis, a swelling of the brain.
Last year, seven people died of West Nile encephalitis in and around the city, and 60 others developed serious infections. There was no documented rise in health problems from the spraying, city health officials said.
"No pesticide is 100 percent safe, and they have to be used in accordance with labeled directions," said Stephen L. Johnson, a deputy assistant E.P.A. administrator who is in charge of the agency's pesticide program.
"But," Mr. Johnson added, "we have concluded that we don't have any level of concern with regard to food or drinking water or the use of malathion in a program to control mosquitoes, boll weevils or medflies."
Yesterday, private environmental groups, the pesticide industry and city and federal officials had widely varying reactions to the E.P.A. report. Some said that the newly identified potential cancer risk was a reason for heightened concern, while others said the report gave the chemical a clean bill of health, as long as it is used correctly.
Laura Haight, a pesticide expert at the New York Public Research Interest Group, a private consumer and environmental group in Albany, said it was important for the agency and the public to keep in mind that cancer is only one factor to watch for with chemicals such as malathion.
"All this focus on the cancer causing potential of these pesticides is missing other harmful effects," she said. "Malathion is a nerve toxin and can cause acute reactions. There are non-cancer health hazards that are still very serious."
But agency officials said the review took into account every possible health impact of the chemical.
Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said, "We're reassured by the findings of federal scientists that malathion used in mosquito control is of negligible health concern."
But he said that until the review becomes final sometime late this year, the city planned to avoid using malathion for mosquito control and would only use other sprays as a last resort, if the West Nile virus emerges again in force.
The E.P.A. is accepting public comments on its findings for 60 days, then will issue a revised report and take public comments once again before publishing its final conclusions, Mr. Johnson said.
Malathion is one of 43 organophosphate pesticides approved for use in the United States. These chemicals, related to nerve gas, kill insects by disrupting the action of their nerve cells. Some, including malathion, have been known to cause neurological problems in people in high doses.
In the report, the agency did find a few instances in which people might be exposed to levels that pose some health risks: for instance, if a toddler plays in a backyard sprayed recently by a homeowner, or when adults pick fruits in gardens or farms where malathion was recently applied.
"You shouldn't stand out and be sprayed, you should make sure your children and pets are indoors and toys removed," Mr. Johnson said. But, he added, for cancer particularly, no evidence of a threat to people was found, even if they are exposed.
The new appraisal of malathion was initiated by the E.P.A. as part of an ongoing reassessment of all the 20,000 pesticides in use. The reassessment was called for under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act.
Under the law, the agency must judge the merits of a chemical solely by measuring its impacts on health and the environment, and must determine all the potential routes by which someone could be exposed -- through diet, work and exposure in air or water. This is a much stricter standard than the agency's previous approach, which had also taken into account a chemical's economic benefits, agency officials said.
Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota, reacting to the findings, said that the study rebuffed critics of the city's spraying operation last year.
"This is a much lower risk assessment than you'll find on your common can of bug spray that you find under your kitchen sink," Mr. Lhota said yesterday.
But Representative Gary L. Ackerman of Queens said that the indications of a cancer link -- though confined to laboratory tests -- showed that the chemical was not as benign as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani portrayed it to be last year.
"In so many press conferences, they said it was perfectly safe," Mr. Ackerman said.

HEADLINE: COMPANIES TO CUT COST OF AIDS DRUGS FOR POOR NATIONS

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 11

 BODY:
Five pharmaceutical companies offered today to negotiate steep cuts in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and other poor regions afflicted by the disease.
The announcement of negotiations, to be held with the World Health Organization and other international aid groups, was made in Geneva. It followed mounting pressure on the companies -- including a personal appeal from the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, at a special session on AIDS in December -- to make their therapies more accessible in Africa, Asia and other regions devastated by the epidemic. 
 Dr. Peter Piot, the executive director of Unaids, a joint United Nations agency, said, "This is a promising step in a long-term process." He added, "Lowering the price of medicines, however, is only one critical factor in what must become a much broader and more urgent effort."
In many parts of Africa, government health budgets can be as little as $10 a person a year, and treatment programs are hard to carry out, even among people who acknowledge having the disease.
Some 50 million poor people in developing nations are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The participants in today's accord emphasized that they were at the beginning of a process and did not predict how many people might be helped soon.
Though only one company, Glaxo Wellcome, spoke of any specific prices, the companies were expected to agree to cuts of 80 percent and more below their American prices. Drug treatments used in the United States, most commonly the triple-therapy "cocktails" that suppress the replication of H.I.V., can cost up to $15,000 a year.
Dr. Rolf Krebs, vice chairman of one of the five companies, Boehringer Ingelheim, which is based in Germany, said, "This is the first time that both the public and private sector are joining forces to implement a major change in the care of H.I.V./AIDS in the developing world."
Besides Boehringer, the other companies in today's agreement are Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Company, both of the United States; Glaxo Wellcome of Britain, and Hoffmann-La Roche of Switzerland.
Ben Plumley, an official of Glaxo Wellcome, said the company would sell its Combivir, a blend of AZT and 3TC that sells at a global average price of $16, for $2 in poor countries.
The announcement of the agreements, first reported in The Wall Street Journal, followed several weeks of negotiations. Officials said the companies negotiated separately to avoid falling afoul of American price-fixing laws.
The five companies will work with five international agencies, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, Unaids, the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Population Fund.
At world trade conferences like the one in Seattle in December that attracted many protesters, drug companies have been portrayed as racking up record profits by concentrating on drugs to cure relatively minor problems like obesity, baldness and impotence among rich Americans, Western Europeans and Japanese, who make up 80 percent of the world drug market, while ignoring dire suffering in places like Africa, which buys 1 percent of the world's drugs.
Gro Harlem Brundtland, the director general of the World Health Organization, said in an interview today that big pharmaceutical companies had "analyzed their roles more broadly recently."
"The reality of poverty and the affordability of medical technology has led companies to think about their policies and postures," she said.
But officials in Geneva and elsewhere cautioned that cheaper drugs would not provide a quick fix for the epidemic.
They stressed that controlling AIDS also required a developed health-care system, which many third world countries lack, and that even slashed prices might be too high for many patients. They also said they feared that the cheap drugs could find their way into black markets in richer countries.
By some estimates, sub-Saharan Africa has 80 percent of the world population of people infected by H.I.V., though few of those people have ever had an AIDS test.
In much of Africa, the disease is treated as a badge of shame. And the anti-retrovirals, protease inhibitors and other drugs involved are toxic and difficult to monitor even in patients in Manhattan.
In many poor countries, distributing the drugs, teaching people to take them and monitoring levels of virus, T-cells and drug residues in the blood amount to a mammoth task.
"To be realistic, this is not going to fix the problem, but I'm cautiously optimistic," said Dr. Piot, of Unaids. While the agencies involved in today's accord emphasized the hope of lower prices, the drug companies focused on joint principles for tackling the epidemic. These include stronger government efforts, better drug-distribution systems and more financing from donors, all matters outside the corporate world. Who would pay to create such standards remains unclear.
Most of the drugs scheduled to come under discussion are those used to control replication of H.I.V. But the poor also need other medicines, like strong antibiotic and anti-fungal drugs for the infections that arise with AIDS.
Cutting prices is in some ways a risky concession by the companies. Soaring prescription prices in the United States have led some lawmakers to call for European-style price controls. If the drug companies in effect admit that they can sell a drug at an 80 percent discount, they risk Congressional pressure to lower Medicare prices. But over time, the industry argues, skimpy prices would strangle their immense research budgets, and the flow of valuable new drugs would stop.
Some AIDS activists argue that the companies are lowering prices simply to forestall the seizure of their patents by third world nations desperate for the drugs. Thailand and South Africa have recently passed laws allowing such seizure; India, Bangladesh and Brazil have drug industries that ignore patent treaties.
On Wednesday, the Clinton administration angered the industry by issuing an executive order saying the government would not interfere with African countries that violate American patent law to obtain cheaper AIDS drugs.
The companies denied that they had asked for any quid pro quo, like demanding that countries pass tough patent laws or that the United Nations agencies endorse them. "No, we're not asking for a ban on parallel imports or compulsory licensing," said Jacqueline Wallace, a Roche press spokeswoman. "That would be illegal."
The fear of all five companies is that corruption in poor countries is so rampant that millions of their cut-rate pills will disappear and be sent to rich countries to cannibalize their full-price sales.
"That's precisely one of the things that's worried us," said Jeffrey Sturchio of Merck & Company. "That's something we hope this initiative will be able to address."
Today's announcement was greeted with skepticism by Doctors Without Borders, the Nobel Prize-winning medical agency. The opening of discussions "is a victory, but a small one, much like an elephant giving birth to a mouse," said Dr. Bernard Pecoul, who cited the lack of any concrete commitments.
A Clinton administration official said the administration had not played much of a role in events that led to the agreement.
Poor people in the United States, unlike those in poor countries, have several ways of obtaining AIDS drugs. Medicaid generally covers the costs of such drugs. Low-income people who do not qualify for Medicaid may be able to obtain drug therapy through AIDS drug assistance programs run by the states with substantial federal money.
In addition, drug manufacturers have programs to provide drugs free, as a last resort, to patients who have no health insurance.
But Daniel Zingale, former executive director of AIDS Action, a lobby for people affected by the disease, said: "There are still some people in the United States who cannot get the drugs they need because the price is prohibitive. It costs $15,000 to $17,000 a year just for H.I.V. drugs."
Glaxo's Combivir, a combination of retrovir and epivir anti-viral drugs, generated $454 million in 1999 sales, but only 10 percent came from outside the United States and Europe.
"They don't have a great deal to lose," James Culverwell, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in London, told Reuters. "I don't imagine the financial effect is that significant."

HEADLINE: FORD IS CONCEDING S.U.V. DRAWBACKS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 11

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company, which depends on sport utility vehicles for much of its profit, acknowledged today that they cause serious safety and environmental problems.
In its first "corporate citizenship report," issued at the company's annual shareholders' meeting here, Ford said that the vehicles contributed more than cars to global warming, emitted more smog-causing pollution and endangered other motorists. The automaker said that it would keep building them because they provide needed profit, but would seek technological solutions to the problems and look for alternatives to the big vehicles. 
 Ford Motor's voluntary admission that it faces an awkward situation because its most profitable products do not meet its goals for social responsibility has few parallels, according to Business for Social Responsibility, a corporate group in San Francisco.
In an interview, William C. Ford Jr., 43, the company's chairman and a great-grandson of Henry Ford, depicted the company's statements as a combination of altruism and long-term business planning. He said that he worried that automakers could wind up with reputations like those of big tobacco companies if they ignored sport utilities' problems.
"The court of public opinion sometimes decides before you're ready for them to decide, and I want to make sure we're ready and ahead of the curve," said Mr. Ford, who became chairman 16 months ago. The company has sought to portray itself in recent months as the most environmentally responsible automaker.
Yet Mr. Ford and Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, said that they had no plans to stop making sport utilities, including the immense Ford Excursion, which weighs as much as two Jeep Grand Cherokees and gets just 10 miles to the gallon in the city and 13 on the highway.
"If we didn't provide that vehicle, someone else would, and they wouldn't provide it as responsibly as we do," Mr. Ford said.
For the last two years, Ford Motor has voluntarily built its sport utilities to emit far less tailpipe pollution than allowed by law. Ford has also voluntarily installed bars below the bumpers of the Excursion to reduce the risk that it will override cars during collisions, even though there are no federal regulations on this.
Environmentalists welcomed the automaker's stance. "While this isn't quite the fall of the Berlin Wall, we applaud Ford's recognition of the environmental and safety problems posed by S.U.V.'s," said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.
Mr. Nasser cautioned that while customers consistently said in market surveys that they wanted more environmentally responsible products, they were unwilling to pay more for them or to sacrifice features on their sport utilities.
With sport utilities accounting for a fifth of Ford's sales -- up from 5 percent in 1990 -- and the bulk of its profit, the automaker's stability could be affected if the sport utility market slumped, warns Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency. While Ford does not release profit margins by model, financial analysts say that the company earns $10,000 to $15,000 apiece on Ford Expeditions and Lincoln Navigators and up to $18,000 apiece on Ford Excursions.
Yet today's report clearly expressed the company's concern that the big vehicles have problems. "Sustainability concerns associated with SUV's raise issues relative to Ford's corporate citizenship commitment," the report said, adding: "We believe that the steps Ford has taken to date are only a beginning in addressing the issues raised by these products. Our task is to develop additional technological solutions and identify and implement alternative ways to satisfy customers that build a sustainable competitive advantage while meeting our environmental, social and economic objectives."
While admitting that the company was not being specific, Mr. Ford said that progress was being made. "It's sort of a 'watch this space' thing, it's going to get better as time goes on."
In a question-and-answer section of today's report, Mr. Ford said that it might be difficult to persuade Wall Street that it was worthwhile for Ford Motor to take big steps to be perceived as progressive and environmentally friendly. "Analysts are focused on the next quarter's report, and at most, your next year's report," he said. "And the kinds of issues we've been discussing today have payoffs 5, 10, 20, 50 years down the line. I do believe that I'm building a stronger Ford Motor Company for my children and grandchildren. But that's not a theme that resonates very well with most analysts."
John Casesa, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that Wall Street would tolerate the company's emphasis on social responsibility provided that it did not prove enormously expensive. "It's not going to make the stock go up, it may make the stock go down, but good companies are respected," he said. "It may take years before consumers buy a Ford because it's a responsible company, but it won't take years for regulatory authorities and communities to say, 'This is a company we can work with.' "
The Ford family has a long tradition of public service, best shown by the family charity, the Ford Foundation. The Ford family controls 40 percent of the votes at Ford Motor through a special class of shares.
Mr. Ford's comments today confirm a shift in his position on sport utilities. An ardent fly fisherman who bought his own fly fishing rod company, he has been active in environmental causes since his days at prep school and then Princeton. But he was also one of the board's most enthusiastic supporters of the decision to introduce the Expedition sport utility vehicle in 1996.
Sport utilities are three times as likely as cars to kill the other driver in a crash, but the death rate for sport utility occupants is just as high as for car occupants because of sport utilities' tendency to roll over and their lack of crumple zones. While current regulations allow large sport utilities to emit up to 5.5 times the smog-causing pollution of cars, President Clinton announced rules in December that will require sport utilities to meet the same standards as cars by 2009.
Business for Social Responsibility said one parallel to Ford's actions lay in BP Amoco's vow two years ago to reduce the global warming caused by oil consumption, even though it is the world's second-largest oil company. Another, less direct parallel lies in the Liggett Group's acknowledgment in March 1997 that cigarettes are addictive and cause cancer -- an admission that followed years of litigation and medical studies, the group said.
Executives at DaimlerChrysler defend their record. "We're every bit as responsible on safety and environmental issues" as Ford, said James Holden, the president of DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler unit, while adding that "all of the manufacturers are pursuing whatever we can do on safety while meeting consumer demands, and sometimes those are at odds."
DaimlerChrysler canceled plans in December to build a full-size Jeep. Bud Liebler, the vice president for marketing, said in January that one reason for the decision had been a fear that safety and environmental concerns would sour the public on large sport utility vehicles before Chrysler could get the vehicle to market.
By contrast, General Motors plans to increase its production of full-size sport utilities by 20 percent next year. G.M. declined to comment today on Ford's position. G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler are roughly tied in global sport utility sales.
While Ford started the sport utility boom in 1990 with the Explorer, the company has not been as aggressive in expanding production as its rivals since Mr. Ford took over the leadership of the company at the beginning of last year. And while automakers spend up to $100 million on advertising to promote a new model, Ford spent just $420,000 in the fourth quarter of last year to announce the Excursion's introduction.

HEADLINE: Merrill Joins Wall St. Rush To Keep Employees Happy

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch & Company has joined the rush of Wall Street firms offering new benefits and risk-free investment opportunities to attract young investment bankers and prevent others from defecting to Internet companies.
Merrill, one of the nation's biggest securities firms, is building a new fitness center for employees near its headquarters in Lower Manhattan and providing a concierge service to handle chores like shopping and laundry. The firm also hopes to lock in investment bankers by giving them chances to invest -- with a financial sweetener from the firm -- in new-economy companies that are still private. 
 The moves, some of which Merrill announced internally yesterday, are the latest in a series of attempts by Wall Street firms to stem defections. The firms are still developing these benefits despite the recent weakness in technology stocks and rising doubts about the future of many Internet businesses.
"I think the fever pitch has died down," said Mary Taylor, a senior vice president at Merrill. "People are a little more even-keeled about it and not just saying, 'I have to go to a dot-com.' "
Still, Wall Street executives say the competition for people with strong analytical skills remains fierce. To compete, some firms are simply raising salaries. But most are trying to devise incentives that will have a minimal impact on their firms' quarterly income if the stock market remains shaky for a while.
Merrill's midlevel to senior investment bankers will be able to invest as much as $1 million of their own money in a new private-equity fund with a focus on companies in technology, media and telecommunications. For each dollar an employee invests, the firm will put in $2 of its own money and let the employee keep the return on the full amount.
Younger bankers who are not qualified to -- or cannot afford to -- invest their own money in the fund will receive options worth as much as $100,000 on shares in the fund next month. Those options will give bankers in their first few years out of college or business school the chance to reap big gains without putting up any money. The catch is that they have to stay around to collect the gains when they are distributed.
Ms. Taylor described those benefits as "more cost-effective and efficient" than increasing salaries or cash bonuses. She declined to say how Merrill would account for them but hinted that they were designed to have a limited impact on the firm's reported compensation expenses.
Goldman Sachs Group, which recently handed out shares of its own stock to 8,000 junior employees, and Credit Suisse First Boston are drawing up similar plans.
Some investment banks, including Lehman Brothers Holdings and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, have offered senior bankers similar leveraged investment opportunities for years. Now, they and other firms are spreading the potential wealth more broadly to retain the young bankers who are most likely to be enticed by the prospect of quicker riches.
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette shook up the industry a few weeks ago when it offered hefty guaranteed pay for two years to young bankers who would sign agreements not to go to work for competitors. But other big firms have declined to follow suit.
"Locking in base salaries and bonuses for two years, given the uncertainties of the market, is not the prudent thing to do," said Alicia Whitaker, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston. "We continue to believe that a high percentage of variable compensation is what's appropriate."
Ms. Whitaker said her firm's recent increase of base salaries to $55,000 from $40,000 for first-year bankers, and to $65,000 from $45,000 for second-year bankers, showed that the firm was committed to paying some of the highest base salaries in the industry. Those raises, in turn, will drive up salaries through the rest of the investment bank, she said.
The firm is also planning to offer private-equity investments to bankers all the way down to the lowest levels, Ms. Whitaker said, because the tug of war among investment banks and dot-com companies rages on. "We'd love to think that it's over," she said, "but our people are still getting calls."

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN BRIEFING

BYLINE: By Compiled by B. Drummond Ayres Jr.

 BODY:

THE REPUBLICANS
 
McCAIN RESPONDS TO SUPPORTERS ABOUT BUSH -- Supporters of Senator John McCain of Arizona are inundating him with hundreds of e-mail messages and telephone calls complaining about his endorsement of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. He has responded with an e-mail message of his own, sent to 120,000 supporters on his campaign list, that recalled that he had promised at the start of his campaign to support the eventual Republican nominee and that he always makes good on his promises. In any event, the message continued, Mr. Bush is now "our best hope" to oust the Democrats from the White House. "To those who I have disappointed," Mr. McCain wrote, "let me simply reiterate that I will never give up my fight for real government reform." He and the Texas governor, he said, still have "a few principled disagreements," but he did not elaborate. McCain aides said the senator expected complaints about his endorsement but went ahead because breaking a promise would not only have tarnished his straight-talking image but also have made him appear a poor loser and a less-than-faithful Republican, should he ever seek the presidency again. (NYT)
 

BUSH COMMENTS ON 2 POSSIBLE RUNNING MATES -- When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was asked about vice-presidential candidates in an interview with the Lifetime women's cable channel yesterday, he had notably different reactions to two names, suggesting that he was concerned about appearing too open to the idea of a running mate who strongly supports abortion rights. Asked if Elizabeth Dole, an opponent of abortion, was on his list, he said that she was and then praised her as "a good friend of mine who has had a great career." But when asked about Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who supports abortion rights and whose selection would undoubtedly provoke many religious conservatives, Mr. Bush's response seemed conspicuously restrained. "There's a lot of people on the list," he said. Frank Bruni (NYT)
 
THE POLLS
 
ANOTHER SURVEY SHOWS A STRONG BUSH LEAD -- For the second time this week, a national presidential preference poll has Gov. George W. Bush leading Vice President Al Gore by at least half a dozen percentage points. The newest survey, released yesterday by the Voter.com group, puts Mr. Bush ahead by 48 percent to 42 percent. A poll released on Wednesday by The Los Angeles Times had Mr. Bush ahead by eight percentage points. Like the Times poll, the Voter.com poll found Mr. Bush now pulling about as much of the female vote as Mr. Gore, though that voting segment has traditionally leaned heavily to Democrats. Mr. Bush continues to lead among men, and he has moved ahead in the struggle for independents, a toss-up earlier. The Voter.com poll also found Mr. Bush leading among Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and also found that half of all voters had grown pessimistic about the state of the nation and its direction, despite the strong economy. Asked to rank top issues for Congress, voters most often mentioned "restoring moral values," followed by education. They said Republicans would be best at restoring moral values -- 6 in 10 disapproved of President Clinton "as a person" -- but believed Democrats would do more for education. The poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters from May 1 to May 3 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. (NYT)
 
THE DEMOCRATS
 
GORE MAKES MOST OF WASHINGTON CONNECTIONS -- Many are the perks of being vice president, particularly when you are running for president. Al Gore demonstrated that anew this week, first by handing out what his office called "deliverables" -- more than $25 million in grants to expand tourism and businesses in the financially struggling Mississippi Delta -- and then by announcing "improvements" in veterans' education benefits worth $1.2 billion over five years. (Never mind that the money will come from savings in other veterans' programs.) Mr. Gore boasted that the improvements were "the single largest increase in veterans' education benefits" in more than 15 years. Gov. George W. Bush called Mr. Gore hypocritical because the Clinton administration had earlier proposed sharp cuts in veterans' benefits. Katharine Q. Seelye (NYT)

HEADLINE: Florio Puts Corzine on the Defensive in Their First Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 11

 BODY:
After enduring an eight-week barrage of costly television commercials by Jon S. Corzine, his opponent in the Democratic primary, former Gov. Jim Florio, seized control of their first debate today, forcing Mr. Corzine on the defensive for a full hour as the two men showed why theirs is perhaps the most captivating Senate race outside New York.
Mr. Florio, who had to wait nearly a year for the chance to debate his rival, made the most of the opportunity, ridiculing Mr. Corzine's proposals, likening his views to those of Republican politicians and repeatedly attacking his main qualification for the United States Senate: his record as the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company. 
 But Mr. Corzine, an unpolished speaker who had seemed reluctant to attack Mr. Florio personally, criticized the former governor for raising taxes by $2.8 billion during the 1990 recession, a move that cost Mr. Florio his job and led to a Republican takeover of the State Legislature. "I think we took a problem and made it a crisis," Mr. Corzine said.
In his prepared opening statement, Mr. Corzine sought to cast Mr. Florio as a bad memory best forgotten. "People can embrace the past without embracing its failures," he said. "The voters of New Jersey are looking to the future, and the Democratic Party should as well."
But when their exchanges were extemporaneous, Mr. Florio was far more effective. When Mr. Corzine tried to talk about the specifics of what he calls his "bold ideas," for example, Mr. Florio delivered a withering retort: "Words," he said.
"Bold is about taking on the gun lobby," Mr. Florio said. "Bold is raising the money to finance education for our children. Bold is going out and making sure that we have a clean environment by taking on corporate polluters.
"Rhetoric is rhetoric, words are words," he added. "This is not bold; this is baloney."
The debate today was the first chance for most New Jerseyans to see the two Democratic candidates side by side, and it gave Mr. Florio, who has not yet been able to afford his own television ads, a coveted chance to address a broad audience.
The debate was taped in Trenton for broadcast tonight on the New Jersey Network, a state-owned group of public television and radio stations that sponsored the event with The New York Times. It will be shown again on Sunday at 3 p.m.
Mr. Florio held a wide lead in the polls against Mr. Corzine, a newcomer to politics, until Mr. Corzine began his ad campaign in mid-March and steadily eroded that gap. Officials in both campaigns say the former governor holds an edge of only about six percentage points among likely Democratic voters, and they expect the race to be exceedingly close right up until the primary on June 6 .
Throughout today's encounter, Mr. Corzine tried several times to outline his ideas for universal health care, long-term care for the elderly and disabled, and education, and Mr. Florio belittled them as unrealistic and too expensive. But the two men focused far more on their backgrounds in business and politics than on their proposals.
When Mr. Corzine spoke in favor of gun control, for example, Mr. Florio zeroed in on Goldman, Sachs's links to gun companies, saying the firm had advised the makers of Smith & Wesson, Remington and Ruger firearms in various transactions.
Mr. Corzine first denied that he had led Goldman, Sachs while it was advising those companies, then said the stocks of companies that make guns occasionally "flow through our portfolios provided for the investors."
Mr. Florio responded: "Jon is getting very good at the political art of squirming off the hook. We're not talking about trading stocks, we're talking about raising capital to go into gun manufacturing companies. And through this whole last decade, Jon was either the C.E.O. or he was a member of the nine-member management commission."
Mr. Florio's attacks were so persistent that Mr. Corzine at one point felt compelled to defend his former employer. "I'm proud of my record at Goldman, Sachs; I'm proud of Goldman, Sachs," he said.
Mr. Corzine offered his most extended rebuke of Mr. Florio for raising taxes in 1990, after promising as a candidate the year before that he would not. Had he been in Mr. Florio's shoes, Mr. Corzine said, he would never have made such a promise. And he would not have raised the sales tax, the "most regressive" kind of tax, in any case, he said.
"Governor, you told the New Jersey public that you would look at the $12.6 billion state budget and find savings," Mr. Corzine said, adding that Mr. Florio's actions evinced "a 'ready, fire, aim' attitude."
In response, Mr. Florio called Mr. Corzine's recollection "an Orwellian rewriting of history," and questioned how Mr. Corzine would have replaced the sales tax revenue. "Jon just took $700 million out of the equation," he said. "That's fine, but I'm still waiting for him to say what he would have done."
Mr. Florio again defended the tax increases as necessary to pay for more aid to needy urban school districts. "This sounds very much like the Republicans the other night," he said of Mr. Corzine's objections. "It's fine for Republicans to walk away from a commitment to finance education for all of our children.
"Those kind of know-nothing views about not standing up for our children don't belong in our party. They belong in the other party."
Mr. Florio also attacked his rival on campaign finance reform, repeating his claim that Mr. Corzine was trying to buy the election. Mr. Corzine is bankrolling his candidacy using his $400 million fortune. When Mr. Corzine said, "Elections are about a contest of ideas, they're not about money," Mr. Florio replied: "Jon's being a bit disingenuous. Even one of his supporters in the audience said he wouldn't be talking to him if it weren't for his money."
Mr. Corzine, whose aides said his poor debating skills made him seem more human than the composed but sharp-edged Mr. Florio, made no major gaffes and slowly grew more comfortable on the podium. But he appeared nervous at first, his syntax frequently derailed, and some of his points were lost on even the most informed people in the audience. Attempting a riposte to Mr. Florio's attack on his Wall Street record, for example, Mr. Corzine was inarticulate in trying to raise similar questions about Mr. Florio's years in private legal practice.
Mr. Florio, by contrast, was as pointed and focused as he has ever been, although it remains to be seen whether his familiar, jabbing cadences and aggressive style will still appeal to voters. Mr. Corzine's supporters believe that many have grown weary of Mr. Florio -- a condition they call "Florio fatigue."
"It's the same old Jim Florio, the same rhetoric, the same old attacking, critical style," said State Senator John A. Lynch, a supporter of Mr. Corzine. "I saw the past, and I saw the future in Jon Corzine. I like the future."

HEADLINE: MY MANHATTAN;
Where Unicorns and Tapestries Wait in Timeless Repose

BYLINE: By HELEN SCHARY MOTRO; Helen Schary Motro, who grew up in Manhattan and divides her time between Israel and New York, is a columnist for The Jerusalem Post.

 BODY:
The most beautiful European cloister I've ever experienced lies along the Hudson River, just south of the Bronx border. The Cloisters and I were introduced in early May of my 11th year, a season when the transplanted monastery gardens in Fort Tryon Park explode with color.
Our sixth-grade class had studied the social, political and economic structure of medieval Europe with a thoroughness that years later could carry us cold through college examinations. We had spent the interminable dark winter immersed in the Middle Ages, hardly raising our heads to see if the 15th century ever arrived. 
 We passed our weekends assembling bulky scrapbooks, scavenging our parents' bookshelves, buying up secondhand magazines on 42nd Street. In gold and peacock watercolors, we painstakingly adorned with gothic lettering the individual compendiums of our year's work. Our "medieval books" were displayed for admiring parents in the school library with a seriousness and pomp matching that of the rare-book room at the British Museum.
In May our class set out in a yellow school bus with bad shocks on a bumpy crusade up the Henry Hudson Parkway. The Cloisters wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is more than a reproduction of a medieval microcosm that any come-lately millionaire could hope to construct in Arizona. Chapels and cloisters were transplanted stone by stone from monasteries scattered throughout Europe. On a site overlooking the New Jersey Palisades, they were rebuilt on the biggest hill in New York near the highest-numbered streets in Manhattan.
The perfect haven of beauty abloom with fragrant blossoms, the bubbling stone fountain in the center, the spring air limpid and the sunshine sending warm rays upon our shiny childhood hair -- it was my first aesthetic jolt.
And I've kept trying to recapture that platonic essence of cloister ever since.
In every European city I've run straight to every cloister mentioned in each footnote of my guidebook. Predictably, my expectations were forever higher than any mere human cloister could deliver.
In high school I dragged hapless friends on the endless trip through upper Manhattan on the No. 4 bus. Finally it made a majestic sweep into the circular driveway of the Cloisters; we disembarked and forded the mental moat back to the Middle Ages. But my friends always remained bewildered; reality did not match my magical description. We hurtled noisily back downtown on the A train.
I introduced my two little girls to the Cloisters in exactly the right spring season.
Driving them in from the suburbs in my station wagon, I told them over my shoulder of my mystical class trip and the wondrous surprise that was awaiting them. But my little girls had never heard of troubadours or Eleanor of Aquitaine, of stained glass windows or illuminated manuscripts.
They trailed blankly after me through the courtyards until their patience wore out and they started to beg for Good Humors and tug my arm toward the gift shop.
Years later, I took my first daughter to the Cloisters on the last sunny weekend before she left for college. I suspect I wanted to take my parting from her by coming together to the womblike gardens nestling hidden and comforting inside fluted arches. She recognized the white unicorn, an old friend from the reproduction of the tapestry tacked up on our kitchen cupboard, and said with sparkling eyes that she would certainly come back in the spring to see the rose trees flower.
But for her the spring was years still in the future.
It is suddenly spring again, a spring when I feel leaden and pedestrian -- ages older than the springs of my Middle Ages. Among the mail filled with offers of things I do not want I find the bulletin of events from the Metropolitan Museum. One page near the back lists hours, activities and location of the Cloisters. Tucked at the bottom is an unobtrusive photograph of a flowering cloister garden, almost begging to be overlooked.
I feel myself again walking in the orderly line of sixth graders, holding hands, two by two, with the teacher at the head and a chaperoning mother at the rear, wearing a starched cotton dress tied at the waist, filing out from the cool vaulted halls into the brilliant sunshine of the Cuxa cloister.
What need have I to be moved by the fairyland beauty of foreign castles along a foreign Rhine or to trudge with tourists through congested Florence, when right next to the prosaic Hudson looms our majestic medieval fortress controlling all of Manhattan Island? And along with Manhattan, holding my old heart within its walls, a more than willing captive.

HEADLINE: Telefonica's Brave New World;
A Strategy With a Latin American Centerpiece

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: MADRID

 BODY:
In Spain's corporate world, with its cozy relationships and closely knit elite, it might have seemed that Juan Villalonga's greatest asset as head of the national phone company was his boyhood friendship with the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar. But Mr. Villalonga, the 47-year-old chairman of the company, Telefonica, has also made his way on his own.
Recognizing that Telefonica lacks the size and revenue to compete in Europe, he has devoted much energy to expansion in Latin America -- which, as he sees it, has the added bonus of being a back door to North America. And, breaking with Telefonica's tradition as a unified national giant, he is spinning off businesses like cell phones and multimedia operations to cash in on investor appetite for technology stocks. 
 In the process, Mr. Villalonga has made Telefonica a darling of investors. Since he took over in 1996, its shares -- lovingly called Matildas, after a 1970's television promotion in which a husband boasts to his wife, Matilda, that he just bought some -- have risen fivefold, hitting a high of $93 before falling back sharply in recent months. The American depository receipts closed Friday at $65.1953, up $2.3516.
Carol L. Franklin, a portfolio manager at Scudder Kemper Investments, who holds Telefonica in her Scudder Greater Europe and Kemper New Europe funds, said Mr. Villalonga understands "better than anyone else the whole value chain of the telecommunications business."
Despite his accomplishments, Mr. Villalonga is having trouble lately getting what he wants. To fortify Telefonica in Europe, he has set his sights on the new generation of cell phones, which feature an array of interactive devices, by bidding for licenses in Britain, Germany, France and Italy.
His first effort, in Britain in April, ended badly when the company dropped out rather than top a $6.8 billion bid by Telesystem International Wireless of Canada. Earlier this month, Telefonica lost another opportunity, after bankers on its board, at the behest of the Spanish government, vetoed a $58 billion merger with the Dutch phone company Royal KPN, which would have created Europe's fourth-largest phone company, with a market capitalization of $125 billion.
With that latest setback, Mr. Villalonga is being tested as never before -- and even faces questions about whether he can hang on to his job. But judging by his record, Mr. Villalonga is not likely to give up easily.
Born in Madrid the son of a banker, he got a degree in management, then worked as a consultant at McKinsey before joining Credit Suisse First Boston and later Bankers Trust in Madrid.
As an investment banker, Mr. Villalonga appears to have been no standout. A Madrid banker described him as "good at opening doors" for bankers who flew in from London and New York to manage deals in Spain.
Along the way, though, he made the most of some early friendships. Mr. Villalonga's ties to Mr. Aznar, a high school classmate, paid off in 1996 when Mr. Aznar, freshly elected as prime minister, offered him Telefonica.
The challenge was immense. European phone deregulation was around the corner, and Telefonica, known mainly for wrong numbers and months of waiting to get a phone, was scrambling to shape up.
Mr. Villalonga, who is uncomfortable with the press and declined to be interviewed for this article, proved skillful at surrounding himself with good people. In an interview with Shere Hite for her recent book about the workplace, "Sex and Business," he described himself as "spending an important part of my time identifying talent."
He brought in trusted associates like Fernando Abril, a former J. P. Morgan banker, who became chief financial officer, and shifted managers. Recently, Mr. Abril was appointed to run the yellow pages unit, while another trusted associate, Juan Perea, who arrived with him as chief strategist, left the company.
In 1998, Mr. Villalonga spent $5 billion for stakes in Brazilian phone companies after the breakup of the national phone company, and this January he began a $21 billion all-stock tender offer for full ownership of the companies in Brazil, plus others in Argentina and Peru. In November, he spun off a third of Terra Networks, Telefonica's Internet service provider, which became Europe's fastest-growing Internet stock. Earlier, he sold 37 percent of the yellow pages publisher.
Not satisfied with just owning distribution, he also wants to control content. In March, he offered $5.4 billion for the hot Dutch television production company Endemol. This month, Telefonica said it was in talks with about 20 Spanish-language television groups in the Americas, including Univision Communications, the No. 1 Spanish network in the United States. A media company will ultimately be spun off, he says.
While the breakup may be unusual for a Spanish corporation, the drive across the Atlantic is not. Beginning in the 1980's, Spanish utilities, television companies and banks -- exploiting linguistic, cultural and historical ties -- rushed into Latin America as governments there liberalized their economies. Prisa, the media group that competes with Telefonica in the Spanish-language Internet business, plans to sell 25 percent of its shares to the public in June, in part to raise cash for Latin America.
And despite the region's volatility, the investments are paying off. Banco Santander Central Hispano, a pioneer in Latin America, expects $1 billion in profit there this year, on top of $600 million in 1999.
Mr. Villalonga's razzle-dazzle has occasionally put him at loggerheads with minority shareholders. Pension funds holding shares in the Latin American subsidiaries protested when crucial assets, like Internet services, were merged with Terra. Mr. Villalonga's buyout of the junior shareholders with Telefonica stock in January mended bridges with institutional investors.
In the meantime, Mr. Villalonga has been much in the gossip columns lately after separating from his wife, with whom he has two children, and reportedly dating Adriana Abascal, a former Mexican beauty queen and widow of the Mexican television executive Emilio Azcarraga Milmo.
The Aznar and Villalonga families are close, and Mr. Villalonga's marital problems have not helped a cooling of relations with Mr. Aznar. Mr. Villalonga became a liability for the prime minister in his recent successful re-election campaign after it was disclosed that Telefonica had provided stock options worth $190 million to 100 top executives, provoking charges of cronyism. To disarm critics, Mr. Villalonga spread the options to 90,000 employees.
Mr. Villalonga's influence, though, has flourished even as government control declined. In 1997, the government sold its last 21 percent stake in Telefonica, though it retained a "golden share" enabling it to sway big decisions.
Long before Mr. Villalonga brought his flair, Telefonica had begun its international push. In the late 1980's, the looming liberalization of the European market prompted the company to seek fresh markets abroad. Latin America offered opportunities, as Argentina, under Carlos Saul Menem, and Mexico, under Carlos Salinas de Gortari, overhauled their economies, and Chile marched out of the Pinochet years to more liberal economic rules.
Telefonica's chairman then, Luis Solana -- a well-connected manager whose brother, Javier Solana, was foreign minister and later secretary general of NATO -- pushed into the region, acquiring stakes in phone companies in Chile, Argentina, Peru, Mexico and Brazil. The company faced scant competition from North American competitors, who viewed Latin America as too risky.
"Now, everybody wants to go there, but then people often told us we were crazy," said Ignacio Santillana, a former associate of Luis Solana and head of Prisa's Internet group. "But governments in the region were fighting to get our investment."
Under Mr. Villalonga, Latin America became a centerpiece of Telefonica's strategy. Analysts say he showed boldness, but also financial acumen, in Brazil's economic crisis. "Instead of going on the defensive, he became more aggressive," said Lucia Granda, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Madrid. And by delaying payment of 40 percent of the purchase price of the assets of the national phone company, then investing the money in dollar-denominated Brazilian bonds, Mr. Villalonga nearly doubled his investment when measured in Brazilian reais.
To be sure, Mr. Villalonga's strategies are not without risk. For all Telefonica's strength in South America, it remains a relative dwarf in Europe and North America. Indeed, some analysts say Telefonica's limited successes may succeed only in making it a takeover target.
Mr. Santillana of Prisa noted that while roughly a quarter of Latin American telecommunications traffic and commerce is within the region, and 60 percent is with North America, links with Europe remain negligible. On the other hand, 80 percent of Spanish phone traffic is with neighbors like France, Italy and Germany. "Telefonica and Spain belong to Europe," he said. "Telefonica and Spain have to dedicate their time to being European players."
The failed bids in Britain and the Netherlands illustrate how difficult executing that strategy is going to be.
Moreover, despite Telefonica's efforts at acquiring content providers, like Endemol, not all analysts are convinced that that is the way to spend limited resources. "The best distribution platforms will be able to attract content without necessarily owning them," said Ms. Granda of Merrill Lynch.
Still, Mr. Villalonga keeps convincing investors.
As technologies continue to integrate, said James S. Byrd, an asset manager who holds Telefonica shares in his Fortis International Equity and Fortis Global Growth funds, "content is going to be the thing, and he is trying to position Telefonica." As for Latin America, he said, "when you look at where unit growth is around the world, it's going to be there."
Mr. Villalonga could not agree more. "The production of content is going to become, in a short time, the field of activity with the greatest level of return," he told shareholders in April. As for geography, he said, if Telefonica has strategic value, "it is due to its position in Latin America."

HEADLINE: Political Turmoil Adds to Colombian President's Woes

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

 BODY:
Since taking office in August 1998, President Andres Pastrana of Colombia has had his hands full trying to fend off both guerrillas and drug traffickers. Now a deepening political crisis is threatening to weaken his authority even further.
The crisis is in large part a result of a plan that Mr. Pastrana announced on March 30 for a referendum to enhance his power by dissolving the existing Congress and electing one that would be more streamlined and, presumably, more compliant. But the move backfired when legislators urged that Mr. Pastrana's own job also be submitted to a vote, and the president withdrew his plan on Monday. 
 In addition, three of Mr. Pastrana's closest advisers have resigned in recent weeks. Interior Minister Nestor Martinez is the latest casualty, stepping down on Monday just as Congress was about to begin an investigation -- apparently in reprisal for the referendum proposal -- into accusations that he had been making payoffs to lawmakers to support government legislation.
The turmoil in Bogota occurs as the United States Congress is considering $1.7 billion in emergency aid to Colombia to help Mr. Pastrana combat an increase in drug production that Washington attributes to guerrilla groups. The bill has passed the House but is stalled in the Senate, and President Clinton warned last week that Colombia might be "undermined and overwhelmed," unless action was promptly taken.
Mr. Pastrana's approval rating has dived, to 29 percent from 40 a month ago. With the midway point of his four-year term approaching, he increasingly has to fight the perception that he is no longer running the country or able to control events.
In an editorial on Tuesday, El Espectador, the daily in Bogota, compared Colombia to a ship "tossing around in stormy seas without a compass or a crew." The paper, owned by the country's leading business group, also said, "It is hard to remember a time of greater turmoil or a time when there was worse leadership in charge of the state."
Almost simultaneously, peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the main Marxist-Leninist guerrilla group, have taken a turn for the worse. Last month, the group, known by the Spanish acronym FARC, said it intended to impose a "peace tax" on all people and companies with assets of $1 million or more. People who did not pay would be kidnapped, the rebels said.
That announcement was followed by the resignation of Mr. Pastrana's chief peace negotiator, Victor G. Ricardo, and a wave of speculation that the FARC was writing off the possibility of an accord and building up a war chest to counter American aid.
"Things are heating up in such a way that it could quickly lead to a break-off of negotiations," Manuel Marulanda, the group's founder, said on Sunday in a rare interview with reporters.
Despite the outcry, Mr. Marulanda has refused to budge from the "tax" demand, presenting it as preferable to his group's current extortion and abduction. "This law is going to avoid kidnapping," he said. "Instead of searching for them, we can reach an agreement" with targets.
To succeed Mr. Martinez, his chief political operative, Mr. Pastrana has turned to a onetime rival, former Vice President Humberto de la Calle. A member of the opposition Liberal Party, Mr. de la Calle was the running mate of Ernesto Samper, who defeated Mr. Pastrana in his first run for the presidency, in 1994, but was ostracized by the United States after it was learned that drug traffickers had bankrolled his campaign.
Mr. de la Calle, who resigned halfway through the scandal-ridden Samper administration, said this week that his most urgent task would be to try "to rapidly lower the temperature and return to an atmosphere of democratic discussion."
Foreign Minister Guillermo Fernandez also called for a respite from squabbling, saying: "The language we should use at this moment is of calm, not confrontation. It seems that the country cannot withstand more confrontation."
Mr. Pastrana has also lost his chief of staff, Juan Hernandez. He stepped down this month after having been accused of "improper personal enrichment," the same type of corruption that Mr. Pastrana pledged to eradicate as a candidate two years ago.
The uncertainties have worsened the economic crisis, which had recently shown signs of easing. The peso fell to record lows against the dollar this week, and there is wide speculation, which the government called unfounded, that Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo will be the next minister toppled.
"The combination of guerrilla threats with the development of a political crisis of unpredictable consequences that damages the management and the correction of serious fiscal problems has reverberated very negatively in debt evaluations and the perceptions of Colombia abroad," said Armando Montenegro, president of the National Association of Financial Institutions.
The confrontation also increases fears that Mr. Pastrana will not win approval of tax and pension reforms that are requisites for a $2.7 billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund. In a speech to a business group on Monday, Mr. Pastrana asked lawmakers to show "a patriotic sense of duty" but said he would act without them if he had to.

HEADLINE: Ford's Admission Perplexes the Neighbors in Henry's Hometown

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., May 12

 BODY:
The doors and floor mats at City Hall here proudly bear the logo, "Home Town of Henry Ford." The Ford Motor Company's headquarters, an immense rectangle of glass and steel in a community of two-story homes, is a mile down the street, and the company's endless office parks, factories and test tracks cover most of the landscape.
So people in this southwest suburb of Detroit tend to support Ford, and they expressed little shock at the company's frank admission on Thursday that sport utility vehicles cause serious safety and environmental problems. They focused on Ford's vow to improve the big vehicles' tailpipe emissions and fuel economy and find ways to make them less dangerous in crashes with cars. 
 "They should if it's the vehicle you're buying -- it's a lot of money you're investing," said Natasha Lintz, who works for a trucking company that carries steel to Ford factories. She drives a sport utility vehicle, a dark red GMC Jimmy.
Across the Detroit area and in Washington, people were trying today to interpret Ford's acknowledgment that it faced an awkward situation in balancing sales of highly profitable sport utilities with the company's desire to be a good corporate citizen. In an industry with a long history of resisting safety and environmental advances like seat belts, air bags and catalytic converters, Ford's forthright stance took many by surprise.
Some in Michigan's Congressional delegation were concerned that the company might have strengthened its longtime political enemies in regulatory and legislative battles. "It does make it more difficult for us to propose reasonable standards," said Paul F. Welday, the chief of staff for Representative Joe Knollenberg, a Michigan Republican on the Appropriations Committee. "The company is trying to find itself right now, and we're not sure where it is."
Mr. Knollenberg has led efforts to freeze fuel-economy regulations, locking in more lenient treatment for sport utilities and other light trucks than for cars. Each federal budget since 1995 has included a rider barring the Clinton administration from spending any money to tighten the standards.
Detroit's news media seemed mystified by Ford Motor's stance. "Ford admits its trucks hurt Earth," was the large headline leading the business section of The Detroit Free Press, although the article below it from The Associated Press was just seven paragraphs long. "Ford admits dilemma: SUVs vs. environment," was the headline on the front page of the business section of the more conservative Detroit News, next to a column warning of the dangers of providing help to critics of the auto industry.
The environmental groups to which Ford wants to build ties were particularly perplexed about how to respond. Some saw the "corporate citizenship report" issued by the company as ammunition to use against Ford and the rest of the auto industry in pursuing tighter regulations in Congress.
"The timing is useful in terms of the likely discussions that are going to be taking place in Washington," said Brian Dunkiel, a lawyer for Friends of the Earth.
But some environmental groups were reluctant to use Ford's arguments in lobbying, for fear of discouraging Ford and other companies from taking a more cooperative approach to the environment. "There will probably be some groups that will use it to make more trouble, but others will want to work with them," said Frank J. O'Donnell, the executive director of the Clean Air Trust, a Washington group that has lobbied for tighter emissions rules on sport utilities.
William C. Ford Jr., the automaker's chairman, and Jacques Nasser, its chief executive, said at the company's annual meeting on Thursday that they believed it was best to be open about the company's problems. Mr. Nasser said consumers are increasingly influenced in their buying decisions by their overall perceptions of companies. Ford Motor executives have long been envious of the reputation of the General Motors Saturn division, which had considerable success for many years in using its strong public image to sell cars that tended to draw poor reviews from experts.
Debbie Zemke, a longtime friend of Mr. Ford who is now Ford Motor's director of corporate governance, drafted the report with the forthright discussion of sport utility vehicles' drawbacks. "We just said: 'For heaven's sake, everybody else is talking about it, so why shouldn't we?' " she said.
At lunchtime today on the streets of Dearborn, there was even a sense of relief at the company's remarks among some car owners. Marie Conrad, a homemaker and the wife of a retired Chrysler auto worker, drives a 15-year-old white Chrysler Fifth Avenue with plush red seats and feels nervous around big sport utilities.
"I'm glad they're doing something about it," she said. "But why couldn't they catch it sooner?"

HEADLINE: On Road Again in Midwest, Clinton Promotes China Trade

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: SHAKOPEE, Minn., May 12

 BODY:
President Clinton took his campaign to improve trade relations with China to the Midwest today, arguing that if Congress rejected the measure it would deny troubled farmers a chance to tap a giant new market.
Standing on hay bales in a made-for-television panorama of grain silos and combines at a Minnesota family farm, the president said soybean and corn producers could expect an "almost incalculable" increase in exports if China opened its markets to American agriculture the way other Asian nations had. But, Mr. Clinton warned, the opportunity will be lost unless Congress votes yes on extending permanent trading rights to Beijing when the issue comes to the floor this month. 
 "Chinese farmers cannot keep pace with their own consumers," he said. "But American farmers can."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton visited Canton, Ohio, where he attended a panel discussion on China trade organized by Representative Tom Sawyer, an Ohio Democrat who is counted as undecided on whether to end Congress's annual review of China's trade status. Congressional aides said the meeting, at a National Guard facility next to the Akron-Canton regional airport, was to rally political support for Mr. Sawyer, who faces intense union pressure to vote against the measure.
President Clinton has campaigned for the China trade bill every day this week, stepping up his lobbying as the vote approaches. But he still faces a struggle in Congress, where his own party leadership stands four-square against the measure and supporters are still shy of the 218 supporters they need in the House.
An agreement the United States negotiated to clear China's entry into the World Trade Organization requires on overhaul of that nation's tariffs and trade barriers generally, but promises especially big export opportunities in China's now heavily regulated farm sector. Congress is being asked to give up its annual review of China's trade status to take full advantage of China's entry into the Geneva-based trade body.
White House officials have said that strong support from agricultural districts could tip the balance in Congress, where the farm lobby is strong and is seen as a counterweight to organized labor's steadfast opposition.
Several hundred farmers, their jackets tied around their waists in the bright sun, gathered at the Hauer farm to hear the president. Some complained that Mr. Clinton had not done enough to relieve the farming crisis, but applauded his stance on China trade.
"If every Chinese ate two more eggs a week, they would need the entire grain crop of Minnesota just to feed their chickens," said J.R. Hanson, 51, who operates his own 800-acre spread nearby. "But I'm not saying this is a miracle cure."
Clearly sensing that economic arguments alone are unlikely to sway Congress, Mr. Clinton also emphasized his view that China must get permanent trading rights for national security reasons. In both Ohio and Minnesota, he said that while granting the new rights was no guarantee that China would democratize, rejecting the measure would boost Communist hard-liners in that country and set the stage for a hostile relationship across the Pacific.
Still, the quandary some Democratic lawmakers face defying either the president or powerful labor interests in an election year was on full display in Ohio. Outside the armory gate, several dozen union protesters in the heavy industrial area warned Mr. Sawyer that his job was at risk if he backed Mr. Clinton.
"People who vote the wrong way in this Congress are going to be punished this time around," said Warren Davis, a United Auto Workers organizer in the region who attended the rally. Labor unions have argued that the China agreement would promote the transfer of good manufacturing jobs to that country.
Formal consideration of the China trade measure was set to begin next Wednesday, when the House Ways and Means Committee is expected approve the bill. The Senate Finance Committee, also expected to vote yes, will take it up the same day. The full House vote is planned for the week of May 22, and the outcome is considered too close to call.

HEADLINE: Lower Energy Costs in April Led Wholesale Prices Lower

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Wholesale prices fell in April for the first time in 14 months as energy costs took their biggest plunge in nine years, more than outweighing a sharp jump in food prices.
But even with the good news on inflation, economists expect the Federal Reserve to push interest rates higher on Tuesday. 
 The Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers, dipped an expected 0.3 percent last month after having shot up in February and March, the Labor Department reported today.
Outside the volatile energy and food categories, the core rate of inflation in April rose for the second consecutive month by 0.1 percent, also matching many analysts' forecasts.
Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's economic forecasting project, said it was a good report. "When I look at it, I kind of say where's the inflation?" he said. "Sure, you got problems in a few spot areas but you are always going to have that."
Even though the report suggested that inflation at the wholesale level was quiet last month, it came after a series of other economic indicators showing strength in the economy and rising wage and inflation pressures. And that has led a growing number of economists to predict that Fed policy makers will raise interest rates by a half a percentage point, a step up from the quarter-point increases of the last year.
How much the Fed raises rates may well be determined by the results of the Consumer Price Index for April that is due out Tuesday, economists said.
The decline in wholesale prices in April was the first since February 1999.
In February and March of this year wholesale prices shot up 1 percent. In both months, the jolts came from soaring energy prices, which posted their biggest increases in nearly 10 years.
But in April, energy prices plunged 4.1 percent, the steepest decrease since February 1991. Increased crude-oil production accounted for the decline, economists said.
Gasoline prices -- which skyrocketed in February and March -- went down 11.7 percent in April, the steepest drop in nearly 11 years. Home-heating oil fell 14 percent, the largest decline since December 1998. Prices for liquefied petroleum gas, like propane, fell 7.8 percent, the biggest decrease since January 1999.
Food prices, which rose just 0.1 percent in March, rose 1 percent in April -- the biggest jump since January 1999.
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an annual rate of 5.4 percent, compared with a 3 percent gain for all of 1999.

THE DEMOCRATS
 
GORE LEADS CASH PARADE -- Vice President Al Gore continues to pull in the cash for his party. This week he raised $2.4 million for the Democratic National Committee at six dinners. That brings the total that he has raised for the party since the end of March to $15.8 million, not including the $5 million he helped raise with President Clinton in Hollywood ($2.8 million) and New York ($2.2 million). The events this week included two dinners each, back to back, in Manhattan, Dallas and Los Angeles. Next up is a fund-raiser for the party on May 24 in Washington, where the host, Terry McAuliffe, has promised a record-breaking single-night haul of more than $21 million. Katherine Q. Seelye (NYT) 

THE REPUBLICANS
 
BUSH HONING FOREIGN POLICY SKILLS -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, ever eager to burnish his foreign policy credentials in the presidential campaign, plans to attend a conference of American and Mexican governors from border states next month in Sacramento. The event is being organized by Gov. Gray Davis of California, a Democrat who is an ally of Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Bush's expected rival in the presidential race. Governors Bush, Gray and Jane Dee Hull, an Arizona Republican, will meet on June 1 and June 2 with their counterparts from six Mexican border states. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Mindy Tucker, said yesterday that the agenda included education, economic development and the environment. Last month, Mr. Bush met with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico at the dedication of the eight-lane, $128 million World Trade Bridge in Nuevo Laredo, just over the border from Texas. (AP)
 
THE STATES
 
A KENNEDY DEFENDS HIMSELF -- Representative Patrick J. Kennedy met today in Los Angeles with an airport guard who said he had assaulted her. They were there to view a videotape of the incident and to give their versions of events to a hearing officer. Lawrence Webster of the city attorney's office said a decision would be made in about a week on whether to file misdemeanor charges against Mr. Kennedy, a Rhode Island Democrat and rising star of his party. The guard, Della Patton, 58, said Mr. Kennedy shoved and grabbed her on March 26 after she told him his bag was too big to fit through an X-ray scanner at Los Angeles International Airport. Rather than filing a misdemeanor battery charge, which carries a penalty of up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine, the city attorney's office ordered today's hearing in hope of resolving the case. Mr. Kennedy, 32, the son of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, has expressed regret for acting rudely, but has denied hurting the woman. Ms. Patton's lawyer, George L. Mallory Jr., said his client "desires to go forward with a criminal case." In a statement after the hearing, Mr. Kennedy said "there is absolutely no question" that the accusations were inaccurate.

International Paper Wins Contest to Buy Champion
International Paper emerged the victor in a bidding war to acquire Champion International after a Finnish paper company declined to increase its offer. International Paper agreed to pay about $7.3 billion, or $75 a share in cash and stock.
UPM of Finland had reached a merger deal with Champion in February for $6.6 billion, or $56.50 a share. International Paper made a surprise cash-and-stock bid of $64 a share two weeks ago. UPM raised its bid to $70 in cash, but failed to match International's highest offer as the deadline passed. Page C4.

It was not so long ago that Sir Martin Sorrell was on the brink of ruin, nearly bankrupting the British advertising conglomerate WPP Group that he was trying to build. But as Sir Martin announced that WPP had formally agreed to acquire Young & Rubicam for stock worth $4.7 billion, it is clear that not only is Sir Martin back, he has vaulted to the top of Madison Avenue's short list.

HEADLINE: A Town's Grieving Mothers Find Reason to Pray and to Cry, but Not to March

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: PINE BLUFF, Ark., May 10

 BODY:
Teresa Brown carries a letter and a photograph in her pocketbook. The photograph is of her son, Patrick. The letter is from one of the five young men who killed him.
She has read the letter many times, but she cannot yet find an answer for the man who wrote it. He wants her forgiveness, her mercy, but she still must pass her son's empty bedroom each morning. She touches his picture on the wall with her lips and says hello. She tells him that she loves him and apologizes that he had to die so unfairly. No, she cannot answer that letter yet. 
 "In order for me to see God, I've got to forgive him," she says. "But right now it's hard."
Mrs. Brown will not be among the tens of thousands of mothers gathering in Washington on this Mother's Day weekend for the Million Mom March against gun violence. She and other mothers who have lost children to violence here admit they know little about the demonstration. And they do not even agree with all the fine points of its message.
But they do know a lot about murder. For few places offer a more sobering picture of murder in America than this gritty paper mill town in the Arkansas Delta.
The murder rate here led the nation in 1997 and 1998. The local prosecuting attorney estimates that there are more guns than people. Unemployment is double the state average, and city officials are so desperate to stanch the falling population that they recently annexed nearby prison units with 1,500 inmates.
The protesters in Washington are calling for "sensible gun control," and mothers in Pine Bluff like Mrs. Brown would seem to be a sympathetic audience. But their responses are hardly predictable. Mrs. Brown's son was killed in 1998 during a weekend visit home from college, and she does support more gun restrictions.
Lynda Carter, whose oldest son, Gabriel, was shot when someone fired indiscriminately into a crowded dance hall, supports gun licensing and registration. But she sounds like many gun control opponents when she says that the problem lies more with the person holding the gun than with the weapon itself.
And Frankie Bishop Odom, whose son, Chris, was shot outside a bar here in 1997, also thinks guns should be licensed. But she doubts that doing so will prevent criminals from getting them.
"I don't blame the mothers who want the handguns done away with, I don't blame them at all," Mrs. Odom said. But, she added, "In this town, it's not a bad idea for you to have a gun."
So on Mother's Day, as protesters gather at the foot of the Capitol, Mrs. Brown will attend church. Mrs. Carter will spend the day with her husband and three other children. And Mrs. Odom will carry a single rose to her son's grave, which she visits every week, talking to his headstone, even though she knows she must look like a crazy lady whispering to a ghost.
"The favorite word is closure," said Mrs. Odom, 46, who manages an apartment complex. "I hate that word, because there's no such thing. You never have your life back. I go to bed thinking about it. I wake up thinking about it."
She once drove 40 miles to Little Rock to attend a support group for parents of murdered children, but never went inside. She sat in the parking lot, unable to will herself out of the car, so she drove back to Pine Bluff.
She poured her energy into bringing her son's killer to justice. She wrote anonymous letters to the local newspaper when the case seemed stalled.
When she feared prosecutors might negotiate a reduced sentence, she faxed them a homemade Christmas card with a picture of her son's grave. The killer got 40 years.
The conviction brought her some relief, but it has not eased her loneliness. She still has her husband and her 14-year-old daughter, Catherine, but she and Chris, who was 23, talked about everything. Some nights, she says, she prays she will dream about him so they can talk again, and she can touch him. "I ask people sometimes, 'Do you think I'm crazy?' " she says.
There is reason for some optimism in Pine Bluff. The city recorded 21 murders in 1996, then 19 in 1997 and 18 in 1998. None of these numbers would be startling for a large city, but Pine Bluff has only 57,000 residents within its city limits, and about 82,000 people in what officials call its metropolitan area.
In 1998, the city was the nation's murder capital with a rate of 33.8 per 100,000 people, compared with a national average of 6.3. If New York had had a similar rate, the city would have recorded roughly 2,500 murders, far surpassing the 629 in 1998.
But last year the number of murders dropped to eight, meaning the city will probably shed its unwanted murder capital designation when new statistics are released later this year. No one in Pine Bluff is certain, though, if last year's improvement is the start of a trend, particularly since the city has already recorded six homicides this year and remains plagued with stubborn social and economic problems.
Only in recent years has the city begun to seriously address its homicide rate, said the Rev. Jesse Turner, a local Baptist preacher. In 1997, a coalition of ministers started a "Respect for Life" campaign to educate young people about violence. Recently, federal officials designated Pine Bluff for the Justice Department's "Weed & Seed" antidrug program.
"We let so many people get killed and don't say enough about it," Mr. Turner said. "I think the outrage is just not there."
He added that "because guns are prevalent, the only way the young people know how to solve a problem is with a gun."
Stevan B. Dalrymple, the local prosecuting attorney, said guns were part of the culture in Pine Bluff and surrounding Jefferson County. One local school district cancels classes for the first day of deer hunting season.
Antique rifles and other hunting guns are often passed down for generations, and Mr. Dalrymple estimates that there are at least 100,000 guns in a county with a population of about 90,000.
He is skeptical that new gun laws and restrictions will make any difference in reducing homicides, particularly since he says criminals often steal weapons rather than buy them.
"I believe we have a law that covers every violation," he says, attributing the murder problem, in large part, to drugs, poverty and teenagers growing up without supervision. "The biggest problem here is societal."
The range of homicides in Pine Bluff is much like the rest of the country. Most arise from either domestic disputes or botched armed robberies. Often, Mr. Dalrymple says, the shootings involve "bad guys killing bad guys." But there also are innocents who die.
Lynda Carter's son Gabriel Walker, 19, was a sophomore track star at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, the oldest of four children, with dreams of running in the Olympics. But on Nov. 1, 1998, he was dancing at a party of about 300 people when someone opened fire through a window. He was shot in the head.
The authorities arrested a man and accused him of spraying the gunfire into the party after bouncers had ejected him for not paying a cover charge. A jury found the man not guilty.
Mrs. Carter, 45, lives about 80 miles southwest of Pine Bluff, and she has taught Spanish in a rural public high school for nine years. But now she says she may quit.
"The system is telling me my life and my son's life is worthless," she said. "I send this love out to the world and they send it back to me in a box. Let the world know what a great person violence has taken from amongst us."
Joye D. Cook, the liaison between the prosecutor's office and families of victims, said support groups for parents of murder victims were "hard to keep going" in Pine Bluff, though not for lack of eligible parents. Some parents expect a trial and a conviction to bring resolution and peace, though Ms. Cook said that rarely happened.
"Nobody ever gets over it," she said, "and nothing is ever enough."
Teresa and O. D. Brown Jr. watched as all five of the young men involved in the shooting of their son, Patrick, were convicted.
Mr. Brown is a retired junior high principal, and Mrs. Brown still teaches health at Pine Bluff High School, where Patrick was a star football player. She carries a picture of him from the day two years ago when he signed a scholarship for Grambling State University in Louisiana.
He had come home with his girlfriend for a weekend in June 1998. A high school friend called and asked him to go to a party, then called again and again until Patrick, who was 20, agreed to drop by. Prosecutors say people were gambling and drinking at the party and that Patrick stayed for less than five minutes. But on his way out he was attacked by robbers and shot in the chest.
"I just can't seem to shake it, and it doesn't seem real," said Mrs. Brown, 55.
Mrs. Brown does not know Mrs. Odom or Mrs. Carter, but all three of the women know each other's stories. They read about killings across the country every day now in the newspapers. They watch the murder reports on the news.
"I'm not the only one this is happening to," Mrs. Brown said. "It's happening to other mothers, other kids. It's happening to good kids."

HEADLINE: In Hunters' Havens, Gun Control Is Risk for Gore

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: AMBRIDGE, Pa., May 11

 BODY:
It has become conventional wisdom among Democratic strategists that the Million Mom March for gun control on Sunday will be good for Vice President Al Gore in his quest for the presidency. But the conventional wisdom does not apply here in Beaver County.
Nestled in the shadows of shuttered steel mills 20 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, Beaver County has been a Democratic bastion since the New Deal. It is also a haven for hunters, Second Amendment devotees and the National Rifle Association, Mr. Gore's sworn enemy. 
 So when Mr. Gore stumps for gun control, as he often does these days, many Democrats here, particularly men, squirm. To them, the issue is a divisive headache that drives their friends and neighbors into the arms of Mr. Gore's presumed Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a frequent critic of gun control.
"I get so frustrated when I hear Al Gore talk about gun control," said Jim Rooker, a 57-year-old former pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates who now owns a tavern in Beaver County and is active in the local Democratic Party. "There isn't any question that he'll lose votes here if he keeps it up."
For Mr. Gore, winning this fall will almost certainly require keeping places like Beaver County solidly in the Democratic column, political analysts say. But therein lies the risk of gun control: While the issue plays well among suburban women, it infuriates many men in places like western Pennsylvania. Mr. Gore already trails Mr. Bush among men by double-digit margins, recent polls show.
"To gun owners, he's already viewed as an extremist," said Representative Bart Stupak, a Democrat from Michigan who, for most of his five terms, has been an opponent of gun control. "If he wants to talk about safety measures, that's O.K. People see that as reasonable. If you talk about further layers, he'll lose voters in a minute. They're not comfortable with his position as it is."
But to the chagrin of Democrats like Mr. Stupak, Mr. Gore supports gun control proposals that go well beyond simple safety measures like trigger locks. He would require states to create photo licenses for buyers of new handguns. He would ban the cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials and limit handgun purchases to one a month. He supports lawsuits by counties and cities against gun makers. And he accuses Mr. Bush of being a pawn of the rifle association.
Mr. Bush, by contrast, contends that the federal government should enforce existing gun laws rather than enact new ones, a basic tenet of the N.R.A. As governor, he signed legislation that allows people to carry concealed weapons into churches, among other places, and that prohibits municipalities from directly suing gun makers. Recently, he suggested that he would also sign anti-lawsuit legislation as president.
 Mr. Bush announced yesterday that he would spend $1 million a year to provide free trigger locks for handgun owners in Texas and would push for a similar national initiative.
"Bush is in the safety zone on guns for Pennsylvania voters," said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Keystone Poll at Millersville University in Pennsylvania. "I think supporting lawsuits against manufacturers is problematic for Gore in Pennsylvania because it raises the prospect that guns could be outlawed."
What further complicates the issue for Mr. Gore is that there are many places like Beaver County in the necklace of northern states that Democratic strategists say he needs to win, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan. In recent visits to those states, he has tended to avoid mentioning his positions on gun control.
Mr. Gore and Bill Clinton won those states in 1992, when the economy dwarfed all other issues, and in 1996, when the race was a rout. But this year's contest is expected to be close, meaning gun control could emerge as a significant factor. And history has shown the N.R.A. to be better at mobilizing its voters than gun control proponents have been at energizing theirs.
Unlike Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush has said little on gun control except when pressed by reporters, apparently concerned that the issue poses risks for him, as well. Clearly, gun control is widely supported not only in Democratic cities but also many Republican suburbs. And it is popular in California, the largest state, and New Jersey, an important swing state.
But the greatest risk for Mr. Bush on gun control is among women. Most polls show that women, by significantly higher margins than men, favor gun control and distrust the N.R.A. The higher the income and education level, the more supportive women are of restrictions on guns.
"The arithmetic on guns works out in Gore's favor," says Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster. "The pro-gun vote is primarily made up of white men who vote Republican on a pretty routine basis. The voters who are more in play tend to be suburban women who vote Republican in some cases, but who get driven away from Republican candidates on the basis of gun control."
Even in western Pennsylvania, there are clear sex differences on gun control. In recent interviews in the Pittsburgh area, more women than men said they supported gun control and had low opinions of the N.R.A. Those sex differences cut across party lines.
Sandra Miller describes herself as a lapsed Democrat who votes increasingly Republican. A resident of one of Pittsburgh's affluent suburbs, Ms. Miller dislikes Mr. Gore, calling him "a real politician who turns whichever way the wind blows."
But Ms. Miller, 56, who grew up in a Texas household surrounded by hunting rifles, thinks it is time to put tough restrictions on gun owners. "I don't want to take anyone's gun away, but that Second Amendment was written a long time ago," she said. The N.R.A., she added, "scares me."
"They are too powerful," she said. Asked if she might vote against a politician, including Mr. Bush, based solely on his gun control record, she said, "Yes."
It is because of women like Sandra Miller that Democratic strategists think the Million Mom March will be so useful for Mr. Gore. By emphasizing motherhood, the event will unite women from both parties behind the Democratic agenda without evoking partisan politics, the strategists say.
More important, gun control advocates say, the march will demonstrate that supporters of gun restrictions are becoming as powerful a political movement as the opponents. Mass shootings at Columbine and elsewhere, including two in the Pittsburgh area in the last two months, have changed that dynamic, gun control advocates assert.
"There are far more people who care about the issue today," said Joe Sudbay, political director for Handgun Control Inc., which advocates stronger regulations on firearms. "For the first time, people on our side are making it a voting issue."
The elections will test that theory, and western Pennsylvania is likely to be one of the proving grounds.
In rural Beaver County, even supporters of gun control speak reverently about Second Amendment protections of the right to bear arms. Representative Ron Klink, a four-term Pennsylvania Democrat who is running for Senate this year, has been consistently anti-gun control in Congress. State Representative Terry Van Horne, the Democrat who wants to replace him, has endorsed only modest gun-control measures, like mandatory trigger locks.
But even that position has caused Mr. Van Horne's Republican opponent, State Senator Melissa Hart, to assert that he is "out of the mainstream" on guns. Ms. Hart has been endorsed by the N.R.A., which views the district as an important opportunity to protect the Republicans' slim majority in the House.
"Gun rights and the Second Amendment are swing issues for voters in western Pennsylvania," said John Lee, director of legislative affairs for the Pennsylvania Rifle and Pistol Association, the N.R.A.'s state affiliate. "We're more 'no compromise' here."
There are, of course, some Democrats in Beaver County who support Mr. Gore's gun control positions and do not worry that the issue will drag him down. "The big issues are Medicare and Social Security," said Robert Standish, 61, a debt consultant and local Democratic activist.
Indeed, chances are good that Mr. Gore will carry Beaver County. But the question is whether he can win it with enough votes to offset Mr. Bush's gains in less Democratic districts. Gun control is likely to be a factor in determining that level of enthusiasm.
Take Dominic DeMarco, a 65-year-old retiree from the Beaver Falls area. Mr. DeMarco is a fan of President Clinton, and thinks Mr. Gore should be given the chance to continue current policies. But do not get him started on gun control.
"The government is to blame for not keeping criminals in prison," he says angrily. "The last thing we need are more gun control laws."

HEADLINE: Wall Street Shuns Invitation to Discuss Role in High-Rate Home Loans for Minorities

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Wall Street's role in the financing of abusive lenders was the theme of a public hearing that federal regulators held yesterday in the financial district, but none of the invited business speakers showed up.
"I think it was that nobody wants to defend it," said Andrew M. Cuomo, the federal secretary of housing and urban development, who presided at the session and commented later. Organizers said they had asked several financial institutions to send representatives. 
 Nearly 30 other witnesses did appear, however, and testified for several hours about the problems of what critics call "predatory" lenders, who single out minority borrowers with limited credit and offer loans with relatively high interest rates. The speakers included several borrowers, community group advocates, public officials, academics and representatives of the lending industry.
"We're in one of Wall Street's houses, but Wall Street's not here," said one witness, John Taylor of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, an advocacy group. The hearing was in the New York Mercantile Exchange at the World Financial Center.
The flourishing "subprime" home-equity market pushes loans to people with limited credit ratings, charging higher than average interest. Predatory lenders are a subset focusing on minority neighborhoods, and especially elderly homeowners, using deceptive tactics to pressure them into loans with exorbitant fees and interest that they cannot afford to repay. Borrowers often end up in bankruptcy or foreclosure.
Secretary Cuomo called the predatory lenders "bottom feeders," "con men" and "scam artists," but he gave the financial industry the benefit of the doubt. "I don't think that Wall Street investors are aware of the problem," he said. "I believe they would be as surprised by these revelations as anyone else, and once they are aware they will quickly distance themselves from it."
Critics call that view naive and say that Wall Street is well aware of the issue.
In April, Moody's Investors Service issued a report on the rising number of complaints about predatory lending but was generally reassuring to investors. "Predatory lending allegations, no matter how unseemly, will not affect most subprime mortgage securitizations," Moody's said.
Wall Street companies have come under increasing scrutiny because they underwrite subprime lenders, including the predatory ones, and resell their bundled loans, making fresh money available for them to issue more loans.
As an example, a speaker from the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, an advocacy group, asserted yesterday that Merrill Lynch -- which has offices in the World Financial Center near the hearing site -- was the nation's third-largest underwriter of subprime lenders. The critics also said that the company itself made 800 home loans in the New York area in 1998, of which only five were for black or Hispanic borrowers. A company representative did not return phone calls left last night requesting comment.
A few dozen protesters from Acorn planned to march to Merrill Lynch, seeking to meet with company officials. Acorn's leaders said that state park police officers and city police officers had threatened to arrest demonstrators and tried to bar them from the hearing and from Merrill Lynch.
A confrontation was averted, however, when a Merrill Lynch representative approached the protesters and talked about arranging a meeting.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is also holding hearings in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago and Los Angeles in an effort to press for changes. Speakers yesterday called for more statistical reports to track the problem, self-policing in the industry, public education, more enforcement of existing rules and the adoption of new regulations. They have an ally in Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York.
Mr. Schumer, who was at the meeting, called the victims' testimony "heartbreaking." Gail Floyd of Philadelphia described how her request for a $1,500 loan to convert her oil furnace to gas snowballed into a refinancing of two old mortgages totaling $25,000 at 9.5 and 11 percent, plus $7,000 in fees and points, for a new $33,000 loan at 12 percent. Anther woman, Marie Morency of Brooklyn, said she was about to lose her home in foreclosure.

HEADLINE: Seeing Two Microsofts, Not One

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Richard Gilbert (Op-Ed, May 10) contrasts the government regulation of the heirs to AT&T's businesses with the prospect of a clean division of Microsoft into two virtually unregulated companies.
In fact, the government's plan would create a mare's nest of rules -- everything from a requirement that the new Microsoft operating system company continue to sell obsolete versions of Windows at a fixed price, to a remarkable provision obliging the new company to discount "light" versions of Windows in proportion to the amount of code the computer maker chooses to rip out. Meanwhile, government functionaries would be called upon to decide imponderables like whether additions to Windows were "middle-ware" and thus must come with an easy means of removal. 
 Mr. Gilbert also asserts that the breakup would accelerate innovation in software. Yet the involuntary division of a productive company that is organized around flexible project lines is bound to slow technological change within the two Microsofts for many years.

HEADLINE: U.N. CHIEF FAULTS RELUCTANCE OF U.S. TO HELP IN AFRICA

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 12

 BODY:
Faced with wars on several fronts in Africa, Secretary General Kofi Annan said today that the United Nations' peacekeeping efforts needed the kind of military help that the United States was now unwilling to provide.
Instead, the United States is offering only to transport troops from other countries to confront the most immediate crisis in Sierra Leone, he said, but the United Nations is turning down those offers because the cost of using American planes is more than the organization can afford. 
 Given the reluctance of the Clinton administration to put American troops on the ground abroad, Mr. Annan suggested that there was little room for the United States in what he describes as a new style of peacekeeping for a different age. America's reluctance to take on any more than a limited role has become evident since the Sierra Leone crisis began two weeks ago.
"Washington will not put an American officer on the ground," he said.
Mr. Annan would like to send in sophisticated and experienced military teams to assess problems or set up missions. But the United States prefers to see missions in Sierra Leone carried out by other countries, many of them with poorly equipped, lesser trained troops.
In an interview today that ranged over the multiplying crises in Africa, where heavy fighting erupted today between Ethiopia and Eritrea, Mr. Annan said it was "disheartening" to confront a continent with calamities from end to end, and consider what this says about African leadership.
Only a few years ago, a new generation of leaders -- among them Isaias Afwerki in Eritrea, Meles Zenawi in Ethiopia, Yoweri Museveni in Uganda and Paul Kagame in Rwanda -- seemed to offer hope of a turnaround in African politics and an end to constant civil conflict.
"When everyone started talking about the African renaissance, President Clinton used to cite these four," he said. All four are now embroiled in war, the Eritreans and Ethiopians on the Horn of Africa, and Rwanda and Uganda in Congo.
In southern Africa, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe risks civil strife to bolster his one-party state by igniting racial tensions, threatening the economic health of all of Southern Africa.
Mr. Annan, a Ghanaian, rejects the view that someone who makes himself president for life reflects traditional African tribal culture, where democracy can flourish within an essentially closed system.
"That's not true," he said. "Take my own society. In West Africa, we have the Ashanti kings. But the king can be removed for wrongdoing, incompetence or lack of leadership. It's not as if they are anointed by God and can stay there forever."
His prescription for Africa is stronger nongovernmental institutions to curb the excesses of leaders who stay too long, and a market economy to reduce corruption that follows from government control of essential goods and services.
"Corruption is built on everything being in the hands of the government," he said. "So for everything you want, you need a permit. The person who gives you the permit wants a bribe. The person who's going to make the appointment for you wants a bribe. And so on."
Senseless wars take terrible tolls, he said, adding that he recently told the leaders of Eritrea and Ethiopia that they would pay a price in international assistance. "I had to tell them that as someone who was raising money for the famine, I was having difficulties," he said, "and donors were asking: How do you expect us to put up money when they are using their money for war?"
Given the disaster facing the United Nations in Sierra Leone, Mr. Annan focused most of his remarks today on that country, where hundreds of United Nations peacekeepers are being held hostage.
He spoke of the lessons the organization is learning there about how to be better prepared for an era of messier wars and freelance warlords impervious to the international pressures that once helped rein in renegade governments.
"The nature of wars has changed and the dangers are also higher," said Mr. Annan, who was head of peacekeeping at the United Nations before becoming secretary general. "In the past one was dealing with international wars and established states with government leaders who understood international pressures -- to whom you can say, 'If you don't do this, we will cut off your weapons, we won't trade with you, nobody will recognize you.'
"What does this mean to Sankoh?" he continued, referring to the rebel leader in Sierra Leone, Foday Sankoh. "What does it mean to these warlords? Some may not even be warlords but national leaders who are so insular, whose vision is so narrow, that in their concerns about their own power and survival, the interests of their people don't count."
To confront such conflicts, Mr. Annan said, the United Nations will need a bank of rapid-reaction contingents on call from countries with well-trained and well-equipped troops, ready to move fast to pave the way for peacekeeping forces. The Security Council will have to give those forces stronger combat authority and better equipment "because you never know what's going to happen on the ground."
The organization will also need better intelligence and more intelligence sharing, he said. "We were completely sleeping on the issue of intelligence," he said, referring to Sierra Leone and its rebels.
The world also needs an international criminal court for dealing with leaders like Mr. Sankoh, whose rebel force is known for hacking off civilians' limbs to keep people intimidated and who has disrupted peacekeeping in Sierra Leone, he said.
"It is a real missing link in all our efforts to contain these criminals who act with impunity in our world today," he said of such a court, now being created. The United States, almost alone in the industrial world, opposes it because Washington cannot extract ironclad guarantees from other nations that no American will ever face trial there.
When Washington offers support equipment, like planes to fly in other countries' troops, "the U.S. offers are usually three times the commercial rate," he said. Last week, the Clinton administration said it would provide transportation, but only for a fee, and that has proved too high for the United Nations budget.
Mr. Annan said, for instance, that the United Nations would have had to spend as much as $17 million to $21 million for an American military airlift of Bangladeshi soldiers to Sierra Leone. The organization has now chartered a commercial airliner for $6 million to do the same job.
Although an American transport plane carried ammunition from Jordan to Sierra Leone today, the 300 Jordanian paratroopers who also arrived there today flew on a commercial charter, a Russian plane. Indian troops will be transported free on a Canadian government Airbus.
American officials acknowledged today that to date their assistance had been limited to flying in one load of Jordanian ammunition, but the State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said the United States was still discussing other ways to help. He mentioned American discussions with Nigeria over the equipping and transporting of its soldiers.
Mr. Annan stressed the importance of having well-trained and skillful commanders of peacekeeping operations and acknowledged that the situation in Sierra Leone has not been perfect. A commander has to coordinate disparate units from several countries, and diplomacy is needed, he said.
The commander in Sierra Leone, Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley of India, has come under criticism from Zambia, whose troops have been taken hostage in large numbers, and from other contingents.
"There's tension in the command," Mr. Annan said. "Everybody who's met Jetley say that he's a very good officer. But some of the commanders complain that he just gives orders, implying that there is no consultation."
In Sierra Leone, as in other conflicts in Africa, diamonds and other lucrative resources not only supply warlords but also have the potential to corrupt the peacekeeping operation, particularly when poor soldiers see the chance of sudden wealth.
"I have to make sure that my own peacekeepers down the line don't get caught in this situation," he said. "So when a whole Guinean battalion on its way to Sierra Leone -- 900 men with A.P.C.'s -- said they were disarmed, you wonder," he said referring to armored personnel carriers. "Did they sell them?"

Clinton Notifies Congress
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS
WASHINGTON, May 12
 President Clinton notified Congressional leaders tonight that a small number of American military personnel could run the risk of becoming embroiled in hostilities in Sierra Leone, Congressional and other government officials said.
The notice referred to a group of 7 to 10 Americans who are aboard British naval vessels moving into position off Freetown, the officials said. The Americans, believed to be fighter pilots, have been taking part in an exchange program with the British Navy. It has sent several ships to Sierra Leone to reinforce United Nations peacekeepers and calm a confused situation, the officials said.
In addition, American military personnel were flying a C-17 plane loaded with ammunition into Sierra Leone to assist Jordanian peacekeepers, Mr. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said today.
Earlier today, Mr. Boucher said there had been no discussion in the administration of deploying combat troops to the West African nation.
Officials said the notification referred to the War Powers Act. Mr. Clinton stopped short of invoking the act, which would require him to bring home troops within 90 days unless Congress authorized their continued role overseas.
"They're being very, very careful," said a senior House Republican aide. "It's not like they're sending in the 82nd Airborne."

HEADLINE: The Last of Levy's Competitors for Chancellor Drop Out

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS 

 BODY:
And then there was one, and his name is Harold O. Levy.
Four months after the Board of Education began a nationwide search for a new schools chancellor, the incumbent's last two competitors dropped out yesterday, just one day before they were to be interviewed by the Board of Education. 
 The latest development suggests that -- barring any scandal, disaster or unexpected maneuver -- Mr. Levy, the interim chancellor, is all but certain to be kept on, probably as a permanent chancellor, although the votes have not been counted yet.
The swing vote, that of Irving S. Hamer Jr., the Manhattan member of the board, has been promised to Mr. Levy, aides to C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said yesterday. Last week, Mr. Hamer put himself forward as a surprise challenger to Mr. Levy, but he dropped out this week when it became clear that he could not win.
Dr. Hamer's vote would give Mr. Levy the same 4-to-3 majority of the Board of Education that he had when he was appointed interim chancellor on Jan. 9.
It was yet another twist in what has been one of the city's most unpredictable searches for a schools chancellor. When Mr. Levy was first appointed, the board president insisted that there was almost no chance he would become permanent chancellor.
"It is a little strange," the president, William C. Thompson Jr., conceded yesterday. "I don't think anybody could have predicted the job Harold has done. What started to occur around the city was a consensus. 'Why don't you keep him?' became the No. 1 question around town."
It remained unclear yesterday whether Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's two appointees to the board and the Staten Island delegate, who opposed Mr. Levy the first time around, would make the vote unanimous in the interest of consensus and compromise. The vote is scheduled to take place on Wednesday.
One Giuliani appointee, Ninfa Segarra, said yesterday that they had not yet had time to meet and discuss the latest developments. On the other hand, she did not rule out voting for Mr. Levy. "I need to discuss with him how he would handle the next step," she said of the mayor.
Ms. Segarra complained that the board had ended up with what she called no choice, but the lament was more whimsical than bitter.
"This is like 10 little Indians," she said. "We've got one little Indian left." Then she added: "See? I have some culture," an allusion to Mr. Levy's efforts to raise the cultural consciousness of his board by sending them poetry.
Board members said they had not yet discussed how long a contract Mr. Levy might be offered, though one said that two years -- about what Rudy Crew got when he arrived in October 1995 -- sounded about right.
Mr. Levy, who is on leave from his job as a Citigroup executive, would not comment. Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for Mr. Giuliani, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
Just last Thursday, the board announced the names of five candidates for chancellor who had been recruited by headhunters in a national search. But by Tuesday, three of them had withdrawn: Richard T. LaPointe, president of Laubach Literacy in Syracuse; Anthony J. Trujillo, an official at the National Center on Education and the Economy; and Joan P. Kowal, former superintendent of schools in Palm Beach County, Fla.
Interviews were scheduled for today with Jerome Clark, the president of Bowie State University in Maryland, and James P. Gallagher, the president of Philadelphia University. But yesterday they, too, withdrew, said the board president. Mr. Gallagher issued a written statement saying he was flattered to have been considered.
"It was a little bit of a domino effect," said Mr. Thompson, the board president. "They said, 'Gee, if they're withdrawing, why are we staying in?' Finally, it was, 'I don't want to be the only one.' "
The chancellor's post became vacant in December, when Mr. Crew was ousted by a divided board. Board members complained that he had lost his commitment to the job after months of sparring with Mr. Giuliani over school vouchers, summer school and the management of the school system. The mayor's delegates joined with the Staten Island and Queens appointees to oust Dr. Crew.
Mr. Levy emerged almost overnight as a dark horse candidate for the interim post. He had no formal credentials in education, although he had served on the State Board of Regents and on a commission looking at the city's crumbling school buildings.
After his interim appointment, Mr. Levy made a quick impression as a strong manager -- ironically, with the kind of business approach that Mr. Giuliani had advocated -- but the mayor remained somewhat cool to him.
Mr. Thompson said that the board ultimately spent a bit less than the $165,000 it had budgeted for the search, but that he did not know how much less.

 THE YAMATO DYNASTY
 The Secret History of Japan's Imperial Family.
 By Sterling Seagrave and Peggy Seagrave.
 Illustrated. 394 pp. New York:
 Broadway Books. $27.50. 
 For fans of vast right-wing conspiracies, "The Yamato Dynasty: The Secret History of Japan's Imperial Family" posits a doozy: Over the last 150 years, four Japanese emperors, and assorted princes and consorts, have been so fiendishly wrapped around the fingers of a cabal of sinister power brokers, financiers and politicians as to make the Chrysanthemum Throne little more than a front for greed, corruption and fraud. That, say Sterling and Peggy Seagrave, the authors of "Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China," helps explain why Japan is today one of the "world's richest and most deceitful governments."
Having reported on Japan for a decade, I was surprised by how much I had missed. For instance, despite long hours spent listening to Japanese leaders dilate on the intricacies of rice subsidies or the dangers of importing aluminum baseball bats from the United States, I learned for the first time that "many Japanese politicians . . . still state flatly that Japan did not lose the war." Here is another of the Seagraves' news flashes: Japan's economy was not really shattered by World War II -- its secret agents had socked away enough fascist gold to underwrite a buoyant rise from the ashes.
Behind this long-running imperial racket is a crew of Dick Tracy-like characters, including the former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, who "resembled a salamander," and the "prune-faced" former prime minister Noboru Takeshita. (It's true that Kishi, whom I had occasion to interview, was no Clark Gable, and did have a complicated past, but I confess that I totally missed the face thing with Takeshita and, on the whole, found Japanese pols no slipperier, say, than Al Gore among the Buddhist nuns.)
But predation has its price. By the late 1980's, the Seagraves tell us, "so much black money was in circulation from war loot" that Japan's speculative bubble eventually burst. And to think that some of us were bamboozled into believing that it was Economics 101 at work -- too many surplus dollars from exports channeled into too few Cartier wristwatches, overpriced Impressionist paintings and gaudy Tokyo condos.
The book's real blockbuster, though, is the story of how Emperor Hirohito escaped prosecution as a war criminal. By 1945, we're told, Japan owed American lenders huge amounts of money. Enter former President Herbert Hoover. A well-known Quaker, he conspired with "a network of Quakers and near-Quakers" within Japan's elite to preserve the royal family. Hoover and his allies worked to ensure, first, that Japan did not go Communist; second, that its financial gnomes stayed in place; and, third, that Wall Street got its money back.
Meanwhile, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the ruler of occupied Japan, was suborning key witnesses in the Tokyo war crimes trials to keep Hirohito out of the dock, in hopes that one day Hoover and his Republican friends would help him occupy the White House. In saving the throne, the Seagraves argue, MacArthur deviously undermined real democratic reforms in Japan and became a "perfect patsy" for the men who had ruled Japan before the war and would continue to do so secretly after the war. (Well, not all that secretly -- several generations of foreign reporters stationed in Tokyo knew where to find them.)
The occupation had its share of dark corners and high-handed behavior, to be sure. MacArthur did flirt with the presidency, even if his towering self-regard made him an unlikely patsy for anybody. He did use the throne, but as a tool for what the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian John W. Dower calls his "almost messianic zeal" for democratizing Japan. Even though Communist advances in China and Korea forced a reversal of early policies, postwar Japan emerged, as Dower points out, "a vastly freer and more egalitarian nation" than before the war.
One needs to be open to new theories, of course, but big conspiracy theories require big proof, and the Seagraves fail to provide it. Despite copious footnotes, key sources are weak, or missing altogether. The authors tell us, for example, that "documents show" that MacArthur and Hoover knew about a "massive recovery" of Japanese war loot and, further, that large deposits of gold bullion were placed in accounts bearing their names -- yet I could find no further details in their book about these pivotal papers.
But then you can't be too careful. "Old ways die hard in Japan," we learn, "where it can still cost your life to speak aloud." My opinionated 77-year-old mother-in-law in Tokyo would find that one almost as rich as the idea that "older generations of Japanese still believe that if they look directly into an emperor's face, they will be blinded."
Yet even a book that presents a darkly cartoonish view of modern Japan contains elements of truth. The Seagraves are right to say we should not remember Emperor Hirohito as simply the charming old gent who met Mickey Mouse on a 1975 trip to Disneyland and overlook his role in a war that ravaged Asia in his name. But you have to wonder if it really helps drive the point home to sum up Hirohito's long, roller-coaster reign by likening it to "the kingdom of Mickey -- his only true rival."
 
Let Me Say This
We are here now but soon
we will not be here.
There are pigeons asleep in the sunlight
on the roof of the station house in Greenlawn;
there is an elderly woman on a bench
looking up from a crossword puzzle.
And on the train a girl cuts the curls
on a doll and talks to it
with the whimsical authority
of a mother of the inanimate
or the invisible, the way the woman
I used to meet in the restroom
in Penn Station was always fussing
and baby talking into a carriage
that, except for a few cans
and some garbage, was empty.

 The Consolations
 of Philosophy
 By Alain de Botton.
 Illustrated. 265 pp. New York:
 Pantheon Books. $22.95. 
 On a plane over the Atlantic a few years ago Alain de Botton looked down at a postcard of "The Death of Socrates," by Jacques-Louis David, and, as he describes it, had a life-changing experience. Socrates' "independence of mind was a revelation and an incitement," he writes; it seemed "to offer an invitation to take on a task at once profound and laughable: to become wise through philosophy."
"If the postcard struck me so forcefully," he had noted, "it was perhaps because the behavior it depicted contrasted so sharply with my own. In conversations, my priority was to be liked, rather than to speak the truth. A desire to please led me to laugh at modest jokes like a parent on the opening night of a school play. With strangers, I adopted the servile manner of a concierge greeting wealthy clients in a hotel -- salival enthusiasm born of a morbid, indiscriminate desire for affection. I did not publicly doubt ideas to which the majority was committed. I sought the approval of figures of authority and after encounters with them, worried at length whether they had thought me acceptable."
"The Consolations of Philosophy" supposedly issues from an existential change of heart. My problem as a reader is that the book has persuaded me that the conversion story, though charming, isn't true. There is no love of truth in this book, and thus no real change of character could have led to its production.
There is a need for someone to bring that joyful activity of mind we call philosophy to the wider reading public. And de Botton, the author of "How Proust Can Change Your Life," writes with verve. Academic philosophy in the United States has virtually abandoned the attempt to speak to the culture at large, but philosophy professors are doing something of incredible importance: they are trying to get things right. That is the thread that connects them back to Socrates -- even if they are not willing to follow him into the marketplace -- and that is the thread that "The Consolations of Philosophy" cuts.
Indeed, de Botton's Socrates, for all the huffing and puffing about his greatness, is indistinguishable from a second-rate sophist. He is merely someone who questioned common-sense conventions and got people angry. How could anyone think that a world-historical figure could emerge by taking such a small step from timid conformity? The picture not only flattens Socrates, it trivializes the concerns of the populace. The ancient Greeks, de Botton says, "would have been confounded and angered to be asked exactly why they sacrificed cocks to Asclepius or why men needed to kill to be virtuous." In fact, the Greeks had plenty to say about why sacrifice was important and why it was important to achieve glory in war. Generalizing to today, de Botton continues, "If we refrain from questioning the status quo, it is -- aside from the weather and the size of our cities -- primarily because we associate what is popular with what is right."
But who, then, are we? In Britain, where de Botton lives part of the time, the election of Margaret Thatcher brought about a giant transformation of social, economic and educational structure. There is very little that one could continue to call "the status quo." The United States has seen huge shifts in social and economic opportunities for women, changes in race relations; the Internet may be ushering in an economic revolution. Above all, we are a country that allows social transformations -- desegregation, legalized abortion, uncoerced confessions -- to issue from lawsuits. The social institution of the lawsuit is the embodiment of the idea that we, as a culture, do not simply associate what is popular with what is right. Obviously, in a democracy there is always danger of the intolerance of the group, and mass media and consumer culture do instill pressures to conform. But de Botton's "we" is not us; it is the cliche of a herd.
Still, according to de Botton, if you want to leave the herd, it is easy enough: "Anyone with a curious and well-ordered mind who seeks to evaluate a common-sense belief can start a conversation with a friend in a city street and, by following a Socratic method, may arrive at one or two groundbreaking ideas in under half an hour." Only two? The account of the Socratic method is of such stunning banality -- find a common-sense generalization and then find a counterexample, make a new generalization and continue the process -- that it would seem the only reason every one of us hasn't become another Socrates is that the activity is too boring to endure. Socrates clearly did look for counterexamples, but there is no understanding of the context. Nor is there any understanding of how Alcibiades, in Plato's "Symposium," could call Socrates unique in all of human existence.
If there is no philosophy here, there is no consolation to be had from philosophy. As a consolation for feelings of intellectual inadequacy, de Botton raises Montaigne's question -- What good did their great erudition do for Varro and Aristotle? Did it free them from human ills?" -- and sets out to help us "understand why the two men could have been both so erudite and so unhappy." He then criticizes an institution of higher learning: "It excelled at imparting learning but failed entirely at imparting wisdom -- repeating at an institutional level the errors that had marred the personal lives of Varro and Aristotle." The only problem is that there isn't a shred of evidence that Aristotle was an unhappy man. De Botton has moved from a rhetorical question to an established fact in one sentence.
Indeed, all the evidence we do have suggests that Aristotle took himself to have lived a profoundly happy life. In the "Nicomachean Ethics," he argues that the best and happiest human life is one that is oriented toward contemplation. Obviously, he may have had problems we don't know about, but that's just it: we don't know about them. In effect, de Botton invites us to take comfort in the thought that a person of profound mind and astounding intellectual accomplishment wasn't really happy -- in spite of the fact that all available evidence suggests he was really happy and it was precisely his intellectual activity that contributed to his happiness. This is not a consolation of philosophy, it is the consolation of envy and ressentiment.
In general, de Botton's consolations are worthy of Polonius. In consolation for not having enough money, we are told that "expensive things cannot bring us remarkable joy" (while ignoring the crucial question of whether they might contribute to our joy). As a consolation for frustration: "The wise will learn to identify what is necessary and follow it at once, rather than exhaust themselves in protest." At the beginning of a chapter on sexual inadequacy, we are told that it is problematic "to have both a body and a mind, for the former stands in almost monstrous contrast to the latter's dignity and intelligence." But at the end of the chapter we are given this consolation: "True wisdom must involve an accommodation with our baser selves, it must adopt a modest view about the role that intelligence and high culture can play in any life and accept the urgent and at times deeply unedifying demands of our mortal frame." And so on.
IN the chapter on sexual inadequacy, de Botton tells us of a friend of Montaigne's who "had grown impotent after failing to achieve the unwavering rational command over his penis that he assumed to be an indispensable feature of normal manhood." It is difficult to believe that Montaigne's friend was worried about unwavering rational command. The perennial problem of the penis is precisely that because it is not under a man's rational control, it is taken to reveal his manly desire. That's why a limp penis has often been taken to provide independent evidence against official protestations of masculine desire. Still: "The solution was to redraw the portrait; it was by accepting a loss of command over the penis as a harmless possibility in lovemaking that one could pre-empt its occurrence -- as the stricken man eventually discovered." Good advice at any time, no doubt; excellent advice in a 16th-century French village. But, let's face it, this isn't philosophy. What a relief.

 WORKING-CLASS NEW YORK
 Life and Labor
 Since World War II.
 By Joshua B. Freeman.
 Illustrated. 409 pp. New York:
 The New Press. $35. 
 New Yorkers consider their city an exceptional place, unique in the nation as a center of commerce, culture, finance and entertainment. (Make it in New York and you can make it anywhere.) Rarely, however, has someone claimed that the city's working people are in fact the key to its exceptional stature. This is precisely what Joshua B. Freeman asserts. In "Working-Class New York," Freeman, an associate professor of history at Queens College, argues that the strength of organized labor and its continued political influence in the three decades following World War II were largely responsible for the rise of a social democratic politics that made the city special. The presence of organized labor, Freeman says, even gave the city its "cultural greatness."
"Working-Class New York" actually comprises two books. The most compelling story explores efforts on the part of organized working people, in close connection with liberal politicians of both parties, to provide affordable housing, health insurance and decent jobs as the city's economy underwent a formidable transformation in the postwar decades. While little that is dramatically new is revealed here, Freeman's account is an important reminder that social policy is not made simply by political elites.
Far more problematic, however, is the book's other story, Freeman's attempt to understand the meaning of these efforts. This story's villain is an elitist "hegemonic liberalism" that used means both fair but more often foul to crush the social democratic impulse. Two stand out particularly. The anti-Communism of the 1950's, he argues, deprived the labor movement of effective leaders, leaving the unions with little alternative but to gravitate toward "the liberal center." Twenty years later, the city's fiscal crisis allowed financial leaders to implement "a general corporatist approach" that reduced city jobs and services.
The book's heroes, in turn (this really is a "friends and enemies" type of book), are the Communist and independent leftists who envisioned a labor movement "winning and wielding social power." It's a heady tale, to be sure, but one that is fundamentally flawed.
It would have been valuable, given its importance to his central argument, for Freeman to distinguish between liberalism and social democratic politics. Similarly, one looks in vain for an explanation of Freeman's praise for Franklin Roosevelt while dismissing liberalism, the New Deal's reigning political philosophy.
In addition, Freeman is often unrealistic. To argue that the revival of the Labor Day parade in 1981 (following a 13-year hiatus), together with the unsuccessful mayoral candidacy of State Assemblyman Frank Barbaro, a son of the old left, "testified to the continuing institutional strength of New York unionism" suggests a fatal penchant for symbolism over political substance. But this is part of the book's pattern: the only unmitigated good noted in organized labor comes from those with ties to a left heritage. That may be comforting to some, but it is profoundly misleading.
Despite its title, actual working people are not the subject of this book. While Freeman explores in loving detail the positions of a few left-led unions with a combined membership of less than 40,000, he blithely dismisses Catholic anti-Communist demonstrations, some as large as 50,000, as simply a manipulative creation of New York's Roman Catholic archbishop, Cardinal Francis Spellman. In an analysis of a city that was 50 percent Catholic, with a large, multiethnic and organized Catholic working class, this strains credibility. A sustained examination of the political and social activities of working people in neighborhoods like Bensonhurst and South Brooklyn, Harlem, the Lower East Side and elsewhere would have revealed men and women whose own, often militant, commitments frequently diverged from the leaders and causes Freeman so romanticizes. That story still awaits its historian.

A Weak Euro Means Bargains for U.S. Visitors

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
BANKERS are wringing their hands; tour operators are applauding.
European countries are enjoying a decade-long boom in American tourism, and the continued weakness of the new European currency, the euro, is expected to attract even more Americans. 
 "It's not as though the moment there's a strong dollar people start packing their suitcases," said Giuliano Corsi, general manager of the elegant Hotel Danieli in Venice. "But the strong dollar will certainly tempt people to come to Europe."
At the luxurious Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in Munich, capacity is already 80 to 85 percent, some of which is due to American visitors, and Gerhard Bosse, the front office manager, said, "People are shopping and buying more, whether its simple souvenirs or expensive items, even china."
Of course, not everyone is so bullish.
"I'm not sure whether a tourist from Burbank is going to come here just because the dollar is a little stronger," said an official at Euro Disney, which runs Disneyland Paris. Yet Disney reported that park revenue had risen considerably in the first three months of this year, though it did not say how much of that was from Americans.
Sixteen months ago, when the euro was introduced, the European travel industry feared the new currency might be so strong it would frighten visitors away. The opposite has happened.
In January 1999, 11 countries -- Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland, Finland and Portugal -- adopted the euro. Since then, any transaction not involving cash may be done in euros. Thus, banks offer euro accounts and credit cards, and travel agencies like Thomas Cook and American Express euro-denominated traveler's checks; European stores, like the Galeries Lafayette in Paris, advertise prominently that they will accept them.
But even if you pay for your Italian fashions or French meals in francs or lire, you are still using euros, since the national currencies, like French francs and Italian lire, are now mere denominations of the euro. At the end of next year, national bills and coins will disappear entirely. Government mints and private contractors across Europe are busy printing 13 billion euro banknotes and minting 56 billion coins.
Since its introduction, the euro has lost value continuously against other currencies. In fact, the euro has plummeted so far that while an American buying euros a year ago got 0.85 of a euro for every dollar, by May 5, he was getting 1.12. In local currencies, that meant 7.3 French francs, instead of 5.5; 2.19 German marks instead of 1.65, and 2,172 Italian lire rather than 1,645.
Walter Leu, director of the Brussels-based European Travel Commission, says his organization expects 12 million American tourists this year, compared with 11.6 million last year, continuing a string of annual increases that began in 1993. The increases are due partly, he says, not only to the "astonishing fact that a cup of coffee costs 50 percent less than only a few years ago," but also to America's booming economy. In the last decade, he said, the pool of American travelers that European tourism relies on most -- those with average annual earnings exceeding $75,000 a year -- has doubled, to 30 million.
Peter Shackleford, regional director for Europe at the World Tourism Organization in Madrid, recalls how before the euro was introduced, European tour operators and hotel owners feared that a powerful euro would deflect tourists to cheaper destinations, like Turkey and Morocco. The present mix of weak euro, low European inflation and a strong American economy, he said, "is a tour operator's dream."
Now, airlines and cruise ship operators are cashing in. The number of nonstop flights from American cities to Europe is growing. In March, Air France began flying from Philadelphia to Paris; this month, Northwest Airlines added flights from Detroit to Rome and Milan.
This year, Crystal Cruises of Los Angeles added several more destinations, bringing its European cruises to 17, and lengthened the season to mid-November, from late September; Holland America increased its ships to three, from one. Cruise Lines International Association, an industry group, says 1.2 million people will cruise in Europe this year, double the number five years ago.
Gavin Tollman, president and chief executive of Trafalgar Tours in New York, said the powerful American economy and strong dollar painted "a jewel picture." Trafalgar travelers to Europe will rise 30 percent this year over 1999, he said.
To be sure, not everyone in Europe is exulting. In Britain, which decided against adopting the euro, the pound has gained in value, making Britain more expensive for travelers from the Continent. This month, the British Tourist Authority revised tourism growth estimates down, from 5 percent to 3 percent. Britain risks losing visitors to France and Italy, it warned, where prices, measured in dollars, are as much as 20 percent lower than a year ago.

New York's Bargain Hotels, With Help From the Web

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
I SPENT six weeks this spring bottom-fishing for affordable hotel rooms in Manhattan, a project I approached with trepidation. As any New Yorker knows, living space is at an all-time premium in the city. To make matters worse, New York has far fewer hotel rooms, for its size, than Los Angeles, San Francisco or Miami, so the laws of supply and demand operate with a bloodless precision that would warm the heart of Adam Smith. Setting myself an upper limit of $125, without taxes, for a night's stay ($25 more than I would budget for hotels in any other U.S. city), I envisioned bleak nights in sour, minuscule rooms with peeling wallpaper, ventilated only by air shafts.
The good news is that there was not a single moment during my overnight stays in five New York hotels when I wondered if the man in the next room was Ray Milland having a lost weekend. Instead, I rubbed elbows with young London tourists, Argentine tango dancers, large French families and touring jazz musicians. There have always been tourists who come to New York City with more style than money, and I discovered that an increasing number of hotels are aiming their sights at this market, offering no-frills rooms with a touch of panache -- and sometimes more. 
 The bad news is that "no frills" means exactly that. In only one of the hotels I visited did a bellhop appear and offer to take my bags. Room service consisted of a takeout Chinese or coffee shop menu next to the Gideon Bible in the drawer of the nightstand. While most of the hotels had tourism brochures in the lobby, I saw a concierge in only one (the Wolcott), and only part time.
Finally, there's this discouraging reality: in New York City, "cheap" means at least $99 a night. Below that price, you can pretty well forget about getting a room with a private bath. (For purposes of this article, I limited my search to rooms-with-bathrooms, and to hotels with at least 40 rooms, rather than hostels or small B & B's.) And to stay within that $99-to-$125 price range I had to do some advance work, because only one of the hotels I stayed at (the Cosmopolitan) offered a room to walk-in customers for under $125. To get my price elsewhere I checked guidebooks, consulted my local grapevine and walked the streets to familiarize myself with as many budget Manhattan hotels as possible. Then I went on line to search for discounted rates at my target hotels on several reservation Websites that specialize in cut rate deals. This usually got me a 20 to 25 percent off the rates.
I booked my $125 room at the On the Ave hotel through one of these services, www.travelscape.com. It works like this: you go to the Web page, and fill out a form that asks what city you want to stay in and on what dates, and after a minute or two up pops a list of hotels available for those nights and the prices, which range from luxury hotels to cheapies. You choose a hotel, enter your name and credit card number, and pay Travelscape in advance; the company send you a confirmation by e-mail. The reservation can generally be changed up to 72 hours in advance for a $10 fee; after that point you forfeit the first night's charge.
When I arrived at the front desk of On the Ave, on Broadway and 77th Street on the Upper West Side, I handed the clerk a printout of the Travelscape e-mail confirmation and she handed me the plastic computerized keycard to Room 916. Out of curiosity, I asked about the rack rate, or published price.
Her answer was vague. Hoteliers are reluctant to quote a fixed room rate, because they vary depending on the season, the week and even the time of day. "Well, it depends," she said. "Today it would be $165."
My delight at having secured almost a 25 percent discount was doubled when I walked into a large, bright, high-ceilinged room with a big window overlooking Broadway. The tiny lobby had prepared me for a spartan cubicle. Instead, the space was not only big by Manhattan standards -- about 20 by 16 feet -- but it actually bore traces of an interior designer's hand. A queen bed appeared to float on a Japanese-type wooden platform with a wooden canopy. Inside the bathroom gleamed with a futuristic matte-chrome sink and mirror -- a knockoff of Philippe Starck, yes, but well-executed. The bathroom was stocked with designer shampoos and soap, and two fluffy bathrobes. There was a gleaming, glass-enclosed shower and tub (the shower had a pulsing head).
It was a terrific room for the price, and the skeptic in me began to search for the catch. There were a few, though none was serious. On the Ave, which is being developed by a group specializing in stylish budget hotels (it also owns the Habitat, on West 57th Street) is still under construction. The floor I stayed on was complete, but workers renovating the floors below were constantly using the hotel's two small elevators. (There are three now.) Still, I couldn't hear any noise through the sturdy walls of the prewar building or the heavy, double-hung windows.
The other catch was location. The Upper West Side, a safe, pleasant residential neighborhood, is somewhat removed from the New York pizazz of trendy restaurants, night life, and theater. (The nearest subway is the often crowded IRT No. 1 local, two blocks away.) But if you're visiting New York to go to uptown museums and attend Lincoln Center, On the Ave is a perfect home base. And it is perfectly positioned for a classic New York breakfast -- I rolled out of bed in the morning and walked three blocks up Broadway for a takeout coffee and bagel from the cafe at Zabar's, the food mecca.
I next searched for an inexpensive hotel downtown. A friend had recently stayed at the Pioneer Hotel, a budget place on Broome Street and the Bowery, at the edge of SoHo, and pronounced it "O.K. for the price." I phoned to reserve a room ($99 with a private bath), and went over to check it out. Up at the top of a long narrow flight of stairs, I turned left to find a barred window covered with bulletproof Plexiglas and adorned with a hand-lettered sign: "Welcome to your home in New York." Three Swiss women with backpacks stood in front of the partition, vociferously complaining about their room and asking to switch.
Thus forewarned, I asked if I could see the room I'd be staying in before checking in. Reluctantly, the clerk complied and sent his assistant with a key -- a regular one, not a computerized card. When she opened a thin wooden door that was almost directly off the busy lobby, and I saw the dark grim room with a saggy double bed, I decided to look elsewhere.
Trendy and desirable, the downtown neighborhoods of SoHo, NoLIta (North of Little Italy) and TriBeCa have fewer hotels than other parts of Manhattan -- and almost none I could afford. I had high hopes for the Holiday Inn Downtown, on Lafayette Street, but it has been recently renovated, and rates start around $250. Only the Cosmopolitan, a recently redone hotel at the corner of West Broadway and Chambers Street, fell within my limits, at $109 a night for a single.
Room 423, smallish, dark and poorly ventilated (it faced an air shaft), fullfilled my deepest Motel 6 fantasies. The modern bathroom had cheap fixtures and industrial-grade packets of soap, scratchy towels and a noisy fan that rumbled on every time I switched on the light. Decor consisted of a big Toulouse-Lautrec print on one wall and a bizarre, upsetting canvas containing a magenta inkblot on another. Corridor noise seeped easily and often (the hotel was full) through the paper-thin walls. On the plus side, the double bed was comfy, the room was clean, and in the morning I treated myself to a full breakfast ($9.95) at the cafe of the trendy Bouley Bakery nearby, which served the best blueberry muffin I've ever tasted.
Giving up on downtown, I turned my attention to midtown, in the 30's and 40's. This area is ground zero for the new wave of budget hotels, since it contains many sturdy old places that fell into disrepair in the 70's and 80's. Because of New York's economic and tourism boom, these once-grandes dames are regaining some luster. Walking into the giddy, ornate plaster-and-marble ornamented lobby of the Beaux-Arts Wolcott Hotel, on 31st Street near Fifth Avenue, I fooled myself for an instant, thinking that I'd returned to the elegant New York of 1910, although the Japanese punksters and Russian tourists pushing enormous wheeled suitcases up to the bare-bones modern reception desk spoiled that fantasy somewhat.
AN excruciatingly slow elevator ride took me up to my corner room, 1203, which measured a quite decent size, about 14 by 10 feet, and had two windows. I dropped my bag in the enormous walk-in closet, while clucking disapprovingly at the forgettable decor: a ho-hum dark green bedspread over the queen bed, mahogany faux-Federalist furniture, and striped wallpaper. Then I happened to glance out one of the windows and saw that it had a fantastic front-row view of the Empire State Building, just three blocks away.
The bathroom was newly renovated, with a shower and a tiny bathtub. Amenities included an in-room computerized safe (the door lock was also modern and computerized), and a small fitness room on the mezzanine with two treadmills, a step machine and stationery bike. By mak ing my reservation through www .hoteldiscounts.com, a service of the Hotel Reservations Network, I'd gotten this spacious, clean room with a view for the same cost as the dingy closet at the Pioneer: $99.
Like the Wolcott, the New Yorker Ramada Plaza is another fabulous vintage building in the 30's (Eighth Avenue between 34th and 35th, near Madison Square Garden) with a dodgy recent past. In the 80's, this Art Deco skyscraper with more than 1,000 rooms served as the headquarters and dormitory for the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church. The hotel has been extensively renovated over the past two years, became a Ramada a few months ago and is trying to attract budget conventioneers (it's not far from the Javits Center) and tour groups.
The lobby bustled with hundreds of guests, and a long waiting line cordoned off by little ropes made it feel like an airport. But the receptionist was extremely friendly, and handed me a computer key to a room, 3210, only eight floors from the top. Figuring I was sure to get a decent view, I became quite giddy when I pulled open the curtains to behold a panorama that extended from Madison Square Garden to the Empire State Building to the Chrysler Building. It was the kind of view that makes you want to phone your 50 closest friends and throw a cocktail party.
Clean, reasonably sized, and with a lovely vintage tiled prewar bathroom, my room at the New Yorker was a super deal at the price I was able to snag that weeknight through www.hotres.com: $99 a night. The hotel also has a fitness room with rowing machines, weights, bicycles and stairclimbers. Drawbacks: some nighttime street noise (the windows could use more insulation), the crowded-airport feel of the lobby, and the less-than-charming neighborhood. In the morning I scurried to Starbucks across the street for breakfast, grabbed coffee and a muffin and went back to my room: Eighth Avenue looks a lot better from 32 stories above.
Friends had recommended the Mayfair New York Hotel on West 49th Street in the theater district as a charming, European-flavored small hotel. The cheapest price quote I could get on the phone was $145. However, as I was trolling the Hotel Reservations Network site, the Mayfair came up on the screen -- for $119.95 a night. I quickly reserved a single.
The Mayfair was indeed cute. The reservations desk shares space with a small, clubby bar-restaurant (the Garrick) in a wood-paneled lobby hung with vintage photographs of famous actors. The restaurant is busy right before theater time, and one must negotiate through the tables and waiters to reach the elevator, which I found somewhat inconvenient.
My room, 510, was typical of what I'd encountered traveling on the cheap in London -- the size of a breadbox, but brightened by a cheerful pink calico bedspread and intelligent use of space. A wall mirror compensated somewhat for the window facing an air shaft, and I liked the custom-built armoire, tucked barely inches from the foot of the double bed, which housed a TV and rollaway desk (a modem outlet was within reach). The bathroom was new, with gleaming white and black tile and a big, well-lighted mirror.
Still, it was a bit claustrophobic, a place made for sleeping, not hanging out. So I stowed my gear in the tiny closet and walked back out to 49th Street, where theater marquees beckoned enticingly from every corner. I realized that by staying so cheaply in New York, I could afford to buy a ticket for any of them. Maybe even two.
 
The bottom line
I spent between $99 and $125 a night, plus tax of 13.25 percent and $2 a night, in five New York hotels during March and April. To get these prices, which are generally lower than the hotels' "rack" or published rates, I chose hotels whose prices were already at the bottom of the range for the Manhattan market. I then booked most of my stays through one of several hotel discount services on the Internet: www
.travelscape.com (Travelscape
.com); www.hoteldiscounts.com (a service of Hotel Reservations Network), or www.hotres.com (HotRes
.com).
I found the HotRes software the most useful; its display shows you graphically a block of 12 days around the date selected and the rates for each day. However, it offered a smaller range of budget hotels from which to choose than the others.
There is no surcharge for using the Internet services, but you must to pay for the room in advance with a credit card number (either sent over the Internet or phoned in to a representative of the company). Pay attention to fees for cancellations and changes; depending on the service and when the change is made, they range from $10 to one night's rate.
Rack rates, quoted in early May, are for one or two people in a room unless noted otherwise.
On the Ave Hotel, 2178 Broadway at 77th Street, (212) 362-1100, fax (212) 787-9521. I booked this room for $125 through Travelscape.com in March. Current rack rate, $145.
Wolcott Hotel, 4 West 31st Street, (212) 268-2900, fax (212) 563-0096. My room in March cost $99, booked through Hotel Reservations Network. Rack rate, $140.
Cosmopolitan Hotel, 95 West Broadway at Chambers Street; (212) 566-1900, fax (212) 566-6909. I booked my room ($109) directly with the hotel, since I did not find it on any of the Internet services.
New Yorker Ramada Plaza, 481 Eighth Avenue, (212) 971-0101, fax (212) 629-5636. I booked my room through HotRes.com in April for $99. Rack rate, $179 single, $199 double.
Mayfair New York Hotel, 242 West 49th Street; (212) 586-0300, fax (212) 307-5226. My room in March cost $119.95 through Hotel Reservations Network. Rack rate, $150. DAISANN McLANE

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 5-14-00;
Me, My Brand And I

BYLINE: By Rob Walker; Rob Walker is a contributing writer for Money and Slate.

 BODY:
About a year and a half ago, a colleague of mine whom I'll call Steve Theory walked into my office, shut the door behind him and asked my advice about some recent job offers. Without a hint of sarcasm, he explained, "I just want to do what's best for the brand Steve Theory."
I sort of nodded and tried to keep a straight face. "The brand Steve Theory," I muttered, once he left. "Who thinks about life in those terms? Sheesh." 
 But in fact, Steve was right and I was wrong. Practically everybody seems to think of life in those terms these days, whether they state it so plainly or not. In the 1980's, Laurie Anderson had a funny line about how she figured out how to live life. Basically, she said, just look at what the government does and, you know, scale it down to size. That, of course, was back when people paid attention to the government. Now nobody cares about the government; we care about hot companies. And when we try to figure out how to advance our careers and live our lives, we figure out what hot companies do and scale it down to size. Ours is the age of personal hype.
There is something, I think, about the Internet -- with its microtargeted discussion groups and virtual celebrities who are famous to 15 people -- that ramps up the possibilities of personal hype. The padded resume is probably as old as the resume itself, but with one's own Web site, it is easy to showcase not just your padded resume but also complimentary blurbs from friends and colleagues, thoughtful sound bites, photographs of you with friends, etc. These little self-marketing monuments exist now by the thousands. Two years ago, it was rare for a serious author to have such a site, but now even New Yorker writers have them, successfully creating viral marketing campaigns that were not possible in, say, J.D. Salinger's time. Of course, the strategy isn't limited to published authors. I recently stumbled across a Web site that advised chat-room denizens on how to establish their personal on-screen brand. For starters: "Develop a catch phrase."
It is all part of the "Brand Called You," a sort of life-as-company philosophy articulated by the management guru Tom Peters -- and long since swallowed whole by the career-advice wing of the business press. Since the concept's debut, two big things have changed. First, the shrill self-promotion needed for a company to become "hot" has been ratcheted up to an astonishing degree. It is no longer enough for a company simply to go about the business of whatever its business might be. Companies market themselves not just to consumers but also to venture capitalists, to potential employees, to Wall Street analysts, to the trade press. An initial public offering is a branding event. The potential must, at all times, be astronomically fantastic. The Wall Street Journal recently quoted one unnamed analyst: "Companies that tell the biggest stories can raise the most money and then can use that money to turn that story into reality."
The second change, not surprisingly, is that ordinary people are more enthralled with companies than ever. And so, more recently, Peters has published a book called "The Brand You 50: 50 Ways to Transform Yourself From an 'Employee' Into a Brand That Shouts Distinction, Commitment and Passion!" The book is an extraordinary collection of screamed exhortations, with typography that Marshall McLuhan would find distracting and punctuation that would embarrass Tom Wolfe. "Everybody is a package! . . . You have a personality. (Ask your close friends!) . . . Packaging is Expressed Personality." "Work with what you've got! (Damn it!) (And make it special.) (Damn it!)" "Build a Web site that wows. (Period.)" "You are your own P.R. 'agency."'
You must, in other words, manage your career as though you are a growth stock. What is your potential? Is it limitless? Can you have a huge impact? Will you, in effect, change everything? If not, you are a stodgy Old Economy human being, and nobody wants to buy in.
Self-marketing makes perfect sense in a world where -- like corporations -- we've learned to think in the short term. I have lost track of Steve Theory, but I have spoken to any number of young people working in, say, the high-tech tech field who view their careers in 18-month blocks: after that, a given job has done all it can for one's brand. Those who have been at it longer seek out arrangements with several employers, consulting here, working a project there, serving as part-time interim vice president of engineering someplace else -- resembling, in effect, little morphing conglomerates. Just as it is fashionable for a company to respond to change by constantly redefining its mission, these people are not so much building a resume as forever cranking out the next annual report. Even Bill Clinton's Letterman-esque video for the Washington press corps served mostly to rebrand him as America's entertaining first chum, a gambit all the more successful when compared with the lackluster marketing battle to succeed him.
Perhaps Tom Peters would conclude: Hey, that's O.K. We can all stand out! Obviously, that's not true -- it is a familiar joke, like the universally above-average students of Lake Wobegon. But the easier it is for some of us to think this way, the sooner it will be necessary for all of us to. So I am working on my new personal home page. I hope it will have a huge impact.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Updating (and Retouching) an Old Passion Play

BYLINE: By JAMES SHAPIRO; James Shapiro teaches English and comparative literature at Columbia University. His "Oberammergau: The Troubling Story of the World's Most Famous Passion Play" has just been published by Pantheon Books.

 BODY:
FROM the opening performance next Sunday until Oct. 8, half a million playgoers will make their way to Oberammergau, Germany, to witness a dramatic re-enactment of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. The villagers of Oberammergau, in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, have been staging their six-hour Passion play roughly once a decade since 1634. It is a Roman Catholic play about Jews, performed in German before a largely Protestant audience, most of whom will be American or British. The newly refurbished Passion playhouse holds 4,700 people, and 112 performances have been scheduled. The play (with the exception of some returns from travel agents) is sold out.
The Oberammergau Passion Play is as controversial as it is popular. For the last four decades, the villagers have been divided over questions ranging from "how Jewish was Jesus and who killed him?" to "should Protestants and married women be allowed to act in the play?" 
 More recently, winds of reform have swept through Oberammergau, and this millennial production of the Passion play will be markedly different from those staged in previous decades. For the first time, Jesus will be referred to as rabbi, not Christ. The high priests who oppose him will no longer wear horned hats. Pilate's famous words "ecce homo" ("behold the man," when he presented Jesus to the populace before the crucifixion) are gone: part of an effort to shift responsibility for the death of Jesus to the Romans. And not only will Protestants and married women have roles, but so will a longtime Muslim resident of the town.
Nearly half of Oberammergau's 5,300 inhabitants will take part in the production. Eligibility is limited to those born in Oberammergau, those who have lived there for 20 years or those who marry villagers (which cuts the probationary period in half). The desire to be part of the play is so strong that mortality rates dip in the years immediately preceding and rise in those following the play season: the aged and the infirm tend to hold on for one more chance to be involved.
Almost every Oberammergauer first acts in the play as a child. At a ceremony in September, in which the villagers reaffirmed their ancestral vow to stage the play, veteran Passion players were honored for a lifetime of participation that for some stretched back to 1910. As one former director put it: "The play is a part of us. It controls the rhythms of our life, like it or not."
Fourteen months ago, the villagers began to let their hair -- and the men their beards -- grow long, the better to resemble the first-century Jews they portray; no makeup, wigs or artificial lighting are used. The actors are all amateurs and rehearse in the evenings after a day at work. The rehearsal period lasts for eight months, just enough time for the directors to transform 2,000 woodcarvers, schoolchildren, clerks, farmers, housewives and even the mayor into Passion players.
Tradition holds that the play had its origins in a vow taken in 1633, during the Thirty Years' War, when plague ravaged the countryside. Desperate village leaders made a vow: if those still alive were spared, the townspeople would perform a Passion play in perpetuity. According to tradition, not another soul in Oberammergau perished from the plague. While no contemporary evidence survives to confirm the story, many in Oberammergau consider their performance in the play the fulfillment of the vow.
It was not until the mid-19th century that the devout and the curious began making the pilgrimage to Oberammergau in large numbers. In 1830, roughly 13,000 spectators came to see the play. By 1860, after the "discovery" of Oberammergau, that number had grown to 100,000. Once the railway from Munich finally reached Oberammergau in 1900 -- the town is about 60 miles southwest of the city -- the number of playgoers doubled, then doubled again. Many have come to consider Oberammergau a Christian Shangri-La, an isolated village whose simple piety was not yet corrupted by the materialism that increasingly defined life in the West.
In keeping with that image, the villagers have repeatedly rejected lucrative offers to take their play abroad or to allow it to be filmed, arguing that it would violate the spirit of their vow -- and, skeptics note, cut down on the profits made from housing and feeding visitors and selling them locally produced woodcarvings. Many villagers count on earning money from the play as performers and hosts. Most foreign visitors will have purchased a package that includes both a ticket ($50 to $75) and overnight room and board in an Oberammergau home or small hotel. There is even an Oberammergau Web site: passionsspiele2000.de.
Since Oberammergau started charging admission to the play 200 years ago, the villagers have struggled to reconcile the demands of religious expression with financial gain. At an early rehearsal in September, nervous laughter broke out when Jesus (after destroying the tables of the merchants in the temple) says his first words in the play: "What do I see here? Is this God's house or a marketplace?" The parallels between ancient Jerusalem and modern Oberammergau were not lost on those in the room.
There are other sensitive issues as well. Bitterness lingers over a failed attempt in the 1970's to replace the current script (which dates from 1860) with a more spectacular and poetic one last used in 1760. The villagers have also been divided over who should appear in their play and in what capacity. Until this year, only Catholics were assigned major roles. After court battles inaugurated a decade ago by feminists in the village, women who are married, divorced or over 35 -- a group traditionally excluded from participation -- will take part in the play.
In a village that is celebrated for its piety but that in the last 20 years has witnessed a drop in churchgoing, especially among the young, the very purpose of the Passion play has been called into question. Should it be seen primarily as a fulfillment of a religious vow and a way of strengthening the faith of actors and spectators alike? Or is it an extraordinary act of communal theater that ensures the economic well-being of those who play host to hundreds of thousands of visitors?
When the villagers had to elect a new director four years ago, they were essentially choosing between those alternatives. Dr. Rudolf Zwink, a dentist by profession and a popular figure who had played Jesus in the 1980 production and in the special 350th-year performances in 1984, was the traditionalists' candidate. He was opposed by Christian Stuckl, a native son in his late 30's who was already a professional director with experience at Munich's prestigious Kammerspiele theater and an international reputation. Mr. Stuckl wanted to reinvigorate a play that, from an artistic standpoint, had begun to lose its vitality.
By a narrow margin, the villagers turned their play over to Mr. Stuckl. But as a counterweight, they also invited the Catholic Church to have a voice in decisions about the text, the staging and the casting of major roles. When Cardinal Friedrich Wetter of Munich came to Oberammergau in July and formally received the official script, he made clear to Mr. Stuckl his views on the special nature of Passion playing: "The person imitating Jesus doesn't act the part, he has to be Jesus. To act it is impossible."
Mr. Stuckl replied: "I am a director of theater in Munich and Brussels. And what I do is theater." The deeper conflict over the nature of Passion playing remains unresolved.
For more than a century, meanwhile, outsiders have condemned the play as anti-Semitic. But the criticisms have intensified since the 1960's. The script's depiction of Jews as hateful and vengeful Christ-killers had been given new emphasis when 19th-century revisers eliminated Lucifer and a host of devils who had previously been Jesus' main adversaries. As a play that traces its roots to medieval morality drama evolved into a more naturalistic revenge play, the motive and role of the Jewish leaders in seeking Jesus' death gradually expanded. One of the most electrifying moments in productions since 1860 has been the crowd scene in which, following the Gospel of Matthew, several hundred frenzied Jews demand of Pilate that Barabbas be set free and Jesus put to death, crying out what has come to be called the "blood curse": "His blood be upon us and upon our children!"
It has not helped defenders of tradition that Hitler, who attended the 1930 version as well as the 1934 tricentennial production (where he was warmly received by a cast that included a high percentage of Nazis), declared: "It is vital that the Passion play be continued at Oberammergau; for never has the menace of Jewry been so convincingly portrayed as in this presentation of what happened in the times of the Romans. There, one sees in Pontius Pilate a Roman racially and intellectually so superior that he stands out like a firm, clean rock in the middle of the whole muck and mire of Jewry."
Protests against the play's representation of Jews gained momentum after 1965, following the Second Vatican Council's declaration that Jews should no longer be held collectively and perpetually responsible for the death of Jesus. Suddenly, the village that a few years earlier had been granted a canonical mission by the church was accused of anti-Semitism by both Jewish and Catholic critics. The confused villagers deeply resented these accusations and resisted outside calls for change.
In 1966, Phil Baum, an executive at the American Jewish Congress, lined up a group of intellectuals to protest the play, including Arthur Miller, Lionel Trilling, Stanley Kunitz, Leonard Bernstein, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Elie Wiesel, George Steiner, Gunter Grass, Heinrich Boll and Paul Celan. While not effective enough to hurt financially, the ensuing boycott of the 1970 production stung, and the villagers of Oberammergau began to take outside criticism seriously. This didn't mean that change was readily forthcoming.
Leading Jewish critics -- such as Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee and Rabbi Leon Klenicki of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith -- working alongside prominent Catholic scholars have for the last two decades negotiated with the villagers over such issues as the costuming of the Jewish leaders, the Jewishness of Jesus, the role of the Romans in putting Jesus to death and the use of Hebrew scripture to foreshadow events in the life of Jesus. No issue has been more divisive than the retention of the "blood curse" from the Gospel of Matthew, which the villagers claim has scriptural authority and critics argue has fomented hatred of Jews.
Otto Huber, a schoolteacher who is the script director and has represented the village in its dialogue with Jewish organizations, has worked to address these concerns. This year, for the first time since 1750, the "blood curse" will not be heard. The Jewishness of Jesus and his disciples will be strongly emphasized: they now wear skullcaps and prayer shawls; Jesus even offers a blessing in Hebrew. Mr. Stuckl and Mr. Huber are aware that some of these changes are anachronistic, but they serve to remind audiences that Jesus was Jewish.
THE interfaith distance traveled between the 1990 and 2000 productions can best be measured by the prefaces to the respective printed texts. Ten years ago, the preface contained a spirited defense of the inclusion of the "blood curse." This year, it makes clear that "the Passion play is in no way meant to assign collective guilt," and acknowledges that "this Passion play, too, contributed in various ways to preparing the soil which eventually yielded the terrible harvest of the extermination of the Jews."
Rabbi Rudin and Rabbi Klenicki, who will travel to Oberammergau to see the play, are reserving judgment. Rabbi Klenicki is not optimistic. "Despite the many changes in the script," he said, "I fear that it will still be a source of anti-Judaism."
Rabbi Rudin, though pleased by the revisions, also remains skeptical: "I'm not a playwright, but I think it's possible to tell the Passion story in a way that is spiritually satisfying and totally free of anti-Jewish images and teachings. Despite positive changes, they are still dealing with a flawed script."
Because the text has now been so extensively revised, the traditional score, first composed in 1811 by Rochus Dedler, has had to be revised as well. Dedler's music is sacrosanct in the village, and the unenviable task of providing additions to it has fallen to Markus Zwink, the Passion play conductor. Mr. Huber, the script director, who supplied Mr. Zwink with new lyrics, said he had been approached after rehearsals by singers who spoke of "how consoling they find Zwink's music." In Oberammergau this is very high praise.
A core of young village actors whom Mr. Stuckl has been working with since the late 1980's have filled many of the leading roles in this year's production, including that of Jesus (shared by Martin Norz and Anton Burkhart) and most of the apostles. The Jewish money-changers and high priests arrayed against them will be played by veteran actors, including many in the conservative opposition. The conflict in the Passion play between the Jewish high priests and the followers of Jesus will thus be mirrored in the intergenerational tensions within the cast.
From 1922 until 1990, the same set designs, originally introduced by the director Johann Lang, were mandated. Here, especially, the theological alterations have forced change, and many of the old costumes and props, some in use for centuries, have been retired. The stage designer, Stefan Hageneier, has been given a relatively free hand, and the result is not unlike seeing an Old Master painting restored to its original brilliant colors. Like Mr. Stuckl, the 27-year-old Mr. Hageneier has already developed an international reputation, working with artists like the set and costume designer Jurgen Rose and the avant-garde stage director and designer Robert Wilson, but chose to turn down other professional opportunities to devote himself to Oberammergau's play, explaining, "When you are born in the village, it is in your blood."
When Mr. Stuckl, Mr. Huber and Mr. Hageneier were discussing candidates to design a work of art to complement the Passion play, the name of Mr. Wilson, who frequently works in Germany, came up. With the approval of the village council, the American-born designer was invited to produce a large-scale Stations of the Cross in a field adjoining the playhouse. The council members, who were unfamiliar with Mr. Wilson's style, balked when they saw his designs and voted to rescind the invitation. After further debate, the commission went forward by a single vote; Oberammergau was not eager to get into a confrontation with the art world.
Mr. Wilson's "14 Stations: A Light and Sound Installation," which covers an area half the size of a football field, will run concurrently with the Passion play. The design is cathedral-like, with 12 temporary outdoor buildings, or chapels (six on each side), forming a nave and framed by the portal and apse of the first and last structures. Mr. Wilson, who acknowledged that "it is the first time I have created an installation or artwork related to a devotional subject," said he had "approached it in the same way in which I write or direct a theatrical play or an opera." Village leaders remain anxious that the work of an artist better known for "Einstein on the Beach" than for religious art will alienate visitors who bring to Oberammergau traditional expectations.
Mr. Wilson's "14 Stations" and the Passion play itself raise age-old questions in Oberammergau: should art cater to the expectations of audiences or challenge them? Can tradition and innovation be reconciled? Or, for that matter, profit and piety?

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
'Privatized' Doesn't Mean Perfect

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES; Diana B. Henriques, a financial writer at The Times, is the author, most recently, of "The White Sharks of Wall Street: Thomas Mellon Evans and the Original Corporate Raiders," a business history just published by Lisa Drew Books, an imprint of Scribners.

 BODY:
PRIVATIZATION has been one of the most durable buzzwords of the post-Reagan era.
In Europe, the term means selling off state-owned companies that provide private-sector services like telecommunications, oil production and air travel. But in America, it means letting private-sector companies provide traditionally public services like fire protection, prison supervision and road maintenance. 
 The domestic enthusiasts of privatization seem to believe that if you want a job done right, you must ask the private sector to do it. As a result, they ignore every modern example of private-sector incompetence from New Coke to "Ishtar." Is there much difference, after all, between the Defense Department paying $600 for an ordinary toilet seat and a private-sector corporation paying $600 a share for an Internet start-up with no assets, no profits and no plan for producing either?
Before they bubble over with giddy, rich-kid ideas like letting Federal Express take over the local post office, they should sit quietly in a corner and read Elliott D. Sclar's new book, "You Don't Always Get What You Pay For: The Economics of Privatization," a Century Foundation book just published by Cornell University Press ($25).
The author, described on the book jacket as "an economist by training," teaches urban planning at Columbia University. And his book offers a refreshing dose of common sense, even if the clammy jargon of organizational theory sometimes clouds his arguments.
Despite its subtitle, the book is really about the management of public services. With breathtaking clarity, Professor Sclar reminds us that today's privatization is nothing more than a fancy label for yesterday's public contracting, a gloriously rapacious activity made famous by the likes of Boss Tweed.
But as this book demonstrates with one delicious and well-documented example after another, you don't have to be corrupt to botch public contracting. Being dumb will do nicely. In fact, just being dogmatic and unimaginative will suffice.
When state highway maintenance in Massachusetts was gradually privatized, nobody accounted accurately for the state's continuing overhead expenses. Nor did contract language specifically anticipate what could go wrong; it did not, for example, say litter should be collected before, not after, the grass was mowed. As a result, the author notes, "there is no way of ever knowing whether or not privatization added value for the citizens of the Commonwealth."
HIS message is that privatization is not and never will be an adequate substitute for good public management. Whether you call them privatization plans or public contracts, they must be artfully drawn, intelligently monitored and then measured against accurate internal costs to ensure that the public's interest is protected in the pursuit of profit.
Consider the privatization experiment of the Metro-Dade Transit Agency in the 1980's. As Professor Sclar tells it, the agency hired a private company to run 10 of its bus routes, keeping 10 comparable routes in public operation as a control group.
But the contracts were silent about equipment maintenance. And when the experiment was abandoned after 18 months -- complaints had more than doubled on the routes with private-sector service, and ridership plummeted -- the new equipment that the agency provided to the bus contractor had been so poorly maintained that only 10 of 40 new buses could be kept in service.
Moreover, Professor Sclar points out that "most public contracting takes place in markets that range from no competition (monopoly) to minimal competition among very few firms (oligopoly)." In such markets, the invisible hand cannot be relied upon to protect the public's interests.
Even where markets are initially competitive, they may not be cheaper than a smart in-house operation. When Fort Lauderdale, Fla., considered privatizing its sewer pipe-laying in the early 1990's, contractors prepared bids as high as $130 a linear foot. But city engineers did a careful cost analysis (a rare occurrence among privatization practitioners, apparently) and found that the city's in-house cost could be cut to as low as $43 if the work were better organized. The contractors promptly cut their bids to $52 to $60 -- and still could not compete with a reorganized city service.
But the wisest lesson that Professor Sclar offers is that poorly managed privatization can collide with important public values.
Soon after Westchester County officials privatized parking services at the county medical center, parking fees rose beyond the reach of the families of poor patients. Only then did officials realize, he said, that there was more to running a hospital parking lot than making money.
Similarly, a mutual aid pact among several small-town fire departments in the county was tested to the breaking point when one of the towns hired a for-profit corporation to provide its fire protection service. The corporation kept smaller crews on each shift than the surrounding nonprofit fire companies did, increasing the extent to which the town relied on its neighbors for reinforcements. One day, the reinforcements did not show up, he said, and a $1 million private home burned to the ground, fortunately with no loss of life.
THIS wise and useful book is flawed by academic jargon -- someone should simply take pruning shears to the fifth chapter, "All in the System: Organizational Theories and Public Contracting." And there are a few very minor but unfortunate errors that will cheer the professor's critics -- the name of a Salomon Smith Barney predecessor, for example, is slightly garbled.
But on balance, his examples and his analysis -- and most of all, his plea for sensible attention to good public management techniques -- deserve wide notice. Even if politicians don't heed his advice, taxpayers should.

HEADLINE: Another Round of Questions Aimed at Pequots

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
SINCE 1984 the residents of Ledyard, North Stonington and Preston have watched gambling on the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal reservation grow from a bingo hall to a billion-dollar casino that attracts 40,000 people a day. Taxpayers in the three towns that border the casino have spent almost $1.3 million fighting the expansion of the reservation and the recognition of two other tribes in the region.
Now a $26 book has given them ammunition in the battle, town officials said. The book, by Jeff Benedict, a Massachusetts author, contends that the Mashantucket Pequots might really be an offshoot of a Rhode Island tribe and that the reservation was created illegally in 1983 when Congress granted the tribe official recognition and unwittingly approved a map that contained two and a half times as much land as it was supposed to, and expanded even those boundaries, pulling land out of the reach of local towns' taxes and land-use regulation. 
 Earlier this month, the towns called for a Congressional investigation and have asked for a meeting to discuss the matter with President Clinton when he attends the graduation ceremonies at the United States Coast Guard Academy in nearby New London this month.
Officials of the three towns have also requested that top Department of the Interior and Bureau of Indian Affairs officials attend a public meeting this Thursday evening at North Stonington High School to discuss the recognition process and the findings in the book. Mr. Benedict has said he will also attend.
Ledyard First Selectman Wesley J. Johnson Sr. said he expected the turnout at the meeting to be particularly heavy, given the nature of the information in the book, "Without Reservation" (Harper Collins, 2000).
"At the least, there should be a Congressional investigation," Mr. Johnson said. "I've said before, and it's even more relevant now, if they had the documentation to show that they were a tribe in 1983, they can show it again and settle everything very quickly. And if that land where the casino sits should not have been taken into trust, it would probably be very helpful to our economic development."
Officials at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, members of the region's Congressional delegation, and Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general, all said they could not comment on the findings in the book because they have not read it.
Marvin Fast, a spokesman for United States Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the senior member of the Connecticut delegation, said it was too early to decide on whether to act on the towns' request for a Congressional investigation.
"We haven't read the book," Mr. Fast said. "We obviously want to get a copy, read it, and talk to officials at the state level and within the delegation, before we decide what we should do."
Mashantucket tribal officials declined to be interviewed, but released a statement. "The tribe has reviewed a copy of the book and feels there are many inaccuracies and distortions of history in it. These allegations are nothing new, and represent a continuation of an anti-Indian agenda. The tribe remains unified against anyone trying to define us, and declines to dignify the book with any further comment at this time."
The book contends that the Mashantucket Pequots only formed a tribe in 1975 when organizers were presented with the opportunity to file a lawsuit over reservation land claims. The book also says they had not acted as a tribe or lived together as one for decades, a requirement of federal recognition. Those requirements became moot when Congress, in an attempt to settle the lawsuit, passed a bill with the state's blessing that gave the tribe federal recognition. Along with that, the book says, the tribe also got the right to have the reservation exempt from regulatory oversight by Connecticut, which paved the way for gambling.
Mr. Benedict says the state didn't realize what it was giving up and that lawyers for the tribe were surprised that Connecticut agreed to the regulatory request so easily. In 1992, about eight years after President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law, the tribe opened the Foxwoods casino.
Regardless of whether the book prompts any changes at the Mashantucket reservation, officials of the towns said they believed it will change the nature of the Native American recognition process for the four tribes seeking federal status: the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots and Eastern Pequots in North Stonington, the Golden Hill Paugussetts in Trumbull, and the Schaghticoke Tribal Nation in Kent.
"It shows that it is prudent for the towns to look very closely at the recognition process, to make sure that all the procedures are followed, and to make sure we get to see all the documentation," Mr. Johnson said. "It gives us some more issues to look at, and see where they lead us. I'm not a lawyer, but I think this raises some interesting questions."
Allegations that the Mashantuckets are not a real Indian tribe have been around for years. But town officials contend that the research and documentation by Mr. Benedict provide the argument with considerable credibility.
Mr. Benedict, who grew up in Waterford, said he had just finished a book on the National Football League and was on a trip back from Florida in May 1998, and was thinking about the 600-member tribe that had started the Foxwoods casino. During all his time in the region, he never knew the tribe existed, yet in a matter of a few years it had sprung into national prominence.
In early June of that year, he and his wife, Lydia, drove to his grandparents' house in the Niantic section of East Lyme. She went to the beach, while he made what he thought would be a quick trip to the library before joining her.
"I never made it to the beach," Mr. Benedict said. "I was at the library until it closed, and when I got home I had a huge pile of material. I told my wife, 'there's a book here. I don't know what the book is, but there is definitely a book here.'
"For me the most important element was the statute passed in 1983 and its genesis," Mr. Benedict said. "If there is a so-called smoking gun in this case, I figured it would have to be in that statute, so that's where I went to work, and I spent months and months investigating that statute."
In his book he details how, with the help of a lawyer from the Maine Indian Legal Services, Mashantucket Tribal Chairman Richard A. (Skip) Hayward filed aboriginal land claims against almost 800 acres in Ledyard. When residents realized they could not sell or borrow money against their property while the liens were in place, they appealed to their congressmen for help. United States Representative Sam Gejdenson and then-United States Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. got the bill passed that officially recognized the tribe and allocated money for it to purchase land for a reservation. The text of the bill refers to a reservation of up to 800 acres; the map submitted separately totals 2,000 acres.
Later, as the tribe grew rich on casino profits, it began to add land beyond even those boundaries, which led to extensive court battles over whether it could annex nonreservation land and put it into "trust status," where the federal government holds title to the property, which puts it beyond local rules.
Mr. Benedict also contends that his research showed the last Native American living on the land, Mr. Hayward's grandmother, Elizabeth George, might not even have been a Mashantucket, but rather a Narragansett Indian. In the early years of this century there were few rules governing who could live on a reservation, he noted. He dismisses the tribe's criticism of his book as inaccurate.
"I'm waiting for them to pull out the sources to prove that," he said. "My sources are all listed in the back of the book for anyone to check. I couldn't have done that if I didn't have credible sources," Mr. Benedict said. He notes in his epilogue that Congress recognized the tribe, and Congress can in effect revoke that recognition.
Mr. Benedict does not address in his book how the findings were overlooked by lawyers for the towns, by members of Congress, and by the media for so many years, but Mr. Johnson, the Ledyard first selectman, said he thinks it was just habit.
"When I moved here in 1976, the tribe was never really an issue," he said. "Everyone knew we had a reservation, and there were Indians living on it. Then, when the land claims were raised, the whole thing was resolved in Washington, so it never became a big issue here until afterwards."
Preston First Selectman Robert M. Congdon said for many years local people who questioned the genealogy of the Mashantucket tribe were called racists trying to deny Native Americans their heritage, so the towns have always been on the defensive.
"I think the burden of proof is on the tribe to prove it's not factual, by either suing the author for making false claims, or at least coming out with information to refute what he has said," Mr. Congdon said.
"Traffic in our town has gone from 6,000 cars a day along the roads leading to the casino, to 28,000 cars a day," he said. "Property values have come down 25 or 30 percent in some cases. Emergency services have gone from 200 calls a year to 1,000 calls a year, and there is no increase in property taxes that you'd get with a normal business."
No matter what the outcome of an investigation, Mr. Johnson said he expects Foxwoods is here to stay.
"Would you expect the state to close it down and throw 13,000 people out of work and give up a guaranteed $100 million a year in revenues?" he asked. "I would think they would have to give serious consideration to how it could be kept open. I'm sure the lawyers would be very busy for a long time figuring that out, as well as the legislators and the regulators."
For the town officials, the issue now is whether the book might provide a sort of blueprint for blocking the plans of two other tribes that have won preliminary approval for their recognition petition, the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots and the Eastern Pequots. Both groups have said they are looking for land to build casinos in southeastern Connecticut.
Mr. Congdon said he was astonished to learn that rather than tracing history back to colonial times, the bureau has effectively said that members must only be able to trace their ancestry back to someone living on the reservation at the time of the 1900 census.
The bureau said, in essence, "if someone was living on a reservation in 1900, I don't care if they're Polish, they're Indian now," Mr. Congdon said. "That could lead to hundreds of different tribes being recognized. Was that the intent of Congress? We certainly don't think so."
Town officials also said they have only received about 25 percent of the thousands of pages of documents that outline the genealogy and other factors that are considered when granting federal recognition to a tribe.
"To start the 180-day review process before everyone has all the documentation is like telling people, 'O.K., I want you to all go out and play baseball, but I'm not going to give you a ball or bat,' " said Nicholas H. Mullane, the first selectman of North Stonington. "If they won't even show us how they reached this decision, it's surely not going to be a fair process."
Nedra Darling, a Bureau of Indian Affairs spokeswoman, said those two tribes appear to have met the seven criteria for recognition, which include a requirement that there be a continuous organization from first contact with Europeans, and a tribal government. She acknowledged that the bureau has a backlog that prevents it from getting much of the information out to the towns that they have requested, but it is a matter of clerical under staffing, not collusion.
Schaghticoke Chief Richard L. Velkey said the key is not so much requiring the Bureau of Indian Affairs to go slower on its reviews, but rather providing it with the staff it needs to do the reviews properly. The Schaghticokes have been on a list of tribes ready for a final review for three years, and it has been told it will take another 10 to 12 years to get through it. Even if the bureau staff budget was quintupled, it would take more than a decade to clear out the backlog of 150 tribes seeking recognition, he said.
"The pace that they've set, it'll take 115 years to get a decision in all those cases," Mr. Velkey said. "I don't see how the process could slow down much more than it is, because it hasn't moved at all in four years."
But he agreed that town officials should demand that the bureau stick to its established requirements.
"Ever since casino gambling started, everyone wants to be an Indian," Mr. Velkey said. "You should have to meet all seven criteria, it shouldn't take so long that it becomes a prison sentence. We wholeheartedly agree with the towns."
Mr. Mullane said Mr. Benedict's book underscores how the Bureau of Indian Affairs wields tremendous power over the fate of local towns.
"The recognition process was supposed to help poor Indian tribes win federal aid," Mr. Mullane said. "But it's turning into a scheme for people to get a casino and make a lot of money. Jeff Benedict has shown that somebody has perpetuated a massive fraud."
The three towns had formed an association, the Coalition for Fair Tribal and Trust Acquisition Policies, that has just won the support of the Connecticut Council of Small Towns. Mr. Congdon said the book is making people aware of what is involved when a Native American tribe is recognized.
"If they get recognition, they're going to make land claims somewhere in the region -- maybe Groton Long Point, maybe Waterford or Mystic, wherever. They're going to put liens on land titles and claim they are aboriginal lands, and people will not be able to sell their houses until the case is resolved," Mr. Congdon said. "This is not a problem most towns have faced, but the book is waking a lot of people up to what can happen."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Lambertville, N.J.;
Not-So-Urban Renewal for a River Town

BYLINE: By JULIA LAWLOR 

 BODY:
LINDA NICKMAN was looking for three things when she decided to move from Philadelphia in the summer of 1998: a shorter commute to her job as an art teacher at Princeton High School, an affordable house with room for a studio and a community where she stood a good chance of getting to know her neighbors. She found all three in Lambertville, an old New Jersey river town of 4,300 tucked into the southwest corner of Hunterdon County that has undergone a striking rebirth in the last 20 years.
Ms. Nickman's 35-minute drive to work is a pleasant trip through farm country. After renting for a year, she bought a row house near the Delaware River last May and is quickly getting to know everyone on the block. "It's safe, clean, friendly, and I can walk practically everywhere," she said. "There's a relaxed, laid-back feeling. People look at you on the street and smile. They ask how you are. And it's a diverse population -- there are families, singles, gays, old-timers and new people moving in." 
 When Ms. Nickman began looking for a house, though, she found there were plenty of others just as charmed by Lambertville as she was. A former mill town that covers just over a square mile, Lambertville is full of Victorian and Federal-style brick row houses and brownstones, many with ornate woodwork, high ceilings and other period details still intact. In the last 15 years it has also become a weekend tourist stop for New Yorkers and Philadelphians who are drawn by block after block of antique shops, art galleries, restaurants and B & B's.
After a year and a half of searching, Ms. Nickman made an offer on the very same day she went to see a two-story, two-bedroom Victorian with pine floors, exposed wood beams, a finished basement and a fish pool in back. A bidding war ensued with another prospective buyer, but Ms. Nickman was the eventual winner at $141,000. She describes the house this way: "It's tiny, but really quaint."
Stories like Ms. Nickman's are becoming commonplace in Lambertville. "There are too many buyers and not enough sellers," said Jeanne Galloway, a broker and the manager of Gloria Nilson Realtors. "That's been true the last several years, but especially so in the last year."
To the delight, perhaps, of many of Lambertville's longtime residents, a row house that costs $150,000 today could have been picked up 25 years ago for $6,000. During the 60's and 70's, it was New Hope -- an artists' colony across the bridge on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware -- that got all the attention. Lambertville, always a working-class town, suffered through factory closings and boarded-up shops.
Now, some people contend that New Hope has become too noisy and crowded, with a surplus of ice cream parlors and T-shirt shops. Lambertville's civic leaders have tried to keep development in check, with mixed results. Although all the restaurants, antique shops and galleries have created parking and traffic bottlenecks, town officials have sought to limit the number of cars in town on weekends by encouraging developers to convert factory buildings into office space rather than retail or residential developments.
The biggest complaint among residents, besides the scarcity of parking, is the fact that there is no longer a supermarket in town. The last one closed five years ago, opened again under new ownership for a year, and then went out of business. Residents have to drive to New Hope to do their food shopping. The antique shops have also replaced the practical mom-and-pop stores, like shoe shops and bakeries, that used to serve local customers.
Bonnie J. Eick, Lambertville's tax collector and a part-time real estate agent for the E. J. Lelie agency, said that about half of the home buyers in the last year have been Manhattanites who were looking for weekend homes or wanted a permanent move. Some even commute to Manhattan by bus or by driving to Trenton to catch a train.
T HEY'RE attracted by the small-town atmosphere, the lack of crime, and the decent school system," said Ms. Eick, 48, who has lived all her life in Lambertville.
Although a Lambertville house may look like a bargain in comparison to a Manhattan apartment, some local residents find the increase in prices alarming. They fear that children will no longer be able to buy a house down the street from their parents, as many have done for generations.
The most affordable homes are small two-and-a-half story row houses about 10 blocks north of the main commercial street, Bridge Street. Typically, they sell for $135,000 to $180,000, said Ms. Eick, depending on whether they have been renovated. They have three bedrooms, one bath and an attic. The lots are 18 to 20 feet wide, with just enough backyard for a picnic table, a grill and a few chairs.
Larger three-story houses with three or four bedrooms closer to Bridge Street range from $160,000 to $225,000, she said.
A little farther west, there are three hills, and three-bedroom semidetached houses in this area, still within walking distance to the center of town, go for $150,000 and $250,000.
Freestanding homes with four or more bedrooms command the highest prices in Lambertville, as do those on the river and those that border the Delaware & Raritan Canal, which parallels the river. On Clinton Street, where houses on the canal go for up to $300,000, more modest properties directly across the street with smaller yards may be only $150,000, Ms. Eick said.
Ms. Galloway of Gloria Nilson Realtors said that mansions on the town's most desireable streets, built in the 1800's by the owners of Lambertville's factories, have gone up in price faster than smaller houses and now sell for $300,000 to $400,000. One nine-bedroom brick Victorian on York Street, across from City Hall, was recently bought for $330,000 and is now undergoing extensive renovations.
Although there are a fair number of apartments, demand is high, and they are snapped up quickly, Ms. Eick said. Typical rents for a one-bedroom are $750 to $1,000 a month, and for a two-bedroom, $850 to $1,200. There are also two buildings with a total of 75 federally subsidized apartments for the elderly.
Much of present-day Lambertville was built between 1820 and 1870, according to Gene Dennison, the president of the Historical Society.
It became a thriving factory town, with rubber, paper, flax, flour, rope, twine and cotton mills, and factories making clothespins, hairpins, lace and wooden spokes for the wheels of Civil War wagons. The canal was built in the 1830's by Irish immigrants to transport coal and other goods.
The town's earliest settlers were the Coryell, Holcombe and Lambert families. In 1812, John Lambert, a United States senator during Thomas Jefferson's administration, petitioned the government to open the first post office, changed the name of the town from Coryell's Ferry to Lambertville and made his nephew John the first postmaster.
The Lambertville Public School in the center of town has 250 students in the first through the sixth grades, with a half-day kindergarten program. Average class size is 17, and Edward Stoloski, the district superintendent, said the school was designated a "School of the Future" last year at the New Jersey School Boards Association's annual convention because of its emphasis on technology. The school has 150 computers, including four in each classroom, plus a computer lab. The school is also known for its artist-in-residence program, in which local artists are invited in to work with students.
On the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, which are given in the second, third, fifth and sixth grades, students' scores ranged from the 70st to the 92nd percentile this year, with the highest scores in math, science and language. Ninety-seven percent of the students were at or above grade level in reading.
For grades 7 through 12, Lambertville's students attend the South Hunterdon Regional High School in nearby West Amwell, one of the smallest public high schools in New Jersey with only 400 students from three towns: Lambertville, Stockton and West Amwell.
A typical English class has just 18 students, and some upper-level courses have only four or five students, said Dr. Thomas R. Davidson, superintendent of schools. About 85 percent of this year's graduating class of 71 seniors will go to a two- or four-year college. Last year, SAT averages were 518 in math and 516 in verbal, slightly higher than the state averages of 510 in math and 498 in verbal.
The school is known for the wide range of extracurricular activities in its after-school program, including athletics, theater, newspaper and yearbook. Because of the school's small size, any student who wants to play on a sports team can.
Private schools in the immediate area include the Pennington School and across the river in Bucks County, Pa., the Solebury School and two Quaker schools, Buckingham Friends, with kindergarten through the eighth grade, and the George School, with grades 9 through 12.
Because Lambertville is a river town, recreation is centered on the water. The 64-mile-long Delaware & Raritan Canal State Park, which runs through Lambertville, is the longest and narrowest park in the state. The canal's old towpath is used by bikers, hikers, joggers and cross-country skiers.
Lambertville also has Ely Field, a playground and baseball field, and Cavallo Park, a popular playground for toddlers. A 50-member orchestra, the Riverside Symphonia, performs at the Church of St. John the Evangelist in Lambertville seven times a year.

THE SHAD ARE BACK: Shad travel up the Delaware River to spawn each spring, but in the 1950's they all but disappeared because of pollution. Tougher antipollution laws in the 70's led to cleaner waters, and shad are now fished from boats and caught in nets by the Lewis family, which operates a shad fishery in Lambertville, the last one in the area. "People who love shad are fierce in their devotion," said Ellen Pineno, the office manager for the Lambertville Area Chamber of Commerce, and the annual Shad Festival in April drew 37,000 people this year. Shad normally run during April and May, and anyone who wants to fish for them in the Delaware needs a state license. But shad isn't for everyone. "It's a strong-tasting fish," said Ron Pittore, 53, a lifelong Lambertville resident who remembers fishing for catfish, carp and eels as a boy. "Not to disparage our great shad, but you have to be a true fish lover to eat it."

HEADLINE: Outside Interests

BYLINE: By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
I LIVE in a neighborhood built in friendlier times, before central air-conditioning and television rendered front porches obsolete. By local standards, my porch is barely adequate. It's not particularly gracious, it doesn't wrap around, it isn't screened and it's just big enough to support a couple of window boxes, a few chairs and a table. But that's enough, when the weather gets nice, to give me a purchase on the outside world at the same time I'm engaged in that despicable activity known as work.
In the summer, I work on my porch almost every morning. As long as the wind isn't too strong, and none of my neighbors have just had their lawns sprayed, if the grass and tree guys are busy on other streets and the teenagers next door aren't washing their cars with the radio blaring, I can -- thanks to modern technology -- talk or type to my heart's content. I can work and yet be in touch the season. 
 Real grown-ups -- those titans of industry and politics who march into the city with their briefcases and organizers and who have trouble finding enough casual clothes to wear on Fridays -- might not understand. But some of us cannot labor contently under fluorescent lights, no matter how much money, power or Starbucks you offer us.
Especially in summer.
I was in high school the first time I worked inside during the summer. My boss was my dad, who owned a small publishing company, and I was frequently told how lucky I was to get the experience. But although I made a small fortune by teenage standards, and had already begun to build my resume, I might as well have been a princess trapped in a dungeon. The end of light and air in summer was, quite simply, the end of childhood.
Fast forward a quarter of a century to life in the electronic cottage, the home-based information age economy predicted by Alvin Toffler. How Mr. Toffler figured this all out before the modem, the laptop and e-mail were invented, I'll never know. But I bet he worked it out all out on that forerunner of the laptop -- the portable typewriter -- sitting on his front porch, enjoying the breeze and feeling superior to all those drones still chained to offices.
Well, the virtual office is here. And if you're still laboring under fluorescent lights when you could be outside, you deserve your pallid complexion. "If necessary, put it in your schedule," said Carol Gerrish, a business-success coach in Monmouth Junction. "Because it's too good to pass up."
Ms. Gerrish should know. It's her job to counsel those titans of industry on how to put more success, and balance, in their lives. Part of what she does is to remind them that the outdoors exists and that they are actually allowed to go there. Ms. Gerrish herself is an avid gardener, and she spends as much time as possible outside once the temperature hits 60, reading productivity magazines at her backyard bistro table, surrounded by trees and flowers. "Research and development," she explained.
David Alpern, a senior editor for Newsweek, often does interviews about the magazine's polls from his deck in Sag Harbor, on Long Island. "It's clearly more fun to able to do it in the backyard with the sun and the trees and the moss and the hot tub gurgling on one side and the cat gurgling on the other," he said.
You don't even have to have a yard. Or a laptop. Or a cordless. If your job involves thinking, all you really need to work outside in fair weather is your brain -- although pen and paper might come in handy. That's basically the only equipment used by Ira Gassman, who worked outdoors when he wrote the book and lyrics for the Broadway musical "The Life." Mr. Gassman, who splits his time between Manhattan and Sag Harbor, has done all his writing for the past 20 years outside.
When Mr. Gassman is in Sag Harbor, he starts his writing shift on the porch of the American Hotel. By 3 p.m., when he wraps up, he's worked at picnic tables, benches and beaches all over town, from Long Wharf to Marine Park. "I usually like to stay in the sun, so as the sun moves so do I," he said. He also likes the hubbub of human activity. "I like people around me. It energizes me," he said. Mr. Gassman, however, is more energized by people on the whole than in the specific; he doesn't particularly want to be reached while he's in a creative mood. "Phooey on phones," he said.
Another soul who likes to write on the beach is Dan Rattiner, publisher of Dan's Papers, in Bridgehampton, also on Long Island. Mr. Rattiner has been writing on beaches for 15 years; he started going there to escape his children, who were always bursting into his home study. "I get kind of into a dreamland state," he said. "I can be irritable if I'm interrupted." Even in the dead of winter, Mr. Rattiner works at the beach -- inside his Lincoln Navigator.
And if he happens to experience a small adventure while he's there, even better -- since the life of the South Fork of Long Island is, after all, his beat. He's witnessed fishermen show up late for feasts that the seagulls enjoyed just moments earlier, and once, having noticed some strange tropical birds on the beach, he just happened to run into East Hampton's town environmental officer, who was able to identify the species for him.
I too have found working on my front porch providential. It's easy to strike up conversations with dog walkers, baby strollers and mail carriers who pass my way. Several years ago, one regular dog walker happened to mention that she was seeing an M.D., who was also an acupuncturist. I wound up writing a story about him, then seeing him for back pain and eventually he and I became friends. Last winter, I attended his wedding. None of this would have happened had I been holed up in my garret.
Of course, the outside home office isn't always a Garden of Eden. As I write this -- outside on my porch, of course -- I'm discovering that it's about 10 degrees cooler than it looked when I decided I could work outside today. Barely had I opened my laptop when I found that neighbors two doors down were having two trees removed. Now they're feeding the limbs into a machine that turns them into sawdust, and which sounds like an electric pencil sharpener attached to Jimi Hendrix's amplifier.
And as in the Garden of Eden, I sometime come across knowledge I'd just as soon not. That my mail carrier reads the postcards that inform us of our property taxes, for example. Or that certain neighbors back out of their driveways at frightening speeds.
Luckily -- so far -- I haven't witnessed any squalid extramarital liaisons.
The outdoor working life is not for everybody. Gil Gordon, a telecommuting consultant in Monmouth Junction, has worked at home for 18 years, but rarely takes his job outside. "I want to preserve the feeling of separation and relaxation I get when I'm in the backyard or by the pool or by the lake," he said. "I don't want to soil it with work."
Mr. Gordon is working on a book due out next spring from Random House, "Turn it Off: Controlling the Anytime-Anywhere Office."
Mr. Gordon also points out that there are certain tangible physical hazards from setting up office outside, like having your children trip over the extension cord plugged into your computer. Actually, that happened to me just the other day, and I barely caught my laptop before it hit the deck. Had it crashed, though, I probably would have just bought a new and better one -- one with a working battery, so I wouldn't need that extension cord in the first place. Then I could take it to the pool.

HEADLINE: Putting 'That Great Street' Back Into State Street

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHAROFF 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
AFTER 20 years of on-again off-again urban-renewal efforts, State Street, which was for generations Chicago's premier retail area, appears ready to reclaim its heritage.
Last month, the JMB Realty Corporation unveiled plans for a new $251 million mixed-use project on a square block across from the landmark Marshall Field's department store. The project will include a five-story retail mall anchored by a Lord & Taylor department store, a 34-story tower containing condominiums and a Marriott Suites Hotel. 
 The project, which is to break ground by the end of the year and is expected to be finished in stages starting in 2002, is the climax of what has already been an extraordinary year on the street.
Directly across Randolph Street from JMB Realty's project, a new theater and dormitory complex for the School of the Art Institute is nearing completion. It includes a 17-story tower as well as a renovated former office building that will have 34,000 square feet of retail space.
Several blocks to the south, Sears, Roebuck & Company, which has been absent from State Street for 17 years, is preparing to open a large new store on the first five floors of a recently renovated office building.
In addition, a number of national chains and local retailers, ranging from Kinko's and Radio Shack to Potbelly Sandwich Works and Nuts on Clark, a candy and nut shop, have recently signed leases in other buildings on the street.
"If you look at State in four years," said Tyrone Tabing, an assistant planning commissioner and the point man for the redevelopment of the street, "it will be a dramatically different street than it is today. And it's dramatically different now than it was four years ago."
That may be an understatement. In the early 90's, State Street "was being kept alive on a ventilator," said Bruce Kaplan, the president of the Northern Realty Group Ltd., a large real estate company in the Loop. "It was in horrendous condition," he added.
After a century-long run as the most prominent retail district in Chicago, if not the Midwest, State Street went into a decline in the 1970's and 80's. That decline was brought on by the rise of suburban shopping and the simultaneous development of nearby North Michigan Avenue as the new retailer to the carriage trade.
Contributing significantly to State Street's decline was the urban-renewal project in 1979 that closed the street to vehicles and turned it into an enormous -- and usually deserted -- pedestrian mall.
By the early 80's, State Street, which had boasted seven major department stores a decade earlier, was down to two: Marshall Field's and Carson Pirie Scott. What little specialty retailing that remained was increasingly of the fast-food and adult-bookstore variety.
There matters stood until the early 90's, when two things happened. The first was a housing boom, which resulted in some 12,000 new apartments in and around the Loop. The second was the city's willingness to jump-start the redevelopment process on State Street. It approved $44 million in incentive grants to 10 developers, and in 1996, a $25 million streetscape improvement project that reopened State Street to auto traffic, spruced it up with numerous planters and added lampposts and subway entrances with a turn-of-the-century look.
The results have been striking. Statistics complied by the Northern Realty Group show that annual rents for retail space on State Street have doubled in the last five years, to $52 a square foot, while the vacancy rate is just under 3 percent.
THE street currently has 2.5 million square feet of retail space; 1.6 million of that is accounted for by Marshall Field's and Carson Pirie Scott. In addition, another 750,000 square feet is currently under construction or on the drawing boards.
"Retail is driving the street, and it's driving it harder every week," said J. Paul Beitler, the chairman of Douglas Elliman-Beitler, the developer of the Sears project. Mr. Beitler is also the developer, along with the Prime Group, of Dearborn Center, a new 1.8 million-square-foot, 37-story office building under way at the corner of State and Adams Streets, which will have 100,000 square feet of retail space.
"The Loop is becoming a 24/7 living environment, and people need somewhere to shop," Mr. Beitler said. "State has become a community center. The whole emphasis is on providing the kinds of goods and services that you find in the suburbs."
The Sears project is often mentioned by developers and real estate brokers as an example of what State Street will be like in the future. Sears opened its first store on State Street in 1932, at the corner of State and Van Buren Streets. The building still exists, but it is now occupied by Robert Morris College, a business school. The new Sears store, which is scheduled to open next spring, is four blocks farther north, at the corner of State and Madison Streets and diagonally across State Street from Carson Pirie Scott.
"I think State Street customers tend to be a little more mainstream and mass America than those on Michigan Avenue," said Milton Mooney, the senior vice president for Sears stores in the north-central region. "We're going to merchandise the space in a way that will play to the strengths of that market."
The store, which is costing about $30 million, will have 250,000 square feet of space, about twice as much as an average new Sears store, Mr. Mooney said.
The just-announced Lord & Taylor project is also being described as one that will harmonize with the newly residential character of the Loop. The project brings to a close a troubled chapter in the street's redevelopment. JMB has owned the site for over a decade, and it has been vacant -- except for a Commonwealth Edison substation and an ice-skating rink in the winter months -- for nearly that long.
Neil Bluhm, the chairman of JMB, said that the collapse of the real estate market in the early 90's led to the cancellation of an office project planned for the site. Several other projects also came and went. "Then the city decided it wanted more retail to energize State, so our project changed to reflect that," Mr. Bluhm said.
The new project, which is being designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the New York architectural firm, has a distinctly modern look, a departure on a street where most of the buildings date from the 1920's and earlier.
The new building nearing completion as part of the School of the Art Institute project across Randolph Street is an echo of the architect Daniel Burnham's historic Reliance Building, now called the Hotel Burnham, a block south at the corner of State and Washington.
The Art Institute's architect, Larry Booth of Booth Hansen & Associates in Chicago, said he very much had turn-of-the-century Chicago architecture in mind when he designed the project. "I feel like Louis Sullivan and Daniel Burnham and John Root are old pals of mine," Mr. Booth said, "and this was my chance to join the party."
The project, which is costing about $55 million, will have 34,000 square feet of retail space, 300 dormitory rooms, 2 movie theaters for the Art Institute's Film Center and a legitimate theater that has been leased to the Noble Fool comedy troupe.
The retail anchor for the project will be Borders Books, which will open a 30,000-square-foot store on three levels next fall.
"We always wanted to be on State, based on what's been going on there for the last few years," said Alex Lelli, the vice president for development of the Borders Group Inc. in Ann Arbor, Mich. "There's a lot of activity both during the day and at night and on the weekends. It's a very attractive street."

HEADLINE: Addressing the County's No. 1 Need;
Trying to Create Affordable Housing in a Place That Few Can Afford

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
ON a recent sultry afternoon, fortified only with box lunches and their own passion, a dozen government officials and an equal number of housing advocates boarded a bus at the County Center here and made a great loop around New York's wealthiest county, visiting affordable housing projects from Peekskill to Mamaroneck.
They were guests of the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, who has called the lack of affordable housing Westchester's No. 1 problem, for reasons both practical and philosophical. It weakens the fabric of communities, he said, by forcing out young adults who were raised there, retirees who can't afford to stay and blue-collar stalwarts who staff the volunteer fire departments and ambulance corps. 
 Were that not bad enough, Mr. Spano said, the difficulty of finding affordable housing in all but a few communities, like Yonkers and New Rochelle, is contributing to choking traffic on arteries like the Tappan Zee Bridge, a conduit for those who work here but must live where it is less expensive, say in Rockland or Orange Counties. It discourages economic development. And it fosters certain values that thrive in this petri dish of privilege.
"When we talk about improving the quality of life for all our residents, we must attack the lack of affordable housing," Mr. Spano declared in his State of the County address. "Every study -- whether the subject is transportation, economic development, planning or senior services -- refers to it as the county's most crucial problem."
But the county has no power, except for the bully pulpit, when it comes to land use decisions by its 43 municipalities. And so Mr. Spano, a Democrat, has begun a $250,000 public relations campaign to help overcome resistance from residents and elected leaders.
"We've got to show that the political numbers are greater for than against," said Mr. Spano, whose initiatives include using county money to buy land for such developments, giving legal and technical assistance to municipalities and developers, and tying the distribution of discretionary funds to a community's record in building affordable housing.
Each municipality, under authority granted by the state, drafts its own zoning regulations; approves, rejects or stalls projects as it sees fit. And with a few exceptions, most of Westchester's towns and villages vigorously resist the idea of opening the gates of paradise to those who can not afford to enter without subsidy.
The problem with that attitude is that virtually nobody can afford to live here anymore, including the people who already do, since the median house price is $365,000 and rising.
A case in point is Ron Bianchi, the mayor and supervisor of Harrison. "A lot of us, including myself, couldn't buy the houses we're living in now," Mr. Bianchi said. "My three sons, none of them can afford to live here."
The irony of Mr. Bianchi's lament may be lost on all but county insiders. His community, it turns out, is the most recalcitrant in Westchester when it comes to building affordable housing, refusing even to endorse a nonbinding county resolution that sets goals for each municipality. Harrison, a contiguous town and village, was urged to build 307 units in the last decade. It built none. It plans none. It wants none, Mr. Bianchi said.
There are few places in the United States where the gap is greater between the cost of housing and the wages of all but the fabulously rich. "In years gone by, the basic premise of housing policy was, If you could work you could afford a place to live," said Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, who recently viewed the situation here firsthand during a speaking engagement. "Now, that connection is broken."
The numbers are eye popping, proof that Westchester has pulled the welcome mat out from under people who would be solidly middle class virtually anywhere else, but for a few exceptions like Silicon Valley in California and Fairfax County in Virginia.
To be eligible for affordable housing, according to government regulations, an individual or family must earn less than 80 percent of the local median income. In Westchester, the median income for a family of four is $83,100, which means that a family earning $66,480 would qualify for help.
Again using a government formula, which says housing should cost 30 percent of gross income, that hypothetical family of four should spend no more that $1,600 a month, either in rent or mortgage payments, the ceiling for housing that meets the "affordable" criteria. To find market-rate housing at that cost in most parts of Westchester is impossible.
County planners say that without equity from a previous real estate investment, an income of $110,000 would be required to buy a typical home. And apartments have all but disappeared. About 40,000 were lost to condominium conversions in the 1980's. Only 10,000 rental units remain, or 16 percent of the housing stock countywide, so landlords can charge premium prices.
It is this set of economic conditions, worsening every day, that drives the need to build affordable housing, whether in clusters of new townhouses, in derelict buildings rehabilitated for that purpose, above stores and offices or in accessory apartments in private homes.
To that end, the county created the Housing Opportunity Commission a decade ago and, with assistance from the Rutgers University Center for Urban Policy Research, set goals for the county as a whole and allocations for each municipality. Westchester is the only county in New York State, outside the five boroughs, to do so.
But, the results have been disheartening, to put it mildly.
The countywide goal was 5,000 units in the decade just ended. Fewer than half that many were built. Of the 43 municipalities, 19 failed even to respond with a vague statement of good intentions. Two of those, Yonkers and Cortlandt, are under court order to produce low-income housing. Two others, Harrison and Port Chester, passed resolutions of opposition to the county goals. The cooperation of the remaining towns and villages has been uneven. New goals will be set after the 2000 census, with the county then playing a desperate game of catch-up.
The county's campaign, including glossy informational brochures, is intended to educate the public about who it is that needs this housing, to disabuse a wary citizenry that they are being asked to welcome welfare mothers or minimum-wage workers. But explaining that the target buyer or renter is a local teacher or firefighter, the grown children or aging parents of residents is only a partial solution.
Resistance is driven by other concerns, the recurring themes in all Nimby disputes. Preserving open land. Preventing clusters of bland town houses in neighborhoods of beautiful old homes. Holding down school enrollment and thus taxes. Sustaining property values. Controlling local traffic. Not interfering with one person's views or another's fondness for the woods nearby.
"People are oriented to their own comforts and their own bottom line," said John R. Nolon, director of the Land Use Center at the Pace University School of Law. "Our appetites, desires and whims drive this problem, absent over-riding state authority."
And there is no over-riding state authority in New York that forces municipalities to create a full range of housing opportunities.
A series of court cases, beginning with Berenson v. New Castle, which was decided by the State Court of Appeals in 1975, asserts that "regional considerations must be reflected in local zoning."
But despite its condemnation of exclusionary zoning, neither Berenson nor several cases that followed include any enforcement mechanism. Thus municipalities flout the courts at will, as North Salem has done for seven years by ignoring a court order regarding the illegal upzoning of 63 acres from multifamily dwellings to two-acre parcels, which effectively eliminates the possibility of building affordable units there.
New Jersey, by contrast, has mandated the construction of affordable housing though court cases known collectively as the Mount Laurel rulings. The New Jersey court adopted a statewide allocation plan. The court also retained jurisdiction over any cases brought by developers against recalcitrant municipalities, appointed special masters to ensure follow through and set timetables for compliance, none of which was done by the New York courts.
"It's the difference between 'ought to' versus 'must,' " said George M. Raymond, chairman of the Westchester Housing Opportunity Commission, who cut his teeth in this field as special master in 14 New Jersey communities.
Connecticut tackled the problem legislatively by passing the Affordable Housing Appeals Act in 1988. Any community that does not already have 10 percent of its housing in the affordable range is subject to the law. In these communities, if a developer proposes a project with 20 percent of its units affordable and is turned down because of restrictive zoning, that denial is deemed illegal unless the municipality can show a clear public purpose. That reverses the burden of proof from the usual scenario, where a developer seeking a zoning variance comes to the planning board hat in hand and is usually rejected.
"Where the political will is there, it can happen," Mr. Raymond said.
Certain Westchester communities have shown that political will. The town of Greenburgh, alone in the county, has enacted a requirement that any development in districts zoned for multifamily dwellings must include one affordable unit for every nine priced at market rate.
Such inclusionary projects, as they are known, are favored by many advocates because they integrate subsidized and market-rate units, with no apparent distinction. By legislating inclusionary housing, Greenburgh is encouraging private building without dependence on government subsidies, which are highly competitive, difficult to apply for and thus beyond the expertise of all but a few developers who specialize in affordable housing.
The town of New Castle, which includes the wealthy hamlets of Chappaqua and Millwood, has also shown leadership. The town was supportive of a project, developed by Wilder Balter Partners of Elmsford, with 52 two-family town houses, each with an owner-occupied portion and a rental flat below. And New Castle has a request for proposals out on another site, which it intends to rezone for multifamily dwellings.
This is a reversal of the more common upzoning, which makes lots larger and larger and thus limits them to the very rich. Somers, for instance, has upzoned 15 square miles to parcels of two to three acres, over the objections of the County Planning Board. "They have created a gated community without gates," said Raymond Seidelman, a professor of political science at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers.
New Castle also inspired a county program of financial and technical aid to people in large houses who are willing to add an affordable accessory apartment.
The town administrator, Jerry Faiella, said his goal is to create "cradle to grave housing options," and thus "generational stability," while enabling town employees and volunteers to live side by side with the people they serve.
He said that this attitude is not always popular and that his planning board meetings, like those across the county, draw strident opponents. "I've heard every reason not to do it," he said. "The board's got to make a decision whether they want it to happen or not."
That attitude is not shared by Mr. Bianchi, mayor and supervisor of Harrison, the county's poster child for noncompliance with its housing goals. Mr. Bianchi says his constituents are against providing housing for people who can't afford it on their own, since longtime residents "had to pay their fair share."
When reminded that housing prices have risen exponentially and that current residents could not afford their houses today, Mr. Bianchi tacked in another direction. Residents of Harrison, he said, "don't trust the government" and fear that units set aside today for families earning $60,000 could wind up occupied by the poor.
Mr. Bianchi said he does not share their skepticism. "But I have great respect for the wishes of people who live in this town," he said. "I'm not going to go out and do something that they feel short-changes them."
Developers of affordable housing shun communities that do not welcome them, since the task is hard enough, and the profit margins too low, to permit time-consuming and costly political battles or litigation. To make a project viable requires concessions from the local government, like density bonuses for including affordable units, along with a jigsaw puzzle of Federal, state and county subsidies.
Jonathan Rose, scion of the Rose family real estate dynasty in New York City, is widely considered the guru of affordable housing here. Other developers say that no one is more expert in layering the available sources of financing, a task so time consuming and complex that few attempt it.
Mr. Rose argues that the obstacles to building affordable housing here are surmountable, were the development community not so profit driven. But most developers are less sanguine.
They say that Westchester is in a class by itself in terms of resisting development of any kind, not merely affordable housing. "It's hard to get anything built here -- a shopping center, a garden apartment, a million dollar house -- because of sensitivity about density," said Robert H. Wilder Jr. of Wilder Balter Partners, which calls itself the state's largest developer of affordable housing.
Mr. Wilder and his partner, William G. Balter, proudly display renderings of their projects elsewhere -- Goshen, Middletown, Ballston Spa, Babylon, to name a few. In the last 10 years, they say, they have built more than 1,000 affordable units outside Westchester and just 92 in the county.
"If we could do all our work within 20 minutes of our office, don't you think we would?" Mr. Wilder asked. "The opportunities don't present themselves. It's so much harder here. Sure, it's hard every place: hard but doable."

HEADLINE: Dining Where the Garden Is Decor and Cuisine

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG 

 BODY:
FOR the better part of a decade, critics have extolled the food and ambience at The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse. Craig Shelton, the inn's chef, extolls something else: the glories of its garden. "The garden is the restaurant," he said. "It dictates the approach to cuisine."
This holistic philosophy, linking kitchen, garden, cuisine and ambience, is not new. American chefs, led by Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., have championed the concept since the 1970's. But in New Jersey, economic factors make it less practical to surround a restaurant with lush gardens, even if they produce raw materials for the menu. Jack Boehlert, owner of the Stockton Inn in Stockton, summarized the problem neatly; "Most people who think about the costs of doing business are not going to use one-third of the seating area to make a garden." 
 At the Stockton Inn, shady conditions and rocky soil limit large-scale production of edibles, but homegrown mints appear in sauces and desserts, and flowers are tossed into salads and used as garnishes. The garden is planted with shade-tolerant annuals, perennials and shrubs. Standing amid the rocky outcroppings and waterfalls that surround the terraced outdoor eating area, it defines the restaurant.
At the Ryland Inn, the main garden consists of two fenced acres that produce vegetables, herbs, fruits and ornamental and edible flowers. Another unfenced acre is home to mulberry and elderberry bushes. The head gardener, Chip Shepherd, uses the "French intensive gardening" system, growing plants close together in raised beds full of organically enriched soil to produce larger yields in relatively small spaces.
A walk through Mr. Shepherd's beds is a lesson in the art of composing a kitchen garden. Bare earth is rarely visible. Magenta bee balm, the herb best known as the flavoring in Earl Grey tea, leaps out of one bed, as bees hover over its blossoms. The purple blooms of thyme sprawl along the ground. Red-leafed lettuces face upward, their heads resembling many-petaled flowers. A row of basil plants with green and purple varieties planted alternately runs alongside a bushy row of orange-flowered nasturtiums, creating a combination that would be equally at home on a plate or in a vase.
Mr. Shepherd is convinced that raising fresh, organic produce makes economic, philosophical and gustatory sense. "It's cheaper to grow your own organic produce," he said. (To be certified as organic in New Jersey means, among other things, that fruits and vegetables must be grown in soil that has not been treated with pesticides or herbicides for at least three years.)
Mr. Shepherd, who may be the only organic gardener with previous professional experience in the hazardous waste disposal industry, has supervised the garden for three years. Since the Ryland Inn does not yet have a commercial-size greenhouse, Mr. Shepherd starts the inn's seedlings -- all from heirloom seed varieties -- at his home a short distance away. If all goes according to plan, Mr. Shepherd hopes the majority of the seeds he sows in coming seasons will come from the plants grown in the garden. The germination rate of these collected seeds is comparable to that of commercially obtained seeds, making them an economical alternative.
EVERY spring at Mia Sorella, Abbas Aboelata, the father of the chef and owner, Sam Aboelata, plants seeds and starter plants of basil, sage, rosemary, thyme and Italian parsley in the beds that run like ribbons around the restaurant's sunny outdoor patio. By midsummer, the garden is also producing the tomatoes, peppers, scallions, French beans and arugula used in the younger Mr. Aboelata's Italian cooking. This year, according to the chef, walls will be constructed to raise the beds, enabling diners to be close enough to smell and touch the fragrant herbs.
Because of the "cut and come again" nature of the herbs in the garden, Mr. Aboelata is able to supply the restaurant all summer. If there is a surplus of basil, it is dried or frozen for winter use, or made into classic pesto sauce.
Then there are the flowers. Abbas Aboelata plants them in any space not occupied by vegetables and herbs. Some stay outside to beautify the patio; others are cut for table arrangements inside the restaurant. Homegrown flowers, like homegrown produce, make both aesthetic and economic sense in a business where profit margins can be thinner than French crepes.
The connection between restaurant and garden is as tangible at the Stockton Inn as the stone that was quarried on the spot to construct the restaurant's original building. The space beside the structure, created when the stone was removed, is now home to the three-tiered outdoor dining area and garden. Water cascades down the stone walls, and an array of plants fills the raised beds. In the spring, Virginia bluebells share space with boldly colored ranunculus and pansies. Later on, ostrich ferns and other varieties wave over double impatiens. Azaleas and rhododendrons bloom on the steep hillside behind the dining area, and a pair of lace-leaf maples mark the boundary between tiers of the patio. A pair of hibiscus standards, presented to Mr. Boehlert by a customer, claim a sunny spot flanking a walkway.
Mr. Boehlert began his gardening career at the age of 12, and his career at the Stockton Inn as a waiter six years ago. Since that time he has become chief gardener as well as owner. When he bought the property in 1998, the garden beds were engulfed in English ivy, and the hillside was covered with scrubby vegetation. Gradually he and his crew of part-time helpers weeded out the unwanted greenery and began putting in other plants. In the future Mr. Boehlert hopes to install fragrant lilac and viburnum bushes in the outdoor dining area. For the present he will plant hanging baskets with trailing nasturtium. By summer the flowers will be doing double duty in the kitchen and garden.
Mr. Boehlert is an avocational painter whose renderings of cyclamens and water lilies hang in one of the indoor dining rooms. He approaches the garden as both horticulturist and artist, bringing the same sense of composition and color to his outdoor and indoor canvases.
The fruits of Mr. Boehlert's labors are on display from Mother's Day until the end of the growing season. "Some people will only come during the summertime," he said.
The gardens at the Ryland Inn are open to both the general public and the restaurant's patrons. Garden tours are available as Mr. Shepherd's time permits, and unaccompanied strolling is encouraged. "People come here to walk in the garden all the time," said Mr. Shelton, who described the gardens as an important link between the Inn and the surrounding community.
MR. SHELTON and Mr. Shepherd look ahead to the day when the Ryland Inn will extend its horticultural outreach and provide seedlings of organically grown flowers and vegetables to the public. "Ryland should be part of the community," said the chef. Eventually, he and Mr. Shepherd envision cooking and gardening apprenticeship programs at the Inn. "We want to invite people to participate on an individual level," he added.
Though there is no space to expand Mia Sorella's garden, Mr. Aboelata has his own plans. He wants to build a pergola over part of the terrace. The structure will then be covered with grapevines, providing shade for diners as well as leaves that will make their way into special dishes.
All three restaurateurs view their establishments as part of a larger community. "There is such history here," said Mr. Boehlert of his 300-year-old-inn and its 50-year-old gardens and waterfalls. "My job is to keep it all together."

What Market Windfall?

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
To many Americans, the stock market boom has been like a solitary breeze on a torrid summer night: just when they turn to enjoy the coolness, it seems to go away.
Two-thirds of Americans who responded to a survey about their retirement plans said they had not gained substantially from the decadelong bull market. 
 Six hundred people over the age of 25 took part in the poll, which was commissioned by the Keyport Life Insurance Company in Boston. Of the respondents, 278 were working and 322 were retired.
Of the current workers, only 10 percent said their stock market gains would allow them to retire early; 3 percent of the retired respondents said such gains had let them retire early.
Keyport, which conducted a similar survey in 1995, found contradictory attitudes and expectations about retirement needs and lifestyles. Three-fourths of the current workers said their standard of living in retirement would be the same or higher than it was now, but just over half could not estimate how much money they would need to retire in the lifestyle they wanted. That was up from 43 percent in 1995.
Among the current workers who listed an amount, the median was $400,000, but 26 percent said they would need less than $100,000.
"This lack of financial realism is very disturbing," said Philip K. Polkinghorn, president of Keyport. "Financial planners and other experts that take inflation, life span and other factors into account when setting retirement savings goals would find that $100,000 is only a fraction of what an individual needs as a retirement nest egg."
He said $400,000 was more realistic.
The survey found that half of current workers expected to be working for pay in retirement; 56 percent of those said they would need the money. By contrast, 22 percent of the retirees said they were working part-time now, up from 13 percent in 1995.
Only 23 percent of current workers expect Social Security to be a major source of retirement income, down from 35 percent in 1995. Most expect the majority of retirement income to come from 401(k)'s, individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans. MICKEY MEECE

Brooklyn on 10,000 Calories a Day

BYLINE: By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
The bagel. The knish. The pepperoni slice. To couple the words "Brooklyn" and "food" is to evoke these legendary immigrant-inspired snacks that over the last century have filled the bellies of locals and injected pizazz into palates of Americans from Memphis to Malibu.
But lest anyone think Brooklyn's gastronomic glories are limited to these classics, the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce last year created Brooklyn's Kitchen, a program intended to help the borough's food manufacturers develop and increase sales of Brooklyn fare around the country. 
 Why Brooklyn? It has more food manufacturers than any other borough, with food making up 12 percent of its economic development, said Shawn Starbuck, assistant director of the pilot program, which serves 32 small and midsize clients. The borough's diversity also makes it ideal.
"The different ethnic pockets that make up Brooklyn all have their own food component," Ms. Starbuck said. "There's the Italian sections, the Middle East sections, the Russians in Brighton Beach. The whole food scene in Brooklyn is changing as people develop products they've made at home and try to sell them in this market."
To make her point, Ms. Starbuck (who is no relation to the coffee chain, although she noted that Starbucks' founder was a Brooklyn boy), dropped in on some of her favorite spots the other day.
DAMASCUS BAKERIES, DUMBO -- For anyone who has ever pondered the mysteries of the pita, Edward Mafoud has the answers. Towering over six feet, white hairnet peeking out under a yellow construction hat, Mr. Mafoud, grandson of America's first pita manufacturer, led visitors into his hot, bread-scented warehouse on Gold Street.
Puffy, sandwich-sized pitas glided by on conveyor belts as Mr. Mafoud described the mating habits of yeasts ("typically an asexual reproduction") and stretched dough over his hand to demonstrate the window test ("If I can see my fingernails through that piece of dough, I've done my job").
When Mr. Mafoud's Syrian-born grandfather, Hassan Halaby, started Damascus Bakeries in an Atlantic Avenue storefront in 1930, five employees made the pitas by hand. Today, 60 employees work around the clock, producing 11,000 pitas per hour in 11 different flavors, including cinnamon-raisin and pesto. The company also makes flatbread for wraps, which Mr. Mafoud praises as a fat-free alternative to tortillas.
But the real mystery lies inside the pita.
"I know what you want to ask: how does it get its pocket?" Mr. Mafoud said, nodding wisely. "A lot of people think, 'Well, why don't you put two pieces of dough one on top of the other?' Well, that's not how it's done." Rather, he explained: "We cook the pita bread for 50 seconds at 900 degrees Fahrenheit. As it gets hot, thousands if not millions of air bubbles form. They become excited and move further and further apart. Finally we get one continuous bubble, or pocket."
STEVE'S KEY LIME PIES, RED HOOK -- "I'm the key lime guy," admitted Steve Tarpin, standing in shorts and an apron in a small doorway on Columbia Street. It would be hard to deny, given the hulking 1953 Ford panel delivery truck out front that's painted a creamy pale green and reads "Steve's Authentic Key Lime Pies." But now that Mr. Tarpin has moved his five-year-old business out of his Boerum Hill studio apartment and "gone legit," with two employees and an 800-square-foot storefront he shares with a wedding cake baker, he can afford to boast.
Mr. Tarpin's interest in key limes goes far beyond just squeezing them. "This is the true lime," he said, plucking a pinball-sized yellow-skinned fruit from a box. "It originated in south Asia, the Arabs brought it through the spice trade and passed it over to the Spanish. The Spanish and Portuguese brought them to the New World."
Shaking his head reproachfully, Mr. Tarpin displayed a bottle of preservative-laced juice concentrate that he said most key lime pie manufacturers rely on. To counter such travesties, Mr. Tarpin has created a Web site, www.keylime.com, that outlines the fruit's provenance and explains how to grow your own key lime tree.
Asked the secret of the perfect pie, Mr. Tarpin, who moved here from Florida, began to explain: "Any self-respecting Miami native should know how to make a decent key lime pie. It's a basic recipe----" He stopped short. "I shouldn't tell you that," he said and, tongue-in-cheek, continued, "It's a long family secret which we don't divulge." He did divulge the five simple ingredients: egg yolks, sweetened condensed milk and key limes for the filling; graham crackers and butter for the crust.
Catering mostly to local restaurants and hotels, the company produces up to 120 large pies and 500 individual ones a day. Starting this month, the upscale grocery Citarella will be carrying his pies, which Mr. Tarpin hopes will afford him and his truck a little peace. "So people won't actually have to chase me down the street to get a pie, which has been happening," he explained.
INTERNATIONAL GOURMET DELIGHTS, BAY RIDGE -- Don't try to figure out how many generations Anwar Najjar's family has been in the pastry business. Back in the 11th century, when Crusaders and caravan merchants roamed the Near East, the Najjars were making the baklava that travelers carried to neighboring states and into the Arabian desert.
Transporting their delicacies to Brooklyn was perhaps the next logical step.
"My mom and dad came here in 1972," Mr. Najjar said as his sister and mother uncovered platters of Turkish delight, pistachios in filo dough, and shredded dough with walnuts in their wholesale bakery on Bay Ridge Avenue. Speaking of the Lebanese civil conflict, he said, "In 1976 when the war broke out, they went back and got us in Tripoli." Thus did the business embark on its second millennium, combining ancient Lebanese techniques with an American-style melting-pot marketing philosophy.
"We're halal and we're kosher," Mr. Najjar explained. "We're also in Jewish communities; we're also in Israeli markets." They're also in South America, Asia and Canada, as well as in United States chain stores and Middle Eastern markets.
Butter is a major component in the pastries, but so are more esoteric ingredients. Mastic gum, the sap of a special Grecian tree, gives the sugar-coated loukoum its chewy consistency; rose water provides an aromatic counterbalance to the nuts in the Turkish Delight.
Badrieh Najjar, Mr. Najjar's mother, said local customers include transplants from traditional baklava-belt states like Pakistan, India, Greece, Iran and Yugoslavia. But in this era of rapid transit, even non-baklava countries are tuning in.
"One time some Chinese person brought our product back to China and they wrote about it in their newspaper," she said, adding that the article specifically mentioned the bird's nest, a shredded dough specialty of the house. "They loved the shape of it, they loved the taste of it, and they loved the name."

HEADLINE: The Sound and the Fury

BYLINE: By BERNARD STAMLER 

 BODY:
HAVE you heard the noise?
Madelyn Wils has. A longtime resident of TriBeCa, where three- and four-star restaurants make their home, she listens every evening as motorists honk their horns at double- and triple-parked limousines and their well-dressed passengers, who bark into cell phones as they arrive and depart. 
 "It's like the movie 'Network,' where the characters yell, 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more,' " said Ms. Wils, a freelance television producer, complaining about yet another restaurant that recently applied for permission to open on Duane Street, where she lives. "That's what my neighbors and I are saying now."
Marcia Lemmon, chairwoman of the Ludlow Street Block Association, has also heard the noise. She lives on the Lower East Side, where the freewheeling drug traffic of a decade ago has been replaced by residential gentrification and an explosion in cacophonous bars and "scene" restaurants. On Orchard Street alone she has counted seven places that serve liquor.
"People have said to me that they look back on the time of the drugs as the halcyon days of the neighborhood," Ms. Lemmon said, "especially compared to now, with the noise, taxis and yelling in the street."
For Max Strauss, who runs an aluminum recycling business and lives in an apartment facing West 67th Street, just off Central Park West, the din is "just off the scale." He blames Makor, a Jewish cultural center that opened on the block last fall and runs evening programs aimed at young singles.
"You can feel the music vibrating through the walls," said Mr. Strauss, who added that he and his wife are so frustrated they plan to knock through the walls of another apartment they own in the back of their building and move their bedroom there, away from the commotion.
"We're lucky that we can do that," he said. "Otherwise, we'd have to move."
Noise has always been a part of Manhattan life. But in recent years, people have moved to areas where few, if any, used to live. Spurred by a red-hot economy, they are also demanding, and getting, entertainment in those neighborhoods, as well as in communities that have traditionally been residential.
As a result, the disturbances drawing public ire are not just the jackhammers, car alarms and fire sirens that have long assaulted urban eardrums. Today, nearly everywhere around town, people are also complaining about restaurants, movie theaters, clubs, bars and other gathering places. Many of those complaining were raised outside the city in quieter places and are unwilling to accept the growing din.
Attend a meeting of virtually any community group, and you will hear the same story: despite a stricter city noise code, the racket is growing.
Increasing numbers of residents say they want offending establishments exiled to the fringes of the city or kicked out of Manhattan altogether.
In some cases, they are succeeding. In 1997, Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam overturned a liquor license that had been approved for a bar at 72 Grand Street in SoHo, ruling that the detriment to the community far outweighed any gain to it. In 1998, the State Liquor Authority rejected a license application from a bar at 76 Wooster Street, also in SoHo. It was one of the few times the agency had refused to grant a license for the sake of neighborhood tranquillity.
In February, Justice Franklin R. Weissberg of State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected an application for a license for a proposed nightclub at 372 Broadway, south of Canal Street, on the ground that the club was likely to disrupt the community. The club would have occupied an old four-story building next to a residential high-rise surrounded by stores selling fabric, futons and discount jeans. At night, when the stores are closed, the area is silent save for a few cars and trucks heading down Broadway.
"I don't know if it's a change in people's sensibilities or if the noise is actually louder," said Charles G. Sturcken, chief of staff of the city Department of Environmental Protection, which fields so-called quality of life complaints on a 24-hour phone line. In the last year or two, he said, far more people seem to be complaining about noise from social events and gathering places than ever before.
Judy Duffy, the assistant manager for Community Board 1, said of the din from restaurants, clubs and bars, "It is the most increased kind of complaint we've seen in the last few years."
Her district includes much of Lower Manhattan, where, she said, such noise is "more and more the key issue." Even normal conversation on the street occasionally provokes the wrath of residents.
"We just flat out have more people living here and more people coming here," Ms. Duffy said. "And people make noise."
 
Now, the Once-Sleepless City Dreams of Peace and Quiet
To New Yorkers, it used to be a matter of civic pride that this was the city that never slept. Manhattan, especially, was a mix, a hodgepodge of homes, stores, theaters, restaurants and bars. And that was fine with New Yorkers, who wanted to be able to buy a quart of milk in their neighborhoods, or go out for a drink, a meal or a show.
But that was when the populace had a greater "tradition of tolerance for noise" than it does today, said Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology at Hunter College and the City University Graduate Center, who specializes in urban affairs.
With elevated trains screeching past and windows open on summer nights, "there were different norms of noise," he said.
Times changed. In the 1950's and 60's, great waves of newly affluent or at least middle-class young families packed up and headed for the quiet of the suburbs. Then times changed again. Many grown children of the suburbs returned to Manhattan and many of them are raising their families here, preferring the verve and excitement of the city to what they perceived as the boredom and sterility of the suburbs.
Yet despite their enthusiasm for urban life, these returnees and other new Manhattanites have acquired "certain expectations of behavior that are really quite suburban," Professor Kasinitz said.
They feel entitled to conditions similar to those that prevailed in the places they were raised. "Like peace and quiet," he said.
But there are other reasons for the new militancy against party noise. A major one is the influx of New Yorkers moving into marginally residential or newly gentrified areas like TriBeCa, the Lower East Side, far west Chelsea and the East Village, where elevated noise levels might be expected. The city's prosperity also results in more noise, largely because of the peculiarities of the city's zoning regulations, in which commercial districts are overlaid on Manhattan's residential neighborhoods.
As a result, many of the worst offenses occur in places where New Yorkers have always lived, like the Upper East Side or the block on West 67th Street where Max Strauss and his neighbors suffer.
As Joseph B. Rose, director of the Department of City Planning, points out, Manhattan is a small place, and the commercial heart of the city. If the city is to thrive, he said, both residential and commercial uses must coexist on one relatively tiny island. In Manhattan, unlike the suburbs, there is hardly any residential-only zoning, and even historically residential areas are studded with restaurants, clubs and bars. In boom times, coexistence between the two worlds is increasingly precarious.
"The goal of land use regulation is to achieve and maintain a balance, and noise per se is not a general land use issue," Mr. Rose said. "We are not going to do away with the commercial overlay on residential areas in Manhattan."
 
Problems of Prosperity In the East Village
One neighborhood where the problem has become particularly intense in recent years is the East Village.
From Second Avenue to the East River, the area is zoned as a general residence district, with restrictions on building size, height and uses. On the avenues, however, and some side streets, zoning allows commercial uses, which can include everything from antiques stores to supermarkets to shoe repair shops to bars.
Once an impoverished haven for drug dealers, the East Village was increasingly gentrified in the last decade. It also became host to several New York University dormitories.
Lisa Ramaci, a member of Community Board 3, said the presence of students led to the opening of dozens of bars and clubs, many of which displaced delis, dry cleaners, shoe repair shops and other businesses that could not pay higher rents.
"You now have wolf packs of 20-somethings roaming residential side streets at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, screaming, kicking over garbage cans and fighting," Ms. Ramaci said.
"There are also plenty with fake ID's," she said. "It's like Disneyland East."
Ms. Ramaci cited the Cock, a bar at 188 Avenue A at East 12th Street, as an example.
The Cock was cited seven times between spring 1997 and summer 1999 for violations like selling alcohol to minors and after-hours operations. During that period, it was fined $20,000.
Davis Tong, the building's owner, declined to comment on the present status of the Cock, and the club's owner, Allan Mannarelli, could not be reached.
In December, the liquor authority suspended the bar's license, citing multiple violations, and shut it down for 30 days. But the bar has since reopened. The music is so loud, Ms. Ramaci said, "you have to plug your ears as you go by."
Not even the prospect of college finals could deter midweek revelers from visiting Avenue A on a recent weeknight. Well after midnight, the street was filled with knots of people in various stages of tipsiness, laughing and talking loudly.
At the Cock and other bars, like the Raven near 13th Street, loud, percussive music drifted out the door.
 
If You Can't Throw Them Out, Zone Them Out
One way to improve the situation is to redefine the kinds of businesses that can operate in a certain place. Mr. Rose said the City Planning Department would recommend some modifications along those lines later this spring as part of a major overhaul of the city's 1961 Zoning Resolution.
The City Council has the power to enact zoning changes. But the Council usually acts only in tandem with the planning department. As a result, one proposal to modify uses allowed in specific neighborhoods, made two years ago, has been languishing in committee with little chance of passage.
In October 1997, the Council did pass a law drastically increasing the penalties for multiple violations of the noise code. Establishments that repeatedly "cause or permit" music louder than 45 decibels to be heard in neighboring residences can be fined up to $24,000; the maximum fine had been $8,000. (For purposes of comparison, normal conversation is 60 decibels, while the level for the audience of a rock concert can be 115 decibels or more.)
But there is no agreement on whether the new law has been effective.
"We can't see any correlation between the change in fines and the number of summonses or complaints one way or the other," said John Scanlon, chief of patrol for the Police Department. He and Mr. Sturcken of the Department of Environmental Protection both said that the number of calls to their agencies' complaint lines went way up when the change in the law was first made public, but had since fallen off.
"Most people don't bother to call up to complain about noise," said Ms. Duffy of Community Board 1. Instead, people tend to complain at community meetings.
Even A. Gifford Miller, the councilman from the Upper East Side of Manhattan who sponsored the bill, is qualified in his assessment of the harsher penalties.
"It deals only with repeat offenders," he said, "and there are lots of cases of people who are not being repeatedly cited."
"We've still got a long way to go," he added.
Community groups agree. Frustrated at their inability to remove offending businesses and social halls from their neighborhoods through zoning, they have turned to the courts and other government agencies, with varying degrees of success.
Most turn first to the State Liquor Authority. By law, all bars and restaurants serving alcohol must be licensed by the authority. Community boards review the appropriateness of each prospective license, and forward their findings to the authority. Although their recommendations are only advisory, most boards take their role seriously, as do their constituents.
"In some ways, people are treating us as if we were the zoning agency," said Ms. Duffy of Community Board 1.
Some boards act as if they were. Even though licensed establishments in Manhattan may stay open until 4 a.m., Community Board 4 in Chelsea recently recommended to the liquor agency that a planned restaurant to be called Chelsea Place be granted a license only on the condition that it close at 2 a.m., and that its owners meet monthly with board members to deal with any problems.
The owners agreed to some of the conditions, including the 2 a.m. closing. They promised that Chelsea Place would remain a restaurant and not become a bar or a club, as has happened with other establishments in the neighborhood.
"I call it morphing," said Maria Garcia, a member of the community board. She fears that the restaurant may try to amend its license if it can show some kind of hardship.
"The liquor authority is there to keep places in business," she said. "If that happens, they're never going to close down a place like this."
Her misgivings are shared by members of many Manhattan community boards. As a result, most concentrate their efforts on stopping new bars from opening altogether.
Their recommendations center on the so-called 500-foot law passed by the State Legislature in 1993. That law forbids any new drinking establishment if there are already three others within a 500-foot radius. The law permits exemptions, however, if the authority finds that they are in the public interest.
Public interest can mean many things, like increases in jobs and tax revenues. Over the years, many bars and restaurants that fall within the purview of the 500-foot law have received licenses on that basis, despite opposition from some residents.
 
Fighting Back, And Sometimes Winning
But residents have been fighting back, and sometimes they have won. One recent victory involved a building at 372 Broadway, on the border of TriBeCa and Chinatown. Last year the liquor agency turned down a proposal by the Bowery Room Corporation, which had previously run a club in Greenwich Village, to open a nightclub there.
Community board members, the East TriBeCa Community Association, a local group, and Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed banded together to oppose the granting of a liquor license. They contended that the area had become increasingly residential during the last few years, and that the proposed club, which would have had more than 10,000 square feet on three floors, accommodating 800 patrons, was simply too much for the neighborhood. The liquor agency agreed, and its decision was upheld in State Supreme Court.
"I think there's been a real turnaround with the State Liquor Authority," said Barry Mallin, the lawyer who represented local groups in the case. In other words, licenses are no longer approved without question.
In other neighborhoods, like the East Village, the authority has allowed dozens of bars to open, many on the same block. The authority's willingness to defer to community concern is of no help when there is no liquor license, as in the case of Makor, the Jewish social center on West 67th Street, where residents complained of loud music and noisy young people on the street.
Because of the growing protest, there is concern on the part of many of the city's clubs and restaurants. One person who is especially worried is Robert Bookman, the lawyer for the New York Nightlife Association, a trade group representing about 80 cabaret, bar and restaurant owners.
He acknowledges that there are bars and clubs at which patrons are unruly. But he asserts that many neighbors have "unrealistic expectations" about the amount of noise that is appropriate in the city.
He also contends that the police often cite clubs and bars as offenders when their customers should be blamed. "If a patron after a hockey game gets into a fight in the street," he wrote in a recent issue of his association's newsletter, "Madison Square Garden is not issued a summons."
Mostly, though, Mr. Bookman says, outdated zoning is at the heart of the problem.
"Nightclubs always explored new areas of the city, opened new neighborhoods," he said. "Now these neighborhoods are increasingly residential, and there is no place where there isn't some sort of opposition."
"You can have a place on the West Side Highway, and then people will move in next door," he said. As a result, "professional entrepreneurs are looking to other cities" like Aspen, Los Angeles or Miami, all of which he called more business-friendly.
Such an exodus would undoubtedly delight opponents of noisy bars and restaurants, like Ms. Ramaci of Community Board 3, who said she would welcome the return of "the shoe repair shops, dry cleaners and pet food stores that the clubs have driven from the neighborhood," not to mention "a good night's sleep."
But it would bode ill for New York's nightlife industry, which entertains 24 million patrons annually, Mr. Bookman said.
"If the trend continues, it will change the city," he said. "And not for the better."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
National Debt? The Sum Depends on The Candidate

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"IT'S TIME for "Fiscal Jeopardy."
The first answer is: About $3.5 trillion, and falling rapidly. 
 The correct question is: What is the national debt?
The next answer: About $5.6 trillion and rising rapidly.
The question: What is the national debt?
Confused? Well, there are going to be many confusing claims and counterclaims emanating from the presidential campaign trail in the next few months about who will do more to put the federal government's finances in order. And they start with very different definitions of the debt.
Vice President Al Gore puts his emphasis on the national debt held by the public, the $3.5 trillion that the government has borrowed by selling Treasury securities to individual investors, banks, pension funds and foreign governments.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is taking the view that the government's obligations include not just the public debt, but also the special bonds it is issuing to the Social Security system in ever-growing amounts, representing promises to pay retirement benefits in decades ahead. By that accounting, the current $5.6 trillion in total debt will grow inexorably for years to come.
The differences are coming into play as the candidates hurtle into a high-intensity debate about how to shore up Social Security in time for the aging of the baby boomers.
Mr. Gore has made paying off the entire public debt by 2013 the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He wants to use excess Social Security revenue -- more than $2 trillion over the next decade -- to do it.
Mr. Gore would then channel the interest savings from debt reduction to Social Security, in effect committing trillions of dollars of general tax revenue to keep the system afloat. In that way, he would extend the system's solvency from 2037 to around 2050 without cutting benefits, raising payroll taxes or altering the way Social Security works.
In addition to helping deal with Social Security in a relatively painless way, Mr. Gore's plan would free up trillions of dollars for other kinds of investment, helping to put downward pressure on interest rates and create new economic opportunities for companies and individuals.
Mr. Bush's approach is different. This week he plans to set out a goal of adding private investment accounts to Social Security, a major change that would require hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars over the next decade. The only place to find that money is the Social Security surplus.
To the extent that the surplus is used to finance private accounts, it would not be available to reduce the public debt, a goal in which Mr. Gore sees both economic logic and considerable political appeal.
But Mr. Bush's team argues that reducing the public debt is not the only way to improve the government's financial condition. Because the private investment accounts would replace part of the government's obligation to pay Social Security benefits in the long run, his approach would in effect reduce the debt, broadly defined.
"You'd be improving the government's balance sheet in an even more efficient way," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the former Federal Reserve governor who is Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser.
The scale of any reduction in total debt under Mr. Bush's approach would depend on the amount of money committed to the private accounts, a decision that Mr. Bush says should be made through bipartisan negotiations after he is elected.
Under Mr. Gore's approach, the public debt would sink steadily, but all the while the Treasury's obligation to the Social Security trust fund would be rising even faster, from $855 billion today to $4.2 trillion in 2013. So even if the public debt is retired on Mr. Gore's schedule, the total debt would rise, from $5.6 trillion today to $6.8 trillion in 2013.
The two plans are pretty much a wash when it comes to improving national savings. "Whether you're taking $100 billion and buying down debt or adding it to a pool of private funds available for investment doesn't make a great deal of difference," said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Gore's approach is conservative in the sense that it is based on debt reduction, but it affirms Democratic orthodoxy by retaining Social Security as a guaranteed benefit, even if tax revenue must pay for it.
Mr. Bush bucks mainstream economic thinking to a degree when he plays down the importance of wiping out the public debt. But at heart, his plan is about transferring some control of retirement finances from the government to individuals -- a most basic conservative value.
We'll be back with the final round of "Fiscal Jeopardy" in November, when the voters will decide.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: PARK SLOPE;
Profits and Diversity Jostle At a Gentrification Forum

BYLINE: By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
Some trembled with emotion as they recounted horror stories about apartment-snatching real estate brokers. Others voiced support for small-property owners who could now afford to send their children to college, thanks to soaring local rents.
They were among nearly 200 Park Slope residents who packed a forum entitled "The Gentrification of Park Slope" Thursday night at Public School 321 on Seventh Avenue to discuss the pros and cons of the neighborhood's increasing prosperity. The panel included a community leader, an urban sociologist, a real estate agent and a property owner. 
 The issue, panelists said, revolves around balancing free market forces with the economic and ethnic heterogeneity that many residents say first attracted them to the area.
"Can we find ways to honor the values of our neighborhood -- diversity, affordability and long-term residents -- even when they conflict with many of our interests?" asked Brad Lander, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee. "Do we want the person paying $600 or $700 a month to be able to continue to live where their families have lived for years, even when the market forces raise that apartment to $1,500 to $1,800?"
Mr. Lander said his committee has recommended a voluntary "displacement-free zone" for blocks where lower-income families are in danger of being evicted in favor of tenants who can pay twice or three times as much rent.
But Roger Melzer, a panelist who is a property owner and a board member of a neighborhood revitalization group, countered by saying, "I'm happy to be enjoying the benefits of what's happening in the real estate market, and I'm not ashamed of that."
Sharon Zukin, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York, said market forces could only be resisted through political action. Marc Gerstein, president of Warren Lewis Realty, suggested that the way to preserve diversity in high-priced areas is to improve education and give everyone the opportunity to earn high incomes.
Some audience members said real estate brokers were to blame for escalating housing prices. Sheree Lane angrily described how, after she had signed a contract to buy a co-op she had been renting and then applied for board approval, a real-estate broker on the board persuaded the seller to hold out for more money. "Co-ops should not operate as real estate cartels," she said.
Carl Giangrande, a property owner, said he hoped the high real estate values would spread gentrification into surrounding areas.
"I look forward to the day we'll have this discussion in East New York," he said.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS with WILBUR L. ROSS Jr.;
In Accounting, Separating Church and State

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
THE stock market has turned ugly, cutting off potential cash for Internet companies, many of which can measure their life expectancies in months. And accounting concerns, so often ignored when stocks are rising, are again becoming an issue in corporate America.
In a speech last Wednesday, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, threw a harsh spotlight on the often close relationships between accounting firms and the companies they audit. Mr. Levitt warned that accounting firms doubling as consultants might be tempted to go easy on audits to keep clients happy and the consulting business flowing. 
 It seems like a good time to talk to Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who has made a very successful career of buying stakes in seriously troubled companies. At 62, an age when many people are considering retirement, Mr. Ross has not lost his appetite for the game. Two months ago, he made waves when he announced that he would leave Rothschild Inc., his home for 24 years, to form his own investment firm, W. L. Ross & Company.
Mr. Ross took some time last week to offer his thoughts on accounting, Internet stocks and the broader market. Following are excerpts from the conversation. ALEX BERENSON
 
Q. Is there a structural conflict when accounting firms offer consulting services?
 
A. That is a bit of an issue. I think there's a question -- I think it's dangerous when a person tries to wear more hats than he has heads, because it makes for complicated relationships. What I think gets more complex is if somebody is a partner in a firm and therefore is benefiting from both the accounting profits and the consulting profits.
At the actual working level, it's accomplishable, but I think it makes more sense to have some kind of separation between the two firms.
 
Q. What do you think has led to the increased number of restatements of corporate earnings over the last few years?
 
A. I frankly think it's the whole concept of the stock market driving business decisions in this country. I think there are an awful lot of companies that are hugely obsessed with the progression of quarterly earnings. There's such intense pressure on the earnings results that companies are tempted to find ways to regularize their earnings and meet forecasts. Too many companies have reacted by using very aggressive concepts of reported earnings, and that has led to a lot of pressure on the accountants.
 
Q. For investors, what is the No. 1 red flag? Some analysts say it is companies with positive reported earnings but negative cash flow.
 
A. You can invent earnings. It's really hard to invent cash flow. And when a company goes bankrupt, it's not usually because they run out of earnings. It's because they run out of cash.
 
Q. A lot of young companies are now bleeding cash. Are they likely to go bankrupt?
 
A. People forget that when the automobile industry started, there were something like 100 manufacturers of cars. Now there are only three. And it wasn't because the car wasn't a revolutionary product, because it was. And it wasn't because the market didn't become a huge market, because it did.
I think it's very unfortunate that investors have moved into the position of venture capitalists, financing early-stage companies. It's very hard for the private individual investor just looking at the prospectus, and not having a business plan, and not doing any due diligence, and maybe not even reading it, to make an informed decision.
For the companies, I think there will be three different outcomes. I think some will just go by the boards; they will run out of cash and go bankrupt. A few already have, and I think more to come. I think there will be another pattern that will get venture money, even though that's the reverse of the current pattern, getting venture money after you go public, and maybe strategic partner financing. And I think the third category will get normal financing, from banks or the public markets. But I think the public markets are largely closed for most companies.

Q. What about the overall economy?
 
A. I don't think it's Armageddon, but I do believe the probabilities are that our economy is headed to a slower period. I do think there have been a lot of individual excesses in the marketplace, and those will have to be corrected. It shouldn't be that any brand-new person with a few hours in a training course can make a fortune trading stocks.

The Economy Is New, But Not the Standards

BYLINE: By PATRICK J. LYONS 

 BODY:
Wall Street is fond of saying that dot-coms are a breed apart, that none of the old-economy financial and valuation standards necessarily apply. Does the same go for how these new corporations are managed and governed at the top?
Hardly, according to a new survey of institutional investors to be released this week. Two-thirds of respondents said they expected Internet-company boards to be well stocked with members who are independent of management and are competent to oversee important areas of the company's business, just as those on boards of old-economy companies are. 
 "Forward-thinking dot-com companies should closely review their corporate governance practices" in light of the findings, said John T. W. Hawkins of Russell Reynolds Associates, the executive search firm that sponsored the survey, the fifth in an annual series. "The leading companies are starting to migrate away from the small, venture capital dominated board model to larger, more diverse boards."
Money managers surveyed by Wirthlin Worldwide early this year thought new-economy compensation practices needed another look as well. A big majority of the 409 respondents, drawn from the United States and six European countries, favored pricing the stock options granted to officers and directors at a premium, so that recipients benefit only if the stock performs well. And they opposed repricing option grants in a down market without a shareholder vote.
The investors had some expectations for old-economy boards, too. More than two-thirds said every company's board should have a formal Internet issues committee, and nearly as many said every board should include at least one technology expert. And their money is where their mouth is: A majority said they steered away from investing in companies with unsatisfactory governance practices. PATRICK J. LYONS

HEADLINE: Heard the One About Hip Newark?

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS CENTURY 

 BODY:
ON a recent Thursday evening, at the grand opening of Maize restaurant, a crowd of men in five-button suits and young women wearing Prada and DKNY mingled over passed hors d'oeuvres of tuna tartare, sipping glasses of Gray Goose vodka. As a jazz singer in a spaghetti-strap dress sang "La Vie en Rose," flashbulbs captured the smiles of young artists and musicians, next to the beaming mayor, two former governors and the ageless baseball icon Yogi Berra.
It may have looked like the opening of the latest bistro on Park Avenue South or Spring Street, but what made the gathering notable was that it wasn't in Manhattan at all; it was in downtown Newark, a city not much known for chichi restaurants and the clientele to match. 
 "There's this incredible energy of young artists and writers and musicians coming here, drawn to the realness of the city," said Verushka Spirito, a young woman with a Sinead O'Connor haircut, who stood at the bar with friends.
The opening of Maize, at 50 Park Place, inside the historic Robert Treat Hotel, was certainly a big event by Newark standards; it is easily the most fashionable restaurant the city has seen in years, with a sleek, airy dining room, cigar lounge and tearoom, and an executive chef, Pat Kotsonis, whose resume includes Le Bernardin and Bouley.
It's another indication that a city long moribund, an easy target of late-night monologuists ("First prize is one week in Newark; second prize is two weeks in Newark") is reawakening. Besides an economic resurgence and ambitious real estate developments, Newark is seeing a much less publicized flowering of artists, writers and musicians -- honest-to-goodness bohemians. Hard to believe, but it may be transforming itself into a cool city.
Last Saturday night, Queen Latifah -- the rapper, actress, talk show host and Newark native -- gave a record-release party for her Flavor Unit Entertainment stable of hip-hop artists at Groove, a local nightclub. She is negotiating to develop the Griffith Building on Broad Street into luxury apartments, a restaurant and a nightclub. Shaquille O'Neal, the National Basketball Association's most valuable player, sneaks back to his native Newark from Los Angeles for soul food at Je's Restaurant on Halsey Street, and he is also looking to invest in the city, Mayor Sharpe James said.
Rumors have swirled that Robert De Niro is taking over a waterfront restaurant, though Mr. De Niro's partner in the TriBeCa Grill in Manhattan, Drew Nieporent, said he was unaware of any such plans. Well then, maybe James Gandolfini should think of buying into a riverfront bistro; after all, his Tony Soprano -- inarguably the coolest character on television today -- came by his childhood neuroses in Newark.
It is not the Jersey chic of "The Sopranos," however, that is luring artistically inclined young people to inner Newark. Nor is it the recent building boom, which includes a new baseball park where the minor-league Newark Bears play and a downtown arena that will be home to the New Jersey Nets and the Devils by 2004.
Instead, young transplants cite the reasonable rents and 15-minute trip to Manhattan by New Jersey Transit train; the vibrant mix of Portuguese, Spanish and Brazilian restaurants and bars in the Ironbound section; and a grass-roots fine arts and music scene, which draws even New Yorkers on a reverse night-time commute.
"We've got a lot of friends that come out from Brooklyn and Manhattan for Sounds of the City," Elisabeth Ssenjovu, a programmer of events at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, said of the free outdoor series she oversees. It begins June 1 and features spoken word, rap, reggae, Latin jazz, Dominican and Haitian music. "It's Sounds of the City, not sounds of the suburbs," she added.
Lawrence P. Goldman, the president of the three-year-old performing arts center, which normally books top national artists like the Mark Morris Dance Group, pointed out that the home-grown outdoor series has played an interesting role in the city's social life. "There's a huge young middle-class now in Newark -- white, African-American and Hispanic -- for which there had previously been no civic gathering place," he said. "Basically, what Newark really needed was a good singles scene. That's what Sounds of the City provides, and it doesn't require police or security guards. All it requires is young people willing to meet each other and have a good time."
Naturally, there are skeptics. Many Manhattanites, familiar with the stigma of crime and urban decay that has long hung over this, New Jersey's largest city and still one of its poorest, refuse to believe there's a new Newark. "Get out of here," said Chris Hulbert, a publicist, who has represented trendy New York clubs like Hush and Ohm. "There's no way Newark is cool."
But to spend an afternoon and evening with Ms. Ssenjovu and some of her friends is to get an unmistakable taste of the East Village on the Passaic River. There is a thriving literary movement, ranging from the online Newark Review to a spoken-word series -- whose host is Ras Baraka, a son of Amiri Baraka, the former LeRoi Jones -- at the Lama Lounge on Linden Street.
There's the smoky, couch-filled Euphoria Cafe, in the shadow of the Prudential Insurance Company's global headquarters, at Broad and Academy Streets, which draws a dreadlocked collegiate crowd (and even some suits from Prudential) to poetry slams.
In many ways, Ms. Ssenjovu, 24, tall, lean and wildly energetic, seems to embody the hip side of Newark. "I grew up in the Jersey suburbs, in Union County," she said. "My family's originally from the Ironbound. They're Italians who moved out to the suburbs, and I guess I've come full circle now." She lives with her husband, Patrick, a Ugandan-born actor and performer, in a renovated chocolate factory in the Ironbound, which got its name from the rail lines that encircle it.
Stephanie Voulgaris, the owner of Maize, who was born and raised in Kalamata, Greece, says she has waited years for the city's long-trumpeted renaissance to finally take hold. "I got excited about three years ago in all the activities upcoming in Newark, and I decided that's where I wanted to invest in and to stay," she said. When the arts center opened, "there was no doubt in my mind that it was no longer just a dream -- it was a reality," she continued, adding: "I'd say that the difference I've seen in three years is breathtaking. There are streets where nobody ever wanted to be around 6 p.m., and now people freely walk around at 10 or 11 o'clock."
A generation ago, Harper's magazine called Newark, which never fully recovered from the rioting of the 1960's, the "worst city in America." Its vast tracts of housing projects inspired the nickname Brick City. Nowadays, violent crime is down more than 50 percent from 1995, and real estate values in the immigrant-heavy Ironbound have risen 30 to 40 percent since 1997.
As they toured the streets of the working-class Ironbound, Ms. Ssenjovue and her posse of friends, including Fernando Baptista, born in Portugal, and Khabirah Myers, a native of Newark, jokingly acknowledged that they have the look of a walking Benetton ad.
"I don't know if it's just my generation, or my group of friends, but everybody seems to be in an interracial relationship," Ms. Ssenjovu said. "My husband and I feel very comfortable here, he being African, me being white. I've traveled a lot, but this is the first place I feel is home. I lived in Berlin, I lived in London. I certainly don't feel at home in the suburbs, but it's weird, I really feel at home in Newark."
Lori Barcliff, a young woman who also works at the performing arts center, said, "My family came to Newark in the 30's; my grandparents lived in the West Ward, near South Orange Avenue." After attending college in California and living in Florida, she returned to New Jersey to live in the Ironbound. "I like the cafe culture that's on Ferry Street," she added. "You go to the grocery store, the bakery, the Portuguese fish market, and you can basically do all your shopping on Ferry Street and not have to get in the car."
Asked about recent high-profile investment in the city, including the 11-acre sports arena site that also calls for bars, shops and restaurants, Ms. Ssenjovu said with mock horror: "Just please don't say we're the new Hoboken! That's my biggest fear in the world." She sees Hoboken as a case of gentrification run amok.
"Newark's still got an urban flavor that I don't think will be changed by that," she said. "It's still really edgy."
Ms. Spirito agreed. "You don't want people moving in and all these yuppie bars erupting and suddenly you're losing the Brazilian flavor and the Portuguese flavor," she said. "You'll lose the Haitian community and the Cuban community. That's what makes Newark, and we have to make sure it stays."
For years, Newark has been known as a hip-hop and rhythm and blues hotbed, spawning such artists as Redman, Canibus, Faith Evans, Rah Digga and Lauryn Hill, whose remembrances of her childhood there are captured in her song "Every Ghetto, Every City." ("Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been/ Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem.")
At his desk in the Beaux-Arts City Hall, which has served as the backdrop for Hollywood films like "Presumed Innocent," Mayor James said, "Many of these up-and-coming rap artists have gained strength through struggle, have stepped over a crack vial, stepped over a hypodermic needle, and onto the stage of life."
The city's greatest living cultural figure, however, is a Newark expatriate. From his debut novel, "Goodbye, Columbus," in 1959 to his latest, "The Human Stain," Philip Roth, a product of Newark's Weequahic section, has "turned his bleak part of Jersey and its people into a kind of Jewish Yoknapatawpha County," Robert Stone wrote in a review of another novel, referring to Faulkner's fictional setting.
Mr. Roth's Newark is spectral; the lower- and middle-class Jewish milieu has largely vanished, and his references to contemporary Newark can be biting. "My father was one of those Prince Street guys who loved that city all his life," recounts Swede Levov, the tragic hero of "American Pastoral." "What happened to Newark broke his heart. It's the worst city in the world." He adds: "Used to be the city where they manufactured everything. Now it's the car-theft capital of the world."
Those fictional reminiscences, circa 1995, are now out of date. For one thing, Newark no longer leads the nation in car theft. And many of the 19th-century factories that housed the city's leather, garment and toy manufacturers are seeing a rebirth. On Tuesday, as the temperature topped 90 degrees, Ben Polsky paced around his fourth-floor loft in a factory building on New Jersey Railroad Avenue, wearing shorts and flip-flops.
Mr. Polsky, 34, is a painter, and he shares a 3,500-square-foot loft with his wife, Holli Schworno, 35, also an artist. "The scene here is very organic," he said. "The artists who have come to Newark are a lot less interested in meeting a bunch of other artists down at a cafe; they're interested in having enough space to work and still have some semblance of a family life."
Originally from Miami, Mr. Polsky moved to Newark eight years ago from New York's Lower East Side. He and Ms. Schworno came before the economic boom, when it was still possible to rent 3,000 square feet for $600 a month. And while rents have risen substantially since then, huge studios in the Ironbound still cost a fraction of those in New York City.
In Manhattan, "what they call artists' lofts all look like multimillion-dollar Ikea ads," he said. His loft, across the street from the elevated railroad tracks separating the downtown from the Ironbound, is undeniably authentic: stiflingly hot, paint-splattered, strewn with art-making debris. He smiled and sopped the sweat from his forehead as a New Jersey Transit train whirred past his window at eye level. "We call that our toy train."
Mr. Polsky still hears the skepticism from his Brooklyn and Manhattan friends about Newark's newfound hipness. "We get that all the time," he said, "and quite frankly I hope it continues."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
In Bonds, Worrywarts or the Wise?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
STOCK investors are optimists by nature, believing that rising share prices can help them achieve their hopes and dreams. The boys and girls in bondland, by contrast, are professional worriers, looking for clouds long before they appear on the horizon.
So it was quite in character last week that the corporate bond market struggled mightily while the major stock indexes held their ground. Still, the gulf between the two markets is remarkably wide. 
 Most people on Wall Street expect the Federal Reserve to raise the federal funds rate by a half-percentage point on Tuesday. Stock investors seem to think the Fed will cool the economy but not stop it cold.
But the bond market acts as if grave economic danger lies ahead. Yields on low-grade corporate bonds are six percentage points above 10-year Treasury yields, a spread also seen in 1998, when Russia defaulted on its debt. Remarkably, high-yield bonds of United States companies recently yielded more than emerging-market debt.
The signals from low-grade bonds of small companies are even worse than in 1998. Martin S. Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the yields on small issues now average 3.5 percentage points more than those of large issues. During the Russian crisis, this spread peaked at around 2.5 percentage points.
One of the bond market's biggest problems is that Wall Street dealers are so loath to commit capital that investors are finding it harder to get out of trades. "Dealer liquidity is dramatically reduced in both the high-yield and high-grade markets," said Gary Goodenough, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles in New York. "This creates more volatility, larger swings and more of a discontinuous market."
Companies are having difficulty raising money. Thomson Securities Data says issuance of corporate bonds is down 20.6 percent this year, versus 1999. Last week, not one high-yield bond issue came to market, a first for this year.
Clearly, bond investors see much greater risk in the market today. One concern is that even in a torrid economy, the default rate is rising -- to 5.6 percent on high-yield bonds, according to Moody's, up from around 3 percent recently. It will rise to 7.7 percent by April 2001, Moody's predicts.
Bond issues from untested companies have made investing in corporate debt much trickier. When investors buy a bond, they try to predict what they will get back if it defaults. In the past, most could count on the return of at least some fraction of their original investment. But the Iridium L.L.C. bankruptcy, in which bondholders will be lucky to get anything, changed expectations.
Another problem is that the securities typically used by investors to hedge corporate bond or mortgage holdings -- Treasury bonds -- no longer work. As the Treasury buys back debt, a stampede of buyers for remaining issues has thrown prices out of sync with the overall market. Hedging a bond position is so hard that many buyers have run away.
"The fixed-income market is rightly assigning a higher risk premium to companies now," said Stan Jonas, managing director at Fimat U.S.A., a broker-dealer in New York. He expects the Fed to raise rates on Tuesday, but unlike many economists, he thinks this increase might be the last. The higher rates, he reckons, will set off financial turmoil -- perhaps a high-profile failure -- forcing the Fed to back off from further rate increases. "When the Fed begins to put on the brakes, somebody goes through the windshield," he said. "We just don't know who it is."

The Line Forms Here For Northern Exposure

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
CANADA has been called a nation that hews wood and draws water, even though it is home to some of the world's most successful high-technology companies. And after years in the financial wilderness, its economy and its stock market are on the prowl again.
With little fanfare, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite stock index has done much better so far this year than major market indexes elsewhere. 
 The TSE 300 was up 9.5 percent through Friday, compared with a decline of 3.3 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Last year, the TSE 300 outperformed the S.& P. 500, rising 31.7 percent in Canadian dollar terms.
Still, the numbers may be deceiving. Nortel Networks, the big telecommunications company, represents nearly 26 percent of the TSE 300's market value. Last year, the stock rose more than 400 percent. Through Friday, it was up more than 6 percent.
"When your top stock is viewed that favorably, that is very positive," said David Picton, a portfolio manager with Synergy Asset Management in Toronto.
There are other positives besides Nortel.
Price increases for oil and natural gas, as well as for other raw materials, are lifting Canadian natural-resource companies. And the prospect of further consolidation in the financial services industry has put a floor under bank stocks, despite rising interest rates in the United States.
Perhaps most important, the Canadian economy is starting to hum.
In a commentary on Wednesday, David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Merrill Lynch Canada, wrote that "today's economy is arguably the strongest it's been since the mid-1960's."
Mr. Rosenberg said that if consensus forecasts proved correct, the Canadian economy should grow by more than 4 percent this year, adjusted for inflation, and an additional 3.5 percent in 2001.
Benign inflation is another plus. Prices are rising at an annual rate of around 1.5 percent, well below most of the important inflation measures in the United States. And exports are surging.
All of this suggests that the Canadian dollar, which has been in the doldrums, should be rising in value against other currencies, particularly the American dollar. That has not happened yet -- a major positive for American investors, analysts said.
"The currency is cheap and stable," said Robert J. Haber, chief investment officer for Fidelity Canada Ltd., a unit of Fidelity Investments.
Is it too late for investors to buy in? Leila Heckman, managing director of global asset allocation for Salomon Smith Barney, said that eight or nine months ago, Canada "was one of our dream markets."
"The market has moved up a bit," Ms. Heckman said, "but it is still our second choice among developed-country markets behind France."
While many Canadian companies, like Nortel and Celestica, which makes products for Lucent Technologies and Nokia, are listed on both Canadian and American exchanges, most are not. Of the 300 stocks that make up the Toronto index, Ms. Heckman said, only 10 percent are traded in New York.
Mort Cohen, an expatriate Canadian who is chairman of Clarion Partners in Cleveland, which manages about $150 million in hedge and venture funds, said that about 25 percent of his firm's portfolio was invested in Canadian energy stocks.
Mr. Cohen said he owned Anderson Exploration, Canadian Occidental and Talisman Energy, and two drillers -- Precision Drilling and the Ensign Resource Service Group.
Mr. Picton at Synergy Asset Management also owns Anderson Exploration, as well as Alberta Energy and Canadian Natural Resources. Despite Nortel's lofty valuation, he said he likes it for long-term investors. And he said that while he was not very excited about Canadian financial stocks, particularly the banks, he was a big fan of Toronto Dominion Bank.
"Our banks are ripe for consolidation," he said. "That will carry them for the next 6 to 12 months. But beyond that, they are shrinking relative to international competition."
Toronto Dominion is another story. "Toronto Dominion has a big holding in TD Waterhouse," he said, referring to the the New York-based online brokerage firm, one of the top five. "I think TD Waterhouse has the capability of becoming an Internet bank."
THE downside risk to further increases in Canadian stock prices is the 800-pound gorilla next door.
"If the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy too much and the U.S. economy rolls over, Canada will feel that recession," said Dan Chornous, chief strategist at RBC Dominion Securities in Toronto.
"But if there is a soft landing in the U.S.," "corporate earnings in Canada will prove to be sustainable," he continued. "At that juncture, the Canadian market will be really well-placed."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
Why G.M. Is Getting A Cold Shoulder

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
THE car business is booming these days -- in Europe, Mexico and Brazil as well as in the United States -- and the shares of General Motors have climbed nearly 17 percent so far this year. Of course, G.M. has major technology exposure in the form of its Hughes Electronics business. (While G.M. owns all of Hughes's assets, G.M.'s class H shares are designed to track the unit's earnings independently.)
Even with G.M.'s run-up, however, its stock trades at less than nine times projected earnings, scarcely one-third the average multiple accorded the Dow industrials. 
 Yet analysts have recently soured on G.M., still the world's biggest company by revenue. In the last two weeks, many of them have cut their ratings on the stock.
One of them, John A. Casesa, a managing director at Merrill Lynch, took time on Thursday to explain his change of heart about G.M. and why its archrival, Ford Motor, seems relatively attractive. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. We know that investors usually look ahead, not in rear-view mirrors. But sales are still setting records, with G.M.'s new pickup trucks a huge hit. What's not to like?
 
A. Autos are early-cycle stocks. They tend to outperform dramatically as the economy recovers and underperform later. We're very deep into this current cycle. Since 1991, 130 million vehicles have been sold in the U.S. Essentially, every household has replaced at least one vehicle. It's a risky time to invest.
 
Q. But everybody seemed to love the stock until the last few weeks. What's changed?
 
A. It has been terrific because the company's done some brilliant financial engineering. It is monetizing a big chunk of its very valuable stake in Hughes Electronics, essentially using high-priced Hughes stock to buy back low-priced G.M. common.
The reason we lowered our opinion is that this transaction, which was announced in February, comes to an end May 19. Then the outlook goes back to automotive fundamentals, which is a very peaky market and, in G.M.'s case, means a continuing struggle to stabilize its market share.
 
Q. But aren't the new Silverado and Sierra pickups quite competitive?
 
A. There's a big shift in emphasis in the company's plans, away from passenger cars and toward light trucks. But it's largely catch-up. The new products are better than the old ones, but they still have to contend with the declining competitiveness of these older products.
 
Q. G.M.'s market capitalization of about $53 billion is only one-eighth that of Cisco. Could somebody like Rupert Murdoch really take it over, as some people have suggested?
 
A. There's a great deal of interest in Hughes, in particular its DirecTV business. The rumored buyers are News Corporation and even Disney. Even after the current deal, G.M. will still own more than $10 billion of the Hughes tracking stock, or 15 percent.
Investors are eager to know whether someone will come along and pay a big premium for Hughes and spin off the automotive business. But it's not that easy to do. Since G.M. owns 100 percent of Hughes's equity, it would require a very friendly deal with G.M.; it would have to get done on their terms. And there are very practical political, labor and regulatory issues.
 
Q. But G.M.'s history has been to sell off noncore businesses, as with Delphi last year.
 
A. That's right. In fact, it's not a matter of if G.M. will divest the rest of Hughes, it's a matter of when. They want to get the maximum price, and capital gains are a consideration. Divestiture is not around the corner.
 
Q. What are you advising clients to do about the offer expiring on May 19 to swap each share of their G.M. stock for 1.065 shares of Hughes?
 
A. We're advising that people tender. It's a very attractive way to get some Hughes and lower your exposure to the auto business. But the deal is limited so you won't be able to exchange all your shares, only 14 percent of them if every G.M. share was tendered.
 
Q. At the same time, you're recommending putting money into Ford. Why?
 
A. Just as G.M. is completing this value-enhancing transaction, Ford is about to do the same thing on a smaller scale.
Ford, which has billions in excess capital, will give shareholders a big cash dividend sometime before the end of July and then spin off to them its parts business called Visteon.
 
Q. Is Ford better as a car company than G.M.?
 
A. I think so. Its margins are higher, and it has acquired Jaguar, Volvo and now is adding Land Rover. . . . This takes the product line more upscale, and luxury cars are far more profitable than mass-market cars. And Ford has laid out a credible plan to improve its European business, which has been a mess.

HEADLINE: The World: AIDS in South Africa;
A President Misapprehends a Killer

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

 BODY:
THE tone and substance of the letter was so peculiar that some officials in Washington thought it was a hoax. In a five-page letter to President Clinton last month, South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, argued that his country had to chart its own course in dealing with AIDS, including consulting those who challenged prevailing views on the causes and treatments of the disease.
A "campaign of intellectual intimidation and terrorism" akin to "medieval book-burning" was keeping such voices from being heard, Mr. Mbeki wrote. 
 The letter was no hoax, and it touched off an uproar, in part because South Africa's democratic politics and advanced industry make it the natural leader in the fight against a disease that has devastated Africa. This status was acknowledged in the nation's selection to sponsor this year's international AIDS conference. Yet here was Nelson Mandela's anointed successor questioning many years of scientific research. Never mind that Mr. Mandela hardly mentioned the disease during his presidency.
In the weeks since, many South Africans have engaged in a kind of psychoanalysis of the 57-year-old president they elected last year. Why did this cultured man, educated as an economist at Sussex University in England, take such a position? What does he gain from it?
Mr. Mbeki is the only African leader to have questioned the consensus theory on AIDS. He has, moreover, an embattled history with the disease, having first become embroiled in the scientific debate three years ago, when Mr. Mandela's cabinet backed research into Virodene, a supposed cure developed locally that turned out to be carcinogenic.
Attacked by scientists, the health minister in Mr. Mandela's government, which Mr. Mbeki was virtually running, refused to back down, and it later turned out that stock in the company set up to make Virodene had been given to the ruling African National Congress.
Virodene was discredited long before Mr. Mbeki began publicly questioning the causes of AIDS, so there seems little reason to believe that led to his present position. But it helped create the ill-will that exists between the scientific establishment and the A.N.C.
Last year, Mr. Mbeki stunned experts by questioning the safety of the standard anti-AIDS drug AZT, which the government has declined to distribute to pregnant women despite studies indicating that it could greatly reduce the transmission of the virus to newborns.
Still, AIDS activists are shocked by Mr. Mbeki's refusal to accept the standard scientific model of the disease. Political analysts, meanwhile, say they can see little political gain for him or for his party (which took 66 percent of the vote in the 1999 elections) in his stance.
Most see it as a personal decision from a man who, since his teens, has lived largely in exile, petitioning world leaders to help fight apartheid. They say that Mr. Mbeki's desire to reject Western thinking -- and condescension -- is strong, and his speeches have repeatedly called for an African renaissance.
"He is very keen on doing things in an African way and not just accepting the gospel from the West," said Raymond Louw, editor of the weekly newsletter Southern Africa Report. "You hear this all the time."
Wishful thinking about a cheap cure may also have played a part, some say, since South Africa isn't nearly rich enough to afford $15,000 AIDS cocktails, (or even $3,000 ones, if drug companies cut prices, as they indicated they might last week) for the 13 percent of the population that is infected.
Others believe that Mr. Mbeki simply couldn't help himself. He has repeatedly displayed a stubborn inclination to master technical issues in his own way, and in a highly personal speech recently he told of Internet searches with dictionaries at his side as he looked for information that might help him formulate his country's AIDS policies.
Whether his current approach -- convening a "What Causes AIDS?" panel divided between orthodox AIDS researchers and those who believe it is caused by malnutrition and parasites -- will help or hurt his country is an open question. Heading the panel of 33 experts is William Makgoba, who runs South Africa's equivalent of the National Institute of Health. Mr. Makgoba strongly supports the standard model of AIDS, but said that bringing the dissidents "into the tent" will be a good thing.
MR. MAKGOBA believes Mr. Mbeki to be a "very intellectual person" who is trying to inform himself on a disease that is ravaging his country. He wishes, however, that Mr. Mbeki had informed himself in private, fearing that he will be classified "as one of those African leaders who doesn't care about science or technology."
Tom Lodge, a professor of political science at the University of Witwatersrand, says that Mr. Mbeki shows the personality traits of what he calls "an interferer, not a delegater." It is a trait that has come up in other arenas as well, he says.
At the moment, Professor Lodge points out, Mr. Mbeki is shuttling back and forth to Zimbabwe, trying to ease the tensions over the violence that has broken out as supporters of President Robert Mugabe have seized white-owned farms. But Professor Lodge says Mr. Mbeki should let his foreign minister do the traveling. "He is running up to Harare every two minutes like an office boy," Professor Lodge said. "The AIDS issue is the same. Maybe he will learn the lesson that a head of state does not busy himself with details."

HEADLINE: Chernobyl Revisited

 BODY:
Fourteen years after the worst accident in the history of nuclear power, Ukraine seems determined to shut down the lone active reactor remaining at Chernobyl by the end of the year. The long overdue decision will close a reactor that has experienced an unsettling variety of minor failures and end power generation at a complex that once contained four nuclear plants. But in other ways the Chernobyl accident still haunts the people and lands of the former Soviet Union. The steel and concrete shell encasing the radioactive ruins of the destroyed reactor is leaking and must be replaced.
Reactors with similar designs to those at Chernobyl -- and considerable safety problems -- still operate in Russia and Lithuania. Several countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union depend on other types of Soviet-built reactors that also fall short of Western safety standards. These are expensive problems, requiring money that former Soviet bloc nations do not have. The West has provided millions in financial assistance, but it will have to contribute more to improve nuclear safety and close dangerous reactors. 
 The sarcophagus that houses the No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl, the one that exploded in April 1986, is unstable and cracked. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is trying to raise $768 million to reseal the tomb temporarily and to build a new one. So far, the United States and European nations have given only about half that amount. When donor nations meet in Berlin this summer, they must pledge to pay the balance.
A second need is to continue to care for those affected by the Chernobyl disaster. The greatest problem is thyroid cancer in people who were children at the time of the accident. Most of the 2,000 victims so far live in Belarus and are being treated with help from the World Health Organization.
In 1992, the Group of Seven industrialized nations recommended the closure of 25 Soviet-designed reactors, including all Chernobyl-style power plants. These reactors -- there are 14 today -- are considered the most dangerous. Though they have been upgraded to fix the flaws that contributed to the Chernobyl disaster, they remain unsafe. The 43 other Soviet-design reactors in use are considered somewhat safer, but all need more backup systems and other protective measures. The poverty of former Soviet nations adds to the risk. At Chernobyl, for example, maintenance is slighted and employees have often had to wait months for their paychecks.
The desire to join the European Union has encouraged Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria to try to meet European safety standards by scheduling early closing of their most dangerous reactors. It is no small sacrifice for a poor nation to shut down a source of cheap energy. Lithuania, for example, is planning to close one of its two reactors, which together provide 75 percent of the country's power.
The industrialized nations have been talking about helping Ukraine to close Chernobyl for years. Their aid will take the form of loans to complete two new nuclear reactors -- a bad idea, as the reactors will not meet Western safety standards. The safer, if costlier, choice would be to build a coal plant and improve the energy efficiency of existing factories. Few catastrophes have less respect for borders than a nuclear meltdown. Unsafe reactors are an international problem, and decommissioning requires international cooperation.

Wall Street Remains on a Fed Alert

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
A dash of positive economic news and strong quarterly earnings helped pull some stocks out of the dumps, but most investors remain fixated on the Federal Reserve. 
 We had a nice rally at the end of the week, but the volume has been very light, said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company in Milwaukee. The market is really on a Fed watch.
 Fed policy makers are expected to raise short-term interest rates by as much as half a percentage point when they meet on Tuesday. The central bank is concerned that the economy is growing too rapidly and that inflation will heat up.
 But economic data released last week gave some indication that the economy is slowing. The government reported that wholesale prices showed a 0.3 percent decline in April, reversing two months of increases, and that retail sales slowed in the same month.
 Blue-chip stocks posted gains, and many companies reported solid earnings, including Dell Computer.
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 10,609.37, up 31.51 points. The Nasdaq composite index settled at 3,529.06, down 287.76

HEADLINE: MY FIRST JOB;
Your $40 Pledge, Her $3 Tote Bag Work That Matched The Moment

BYLINE: By JEREMY RIFKIN; Written with Barnaby J. Feder; Jeremy Rifkin, 55, a technology gadfly and consultant who heads the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington, has just published "The Age of Access: The New Culture of Hypercapitalism Where All of Life Is A Paid-for Experience" (Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam).

 BODY:
I WORKED during high school for my father, who had a small business on the South Side of Chicago manufacturing plastic bags. He wanted me to take it over, which was supposedly why I went to the University of Pennsylvania to study at the Wharton School, but I had no intention of going back. It was 1963, and I became involved in civil rights and then the antiwar movement.
 After graduate work at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, I got my first real job in summer 1968, as a Vista volunteer. Most of the work involved helping people deal with the welfare system. I lived with Ernestine Royster, a welfare rights activist in Queens, and her eight children, then moved to an East Harlem apartment. It was firebombed, and my car was destroyed. My roommate and I never found out who did it. Vista moved us to Yonkers, and I was assigned to work in White Plains for the rest of my year. 
 I had grown up in a working class neighborhood with poor people. But I learned in Vista that you cannot really know what overwhelming poverty is like until you have lived with the people suffering it. I also learned that grass-roots organizing has its limits, although it took more time to appreciate them. You can get attention in the streets, and that's a prerequisite for change, but it's not enough. You also have to have real policy ideas and a national thrust.
 I think a lot of life is determined by the historical moment you are caught in. If I were seven years older, I might well have ended up running the family business.

HEADLINE: Marchers And Their Imprints

BYLINE: By John B. Judis; John B. Judis is a senior editor of The New Republic and the author of "The Paradox of American Democracy."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
On this Mother's Day, thousands of mothers will march on Washington to demand tough new gun control legislation, but it is unlikely that the Million Mom March will prove effective in getting Congress to act. Americans have been marching on Washington to demand change ever since the populist Jacob Coxey led his ragtag army of the unemployed from Ohio to Washington during the depression of the 1890's. Some of these marches have had lasting and visible effect, but others have been quickly forgotten.
The most successful marches have made straightforward, but far-reaching, demands that the president or Congress could conceivably meet. Participants in the August 1963 civil rights march demanded that Congress pass the civil rights bill that had already been introduced; the antiwar marchers in October 1967 demanded that the Johnson administration get out of Vietnam. 
 The effective marches have also attracted not just unexpectedly large numbers, but usually the participation of important and powerful public figures. Walter Reuther, the head of the United Auto Workers, had a prominent role in the 1963 march, along with Martin Luther King Jr. and the N.A.A.C.P.'s Roy Wilkins. The 1967 antiwar demonstration featured leading literary lights, including Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer, who celebrated the march in "The Armies of the Night."
Perhaps most important, marches that have won the most serious attention have embodied, implicitly or explicitly, the threat of nonviolent civic disruption and national embarrassment. They carried an intimation of chaos, if not in the demonstration itself, then from what could occur afterward. This sort of threat was obvious in the 1932 Bonus March of World War I veterans, which helped discredit President Herbert Hoover, and in the 1967 and 1969 antiwar marches.
This last characteristic has held true for the most successful civil rights demonstrations. The massive 1963 march was entirely peaceful, though its leaders included three proponents of civil disobedience: King, James Farmer of the Congress of Racial Equality and John Lewis of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The march didn't just make a moral appeal; it sent a warning that the more obstreperous parts of the movement would not accept defeat.
One of the most successful marches on Washington never happened at all. In 1941, as the country began preparing for war, A. Phillip Randolph, the chairman of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, began to organize a huge march on Washington to demand that President Franklin Roosevelt issue an executive order banning discrimination in defense industries and the armed forces. Roosevelt, fearful that the demonstration would weaken support among blacks for the coming war effort, capitulated and signed the executive order five days before the march was to occur.
The less successful demonstrations of recent years have all fallen short in at least one crucial respect. Civil rights marches in 1983 and 1993 attracted as many people as the 1963 march, but they lacked either a clear and achievable demand or the threat of disruption. They functioned largely as uplifting social events, as have Earth Day demonstrations, which have become little more than concerts on the Mall. The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Solidarity Day in 1981, which attracted 260,000 demonstrators, and the 300,000-strong abortion rights march in 1989 were forgettable because it was not clear what was being demanded or what exactly would happen if the demands were not met.
Today's Million Mom March promises to be a stirring event. It has certainly inspired political discussion and reflection, and it may contribute to making gun control a more salient issue in the fall elections. The leaders are calling for handgun registration and licensing -- a reasonably dramatic demand -- but they are not even insisting that the president sign on. And the only threat is far off: the marchers' opposition at the polls in November. (Won't most of them be voting for pro-gun control candidates anyway?)
Moreover, there is no hint of disorder. The marchers are not contemplating picketing gun stores, clogging the aisles at gun shows or sitting in at the offices of recalcitrant politicians -- activities that would raise the costs of not taking the moms seriously.
These tactics may not be necessary for getting controls on guns. It might make more sense to create a national organization of mothers who can walk precincts and run ads against politicians who oppose gun control. That's the way much of politics is conducted today, and there is nothing wrong with it. But if that is what the proponents of gun control want to do, then the Million Mom March, no matter how wonderful an occasion, is only a small, and perhaps not even needed, step.
Organizations rarely grow out of marches, as Bayard Rustin, the organizer of the 1963 civil rights march learned when he tried to sustain the coalition.
If the moms marching today are serious about winning the battle over gun control, they will have to show the allies of the National Rifle Association that if they continue to block legislation, they may have to face opposition more daunting than Sunday marchers or precinct walkers.

HEADLINE: The Nation: The Children's Hour;
Hugging and Kissing Your Way Into the White House

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AT first glance, it was hard to say whether the scene looked more like a television chat show or a "Saturday Night Live" parody. There on a Washington stage last month sat Gov. George W. Bush, his wife, Laura, and two prominent Republican officeholders, both women, all in a semicircle and awaiting their first guest.
On cue, out walked an adorable second grader with a giant white bow in her hair, along with one of her teachers. As the women beamed, Mr. Bush asked 7-year-old Elena Douglass, "How is it here in the nation's capital? Are you having a good time?" 
 "Yes, sir, very," she whispered into her hand-held microphone.
"Me too," confided Mr. Bush, who was using her to showcase his interest in literacy and foreign language instruction.
Call it the infantilization of politics. Ever since President Clinton won re-election four years ago with child-centered issues like school uniforms, literacy and teenage smoking, candidates have increasingly behaved as if they are auditioning for the role of Santa Claus, and not running for public office.
Yes, politicians have always kissed babies. And yes, even in 1988, both George Bush, the father, and Michael Dukakis were vying to be the education president. But it was Mr. Clinton who built a whole campaign around children, displaying his empathy for working parents by watching children make model airplanes, or dropping into a school that requires uniforms, or reading along with towheaded tykes.
Bob Dole, his Republican opponent, once complained, "You give President Clinton five minutes on television, he'll mention children 15 times."
This time around there are no complaints. Everybody's doing it. Just try to count how many times over the last year that Mr. Bush has read "The Very Hungry Caterpillar" to kindergartners to demonstrate his commitment to literacy. He said it was his favorite book from childhood -- no matter that it wasn't published until 1969, a year after he graduated from Yale.
Or how about Al Gore in New Hampshire, where he not only knelt to read "Tikvah Means Hope" to 6-year-old Nikkita Gottling, but bought her the book and autographed it?
These days, Mr. Gore can regularly be found in schools, eating in the cafeteria or sitting at a student's desk. This habit may even have raised the level of debate. At one high school, students were discussing the Plessy v. Ferguson case of 1896, in which the United States Supreme Court upheld the concept of separate but equal facilities for blacks and whites.
Voters have put education and the decline of civic and cultural values at the top of their list of concerns. The boomers have made raising children an obsession, while more and more women voters are trying to balance motherhood and work.
"If you will check out your Jeep Cherokee, you will see the vanity mirror is on both sides," said Alex Castellanos, a Republican political consultant. "It's now on the driver's side and the soccer mom has her hand on the steering wheel. The soccer mom is 70 percent of consumer spending. Two out of three new college entrants are women. The economic power has shifted and she's still the key swing voter in suburban America."
What better way to play gender politics than by having a child on your lap? It telegraphs warmth, empathy and understanding. "Everyone who is running for office has to bend over backward to show that they know what it's like to be a typical American family," said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic media consultant.
Anyone who wanted a demonstration of the emotional power of an encounter with a child had only to watch Mr. Clinton hug a boy on crutches at the funeral for Cardinal John O'Conner, leaving the other dignitaries looking stiff and remote by comparison. Still, a few lonely voices in both parties deplore the dumbing down of political dialogue.
"It atrophies the muscle of political debate," says Jeff Faux, a liberal Democrat at the Economic Institute, a Washington policy research center, who argues that it all started with Ronald Reagan's success with political imagery.
William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, blames Mr. Clinton. "The kid card is used as a trump and it trumps all debate," he said. "You say this is good for our kids and that's the end of it, instead of here are the arguments for and against the measure."
Then again, Bill Bradley and John McCain, the primary candidates who ran on "authenticity" and "substance," lost.
In fact, politicians are using people as props more than ever. They hold small panel discussions with people who agree with them, to highlight some policy proposal. The elderly are paraded for discussion of Social Security. Nurses stand around listening to talk of health care.
Most Republicans say they are delighted they have a nominee with some of Mr. Clinton's political skills and an ability to soften their party's image. "Unfortunately, politics is about symbols and I don't even think you can overdo it," said David Horowitz, whose pamphlet "The Art of Political War" has been circulating among House Republicans.
Several recent polls have shown Mr. Bush in the lead, and making a strong showing among married women, a swing group that Mr. Clinton won in 1996. So don't be surprised to see Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore surrounded by children, reading away like school librarians, right up to November.

HEADLINE: A Plague in New Orleans, With Jaws of Steel

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
It is the height of the social season here. Every year around Mother's Day, emboldened by humidity as dense as wet laundry, tens of thousands of couples, romantically lit by gaslights, descend upon the historic French Quarter to mate.
It is Formosan termite swarm season, a time of year when termite wing cases flutter in the breeze and homeowners wonder if they have stumbled into a 1950's horror film. Formosan subterranean termites with an insatiable taste for irreplaceable historic structures have been devastating the French Quarter, drawn to its moist, porous bricks and centuries-old wood, ravaging ancient live oak trees. The Quarter is ground zero in the federal government's $15 million effort to thwart the Formosan, the most destructive species of termite in the world, capable of building colonies of up to 10 million writhing white bugs, which devour an average of 1,000 pounds of wood a year. Native termite colonies, one-tenth the size, eat a meager 7 pounds per year. 
 An exotic species probably imported in the 1940's in infested planks aboard military cargo ships, the Formosan termite has spread through 11 states, creating an estimated $1 billion a year in damage, $300 million of it in greater New Orleans. Eighty percent of the city's historic structures have been affected, and almost every house, experts say.
The Formosans have found their Galatoire's in this languid semitropical climate where sometimes it can be difficult to distinguish the air from the water.
Bugs are eating their way through landmarks along the Gulf Coast, from barracks at the Citadel in Charleston, S.C., to cast-iron fronted stores in Galveston's Strand Historic District. And they are heading north, having been confirmed in North Carolina.
Much of their movement can be traced to humankind: infested railroad ties sold for raised planting beds and other landscaping, said Brian Forschler, an associate professor at the University of Georgia.
In New Orleans, termite baits round out historic decor, lying in wait behind Victorian velvet settees, beneath Persian rugs. In swarm season, which lasts through June and is triggered by 80-degree temperatures with 85 percent humidity, flying Formosans, called alates, leave their nests by the tens of thousands to build new colonies, blinding motorists in bewinged blizzards.
"You can't have people over," said Roland Behan, who lives in the Lower Pontalba apartments, built in 1851, overlooking Jackson Square. "You don't want them to step in the wrong spot and go through the floor."
Jimmy and Marie Cahn, longtime residents of an 1840's Creole cottage, remember all too well the dinner party they threw last year that was interrupted by clouds of termites streaming out of the kitchen walls, swarming toward the fanlights and dropping into the chicken cacciatore. They have not made it since. "It kind of kills the mood," Mr. Cahn said.
In a city below sea level with a long history of flood and pestilence -- yellow fever epidemics killed thousands -- termite damage is both physical and psychological, playing into its citizens' predilection for dark humor and fatalism.
"In New Orleans we're addicted to apocryphal stories," said Patrick Dunne, a well-known antiques dealer. He tells of a client who complained that her 18th-century Venetian mirror was hanging crookedly, only to discover its wooden backing riddled with termites.
With powerful mandibles and droplet-shaped heads, Formosan subterranean termites are more intrusive foragers than their native counterparts, tunneling through plaster, creosote, plastic, asphalt, electrical high-voltage wire, utility poles, even espresso makers, to find food and water. A queen can live for 30 years and lay up to 1,000 eggs a day.
Dr. Gregg Henderson, an associate professor of entomology at Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in Baton Rouge, calls the swarm "the eighth wonder of the world." He is working with the United States Department of Agriculture and the New Orleans Mosquito and Termite Control Board on Operation Full Stop, a national termite eradication program which includes treating 15 blocks in the 100-block French Quarter.
Dr. Dennis Ring, his colleague at the Center, added, "This termite flies. We can reduce numbers. Eradicating them is just not going to happen."
New Orleans architecture is custom-made for termites: flat-roofed wooden structures with shared walls and porous stucco, designed with a cooling wicking action to absorb moisture in days before air-conditioning. Joists supporting floors and ceilings sit in pockets in the ancient brick, providing "a Ho Chi Minh trail between bricks and mortar and their food source," said Marc Cooper, director of the Vieux Carre Commission, the city preservation agency that oversees the French Quarter.
One house in Lake Charles, La., has a colony estimated at 70 million Formosan termites.
Around this time of year, lights are dimmed at dusk and the talk revolves around baiting and trapping, giving the "city that care forgot" the impression of a gigantic Rod & Gun club. In the testing area around Jackson Square, tourists pass sticky traps and step unawares on shiny silver discs implanted in the sidewalk, indicating underground baits. Baiting, which costs about $1,500 a year a house, is the newest and most promising treatment thus far. In contrast to traditional pesticides, which create a poison barrier around a building, baits contain wood laced with a low-toxicity pesticide that prevents the termites from shedding their exoskeleton during molting, essentially strangling them in their own skin. They carry the toxin -- the termite equivalent of an Obituary Cocktail, a legendary local drink -- back to the nest, infecting their cohorts.
The termites hid successfully for 25 years, reaching a critical mass a decade ago. "They're cryptic insects," said Ed Bordes, the administrator of the city's Mosquito and Termite Control Board. Three years after a colony is formed, the population starts "square-rooting" and continues to do so each year, said Ed Martin, an entomologist and president of Terminix New Orleans, a pest-control franchise. The infestation has grown bigger since 1987, when chlordane, an effective termiticide, was banned by the Environmental Protection Agency as a probable human carcinogen.
Because of central heating, entomologists say that Formosan termites may have the potential to survive in more northerly climates.
Baiting is having promising results in some of the city's most treasured landmarks, which just a few years ago were infested. They include the majestic Cabildo, built in 1795-1799, where the Louisiana Purchase was signed, (now part of the Louisiana State Museum) the Presbytere, 1795-1847, originally built as the rectory for St. Louis Cathedral, and Perseverance Hall (1820), a longstanding cultural center for the African-American community. "We're going after the enemy instead of letting him come to us," said Mr. Martin.
Preliminary research in treated areas of the French Quarter indicates that scientists have turned a corner in their battle. At a recent public update for residents of the quarter, entomologists bearing charts and red pointers explained ways to invite termites into your home. These included air-conditioning leaks and polystyrene slab insulation, which likened to a "great big termite Po Boy."
Some homeowners with termites volunteer as trappers during swarm season, when the insects are dramatically visible. They use fluorescent lights to draw them to buckets with metal traps.
"There are nights when they all seem to get together and say, 'Let's rumble,' " Mrs. Cahn said. "It's atrocious. You can hear the low hum of wings beating."
The economics of Formosan termite infestation are of greatest concern to residents here. Termite inspections are mandatory before the purchase of a property, but they are of limited effectiveness. When inspecting a house, pest-control operators are not responsible for pulling up floor boards or checking inaccessible crawl spaces.
Despite regular termite inspections, Janet and Scott Howard and their children one day discovered a terrible infestation in their 1920's Federal house in the city's historic Garden District, its renovated dining room inspired by the Pompeiian Room at the Met, she said. Termites had turned their joists, in her words, "into straw." They say it will cost around $400,000 to repair the damage. Of that, $150,000 is reimbursable through her pest-control company, which they are suing for misdiagnosing the problem and for improper repairs.
There is no federal disaster relief for homeowners. Deloise Rainey, 63, a deli clerk nearing retirement, lives about 10 miles from the French Quarter. One day she saw dust on the kitchen counter. A year later, it was the walls. "When I pushed the wall they were peeking out at me," she said. Then she discovered mud tunnels in the sheetrock. Over the past five years, she has spent about $5,000 on repairs and another $1,000 on pest control, she said. "I'm spending all my money on termites," she said.
Last month, Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, introduced a bill proposing tax relief for homeowners. It would change the definition of casualty loss to include Formosan termites. It would also provide low-interest loans for treatment. "It's not a sudden disaster," Ms. Landrieu said, "but it is certain."
The Formosans have reached the San Diego area.
And in Hawaii, residents have been battling the termites for well over a century. The famed Iolani Palace in Honolulu, built in 1845, was so decimated that it had to be totally rebuilt in 1879. Builders are now required to use chemically treated wood for framing. But in Louisiania, builders object that it would add $3,000 to the price of each house.
Many Hawaiian builders are also turning to steel and concrete construction, a more expensive solution.
Building techniques are evolving even in historic structures. In New Orleans, the old clock in the tower of St. Patrick's church was recently replaced with a fiberglass version, its beams with steel, its wooden floors with lightweight concrete.
In their never-ending search for what one scientist called the termite's "Achilles' heel," researchers are focusing on behavior and detection, hoping to find termites within walls by homing in on the sound the emit. They are also studying vetiver, a fragrant grass cultivated for centuries by the Creoles that contains nootkatone, a natural repellent.
Still, community-wide action, such as the one in the French Quarter, seem to hold the most promise. "It's an effort that has to cut across property boundaries," said Professor Forschler, of the University of Georgia.
In the Quarter, Mother's Day finds residents in a philosophical mood. "God may have said 'subdue the earth,' observed Kenneth Hedrick, rector of the landmark St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square, which is still battling termites. "But some things can't be subdued."

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 13

 BODY:
In a striking gesture of support for public education, Gov. Gray Davis today proposed to exempt California public school teachers from the state's personal income tax, in what state officials said they believed was the first such peacetime exemption for any occupation in American history.
State officials said the proposal, part of the governor's revised budget package to be announced on Monday, would amount to an income tax cut of $1,350 for the average experienced California teacher, who earns about $50,000 a year. 
 The state has about 283,000 credentialed public school teachers, and the estimated annual cost of the program, which is subject to legislative approval, would initially be $545 million out of a total statewide budget of about $90 billion.
At the same time, the governor proposed to spend another $500 million a year to reward teachers whose schools show improvements in student performance.
Under this plan, teachers whose schools show an improvement rate of 20 percent or more based on the state's new academic performance index, which ranks schools according to standardized tests, would receive one-time bonuses of $5,000 each, while others would receive lesser amounts based on their schools' performances.
That amounts to a form of merit pay that rewards collective achievement by an entire school, as opposed to individual teachers, which education unions generally oppose.
"You know I value all work, whether you're a janitor, middle manager or a C.E.O., and I take a back seat to no one in my respect for people who put themselves in harm's way, such as firefighters, policemen, paramedics," Mr. Davis said in a conference call with reporters, when asked why he was singling out one profession.
"But I really believe we have to make a simple declarative statement that above all else, teaching matters," he said. "This is the single most important profession to us in the Year 2000 and that's the statement I'm making."
In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature recently agreed to create a program that would cover the cost of college tuition, up to $3,400 annually for four years, for students who agree to teach in schools with severe teacher shortages. The plan would also help the state's 11,500 uncertified teachers cover the costs of college courses to become fully licensed teachers.
California has often been a trend-setter in tax policy, and Mr. Davis, who took office two years ago vowing to make education his "first, second and third" priority, has sometimes been mentioned as a potential Democratic vice-presidential contender.
But as a fiscal conservative, cautious to a fault, he has also faced growing criticism for not moving swiftly enough in a booming economy to redress the severe educational problems in a state that once led the nation in per-pupil spending and investments in education but that since the tax revolt of Proposition 13 in 1978 has seen itself slip toward the bottom in numerous national rankings.
Mr. Davis, the first Democrat to lead the state in 16 years, had faced pressure from fellow Democrats in Sacramento and especially sharp attacks from the state's largest teachers' union, which had threatened to sponsor a statewide ballot initiative this fall that would have required California to return its per-pupil spending, which has lagged in the bottom third of states in recent years, to the national average over the next five years. Mr. Davis has opposed that measure as requiring a costly tax increase.
This week, the union agreed to drop the measure after the governor proposed an additional $1.8 billion in discretionary spending for education, intended to compensate for the lean years of the early 1990's, when teachers were forced to do without cost-of-living increases in wages to help close looming budget deficits.
This year, with a projected budget surplus of $11 billion to $13 billion, the challenge has been how to spend the unexpected money.
Senior Davis aides said the idea of the tax exemption, which would apply to fully credentialed teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade, arose at a brainstorming session in a staff retreat last week.
"He's made a huge statement about the importance of teaching," said one senior adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "What are the Republicans going to say? They and the teachers are going to be hard pressed to oppose this."
In fact, legislative Republicans have said they believe there is room in the budget to spend perhaps an additional $3 billion on education, and while they may well be wary of anything that looks like special treatment for the teachers' unions, it seems likely that they would have trouble objecting to the symbolism of Mr. Davis's gesture, which was held in extraordinary secrecy by the governor's staff over the last week so as to make a maximum public splash.
The State Senate Republican leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, said his members favored tax relief but believed it should be "for all taxpayers in California, not just for one group." Mr. Brulte said he wanted to review the proposal before commenting further, but added, "It'll make my kid brother happy: he's a teacher."
Barbara Kerr, the vice president of the California Teachers Association, the state's largest teachers' union, expressed pleasure at Mr. Davis's proposal.
"It's an incredible package," Ms. Kerr said. "It's a positive step, and I think it's going to help the kids of California. It shows teachers are valued, and it's awfully creative."
Davis aides said their research had shown various past tax exemptions for certain employee groups, but only in wartime.
Under the Davis plan, public school teachers would be permitted to deduct 100 percent of their teaching income on state personal income tax returns. The estimated tax relief for a beginning teacher would be $500 a year, rising to $1,350 for experienced teachers.
The tax break for teachers is just one element of Mr. Davis's proposals for doling out the budget surplus. Other plans include a $150 rebate for every income-tax payer to the state, and $300 for couples who file joint returns, at a total cost of $1.76 billion. Other measures include cutting state parks fees in half.
Like other governors, Mr. Davis has offered a series of financial incentives to recruit and retain qualified public school teachers.
This year, he proposed offering candidates who agree to teach in low-performing schools $10,000 loans for buying a home, $30,000 bonuses for attaining advanced certification and $11,000 to repay college loans.
But Mr. Davis has generally resisted formally committing the state to returning its per-pupil spending, which is calculated by complex and sometimes disputed means involving a mix of state and federal money, to the national average. He contends that his latest proposals will take California's spending, which is estimated at $6,045 this year, very close to the national average by the time that average is next recalculated.
Yet Davis aides acknowledged, for example, that there are bound to be disagreements about whether to count the teacher tax exemption toward the per-pupil spending figures, since it is an indirect expenditure of state funds.
In his State of the State speech in January, Mr. Davis acknowledged that California must spend more to return its schools to the post-sputnik era achievements of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown.
"But even more important, we must spend wisely," Mr. Davis said then. "We cannot win this battle simply by throwing money at it. We must not let taxpayer dollars be wasted on bureaucracy, but, instead, we must invest them directly into the classroom: for students and for teachers."

HEADLINE: Dr. J. Edward Carothers, 92, Methodist Leader

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
The Rev. Dr. J. Edward Carothers, a retired minister and former chief executive of national ministries for the United Methodist Church, died on May 1 at his retirement home in Doylestown, Pa., near Philadelphia. He was 92.
Dr. Carothers, who took a keen interest in theology's relationship to economics, science and technology, published seven books, among them "Keepers of the Poor," published by the church in 1966, and "To Love or to Perish: Technological Crisis and the Churches" (Friendship, 1972), of which he was co-editor with Margaret Mead, Roger L. Shinn and Daniel D. McCracken. 
 He held positions with the National Council of Churches from 1952 to 1964. He was the drafting editor of documents that the council issued on labor policy, among them one in 1965 that called for the repeal of statutes outlawing union shops.
Dr. Carothers was chief executive of his denomination's national missions from 1964 to 1972, when he retired to teach, write and serve as an industrial consultant on family welfare.
For 12 years, until last September, he wrote monthly reviews of books on Christian theology, in a bulletin distributed by the church's board of global ministries.
John Edward Carothers was born in Las Animas, Colo., about 60 miles east of Pueblo, and graduated in 1930 from Asbury College in Wilmore, Ky., before earning his master's and his doctorate in theology at the Iliff School of Theology in Denver. He was ordained a minister in 1932 and served congregations in Colorado, Vermont and New York.
Later, as chief executive of the church's national missions, he established the Methodist Urban Service Training program to prepare clergy for the ministry in a changing urban climate. In 1970, he was named executive director of a task force on the future of humanity and the role of the churches.
Dr. Carothers is survived by his wife of 70 years, Leta Hicks Carothers; two daughters, Bettie Lee Thomas of Portland, Me., and Joan Marsan Murphine of Laguna Beach, Calif.; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
In A.L. West, a .500 Record May Prove Elusive

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
It's beginning to smell a lot like 1994. That would be the aroma coming from the American League West.
When the 1994 season ended prematurely, courtesy of a labor dispute between the players and the owners, no A.L. West team had a winning record. None had even a .500 record. The Texas Rangers were in first place, and their record (52-62) was far from .500. 
 Check the division's developments in the early weeks of the season, heading into yesterday's games:
The Rangers (16-19) had their best winning percentage after they won the first two games of the season. The last time they had a .500 record was at 5-5.
When the Oakland Athletics (19-17) sneaked one victory over .500 at 18-17 on Thursday night, it was the first time since they had a 2-1 record that they had climbed above .500.
The best the Anaheim Angels (18-19) had done was get two victories above .500. They were one under .500 before yesterday's game.
Since the Seattle Mariners (17-16) had a 12-7 record, they had won 5 games and lost 9.
The teams, however, aren't ready to play down to their past. "I don't think it's going to reach that," Pat Gillick, the Mariners' general manager, said.
Doug Melvin, the Rangers' general manager, said, "I think somebody will be at .500 to win the division."
Each team has had its problems. The Mariners put together what promised to be the best starting pitching rotation in their history, but the leaders of that rotation, Jamie Moyer and Freddy Garcia, are on the disabled list, having started a combined seven games. The Mariners think Moyer, recovering from a strain behind his left shoulder, can return before June 1. Garcia, who inexplicably fractured a leg, isn't expected back until the latter part of June.
"I hate to say it," Gillick said, "but it will come down to who can stay injury-free. There have been a lot of injuries in this division already. If you lose a significant contributor, it puts a crimp in everything."
The Angels began the season with Tim Belcher, one of their veteran starting pitchers, on the disabled list. He has since been joined by two other starters, Ken Hill and Jason Dickson, as well as shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who had hit .395 in 12 games.
Rusty Greer and Gabe Kapler, two-thirds of the Texas outfield, are on the disabled list, as is Frank Catalanotto, a .500-hitting platooned second baseman. The Rangers also learned last week that Justin Thompson, the primary pitcher they received in the Juan Gonzalez trade, needs rotator-cuff surgery and won't pitch at all this season.
Oakland's offensive catalyst, second baseman Randy Velarde, only recently came off the disabled list, where he had been since the start of the season. Kevin Appier, one of their veteran starting pitchers, came off the list yesterday, while John Jaha, one of their productive hitters, remains on it.
But the Athletics have no shortage of productive hitters. The division, in fact, boasts an offensive orientation.
The Rangers lead the league in hitting, while the Athletics lead in runs scored despite having one of the lowest batting averages and the most strikeouts, and they are second in home runs.
The Athletics' Jason Giambi entered the weekend No. 1 in the league in home runs (15) and runs batted in (42) and second in slugging percentage (.735), Darin Erstad of Anaheim had the highest batting average (.388), the highest home average (.461) and the most hits (59), Alex Rodriguez of Seattle was first in runs scored (36), on-base percentage (.483), road batting average (.435) and walks (29), David Segui of Texas was second in batting average (.378) and Ivan Rodriguez of Texas was second in total bases (92).
Pitching, then, must be a problem.
Melvin readily acknowledged that the Rangers' relief corps has undermined the team's efforts to attain a winning record. John Wetteland squandered a couple of ninth-inning leads over Cleveland and the Yankees, and Jeff Zimmerman, who last year was virtually unhittable, gave up game-losing home runs to Clay Bellinger of the Yankees and Greg Vaughn of Tampa Bay.
Just as damaging, some of the relievers' earned run averages look as if they were attacked by a severe siege of inflation: Mike Munoz 13.50, Matt Perisho 10.50, Tim Crabtree 9.18. The Angels have some of those, too: Mark Petkovsek 8.84 and Shigetoshi Hasegawa 6.98.
"Our starting pitching, for the most part, has been good," Bill Stoneman, the Angels' general manager, said. "Our relief pitching started off poorly, but it looks like it's coming along."
Stoneman said he believed the Angels were better than a .500 team. "We haven't been able to separate ourselves from the .500 mark," he added, "but I see ourselves doing it."
With the departure of Ken Griffey Jr., the Mariners are not the same offensively explosive team they have been in the past. "We don't bludgeon anybody," Gillick said. "Our offense is sporadic. Our game is get a well-pitched game and good defense and hope we score enough runs."
Gillick said he didn't think there was any real difference between his division and the Central. Melvin offered a similar view, noting that the West was "a good division from the standpoint of being competitive."
"Beyond the Yankees," he added, "everybody has problems. If you take away what the Yankees have done, I'm not sure there are any other great teams. That's the way it is in our league right now. It looks like there's parity."
With parity comes mediocrity. Mediocrity breeds .500 teams, or worse.
 
A Rare Pair of 1-0 Shutouts
If, as some baseball people believe, the ball has been altered to allow batters to hit more home runs, which balls must Steve Trachsel have used in his last two starts for Tampa Bay? An 18-game loser last year who did not win two successive starts until September, Trachsel has pitched in two consecutive 1-0 shutouts.
He did not complete the second one, against the Yankees and Orlando Hernandez on Thursday night, but his seven-inning, three-hit performance was impressive nonetheless, especially following his complete-game three-hit shutout against Boston last Saturday in a matchup with Pedro Martinez.
The only 1999 performance that came close to Trachsel's achievement was a pair of 1-0 complete-game shutouts Jose Jimenez pitched for St. Louis against Arizona, whose pitcher in both games was one Randy Johnson. Just to make the feat more spectacular, Jimenez pitched a no-hitter in the first shutout and allowed only two hits in the second. The only problem was Jimenez made a start between those 1-0 shutouts, losing to Houston, 11-3.
According to research by Elias Sports Bureau, the last pitcher to win two consecutive starts by 1-0 scores was Zane Smith of Pittsburgh in 1992. Smith pitched a complete-game five-hitter against St. Louis, then permitted five hits in eight and a third innings against Houston. Stan Belinda got the last two outs.
 Home runs may be up from last season, but so are 1-0 games. Eight such games have been played this season compared with seven in the corresponding period last year. The Devil Rays have won three of them. The Red Sox, the Angels and the Dodgers have each lost two.
 
Left-Handers Can't Hit Johnson
In Randy Johnson's first seven starts for Arizona this season, the relatively few left-handed batters who faced him did not fare well. But then left-handers seldom do. Rafael Palmeiro, for example, made no pretense about not wanting to play when Johnson pitched against his team. Palmeiro has batted against the left-hander 21 times and has only one hit to show for his futile efforts.
This season Todd Helton of Colorado and Mark Grace of the Chicago Cubs had the only two left-handed hits against Johnson in left-handers' 25 times at bat. Then last Wednesday night Johnson pitched against Los Angeles, and the Dodgers put only one left-handed hitter in their lineup. That hitter, Shawn Green, who had not had a hit in five American League at-bats against Johnson, stroked three singles in four tries.
 "You just don't see a left-hander stay in there against Randy the way Green did," said Sandy Johnson, the Diamondbacks' assistant general manager.
 
Hernandez Homer Ratio Up
Hideki Irabu was not the most popular pitcher who ever played for the Yankees. One element of his game that aroused criticism was his penchant for giving up home runs. Last season he allowed an average of one home run for 6.5 innings. The popular Orlando Hernandez, meanwhile, permitted one in nine innings.
Pitching for Montreal this season, Irabu has basically maintained his 1999 pace, giving up one home run every 7 innings (5 in 35 1/3 innings). But look who's giving up more? Hernandez has thrown 11 home run pitches in 56 2/3 innings, or one every 5 innings. He is tied for second in the American League for most home runs allowed, one behind Mike Mussina of Baltimore.
 
Kim's Glove Full of Strikeouts
Byung Hyun Kim, a Diamondbacks relief pitcher from Kwayngsan-ku Songjung-dong, South Korea, committed a no-no in a game against the Dodgers last week. As a bunt by Alex Cora rolled past him, Kim flung his glove at the ball to try to stop it.
Fortunately for Kim, his aim was not good and the glove missed the ball. Had he made contact, Cora would have wound up at third base with one out in the 10th inning of a tied score. The rules award three bases to a batter if a fielder throws his glove at a ball and hits it.
"Ah yes, three bases, no more," Kim said the next day when he was asked about the play.
The 21-year-old right-hander might not have known about the glove-throwing rule, but ask him about strikeouts and he could already write his own book. In six appearances from April 27 through last Wednesday, Kim pitched a total of six innings and struck out batters for 17 of the 18 outs.
His only miss? A tapper back to the mound by Todd Hundley of Los Angeles in the fifth off those six games. Kim pitched to two San Diego batters Friday night and both grounded out.
Throwing a fastball in the low 90's and an assortment of sliders, Kim dazzled batters for Philadelphia, Milwaukee, San Diego and Los Angeles. He gave up four hits, and the lone run he allowed cost the Diamondbacks the first of those games, but his string of strikeouts represents one of the most impressive performances of the season. In 13 games over all, he has struck out 28 in 16 2/3 innings and has a 1.62 earned run average.
What happened after the glove-tossing display? He had struck out Adrian Beltre before the bunt, and afterward he struck out Dave Hansen and Todd Hollandsworth.

HEADLINE: Bush Versus Gore Means an All-Baby-Boom Race

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
After decades of caricature as the most self-indulgent and permissive generation in American history, baby boomers -- including Al Gore and George W. Bush -- are realizing it is time to get with the program.
Despite their differences in political orientation, the two parties' presidential candidates, both of whom were born into the vanguard of the boomer generation, are delivering the same message on the campaign trail: "responsibility." It is a message that goes to the personal and the political and speaks, the candidates hope, to a generation once famous for its idealism and its determination to do the right thing. 
 Moreover, the campaigns have sensed a new wrinkle, so to speak, in the ever-scrutinized lives of the boomers that has emerged as they have aged -- the oldest boomers are now in the unusual position of contemplating their own retirements even as their parents are living longer and requiring more care. At the same time, some, like Mr. Gore, whose mother is 87 and whose mother-in-law lives with him and his wife, are even becoming grandparents.
This nexus of life-defining events for the biggest cohort in American history (the 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964) has infused the presidential campaign with a new urgency, especially regarding Social Security and health care. Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have devoted much time on the campaign trail to Social Security and both plan to deliver major addresses on the topic on Monday.
"It's a response to what's happening in society," said John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP, one of the biggest and most effective lobbying groups in the country. "It's driven by demographics, the economy and technology. There's a growing awareness, particularly of people who are Bush's and Gore's age, that their parent's generation is becoming frail, we don't have support systems that are in very good shape, and the anxiety about your own retirement is on the top of people's minds."
Al Gore was born March 31, 1948, making him 52. George W. Bush was born July 6, 1946, making him 53. And while they had different coming-of-age experiences during the 1960's and 1970's -- Mr. Gore was closer to the counterculture than was Mr. Bush, but still by no means a radical -- both are invoking their generational roots as themes in their campaigns and are developing "responsibility" as rationales for their candidacies.
This campaign marks one of the few times that candidates from both parties have been so close in age. For the first two baby boomers are running for president, representing a definitive break with the World War II era. Given the unprecedented prosperity, these factors give the nation a chance to reset its compass and restructure its priorities.
Here was Governor Bush in a recent interview with "The News Hour" on PBS:
"I'm a strong candidate because I come from the baby boomer generation, recognizing that we've got to usher in an era of responsible behavior, which starts with behaving responsibly in the office."
Here was Vice President Gore at a fund-raiser Thursdayin Los Angeles, explaining the strong economy:
"We got rid of the politics of illusion and said to the American people: 'We have got to make the real hard choices. We have to accept responsibility for our own future.' That's why it was so tough to pass the changes that have helped to unleash all this potential. Tough, tough, tough."
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, says the invocation of responsibility is a harkening to fundamental values.
"The notion that people ought to be responsible for their actions is one of the top-most widely shared values in this country," he said. "So it's no surprise that politicians talk in that idiom."
But there is also a strong degree of self-interest in their appeals, particularly when it comes to issues like Social Security and Medicare. Politicians used to focus issues like Social Security and Medicare solely on the over-65 crowd. But now, Mr. Mellman noted, "people are worried about taking care of their parents, and the leading edge of the baby boom are worried about their own retirement and some are worried about both at the same time, which is a newer phenomenon."
A political focus group of mostly middle-aged people conducted earlier this month in Bala Cynwyd, a suburb of Philadelphia, by Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, found unanimity on one subject -- despite the prosperous economy, people are anxious about health care and Social Security.
"As baby boomers get older, people start to feel it as well as think it," Frank Ratel, 60, an accountant, said during the focus group.
Mr. Rother of AARP said: "The assumption among many people is that it's only seniors who care about Medicare and Social Security, but nothing could be further from the truth. Our polling shows it is boomers who are the most interested in prescription drug coverage because you're thinking about your mom and at the same time wondering about your own future. When you're in your 50's, you don't know what kind of shape you're going to be in. This is a greater concern of people in their 50's than it is for people 65 and older."
The crunch for baby boomers is becoming increasingly obvious. Almost 50 percent of the people who filed for bankruptcy in 1999 were baby boomers. Some academics, like Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy expert at Harvard Law School, argue that, contrary to the popular image of affluent boomers spending their way to consumer heaven, this is "the most vulnerable generation" because of the confluence of potential failures that they face, from the loss of a job to catastrophic illness to the effects of divorce and the need to care for aging parents.
The likelihood of bankruptcy increases with age, as those facing retirement face mounting costs, particularly for prescription drugs and long-term care. Both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are offering proposals to help people meet these needs.
The Social Security system has a surplus now, but the government predicts that the trust fund will begin paying out more than it takes in by 2015 as the baby boom generation retires. Without a major fix, the system could go broke by 2037.
But for both candidates, the notion of "responsibility" goes beyond strengthening Social Security, which they would do by different means.
Mr. Bush emphasizes personal responsibility as a direct counterweight to what he perceives as the irresponsibility of President Clinton (the first baby boomer president). The goal of his candidacy, Mr. Bush says, is to restore honor and dignity to the White House.
And the signal inherent in his message is an appeal to family values, long seen as Republican turf.
Mr. Bush has emphasized the theme since he began his campaign last June, saying "My first goal is to usher in the responsibility era -- an era that stands in stark contrast to the last few decades, where our culture has said: If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a problem, blame someone else."
Mr. Bush has also used his emphasis on compassion to temper any impression that responsibility means harshness or sacrifice.
For Mr. Gore, responsibility is a multipurpose concept, and he tends to use it both subliminally and overtly. He too is trying to distance himself from the actions of President Clinton. But he also wants to present himself as the logical successor to Mr. Clinton as the steward of the nation's current prosperity, and so he offers himself as the responsible heir apparent.
This, of course, necessitates presenting Mr. Bush as the "irresponsible" alternative, a neat way, learned from President Clinton, of transforming a policy matter into a values judgment. Repeatedly, Mr. Gore casts Mr. Bush's proposals as "reckless," a quality Mr. Gore conjures up with his relentless referencing to Mr. Bush's "risky tax scheme." The contrast between the responsible Mr. Gore and the irresponsible Mr. Bush has fast become the organizing principle of the Gore campaign.
Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore is using the idea of responsibility to reinforce one of the basic tenets of his party. While Mr. Bush's reference summons family values, Mr. Gore's highlights the Democrats' traditional advantage on preserving entitlement programs. The "risky tax scheme" that he invokes is a direct threat to two tenets of Democratic orthodoxy -- Social Security and Medicare -- that baby boomers are now either depending on to help their parents or expecting to receive themselves.
"It references the basic policy dilemma of his presidency," said Elaine Kamark, Mr. Gore's chief domestic policy adviser. "The challenge has gone from how to manage the insolvency of these programs to who can keep control of the surplus. The money guys on Wall Street understand this very well. They want confidence. You get it by running a straight, sound fiscal policy."
Because Mr. Gore had children relatively early for his generation, he is now a grandparent. "His life cycle is slightly ahead of his generation, so he can see ahead to the centrality of some of these issues," Ms. Kamark said. Still, Mr. Gore is more a creature of the popular image of the baby boom than is Mr. Bush.
Mr. Bush exudes a more retro 1950's youth, one of hijinks and drinking and frat parties, remarkably detached from the Vietnam War or any kind of rebellion or existential angst. As he told an interviewer for GQ: "I don't remember any kind of heaviness ruining my time at Yale."
The vice president seems much more a product of his time. He invariably dangles his boomer credentials before his audiences, mentioning the touchstones of his generation -- the assassinations, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, Watergate, his "disillusionment with politics," though never rebellion, and his admission that he smoked marijuana.

HEADLINE: U.S. LABOR LEADERS PUSH HARD TO KILL CHINA TRADE BILL

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
The American labor movement is mounting its biggest lobbying campaign ever on trade matters in seeking to defeat the Clinton administration's drive to normalize commerce with China. Unions are holding dozens of meetings on Capitol Hill, putting intense pressure on individual legislators back in their districts, staging rallies and writing huge numbers of letters across the nation.
With the House scheduled to vote on the China trade bill the week after next, organized labor is struggling to counter the intense lobbying of the administration and business groups, with some labor leaders believing that their efforts will succeed in defeating the measure. 
 The members of a single union -- the Steelworkers -- have written more than 200,000 letters urging House members to oppose the bill, which would grant China permanent normal trade relations and pave its way into the World Trade Organization.
Acknowledging that the House vote is too close to call, John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, has cleared much of his schedule to hold one-on-one meetings with House members as well as sessions with moderate Republicans, the Congressional Black Caucus and the New York Congressional delegation.
"We're telling them that our members take this issue very seriously," Mr. Sweeney said. "We tell them that there is absolutely no good reason for them to support permanent normalized trade relations with China. There is no information showing that China is improving its human rights situation or workers rights situation."
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has dispatched full-time coordinators to 32 Congressional districts that are represented by undecided House members. These coordinators are organizing demonstrations and candlelight vigils, arranging meetings with lawmakers and taking cell phones to factories so union members can inundate House offices with phone calls.
Labor's lobbying is often done in conjunction with religious leaders, environmentalists and exiled Chinese dissidents. On April 12, thousands of union members crowded the halls of Congress to lobby.
Last Thursday night, 60 union members demonstrated at a Wal-Mart in Tewksbury, Mass, which stocks many items made in China, to pressure Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Democrat, to vote against the bill. This Monday, union members plan to set up a tent outside the Alabama district office of Representative Robert E. Cramer, a Democrat, to urge him around the clock to oppose the bill.
Labor leaders oppose the bill because it does not protect worker rights and because of China's poor human rights record.
Many acknowledge that defeating the bill remains an uphill battle. President Clinton and Congressional leaders, they say, will make any deals necessary to obtain the 218 votes needed in the House.
"It's still neck and neck," said Peggy Taylor, lobbyist for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, which represents 13 million union members. "We're not only holding our own, we're challenging them very strongly. We can win this vote."
Administration officials and Congressional leaders say the bill will pass easily in the Senate.
"Right now neither side has 218 votes," said Commerce Secretary William Daley, who is coordinating administration efforts to win passage. "Labor's been very active. The fact of the matter is we've seen a whole host of House members struggling with this issue. One of the main reasons they've struggled is their friends in organized labor feel so strongly about it." Mr. Daley said the House would pass the bill.
Administration officials and business executives assert that the bill will help the American economy and workers by increasing exports to China. In the bill, Congress would approve the administration's agreement with China calling on it to lower tariffs and many trade barriers.
"This is a very good deal," said William Morley, trade lobbyist for the United States Chamber of Commerce. "What can be wrong about accepting a deal that will slash tariffs on American exports?"
Union leaders assert that the deal will not bring about increased exports but an exodus of American factories to China using low-wage Chinese labor to produce for the American market.
Much of the union members' opposition stems from a widespread conviction that the North American Free Trade Agreement encouraged an exodus of American industry -- and jobs -- to Mexico.
In 1993, labor fought that agreement in vain. Union leaders say the campaign against the China trade bill is bigger, involving more members and a wider swath of unions.
In one unusual move, hundreds of members of the United Steelworkers of America at a Rubbermaid factory in Wooster, Ohio, upset that much of the plant's operations were being transferred to Mexico, recently wrote on the back of a bathmat and sent it to Representative Ralph Regula, an Ohio Republican.
"Dear Ralph Regula," they wrote, "We are losing 180 plus jobs to Mexico. These products will no longer be made in the U.S.A. Since Nafta, the biggest export has been our jobs. Don't make the same mistake. Vote No on P.N.T.R. for China."
George Becker, president of the Steelworkers, said: "This deal is for multinationals, not for workers. It's for multinational companies to build plants in China and bring products back to the United States. It's the same as the Mexican trade deal."
Representative Bob Clement, a Tennessee Democrat, acknowledged that labor's lobbying helped sway him to oppose the bill. Noting that he was upset by China's religious repression, he said he believed that the current annual trade review of China helps to pressure it on human rights.
But John J. LaFalce, a Buffalo Democrat, who has met with many labor leaders, said he was leaning toward supporting the bill. He said he favored inserting labor rights into trade accords, but he said that because most of America's trading partners refuse to accept such provisions that should not block all future labor agreements.
Mr. Sweeney insisted that in his meetings with members of Congress he never threatens retribution against people who vote for the China bill. Acknowledging that the bill might make it harder for Democrats to regain control of the House, he said union members would certainly weigh each lawmaker's stance on China in deciding whom to endorse.

HEADLINE: Lending Crackdown Said to Fall Short

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
When government regulators announced recently that they were protecting homeowners by cracking down on an abusive nationwide lending company, Margaret C. Roundtree hoped that they would intervene to save her home in Jamaica, Queens, from foreclosure.
"I did expect to get some help," said Mrs. Roundtree, 68, a hospital technician. "But nothing has been done." Now she faces the loss of the house, where she has lived since 1972. 
 Three federal agencies settled their joint lawsuit against her lender, Delta Financial Corporation of Woodbury, N.Y., on March 30. They portrayed their decision as an industrywide warning to the booming but loosely regulated market in high-cost loans. But advocates for victims like Mrs. Roundtree say the officials let Delta off the hook. The critics also say the settlement did nothelp the thousands of suffering borrowers, many of whom have been forced into foreclosure or bankruptcy.
And consumer groups are also attacking Delta's earlier settlement with two New York State regulatory agencies. While the state did extract some restitution for victims, critics say it is only a token amount of Delta's $1 billion-a-year operation. Only a few of the victims will be aided, and nothing will go to those who must lose their homes.
Delta operates in 26 states, and in New York grew to become the largest subprime lender, a type that makes high-cost loans to people with poor credit ratings. But critics called Delta a predatory lender that focused on minority neighborhoods. Its victims, often elderly women, were targets of high-pressure pitches for loans with exorbitant fees and interest. Reacting to the complaints, regulators accused the company of violating lending and civil rights laws. But the settlements have frustrated Delta's critics.
"Delta admits no wrongdoing and agrees to comply with the law -- which it's supposed to do anyway -- while many victims are stuck with horrendous loans for years to come, and people who already lost their homes and their life's savings are completely left out," said Sarah Ludwig, director of the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project, a nonprofit group in Manhattan.
Federal and state officials defend their decisions, saying they imposed heavy sanctions and stopped the abuses now, avoiding years of litigation and possibly keeping thousands more from being victimized. The restitution is the most ever won in the nation's banking industry, the regulators say. Delta also agreed to restrictions beyond statutory requirements and is subject to civil and criminal penalties for new violations.
"This is not just a slap on the wrist," said David Medine, an associate director at the Federal Trade Commission, one of the agencies involved in the settlement of the federal lawsuit.
Another agency, the Justice Department, said, "This suit sends a clear message that the United States won't tolerate discrimination or illegal lending practices." The Department of Housing and Urban Development declined to reply to the critics. But earlier, Secretary Andrew M. Cuomo praised the deal, saying, "Lenders and mortgage brokers are put on notice by this settlement agreement that HUD and the federal government are prepared to fight for borrowers who are being victimized."
The first official to go after Delta was the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer. At first, he tried to place Delta in receivership, but eventually his office settled. His civil rights chief, Andrew Celli, said: "We started with one goal, to change the way the largest subprime lender in the state does business, and we met that goal. We made a conscious choice to reform this industry."
Mr. Spitzer's deputy, Mark Peters, added, "Delta is now bound by a 265-page code of conduct, requiring a whole bunch of things the law doesn't require."
Mr. Spitzer pushed for $6 million in restitution, which the State Banking Department raised to $7.25 million, plus 525,000 shares of Delta stock it valued at nearly $5 million. "The governor instructed us to obtain the maximum amount of restitution to the victims," said the acting banking superintendent, Elizabeth McCaul. "We took the most from the company we possibly could.
Under that settlement, 600 Delta borrowers were recently offered reductions of $50 to $400 in their monthly payments, or 5 percent to 40 percent, Ms. McCaul said. In addition, foreclosures were halted for 75 homeowners, who will also be offered reductions.
Delta issued this statement: "While Delta does not believe it has done anything wrong, it has acceded to these agreements in the best interests of our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve."
But the restitution pales in comparison to the victims' losses and Delta's billions of dollars in loans, critics say. The reduced-payment benefits end when borrowers die, sell their homes, refinance or are foreclosed upon. And the value of the Delta stock has shrunk below $1 million. "It's funny money, all flash and no cash," said Patricia Sturdevant, director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates, a nonprofit group. "This case sets a dangerous precedent for going soft on lenders who are cheating people out of house and home. The message is that crime pays." Since the federal agencies won no restitution, she said, there is no aid for victims outside New York.
Because the settlements were court-approved, there is no apparent way to challenge them. Despite their long efforts against predatory lending, consumer groups say they were not consulted. The federal agencies filed their lawsuits against Delta, and that same day announced their settlements with the company.
Most disturbing, the critics say, is a state requirement that victims who accept restitution must promise not to seek any other legal redress. They cannot sue Delta, and if they eventually face foreclosure, they will not be allowed to raise a defense in court that their loans were improper.
"That's terrible," said Lee Squitieri, a Manhattan lawyer who is organizing a class-action suit for Delta borrowers. He is seeking to release them from bad loans, get compensation for excessive charges and impose punitive damages.
Nearly all the restitution offers that the critics have heard about are for $50 a month. "It's not nearly enough," said Nancy Slahetka, a lawyer who fights foreclosures for South Brooklyn Legal Services. Those offers are paltry, she said, and there are too few of them. "There are thousands of victims, not hundreds."
Mrs. Roundtree said she fell behind on her bills when she was out of work because of two car accidents and her resulting hip surgery. Her lawyer, Jeffrey Rosenberg, said she was talked into a loan of $92,000, "far more than she needed," to pay her debts, plus $20,800 for home improvements, with cash supposedly left over for her. The interest rate was 12.15 percent.
Mrs. Roundtree said she reluctantly signed blank papers when salespeople threatened that "they were going to take my house away." Soon after, she said, she tried to invoke her right to cancel but was ignored. She never got the final papers, she said, and most of the promised renovations were never done.
Although technically Delta did not originate the loan, the company was involved at the outset and took over the loan at the closing, the lawyer said. Inevitably, the payments fell into arrears, and now Delta is demanding $137,000 or the house.

HEADLINE: C.E.O. ROUND TABLE;
On the Continent, on the Cusp

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
THE newly won star status of the European entrepreneur, and the crushing burden of Big Government. The lure of the nimble American economic model, and the strengths of European multiculturalism. The unifying force of the euro, and lingering obstacles to a truly single European market.
Those were some of the puzzle pieces on the table one evening early this month when the chief executives of six fast-growing companies gathered at the Hotel de Crillon here to talk with Money & Business about the challenges facing European business. 
 Rather than the larger-than-life characters who run Europe's imperial blue chips, these executives represent a relatively new type on the Continent's business scene: the upstart. And while none are household names in the United States, all have been especially successful at something for which European business is not particularly noted: creating jobs. They are members of a Brussels-based organization called GrowthPlus that promotes pro-business policies across national borders.
The panelists were Leendert Bikker of the Bikker Communication Group, a Dutch public relations firm; Sylvain Forestier of D Interactive, a French marketing consultant; Christian Hunt of the EMDS Group, a Belgian executive headhunting firm; Martin A. Schoeller of IFCO Systems, a German shipping specialist; Nico Willaert of Lernout & Hauspie, a Belgian speech technology company; and Simon Worth of QAS Systems, a British software concern.
The executives were joined in the two-hour discussion by Edmund L. Andrews, Alan Cowell, Jim Schachter, Andrew Ross Sorkin and John Tagliabue of The Times.
Much of the conversation focused on a Europe in transition -- a place where a young, Internet-nurtured generation is artfully sidestepping political boundaries and cultural barriers to doing business, and where a multitude of tongues and national points of view both foster flexibility and impede change.
The conversation was conducted in English, a second language for five of the chief executives. Following are excerpts, edited for space and clarity.
 
Q. We Americans often see Europe as being a place not exactly friendly to business, with a rigid labor market and difficulties in financing companies. Our newspapers are constantly reporting about how difficult it is to do business in a European context. And yet at the same time, we've been constantly reporting about how Europe is changing, how one market after another is being deregulated, whether it's telecommunications, airlines, banking, postal services. My question: Is Europe gradually coming around to your kind of company?
 
MARTIN SCHOELLER -- I think the view of the entrepreneur in Europe, especially the last one or two years, has changed tremendously. Entrepreneurs are role models, are stars, are heroes. You don't have to defend yourself anymore, excuse yourself for being an entrepreneur.
We think, too, that the European environment is better than it ever was, with low interest, low inflation, growth picking up -- and while the growth is picking up, the inflation isn't picking up. So I think we have a very, very positive outlook here, and we can grow stronger.
 
Q. What about the entrepreneurial environment in France?
 
SYLVAIN FORESTIER -- I agree that there has been a lot of change. In the entrepreneurial environment, it's much easier to get money. The key issue for France is to change the state. Right now, the French state is way behind the private sector. Education is very much backward. And one of the things which could really prevent us from keeping on growing is the lack of people, because we don't have enough people, especially in the high-tech sectors.
 
Q. What has inspired the new appreciation for entrepreneurship here in Europe?
 
SCHOELLER -- I think the Internet and the new markets -- the Nasdaq new markets -- changed the whole perception. First, the Internet makes it apparently easier to realize innovations and to get business models running. Second, it has taught the capital market that things might cost some money. It's not only the big corporations who can now afford start-up losses; the market is trading the future.
I want to add, too, the issue of recruiting people. Everybody says how scarce talent is and how we lack in education on technology, on technical jobs and so forth. But on the positive side, I see that the growing companies get the good people. Before, ABB and Siemens took all the good talent from the market, and then McKinsey and Boston Consulting took the good talent.
And now we are in the pole position, and they want to come to us. They want to come to strongly growing companies where they can get stock options that are not already at Mount Everest peak prices, that are still at a small price that can grow to big mountains. There is really a big change, and this is in the last 12 to 24 months. G.E. people are happy to come to us; Boston Consulting people come to us.
 
Q. Is that your experience, too, Christian, given the kind of business you're in?
 
CHRISTIAN HUNT -- Yes, in the last two years, we've seen clearly a shift, in career preferences, from big traditional corporations, consulting firms, investment banks, etc. People are not honestly looking at the P/E's on the Nasdaq and the high-growth companies. And they are very, very much attracted. You see not one or two people leaving Boston Consulting and McKinsey and the others; you see tens and tens of them leaving.
And obviously, there's a cultural shift. It's a big trend, If you look at Europe, the attraction for big, stable companies was very, very, very strong in the last 10, 20, 30 years, maybe. And now --
 
SCHOELLER -- That's old economy.
 
HUNT -- Yeah, that's old economy. And more and more, probably, people have realized that they have to take charge of their own future in a way. And the result is more attraction for high-growth companies, for stock option models and more people starting their own business.
On the shortage of talent: There is clearly a shortage in Europe -- not just in Europe, but in particular in Europe -- in I.T. information technology and in global management capacity. As economies go global, all companies need people who can run global companies. And there are just not enough people. There's not enough people at the senior level; there's not enough people at all.
 
SIMON WORTH -- I see that a little bit differently in the U.K. The first thing is that the social acceptability of starting a business in the U.K. started before the Internet.
Probably 10, 15 years ago, suddenly, two things happened together. The American experience became more available through the media: satellite telly, quicker transmission of photos and numbers; you get American business pages and numbers in the London press. And in the case of the U.K., taxes and school fees came down. It sounds ridiculous, but if you're a middle-aged guy stuck in a serious job with one of these big companies, and you were paying 60 or 70 percent income tax, and you have two or three kids in private school, then you were stuck.
The other thing that went on in my generation -- I'm coming up 40 -- was that suddenly, in the final year of university, employers were not there saying they'd employ you for life. They were saying 5 or 10 years. And I think this is a two-way street, and both employees and employers have realized that you have to manage your own career. And all of a sudden the options for starting up in business on your own become easier and socially acceptable.
I was employed by a corporation, and we were given instructions: You do not talk to people who've had a go on their own, because they were deemed as trouble. And that's done a U-turn. People of my generation think nothing of having had one or two gos and still be roaring along.
 
LEENDERT BIKKER -- In Holland, becoming an entrepreneur is not an option when you leave high school or university. And that's because, in comparison to the small size of our economy, we have a lot of big internationals, like Unilever, like Royal Dutch, like Akzo Nobel, like Philips. That was Option One, to go to those big global companies.
It was only 12 years ago when I left university, and all the students had to go to one of the teachers to discuss their future. "Becoming an entrepreneur is a dead-end option," they told you. "Don't do it."
 
Q. So your teachers basically steered you to one of the big globals.
 
BIKKER -- Yeah, yeah. And the new generation -- I have a son who became 16 last month, and he said, "Dad, everything is fine, but my first option is having my own company."
And I said, "What kind of company? And why?"
"Doesn't matter what."
It's not taught at school, but the whole group of kids that age -- that's it. And they all talk about dot-coms.
 
SCHOELLER -- What kind of father does he have?
 
BIKKER -- No, no, it's not only his father. It's the new generation, because they're connected to all over the world. He spends his holidays all over the world. It's all over the Web.
 
SCHOELLER -- And you can get rich quick now. This is totally exaggerated, but it shows to many people who were very risk-averse and looking for safety that, wow, this could be just incredible and outmaneuver everything you would do in a whole lifetime's work.
 
Entrepreneurial Origins
 
Q. Were any of your fathers businessmen, or were they all working in large organizations?
 
BIKKER -- hiding his face in his hands Civil servant.
 
NICO WILLAERT -- Small entrepreneur.
 
Q. So entrepreneurialism is not all brand new.
 
WILLAERT -- No, it's not all brand new. I'm happy to hear all these positive comments of my colleagues here. But just to put a couple of things in perspective -- and maybe I'm in the best place to do that, since we were the very first Belgian company quoted on Nasdaq, on Dec. 1, 1995: I had gone through the experience of going to the limits of what European bankers and Belgian bankers were prepared to give us. And even shortly before we went to Nasdaq, one of the bankers asked me if I could send him a sample of an algorithm.
Now, in those days --
 
SCHOELLER -- Even today --
 
WILLAERT -- Yeah, even today, I think, you have to explain to a lot of people what an algorithm is. And software in general was something that made a lot of eyebrows start moving when you talked to bankers, because you didn't have buildings. Yes, you had computers, but what were they worth, after all? I mean, what were your assets?
 
SCHOELLER -- Your assets go home in the night and eat and have sex.
 
WILLAERT -- So it is, first of all, very recent. Secondly, what happened afterward in the European context -- the euro and so on -- helped the feeling that technology was going to play a very important role in our society. I think some of the examples that were set on Nasdaq, and the growth of Nasdaq in general, helped.
Then, of course, we were not in such a bad position, particularly not our company. When you talk about languages, well, where do engineers talk three or four languages? Surely not in the States. I think Holland and Belgium and so on were very well placed -- and Scandinavia -- to engage in global international business.
So we had a couple of assets when the Internet started showing that you could do other types of business than the classical ones.
And I still wonder: Europe may be in a good position to help young entrepreneurs in their first phase, because there is this general feeling that these things are good. But I think there may be limits of $20 million, $30 million. Then, from there on, I think it still becomes relatively difficult to get proper financing.
 
BIKKER -- The market in the U.S. is much more mature.
 
WILLAERT -- It's much more mature. The capital market in the U.S.A., let's not forget, has always had this concept of conceptual I.P.O.'s. When you talk in Europe about the conceptual I.P.O., I think you still have a lot of explaining to do.
 
Q. Have any of you had to get financing from the States?
 
SCHOELLER -- We are also on Nasdaq, yes, and we have funding from U.S. banks. That means 100-page contracts and covenants, higher cost of money, but faster and more supportive decisions.
 
BIKKER -- Yes, but our banks are not run by entrepreneurs, but by policy makers.
 
Weathering the Storms
 
Q. Do any of you have any fears or worries about what happens if and when the first real bear market arrives?
 
FORESTIER -- I'm not very much worried about the possibility that we'd be slowed down by lack of funding, because there is a lot of money coming over; I'm talking about the venture capitalists. And as for the stock market, if you want to raise money, even with French stock you can raise a tremendous amount of money, more than $200 million. And if you really need more money, you can still choose an American bank as a second funding source, or you have other solutions.
My first concern is that really there could be a slowdown in growth because of the lack of skilled people. And that's why in France we're fighting so much for stock options -- because we are in a fiscal environment which is not easy at all and which, of course, prevents us from keeping French talent from emigrating to the U.K. or the States. And, of course, it's not very easy to make U.S. engineers migrate to France, even with our wine and food.
 
Q. We talked about the change in the acceptance of entrepreneurs in Germany and Britain. What's the situation like in France?
 
FORESTIER -- Well, I think it has improved a little bit, but I would definitely not say that there are stars. People are wary of us. French people don't like people to get rich. So they would like Microsoft, but not with the wealth of Bill Gates -- and without Bill Gates, if possible.
 
SCHOELLER -- Don't you think the jealousy factor has come down a little bit? That was very dominating in the 70's and 80's. I somehow feel it changing, at least in Germany.
 
FORESTIER -- What I would say is that young people, especially in the university, in school, have changed a little bit. But if you are talking to anyone on the street -- especially when you are talking to civil servants, one-third of the work force in France -- they don't like at all this sort of wealth going around in the economy.
 
WILLAERT -- What worries me most in the whole concept of the new economy is how very important perception is for the value of a company. If things go down on Nasdaq, Easdaq follows, and you have quite a domino effect throughout the world. These are things that do not emanate from an individual company and that you do not have control of.
But the fact is when people like Motorola, Intel or Microsoft issue profit warnings, that is enough for a lot of investors to run out of the technology sector.
You can say all right, whether our company has a market cap of $7 billion or only $5 billion, you won't eat one steak less or more as an entrepreneur. But, mind you, at a certain moment when you're using your shares as a currency to acquire other companies, these things become important. So if you're not careful, you're overtaken by elements that are totally out of your control.
 
WORTH -- It works the other way. You could be acquired equally if your share value is low. That makes you more receptive to an acquisition.
 
WILLAERT -- Absolutely, absolutely.
 
Navigating a New Era
 
Q. Is this a new era, then, an environment that European executives have to deal with and are ready to deal with?
 
WILLAERT -- I think we're enjoying it right now, because it is a new challenge, it's a new game, and we're not playing too badly. What I just wonder is whether we're all aware of the consequences, ultimately, of that type of game.
 
Q. Is Europe having a harder time throwing away fundamentals?
 
FORESTIER -- There was a joke going around France recently during the drop in the market. The Nasdaq closed down and, of course, the following morning, the French stock market was down. Then one day, the Nasdaq was high, and the following morning the French stock market was down. And so someone wrote: Well, who knew? We don't need the Americans to go down.
Seriously, the problem in France is that we started much later than the U.S. economy on the model and the growth. And so if the U.S. economy is slowing down, it could really slow us down before we really arrive at something good.
 
SCHOELLER -- There's no reason that the economy slows down.
 
FORESTIER -- I hope not.
 
SCHOELLER -- Because new technology enables growth without heating up inflation and enables more and more services to be exchanged. And there is no limit to exchanging services. It doesn't cost material, it doesn't cost energy, it doesn't waste anything. And our Internet world allows us to grow in services without limit, without a top.
That's why I don't see growth going down at all. We only have an issue of how long shall the Europeans move slower, and how efficiently will the European government, with one currency, promote competition.
 
A Sustainable Boom?
 
Q. People say the American economy has moved into a phase of sustained growth, whereas in Europe the danger is that it's simply another cyclical upswing. Do you agree?
 
 
BIKKER -- No doubt about it that we follow the U.S. market, because there is not a U.S. market and a European market and an Asian market anymore. There is a global market. I guess Holland and Germany are the No. 2 and 3 investors in the U.S.
 
Q.What about labor mobility?
 
BIKKER -- Labor mobility is much lower in Europe, because of the culture and the language. That's not an economic difference; that's a generational difference.
 
Q. Christian, do you find that this is the case?
 
HUNT -- People are ready to move, for sure. And as we move more into a service economy, physical mobility becomes less of a requirement, actually. You need people to be able to work in global companies and speak languages -- speak English in particular. More and more people are able to do that. Now you can work on the network from Alaska, servicing a company based in India. I mean, all the software development companies use offices in India and all over the world to be able to work on a 24-hour basis.
And I guess that's an area where Europe actually has an advantage, because we are more used to different languages.
 
Q. But there are obstacles, too.
 
WORTH -- There are all sorts of impediments. We've got different tax regimes in different nations. We've got different legal structures. When we wanted to set up in Holland and Germany, we doubled our legal bill to write contractual agreements, to employ staff, to license customers. And then you go to another nation; you do it again.
 
SCHOELLER -- The banks. Banks cannot control assets in other countries.
 
WORTH -- So you have another bank account. In America, a state is part of the same nation. So you achieve economies of scale. And I think that's quite significant. We're not quite on this boom yet in Europe.
 
SCHOELLER -- But still, we're on a track to --
 
WORTH -- I agree. We are moving forward. But there are still very entrenched problems in Europe. Americans can sell to 250 million consumers. Don't kid yourself. We can't sell to 300 million consumers in Europe as readily as you can in the States. We incur much more cost and many more impediments, and I think many of those things will take longer to change.
 
HUNT -- Yes, but if you look at it from a global point of view, we are in a much better position to sell to Europeans because we understand European culture.
 
WORTH -- Certainly.
 
HUNT -- The Americans probably have more difficulty in doing that. And certainly if we can leverage on that capacity, we can do that also on a global basis. So to the various cultural environments, the various tax environments, the new generation of entrepreneurs says: Nobody operates in an ideal environment. That's the environment we have to deal with, and we find solutions around that.
Sometimes it means the underground economy. Sometimes it means other solutions. And altogether, we are developing skills that will be, I think, very, very useful for the global economy.
 
The Impact of the Euro
 
Q. What difference has the euro made? And is it creating pressure for change?
 
HUNT -- It is. The main impact, seen from my own perspective, is it's another element showing that European economics is becoming actually one element in the global economy, that it is becoming one single economy. And, sure, it means stability. It means it's a lot easier to do business between France and Germany and Belgium and the Netherlands, etc., and there's no risk factor in exchange risk.
 
Q. Mr. Willaert, has it made a big difference for your company?
 
WILLAERT -- Let me put it this way: The euro has been launched in a very euphoric way. And I think it gave us, as Europeans, a good feeling that we were now ready to face international competition.
But I don't really see, at this moment, very much progress in really having a unified market. I still feel that countries individually take advantage, and that there is a tremendous difference in doing business in France than in Holland, Belgium, Germany and the U.K. Having said that, all the business community felt strongly in support of the euro because, in our inter-European transactions, it helps a great deal.
A lot of the future of the European Community will have to do with the social aspects and the harmonizing of the social aspects -- because, let's face it, if you have things made in Portugal, they're bound to be a lot cheaper than in Holland. If you have things made in Greece, they're bound to be a lot cheaper.
Whether it really has an impact on European business with the rest of the world? I'm not too sure. I get the feeling we're sheltering ourselves within a little bit of Fortress Europe.
 
SCHOELLER -- The question is: Can we afford forever this free world trade theory, or shall we switch to what has already been discussed in Seattle -- a fair trade theory, where free trade can happen when a country applies certain minimum salaries and certain minimum ecological standards? That's the question.

WILLAERT -- This is what affects political decision-making. We have politicians who will go against mobility, because they are afraid that the new economy will take jobs from local people. But that is not necessarily the case.
 
Q. So what is the solution?
 
WILLAERT -- My feeling is that we do not have political statesmanship anymore. And that is the major problem that we have. We still have European nations where every politician is getting a profile for himself and is capable of falling back on his national political playing field. We are not harmonizing the situation within Europe.
 
BIKKER -- The policy makers are focused on very rigid systems to solve all the problems with one system for everything.
 
SCHOELLER -- And the market is assaulted by demands for flexibility.
 
Q. Is the overall trend heading in the direction of liberalization, the direction supportive of entrepreneurs, regardless of what political party is in power in the country?
 
SCHOELLER -- I think that everybody would agree that politicians have less and less leverage, and instead of being there like the king and deciding what has to happen, they have to run after the resources to make their country efficient and look attractive, just like companies have to be attractive. It's like running a club. They have to say: "I ask a membership fee, it's less than the other guy and we still have good services here." And this triggers a sense of competition that was never there before.
And the other thing is that entrepreneurs don't feel the government too much, because we have the freedom of capital. The poor victim is the employee. And the employees should stand up and should ask governments to make a more entrepreneur-friendly country, to get more entrepreneurs in and make jobs.
 
BIKKER -- Twenty years ago, we had a left-wing -- very left-wing -- minister of economic affairs in the Dutch market. And that was the reason one of the leading guys of Royal Dutch, a member of the board, left Shell after 20 years of serving Shell all over the world, to become a member of Parliament -- just to oppose these left-wing politics. Now, 20 years later, the one is the president of the European Central Bank, the other is a European Union commissioner for fiscal affairs, and they tell exactly the same story.
 
HUNT -- Maybe the weakness or the strength of the dollar is an illustration of everything we're talking about here. If the euro goes further down, it's going to become alarming, and hopefully everybody's going to wake up and say, "O.K., now we really have to do something about this." And it becomes easier to say that to the French unions, etc. And I guess it represents the pressure of the financial markets here, international financial markets, who are saying we've got to do something. Because the European economy is not doing that badly. And the euro should be stronger.
 
Rewards for Risk-Takers
 
Q. I am struck by the incredible popularity, in companies going public these days, of stock options and other kinds of incentive programs -- and of the possibility of getting very rich very quickly. That implies, with it, a whole different attitude on the part of employees toward loyalty, staying with a company, notions of relative egalitarian pay and so forth. Do these things change business culture for you?
 
BIKKER -- Of course, it has an impact on corporate culture and ways of working. It's new, and we want it old. In Western Europe, it used to be that your whole life was guaranteed and organized. So this feels like quite the opposite. And we will end up in the middle, I guess.
 
SCHOELLER -- I think it's helpful -- because it puts tremendous additional pressure on performing and benchmarking and transparency and professionalism that wasn't there before, when we were a private company. And if we look at the stock markets that have grown by 15 percent while the economy grows by 3 percent, one can deduce from it that you can get in the left lane and start heading faster. It's caused much more work and much more stress, but it points in the right direction.
 
BIKKER -- And much more fun.
 
WORTH -- I don't know about you chaps, but I'm firmly in favor of share options. We're still privately owned, and we have 14 percent of the equity amongst 176 staff out of 230-odd. And it brings people to pay attention to what we do; it makes them be constructive, be critical of their colleagues. They don't waste raw materials or energy.
But the other thing that I find quite amusing and interesting is that it obliges people to learn about the business of business, where before they didn't. You know, what is a joint stock company? What is this private or public limited liability? What's the difference between a shareholder and an officer and a member?
 
BIKKER -- And this helps.
 
WORTH -- I think it's very progressive for everyone.
 
BIKKER -- This also helps in creating breakaways -- new start-ups.
 
WORTH -- Well, one of the humorous bits is you then have trained executives who know how to do all those things. But that's part of the game, isn't it? What goes around comes around.
 
BIKKER -- I guess one of the biggest compliments you can have as an entrepreneur is the number of breakaways.
 
WORTH -- Exactly.
 
BIKKER -- That's the way the Dutch play soccer.

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.;
The Fed, in a Supporting Role for the Euro

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
THE European Central Bank has not been the best friend of the beleaguered euro over its 16 1/2-month life. The confusing signals that bank officials have sent about the euro, the unified currency of 11 European nations, have clearly contributed to its 21 percent decline against the dollar.
And while hints of European Central Bank intervention to support the euro helped it rally last week, to 91.96 cents as of Friday, it remains near its record low of 89.48 cents, reached on May 3. Several American currency analysts still expect the euro to fall as low as 85 cents. 
 So where can Europeans turn for help? Try the United States Federal Reserve, whose policy makers on Tuesday are expected to raise their short-term interest rate target for the sixth time since last June. The only debate is whether the rate increase will be a quarter of a percentage point, like the previous five, or a half-point, in response to recent signs of inflationary pressure.
How could Fed action help Europe?
There are several possible scripts, some of which have the euro continuing to fall -- and the dollar continuing to rise -- in the near term. But longer term, if it finally becomes clear that the Fed is not only determined to slow the American economy but that it is also accomplishing that goal, then the dollar will lose its lift against the euro. And that is important for American investors who have bet on European stocks. The euro's plunge this year has turned almost all of Europe's stock market gains to minuses for American investors.
One possibility is probably best for the euro: a half-point increase in interest rates by the Fed. That would help cement the view that the Fed will not stop raising rates until the annual pace of economic growth slows in the United States from the 5 percent pace of the last four quarters to something closer to 3 or 3.5 percent.
The Fed could underline that message with a statement that "the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future." In fact, those words were included with the announcement of the quarter-point increase in March. Repeating it would signal that there are more rate increases to come.
Adding to the market tension on Tuesday will be the government report on the Consumer Price Index for April. It was the unexpected March jump of 0.4 percent in the core index, which excludes food and energy, that raised the specter of a more aggressive Fed. Another high number would increase inflation fears, making investors even more leery of future rate increases.
Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Securities, said a high consumer price number and a half-point rate increase would suggest that the United States economy was headed for a hard landing -- and equities would take a hit. Further stock market declines could help break the confidence of European investors in the American market, meaning they would sell American stocks and convert their dollars back to euros.
In the longer term, the slowing of growth in the United States, in comparison with Europe, is what will weaken the dollar and strengthen the euro. "More convincing than ever is the notion that the United States economy is going to slow," said James McCormick, currency strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. "If the Fed goes half a percentage point and comes up with a strong statement, that is telling you that the growth is going to slow."
That does not mean the euro will turn on a dime. Mr. McCormick expects the euro to fall to 86 cents, because direct European investment in the United States is strong, and there are no sure signs yet that the American economy is slowing. The 0.2 percent downturn in retail sales in April, the first decline since August 1998, buoyed some equity investors. But one month's numbers do not a trend make.
Still, an American investor who believes that the euro can turn in the months ahead would do well to buy European stocks now -- they are cheaper when the dollar is stronger -- and then get the benefit when the euro rallies, making European stocks more valuable in dollar terms.
WILLAERT -- What is important to realize is that Europe is going through a transition period. I think that's the key word there. And transition means a balancing act. And we are not doing too badly on that balancing act. But I would hope for a bit more statesmanship on the European level to improve on the longer-term vision of what we are doing.
And I think if we can take a lot of the good aspects from the U.S. economy -- take some of the good points there and mix it and blend it with where we are traditionally strong: a good basis of social security, a good concept of health care, good schooling. If we can blend that to a good mixture, I think Europe has a fantastic future.
 
FORESTIER -- I think that Americans should realize that Europe is different from America, that the idea's not for Europe to do exactly the same as America, only a few years after. Europe will succeed by inventing a new way of doing business, especially business in the new economy. And I'm really confident about what we are going to invent, provided all the world surrounding us remains stable, because we are really dependent on government.
What worries me more is the pace of it. I mean, within 10 years we definitely have invented something new and something profound, but how fast is it going to move? And is the surrounding world going to wait for us to make our move?
 
BIKKER -- We are absolutely on the right track, and I'm very positive about our future. Let's focus on the very good things that many countries in Europe have organized pretty well. Probably Scandinavia and, I think, the Dutch are the best in education and health care. I've got a lot of kids and I don't pay any kind of hospital care or education costs --
 
SCHOELLER -- But if you would pay, our system becomes more efficient.
 
BIKKER -- That's one of my big problems with Europe: We have by far too many fines, and subsidies for all kinds of initiatives. If we can bring them back down to zero, in agriculture and also other industries, that will speed up prosperity.
 
HUNT -- Just like everybody else, I'm quite optimistic on the future of Europe. First of all, because it's never the endgame, it's an ongoing game forever -- at least that's what we hope. And I think that the biggest challenge for everybody today is globalization, and I believe that Europe is quite well placed from that point of view.
 
SCHOELLER -- I would say from the American perspective, if you look to Europe, the trends are very positive -- the political trends and liberalization, an easing environment for business. We have the trends of innovation. We have the trends that if capital markets catch up, the stock exchanges catch up, the Internet catches up. It's like an undervalued stock.
And I think the fact that we have the multicultural challenge -- that one McDonald's burger cannot be sold all over the world the same way because of the cultural differences -- makes us more fit.
And we have to be able to grow, so even if governments put many hurdles before us, we are still growing. Sometimes American investors think it's better to keep their money in America, but they have much more potential to unlock if they put it into Europe.
 
Q. When's the secondary offering? Sign me up. Simon?
 
WORTH -- We are changing. We are deregulating and becoming more liberal in the business environment, and I suspect for Americans, that balancing act is what they'll see.
 
Q. Thank you all very much.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 21, 2000, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday with the Portfolios, Etc. column, about the prospects for the euro amid rising interest rates in the United States, carried an incorrect scale label. Figures charted for the euro's value were expressed in dollars to the euro, not the reverse.
A chart last Sunday with a round-table discussion by executives of six fast-growing European companies misstated the estimated 2000 revenue for one company, the EMDS Group. It is $21 million, not $25 million.
Another chart with the article misstated stock prices for a second company, D Interactive. The 52-week high and low prices were $240.28 and $16.99, not $256 and $15. The closing price on Friday, May 12, was $89.14, not $107.

The Way We Live Now

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
IT may take a village to raise a child, but a family still ought to be able to afford one. It now costs about $160,140 to raise a middle-class child through age 17, according to the Department of Agriculture's annual report, "Expenditures on Children by Families." That's up from $25,229 in 1960 and $69,333 in 1980, seemingly a huge increase. But that 1960 figure, adjusted for inflation, would equal $141, 998 today, so in fact, the cost of brining up baby has risen only about 13 percent since 1960.
Housing has always been the biggest single expense, these days making up about a third of the cost of rearing a child, just as it did 40 years ago. But many other expenditures have changed since then. 
 In 1960, for example, child care was a tiny subcategory lumped into overall housing costs. In the 1970's, however, as mothers of young children poured into the work force, child care expenditures shot up. By the 1980's, child care and education were given their own category, which now comprises an average 10 percent of expenses for preteens. Education costs -- school supplies, books and tuition -- have risen, too. They now accounts for 8 percent of family spending on teenagers, up from only 2 percent in 1960. A large proportion of that increase is likely due to spending on private school, according to Mark Lino, the Agriculture Department economist responsible for the report.
Health care costs, 4 percent of the total in 1960, are now at 7 percent, having risen sharply in the last 10 years. Food and clothing, by contrast, haven't fallen as a percentage of the whole.
Single-parent families spend about as much on each oftheir children as much as two-parent families, by using a greater share of their income for their children. And across all income strata, families with a single child lavish about a third more on that child than families with three or more children spend on each of theirs. The rich spend about half again as much on food, clothes and health care than the poor, and more than twice as much on housing, childcare and education.
Costs are highest in in Western cities, lowest in rural areas and Midwestern cities. And as every parent finds out, older children cost more than younger ones: child care costs go down, but not enough to make up for all the extra food, clothes, and video games.
The middle-income baby born last year, incidentally, will have cost $236,680 by the year 2016, the Department of Agriculture estimates. But don't worry, that's not adjusted for inflation. Keep in mind, however, that even after college bills are paid, almost half of all parents in their fifties are still supporting their over-21 children.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Reaching For Power Over Streets And Sky

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
IS architecture an art? What restrictions can government place on architects without violating constitutional principles?
A new proposal to overhaul the city's zoning laws is now forcing New Yorkers to confront these fundamental questions. Titled the Uniform Bulk Program, the proposal amounts to the architectural manifesto of the Giuliani administration -- a major statement on the most famous skyline in the universe. The statement goes something like this: New York to Architecture: Drop Dead! At the precise moment when things are looking up for the continuous art of building our great city, here comes the cultural equivalent of the street crimes unit. Back in line! Back in line! We got architecture off the streets 40 years ago, and we're not going to let it back now! 
 Proposed by the Department of City Planning, the Uniform Bulk Program is now wending its way through the public review process required before it can become law. The plan has already been endorsed by community boards. The City Council is expected to vote on it sometime this summer.
But what is it? And why is it here? What's the point? It's hard to get straight answers to such questions. At a public hearing in late April, it was obvious that even members of the city's Planning Commission were in the dark. In a series of exchanges with representatives from civic and real estate groups, the commissioners seemed as eager as anyone to figure out just what their own staff had cooked up. With only a few weeks left to make revisions, the plan headed for the City Council vote has many people asking "say what?"
But there is no apparent strategy to deceive the public. The issue is much more complicated. Real estate development and municipal government are two relics of the 19th-century industrial city. In the information age, the power of both groups has vastly diminished. They are both in major denial about this. Both sense that the center of power has shifted to the cultural plane. But neither of them knows how to climb up there. The Uniform Bulk Program is supposed to give them a boost. It's designed to give a cultural aura to what are fundamentally economic and political transactions. Unfortunately, it does so at the expense of architecture that has a genuine cultural contribution to make.
Some features are discernible within the program's nebula of charts, graphs, codes and bureaucratic jargon. Three of these would have a substantial impact on architecture in New York. The first two we might call the Tops and Bottoms of the new urban silhouette.
* The plan would set height limits on new skyscrapers throughout the city. Depending on location, the height would vary from 360 feet to 495 feet to 720 feet. Large swaths of midtown and lower Manhattan would be exempt, along with downtown Brooklyn and Long Island City, Queens.
* The plan would abolish current zoning regulations that encourage developers to create small public parks and plazas in exchange for added height. Instead, new towers would sit on low-rise bases that extend to the street wall. These would typically be used for retail. The planning department describes this so-called contextual format as a rejection of the towers-in-a-park concept encouraged by the 1961 zoning resolution, which is still in effect.
* The third provision, by far the most ominous of the three, calls for the creation of a design review panel within the city planning department. Chosen by the department's chairman, a political appointee, the panel would consist of "architects and others concerned with design issues." Assuming a function now held by the city's Board of Standards and Appeals, it would review applications from developers seeking special permits that would exempt them from the new contextual zoning.
Since the Uniform Bulk Program is a political as well as a cultural document, it's worth speculating about the political motives behind it, even though, with such a secretive and rigid city administration, it is natural to suspect the worst. Here are some suspicions.
The Law of the Instrument states: the instrument must be used. With so many planning functions now performed by other city, state and federal agencies, as well as private business improvement districts, something must be found for City Planning to do. Here it is.
With only two years remaining in his term as planning chairman, Joseph B. Rose wants to be remembered for doing Something. The Something could just as easily be Something Else. It happens to be this.
The program is an elaborate operation intended primarily to give Mr. Rose control over the special permit procedure now supervised by the Board of Standards and Appeals. Mr. Rose, who comes from one of New York's most illustrious real estate families, has the makings of a frustrated architect. The special permit process would enable him and his successors to fiddle with forms and shapes without being subject to public scrutiny or accountability.
Hence, the ultimate goal of the Uniform Bulk Program is to turn the city planning chairman -- whoever it may be -- into the design czar of New York, with sweeping powers to define the cityscape for years to come.
Like architecture, the Uniform Bulk Program can be analyzed on two planes: the material and the metaphoric. Real estate developers will find the program's material implications of greater interest. What must they do to comply? How much will compliance cost them, in time and square feet? Will there be a grace period for projects in the works? Will the new zoning simplify permits? How will it affect the market?
Those interested primarily in architectural values must reckon with the program's symbolic as well as its material value. The two realms are interlocked. In architecture, quantity can be a quality. To some developers, tall buildings may signify little more than tall profits. But they are also elements in a skyline that rivals the Gothic cathedral in symbolic power. By the same token, developers may regard a bonus plaza simply as a device that enables them to add more rentable floors. But it is also a void in a city that has little tolerance for undeveloped land. In this case, lack of quantity is a quality, at least if you like voids.
The sky and the street are in themselves symbolic. They are contested spaces where the rights of private ownership and public use come into frequent conflict. Contestation, in fact, is what these spaces symbolize. We can quantify them in terms of shadow, sky exposure, required seating and trees, but their symbolic value lies in the tension between freedom and equality in a democratic society.
Contextualism, the overarching ideology of the Uniform Bulk Program, offers to resolve this tension in symbolic form. By limiting the visual impact of new buildings, contextual architecture is supposed to give people the sense that they are in control of their surroundings. This, at least, is the underlying theory. The abolition of plazas, the requirement that buildings extend to street walls, is intended to preserve the existing character of neighborhoods. The adoption of height limits, similarly, is meant to preserve the existing skyline as a picture postcard. The competitive urges of developers like Donald Trump will not be permitted to disturb its Art Deco ziggurat contour.
In practice things are far less ideal. It is easy to find examples of bonus plazas to illustrate the argument that these public spaces should be abolished. What such examples actually show, of course, is that they were poorly designed, that their developers have no stake in maintaining them and that city officials lack the will to demand improvements. But there are other examples -- I happen to live in a building blessed with one -- in which the bonus park beautifully fulfills its original concept. In real as well as symbolic terms, the park helps bridge the chasm between private luxury and public amenity. This was a worthy experiment for the capital of modern democracy to undertake.
It scares me to imagine the mentality that wants to preserve the skyline in its present form. It is painful, of course, to make that skyward stretch each time a new skyscraper takes shape and towers over its neighbors. But that stretch is the context of New York. Changes in scale, evolutions in form: these are traditional training exercises for a city that prides itself on its ability to adapt to change. If you don't stop before the miracle happens, a building that once seemed objectionably out of scale may eventually look custom-made to your perception. It is hard to believe that New Yorkers will take to squat, stubby towers with quite the same pride they take in the Woolworth Building, the Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center.
At one time, it may have made sense to equate the term "context" with a new building's immediate physical surroundings. But the context has changed. The informational city is global. New buildings in New York are inevitably seen in the context of new buildings going up in London, Tokyo, Paris, Sydney and other cosmopolitan centers. And as New York has demonstrated all too glaringly in recent years, abject obedience to the conventional idea of context may violate the expanded context of contemporary urban life.
History is repeating itself. This is the first thing about the Uniform Bulk Program that will strike those whose memories stretch back as far as the 1960's. Once again, the New York planning department is laying down a set of zoning regulations based on ideas that have been around for 40 years.
The 1961 zoning resolution, which the Uniform Bulk Program is intended to counteract, was based on ideas first proposed by the French architect Le Corbusier in the 1920's. A critique of picturesque city planning principles then in effect, Le Corbusier's 1923 plan for the Contemporary City was a hybrid of the English garden city and the Futurist utopia of mechanized transportation. By replacing traditional streets with highways and elevators, the plan would clear congested ground area for green, open space.
The model was taken up by American planners and architects in the postwar years, with mixed results. In New York, Stuyvesant Town, Silver Towers, Waterside remain fine examples of the towers-in-a-park genre. Used as a formula for low-income housing, however, the concept became synonymous with the projects, highrise ghettos for blacks. By the time of the 1961 zoning, in other words, what began as a critique of the status quo had hardened into a new version of it. It had become the dogma of its time.
Contextualism began as a critique of that dogma, in fact. In 1961, Jane Jacobs's "Death and Life of Great American Cities" was an explicit attack on the towers-in-a-park model. Not long after, preservationists widened their scope from individual buildings to entire so-called historic districts. By the late 1960's, it was customary to regard developers and architects as enemies of the city. The animosity was intensified by the postmodern movement, which promised to create buildings more attuned to popular taste.
Now this critique, too, has congealed into dogma, and is about to be codified into law in turn. And we have already seen the current dogma's dubious architectural consequences. Historic neighborhoods, like South Street Seaport, converted into shopping malls. New neighborhoods, like Battery Park City, designed like prewar theme parks. And stumpy towers on low-rise bases, like One Union Square South.
But the most toxic effect of the contextualist dogma is invisible. It is the virtual disappearance of architecture from New York in recent decades. The theme park stuff would be almost tolerable if the city had encouraged the development of architecture as an art of reckoning creatively with the changing urban condition. But it has not. Instead, it has continued to regard architecture as an alien presence, an immanent invasion from Mars.
ONE positive thing must be said about the Uniform Bulk Program. It represents a long-overdue challenge to the excessive power wielded by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission in recent years. With the creation of historic districts, the landmarks commission has usurped the role of city planning and led the way in the conversion of Manhattan into a theme park. Unfortunately, city planning's effort to check this development does not go far enough. The program's uncritical acceptance of contextualism in fact portends more Disneyfication.
Too tall, too short, or just right for Goldilocks. Here's the weird thing: everything proposed by the Uniform Bulk Program is entirely a matter of taste. Height, context and quality are all areas where subjectivity reigns. They are matters of personal opinion. I like tall buildings and voids. Others don't. We may all disagree about what distinguishes architecture from real estate. This is as it should be. But how did we get to the point where the legislation of taste could be considered an acceptable function of city planning?
Zoning began in 1916 as an instrument for protecting public health. People shouldn't live in airless tenements or work in office or industrial buildings that lack adequate light and ventilation. Housing shouldn't be built next to factories or slaughterhouses. The Corbusian Ville Radieuse was promoted as a public health mission. Open space would bring in light and fresh air, eliminating the congestion that bred disease. This was a reasonable, even a scientific, approach to designing cities before penicillin had been introduced.
In the postwar decades, urban renewal in the United States also came packaged with the rhetoric of hygiene. Slums were cancer. Planners were surgeons. Slum clearance was an operation to remove tumors from the urban body. The goal of planning for public health had shifted from the realm of physical reality to that of metaphor. A tuberculosis pathogen is a physical entity. But a tenement is not a tumor. To view it as such required a certain way of seeing. It reflected culturally constructed ideas about good and bad ways to live.
Mercifully, the Uniform Bulk Program doesn't even bother with public health metaphors. But contextualism comes with a mythology of its own -- the veneer of Junior League politesse often wielded by philistines on a rampage. "Practical," "attractive," "innovative," "within the city's enduring traditions" -- or: sensible pumps, a string of pearls and a splash of naughty French perfume.
With this program, city planning has crossed a decisive line. Without even a nod to the quantifiable goals that brought zoning into being, it has set up shop in the sphere of aesthetic preference. By embracing contextualism -- or any other aesthetic concept -- city planning enters an area where constitutional protections could apply. While the First Amendment does not protect all forms of communication, the Uniform Bulk Program compels us to ask to what extent architecture is a protected form of speech.
In the field of urban semiotics, taste is defined as ideology codified in space. The Uniform Bulk Program is a highly ideological document in this sense. It aims to impose an aesthetic standard on buildings throughout New York. But it also offers a golden opportunity to crack the contextual code.
We inhabit the hub of the advanced capitalist world. We love it here, and even if we wanted to leave, there's no other world to go to. But many of the ills associated with cities -- economic inequality, social fragmentation, disregard for the economically unproductive, the gap between public and private amenity -- are by-products of our way of life. Saskia Sassen, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University, has described ours as the Eviction Society. We exist in a perpetual state of displacement and dislocation created by the economic cycles that drive the fluctuating value of land.
Architecture has traditionally been used to compensate for these unsavory effects. A century ago, the robber barons of the Gilded Age commissioned architects to design such beloved landmarks as the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Later, the magnificent spectacle of the Manhattan skyline went far toward mitigating the violence its construction inflicted on the urban landscape. The bonus plaza was conceived as a benefit for those who do not profit from the real estate industry.
Another compensation -- some might even say redemption -- is the freedom to respond creatively to our way of life. This is no less true in architecture than it is in literature, painting, photography, song or dance. From the Brooklyn Bridge to Frank Gehry's design for a new Guggenheim museum proposed for a site close by, New York's greatest buildings have provided signposts to change. They are forms of communication in which the imagination is placed at the service of truth about its time.
Up to a point, contextualism offers a useful compensation for the eviction economy. It is in the public interest to protect the environment from being incessantly blown to smithereens. Beyond that point, contextualism becomes a form of brainwashing. Like the private shopping mall designed to look like a public town square, the contextual veneer sends out a false message about the city we actually inhabit.
The single most powerful deterrent to architecture in New York is the blurring of the distinction between architecture and real estate. Cities may be able to survive without architecture. They can't survive without discrimination in taste. What would be the point? Cities are places where people are supposed to give their best. Without discrimination, who's to know what "best" means? Few would claim that Harlequin Romances are literature, yet we now have a skyline packed with Harlequin Romance buildings, clamoring to be recognized as architecture. How to deny them this status in a city where the real thing hardly ever comes along?
It's easy to overlook one crucial fact about the urban shift from industrial to cultural production: one major industry has not been left behind. Real estate development is an industry of the old economy that remains active in the city of the new. Other forms of manufacturing have been squeezed out of town or shipped overseas. But real estate development still cranks out material product in a city where all else has dematerialized into pixels. When we peer up and watch the cranes swiveling on the skyline, we should keep in mind that we are looking at relics of the old industrial city towering -- if unsteadily -- over the rise of the new.
And we should keep in mind that municipal government, too, is a relic of the old industrial city -- a dinosaur from the era of "Meet John Doe." Smoke-pumping factories, cigar-chomping tycoons, duplicitous union bosses, agitating longshoremen -- all gone now. Alas, our pols seem to think they're still governing this vanished burg. Except when it comes to hiring campaign strategists, our pols know little about the city of symbolic analysis they govern.
REAL estate developers and politicians, in other words, need each other more than ever. In addition to their traditional economic codependence -- donations made by developers in exchange for a climate favorable to them -- there is the need for moral support as the pair of them venture into a city that they do not understand or particularly care for. And why should they like a city that is fast accelerating beyond their 19th-century reach?
The Uniform Bulk Program represents a strategic alliance between these two aging powers trying to survive in a rapidly changing urban environment. Because of its proposed height restrictions, some regard the program as anti-development. The real estate community has responded as if this were in fact the case. But this is just a bit of roughhouse between the dinosaurs. The truth is that both City Hall and developers stand to gain from this transaction. There are those who still believe that contextualism is a positive architectural idea, rather than the anti-architectural refuge it has become. By embracing contextualism as an aesthetic, developers and politicians acquire the aura of cultural value. In their own minds, at least, this qualifies them for citizenship in the cultural city.
The design review process proposed by the Uniform Bulk Program will provide a more hazardous route to cultural distinction. Imagine that you are a developer. Your architect has proposed a design that does not conform to the contextual zoning. You have two options. You can apply to the Department of City Planning for a special permit. The approval process could take up to a year, with no guarantee that a permit would be granted. Or you can fire your architect and hire a hack.
But let's suppose that you really want to do the right thing. You apply for the permit. The design review panel is convened. The architect walks into the room to present his project, and the entire table is seated with hacks. The worst kind of hacks. Hacks with opinions. One hack wants a stepped silhouette; another wants an Art Deco crown; a third wants an avant-garde fold; a fourth wants glass instead of stone. If your architect will agree to these modifications, the panel will recommend granting the permit. Otherwise -- hack, hack, hack.
You will still end up with hackery, just as if you hadn't bothered to go through the process. And the hackery will be much more expensive. But for the extra dough you'll get to put a little golden sticker on your hack job: the City Hall Mark of Excellence. People can go on mistaking real estate for architecture, and rejecting genuine architecture for being weird, far-out and alien.
Government does have a role to play in raising architectural standards. Paris, Barcelona, Helsinki, Berlin, Tokyo and many other cities use the independent jury system for that purpose. The function of the jury system is to protect architecture from political and economic pressures. As framed by the Uniform Bulk Program, the design review panel could well have the opposite effect.
 This appraisal could not have been written in 1961, even if the Uniform Bulk Program had existed then. Forty years ago, planners and architects operated in a city where the concept of culture had little significance outside the sphere of anthropology. This has changed. The term now extends far beyond the compass of any particular field and has become a common tool for making connections between art, economics, psychology, philosophy and many other fields.
Architects today are operating in this expanded cultural framework. This is the context of architecture today. It is emerging in the work of designers as various as Renzo Piano, Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Steven Holl, Eric Owen Moss, Thom Mayne and Zaha Hadid.
The Uniform Bulk Program has stumbled into this context but is in no way part of it. That is what makes its cultural pretensions so ludicrous. Here was an opportunity for city planning to enlarge the conceptual framework for architecture in New York, to bring architecture into line with the transformations now overtaking urban life everywhere. That opportunity has been lost. Instead, city planning has reheated stale ideas and proposes to pass them into law. It's difficult to accept the inevitability of this.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Seattle

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK; SAM HOWE VERHOVEK is a Times correspondent based in Seattle.

 BODY:
Seattle certainly made a name for itself last December as host to the World Trade Organization meeting. The boosters' idea of using the summit to show off their city as a world-class friend to free trade didn't exactly pan out, amid all the demonstrations and the tear gas, but many residents think that the raucous protests against globalization amounted to a badge of honor for Seattle.
Now the long-running tension here, between those who revel in the high-tech, high-wealth place Seattle has become and those who fret that the city is losing its quirky small-town charm, has a new focus: next month, a museum designed by Frank Gehry, known as the Experience Music Project, opens at the base of the Space Needle. Wildly curvy and colorful, built roughly in the shape of a guitar with the Seattle Center's monorail running through it, the museum is a celebration of modern music and includes a sound lab that, the museum says, lets you "plug in, jam, dance, wail, scratch, learn, connect and, ultimately, experience the euphoria of making music." Some consider the building a brilliant addition to the architectural scene; some call it a curse on the civic landscape. Come and judge for yourself. 
 Dot-com frenzy and cultural activity of all kinds continue to bloom and, as always, late spring and summer remain a time when the natural grandeur in and around Seattle is on particularly glorious display. For information, call the Convention and Visitors Bureau, (206) 461-5840.
 
Events
The Experience Music Project, at the base of the Space Needle, (206) 367-5483, is scheduled to open June 23, but several events before then may allow visitors a peek inside this wacky building. Expect long lines at the make-your-own music studio, but with 3,000 items on view (including Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock guitar) and an archive of Pacific Northwest bands on tap, much else can be seen -- and heard. E.M.P., as it is already known, bills itself as offering "an interactive tribute to the evolution of American popular music through rock 'n' roll, jazz, soul, gospel, country, blues, hip-hop and punk."
On May 26 to 29, the Northwest Folklife Festival, at Seattle Center, (206) 684-7300, features over 5,000 participants with a range of arts and crafts, wandering performers, and stage presentations, not to mention the food, all intended to show off Seattle's world connections.
Watch out for flying fish (that's how many vendors get them across the counter to customers) at the Pike Place Market Festival, a celebration of the city's famous fish and farm market May 28 and 29. Hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; First Avenue and Pike Street; (206) 587-0351.
The Seattle Film Festival, (206) 324-9996, is a launching pad for foreign and independent American films bypassed by the local cineplex. The festival begins Thursday with the North American premier of Kenneth Branagh's version of "Love's Labor's Lost" and runs through June 11 at various locations.
Opened in 1998, Benaroya Hall, 200 University Street, (206) 215-4747, is the home of the Seattle Symphony. In May and June the symphony, under the direction of Gerard Schwarz, will present a range of concerts, many as part of its "Music of Our Time" and "Discover Music!" series.
 
Sightseeing
Seattle boasts many bike trails offering glorious vistas of the city, Puget Sound and both the Olympic and Cascade Mountains. At Blazing Saddles Bike Rentals, 1230 Western Avenue, (206) 341-9994, bikes (with helmet, locks and other accessories included) rent for $5 an hour and up.
If you don't feel so fleet of foot, join the other tourists and take Argosy Cruises' two-hour Lake Washington tour, which passes houseboats and the University of Washington campus on its way to the Gold Coast on the lake's east side. The boat passes by the famous techno-palace owned by Bill and Melinda Gates; a guide helpfully pointed out the trampoline room one recent day, where, she said, Mr. Gates "can go and bounce all his troubles away." Argosy, (206) 623-4252, also has tours of Puget Sound and dinner cruises. The Lake Washington tour is $24.
A cheaper but no less splendid way of seeing Seattle and the surrounding mountains is to climb aboard one of the many state ferries, which travel to nearby Bainbridge Island from Pier 52 downtown. Foot passengers pay $3.70 round trip; (206) 464-6400.
The Elliott Bay Book Company, one of the nation's best and largest independent bookstores, is a beloved institution, with a program of author readings and talks. It is an inviting place to meet a friend for coffee or browse for hours amid the Western red cedar shelves, at 101 South Main Street; (206) 624-6600.
The Seattle Art Museum, in a soaring Robert Venturi building at 100 University Street, (206) 654-3100, has an extensive collection of Northwest Indian, African, Impressionist, Greek and other art. The museum is also affiliated with the Seattle Asian Art Museum, 1400 East Prospect Street in Volunteer Park, which has a remarkable collection of art and artifacts from China, India, Korea and Japan. Both are open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday till 9. Suggested admission is $7 for the Seattle Art Museum, $3 for the Asian Art Museum.
The University of Washington has two outstanding museums on campus: the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, with permanent exhibitions on native art and Pacific Rim cultures, and the Henry Art Gallery, concentrating on modern and contemporary art, with a show through Aug. 20 on how technology has altered the American landscape. The Burke, (206) 543-5590, is open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday till 8; admission $5.50. The Henry, Northeast 41st and 15th Avenue NE, (206) 543-2280, is open daily except Monday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday till 8; admission $5.
 
Where to Stay
The visitors bureau's hotel line, (800) 535-7071, often features deals well below advertised prices.
The Inn at the Market, 86 Pine Street, (206) 443-3600, fax (206) 448-0631, has 70 antiques-filled rooms, many with views of the Pike Place Market, Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains. Doubles start at $170. Even if your room doesn't have a view, the rooftop balcony does, and is accessible to all guests.
"Sleep with the fishes" is the unusual offer made by the Hotel Monaco, 1101 Fourth Avenue, (206) 621-1770, fax (206) 621-7779, which promises to put a goldfish in a bowl in your room if you desire such company. The European-style boutique hotel has 189 rooms. Doubles from $195.
The Beatles slept there, and there's a 1964 picture of them fishing from the window of their suite to prove it at the 236-room Hotel Edgewater, Pier 67, 2411 Alaskan Way; (206) 728-7000, fax (206) 441-4119. The exterior is being remodeled in a style the hotel describes as Paul Bunyan meets high tech, and the rooms are Northwestern lodge style, many with stunning water and mountain views. Doubles from $169.
Budget: The 24-room Ace Hotel, 2423 First Avenue; (206) 448-4721, fax (206) 374-0745, advertised as a place for the "urban nomad on a mission for experience," is not for everybody. But it is an epicenter of Seattle's hipster scene, surrounded by stores and galleries in the Belltown area near downtown, a former flophouse for sailors that has been converted into a chic, sleek place with low beds and interesting steel fittings. Where one might normally look for the Gideon's Bible, expect to find stylized copies of the Kama Sutra. Standard rooms, with shared bath, start at $65; suites with private bath at $130.
The Seattle Inn, 225 Aurora Avenue North near downtown, (206) 728-7666, fax (206) 728-6108, has 159 standard rooms, an indoor pool, a whirlpool and parking. Double rates with Continental breakfast range from $59 to $115.
Luxury: The Four Seasons Olympic Hotel, 411 University Street, (206) 621-1700, fax (206) 682-9633, painstakingly restored several years ago to its pre-Depression Italianate Renaissance glory, has 450 spacious, classically decorated rooms, including 209 suites, and a chandeliered lobby and adjoining lounge. Rooms start at $305.
 
Where to Eat
Cascadia is one of those places that have some Seattleites raving that the city's restaurant scene has gone world-class and others saying that it's all getting a bit too showy. Indeed, the food is great, but expensive (French-press coffee, at $8 a cup, is high even for the city that gave us Starbucks). The restaurant features cherrywood paneling, a frosted glass waterfall of a wall dividing the dining area and kitchen, and a cozy bar. The food, all themed as Northwestern (defined as northern California up to Alaska, and the Pacific over to Montana), comes in the form of six rotating fixed-price tasting menus, in addition to the regular menu, from a vegetarian option at $65 to the "Decidedly Northwest" fare, including a salad of chilled dungeness crab with celery root and apple, salmon "prepared two ways," and Washington beefsteak with garlic straw fries, for $95. The extensive wine list features Washington and Oregon producers, but has many others as well. Cascadia is at 2328 First Avenue, between Bell and Battery; (206) 448-8884.
Cafe Campagne, 1600 Post Alley, (206) 728-2233, is a delightful Parisian-style bistro half a block from the Pike Place Market, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner daily and a Sunday brunch. A good appetizer is the port and pistachio crepinettes, served with a roasted red beet and arugula salad and dressed with horseradish vinaigrette. Specialties include pan-sauteed boneless trout with steamed potatoes and an almond, lemon and brown-butter pan sauce, and a daily rotisserie offering. Dinner for two, with wine, about $110.
The bounty of the northwest's waters -- clams, oysters, crabs, mussels, salmon, halibut -- is astonishing. At Etta's Seafood, 2020 Western Avenue, (206) 443-6000, the menu often changes depending on what's freshest, but among the best of the regulars is Etta's spice-rubbed and pit-roasted Alaskan king salmon with cornbread pudding and shiitake relish, or the sea scallops with udon noodles in a lemongrass-miso broth. Dinner for two, with wine: $120.
In a city with so many quirky neighborhoods, it follows that some of the most interesting restaurants are well away from the downtown lights. In the Phinney Ridge area, Carmelita offers "savory vegetarian fare" in its colorful dining room and also in a back patio enclosed by an herb garden. The seasonal menu is strictly vegetarian and vegan, but creative enough that confirmed meat-eaters will make repeat visits. Among current offerings are a phyllo tart with roasted portobello mushrooms topped with a truffle-arugula salsa, and pappardelle pasta with spring peas, pea tendrils, lemon balm and organic barrel-aged feta cheese. Dinner for two, with drinks from the extensive wine and microbrew list: $80. Open nightly except Monday; 7314 Greenwood Avenue North; (206) 706-7703.
At the Noodle Ranch, 2228 Second Avenue, (206) 728-0463, the pan-Asian menu, under the supervision of the Vietnamese chef, Nga Bui, offers an array of moderately priced dishes: Mekong grill with tofu or meat in a Vietnamese-style marinade, house pad Thai, Singapore noodles, spicy Japanese eggplant in a ginger sauce, Laotian cucumber salad, Saigon-style lemongrass chicken, and on and on. An excellent lunch or dinner, daily except Sunday, can cost as little as $12 a person.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
From Ireland, A Palette That's Dark Yet Humane

BYLINE: By KAREN FRICKER; Karen Fricker is an American theater critic who lives in Dublin.

DATELINE: GALWAY, Ireland

 BODY:
OUTSIDERS who might think of the rural Irish as an innocent and fun-loving people have very likely never encountered the plays of Marina Carr, perhaps the foremost female dramatist in Ireland today. Her deeply troubled characters inhabit a fallen paradise.
Ms. Carr's darkly lyrical family tragedies are written in the dialect of the Midlands region, halfway between Dublin and Galway, where they are set, an area that people even within Ireland tend to overlook. Her characters love too much and too deeply; they reject the roles that society assigns them; they curse and are cursed; they fight and they kill. 
 And yet for all their darkness, Ms. Carr's plays reveal a vivid sense of black comedy and poetic turns of phrase. A character in her latest work, "On Raftery's Hill," calls his depressive father "one sad picnic in the rain"; another remembers a particularly cold season: "That was a winter put manners on lovers, the whole mountain and valley courtin' with gloves on."
American audiences will have a chance to see a home-grown production of "On Raftery's Hill" in Washington this week. It is part of the "Island: Arts From Ireland" festival at the Kennedy Center, which began yesterday and which includes theater, music, dance, the visual arts and film. The theater segment, running from Wednesday through May 27, involves two other plays: "Catalpa," a solo show written and performed by Donal O'Kelly, about a 19th-century sea captain's voyage to rescue Irish prisoners from Australia; and "Pentecost," set in 1974 Belfast during a Protestant workers' strike and written by the late Northern Irish playwright Stewart Parker.
Two earlier plays by Ms. Carr, "The Mai" and "Portia Coughlin," have been well-received at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J. But "On Raftery's Hill" is so new that it had its world premiere this past Tuesday at the Town Hall Theater here. A co-production of the Druid Theater Company in Galway and the Royal Court Theater in London, it will be presented at the Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater from Thursday through next Sunday. The director is Garry Hynes, the artistic chief of the Druid company.
Ms. Hynes has, she said, "been close to Marina's writing from the beginning." She commissioned "The Mai" during her stint as artistic director of the Abbey Theater in the early 1990's and directed the world premiere of "Portia Coughlin" in 1996. Ms. Hynes was the first woman to win a Tony Award for directing a play on Broadway, winning for Martin McDonagh's "Beauty Queen of Leenane," which also had its world premiere here.
Speaking of Ms. Carr, Ms. Hynes said: "Marina has returned again and again to the family, to that central unit by which we organize our society, and has challenged how it works. What she's doing is extremely courageous. It has an extraordinary, terrible beauty."
Joyce McMillan, a theater critic for The Scotsman in Edinburgh, said of Ms. Carr's work: "I am not aware of another woman who writes about tragedy with such grandeur. She goes to a deep place that has not just to do with society now but that touches an inner tragedy of existence. The female quality of her writing comes through not only in the way she writes about women, it's in the physicality in her writing. She is right in there with the cycles of life, with the blood and the dirt."
Where does Ms. Carr's dystopian vision come from? The last person to offer easy answers is the writer herself. A sweet-faced, quiet-spoken 35-year-old, Ms. Carr is quite uninterested in explaining her plays or the impulses behind them. She rarely gives interviews and prefers not to discuss her private life. "My plays are not autobiographical," she said gently (twice) during a recent conversation in the Druid offices here.
The general details of Ms. Carr's life, however, are known in Ireland. She was born in the romantic-sounding village of Pallas Lake in County Offaly, in the Midlands. Her parents both had literary interests and wrote part time; her father wrote plays and her mother poems in the Irish language. "Everyone in the house was always writing," she told an audience at a recent reading in Galway. Ms. Carr left when she was 18 for college in Dublin, where she still lives. She is married and expecting her second child in June.
One subject that Ms. Carr will discuss is current affairs, particularly a troubling strain of racism that has recently emerged in Ireland as the country struggles to cope with an influx of refugees and asylum seekers from Eastern Europe and Africa. One of the attractions for immigrants may be the current economic boom in Ireland.
Speaking of the new arrivals, Ms. Carr said: "These people come here desiring a better life in another country, and they have every right to try for that. Our grandparents and other generations emigrated from Ireland and suffered the same kind of prejudice abroad. This fear that the Irish are now expressing, it's about recognizing yourself in the mirror. The savage rises in people; it's dark, the cruelty that's there, 20 centuries of civilization flying off."
It may be this ability to identify, articulate and yet not judge the negative side of the human spirit -- particularly in an Irish context -- that gives Ms. Carr her distinctive voice. Her first three mature plays -- "The Mai," "Portia Coughlin" and "By the Bog of Cats" (which won the Irish Theater Award for best play last year) -- involve female characters at the extremes of existence. Not surprisingly, most critical comment about her work has focused on her depictions of women and the feminist tone of her writing.
"On Raftery's Hill" seems poised to shift the debate to where, perhaps, it has belonged all along: Ms. Carr's troubling portraits of Irish families.
Ms. Hynes has said that Ms. Carr's depictions of dysfunctional families make her a worthy descendant of the great Irish-American playwright Eugene O'Neill. The director is not the first to do so. In 1994, the critic Michael Coveney, writing in The Observer in London about the play "The Mai," said that its author "articulates deep-seated woes and resentments in a manner you rarely find outside Eugene O'Neill."
As with her previous plays, Ms. Carr sets "On Raftery's Hill" among an extended family in the contemporary Midlands. The central figure is the patriarch Red Raftery. The play concerns his troubled relationships with his two daughters, the 40-year-old Dinah and the 20-ish Sorrel. It is clear from the earliest moments that something is awry in the Raftery world: the neglected family farm is covered with the rotting corpses of cows and sheep, the slow-witted son, Ded, sleeps in the barn, and the grandmother, Shalome, repeatedly tries to leave the house to seek her long-dead father.
The audience eventually discovers secrets that the family is desperately engaged in avoiding, including the fact that Red and Dinah are incestuously involved.
Ms. Carr is confronting the issue of incest in an unusually forthright way on the Irish stage; while previous plays in the 1980's and 1990's, including Ms. Carr's own "Portia Coughlin," have hinted at sexual relations among family members, "On Raftery's Hill" makes the subject its central theme.
"The play reflects an increasing awareness of an issue that as recently as the 1980's did not officially exist in public discourse," said Kieran McGrath, editor of The Irish Social Worker, a quarterly professional journal.
"There was a culture of secrecy in the past," Mr. McGrath said. "But in the 1990's there have been several high-profile court cases that have brought the issue to light. And out of the woodwork started to come some serious situations, like the one depicted in this play: deeply enmeshed families, where sex abuse is longstanding and rampant."
The playwright, however, does not condemn her characters. "I like Red Raftery," she said. "'I know people might find that difficult, but I do. He may not have much humanity, but it's there. His humanity is that he realizes he's bad. He realizes he's fallen. He realizes he's got it all wrong. The inhuman impulses are struggling alongside the impulse to be humane."
While there is an implication that the cycles of incest go back for generations and that the family members are thus governed by forces larger than themselves, Ms. Carr said she does not want to create a world in which "you remove responsibility from the individual."
"There is a point where a woman is responsible," she said. "Dinah is not a victim anymore. She may have been when she was younger but she is no longer. She is in the thick of it, too. They are all implicated. The idea of the monster coming out of the vacuum I just don't buy."
Red asks Sorrel's suitor in "On Raftery's Hill": "D'ya know whah ud manes to be young . . .? Do ya? Manes your slate is clane, manes the muck on your boots stays on your boots and dont sape up to your unploughed soul. Manes ya know . . . all abouh the dirty world, how and why men and women fall."

 THE PRIVATE LIFE OF KIM PHILBY
 The Moscow Years.
 By Rufina Philby, Mikhail Lyubimov and Hayden Peake.
 Illustrated. 449 pp. New York:
 Fromm International. $32. 
 A CURIOUS tidbit surfaces early in this account of Kim Philby's last years in exile in Moscow. The legendary spy's favorite tune turns out to have been "My Way," sung by Frank Sinatra. And, indeed, the line "I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption" nicely catches Philby's ironic self-image as a believing skeptic.
But what was it that Philby thought he had to do while all he believed in as a lifelong Communist was about to come crashing down? The answer will not be found in the centerpiece of "The Private Life of Kim Philby," a 187-page memoir by his widow, Rufina Philby, recounting the final years of the cold war's most fabled defector, a man who was considered a candidate for chief of the British secret service even as he was spying for the Soviet Union. What the fourth Mrs. Philby does provide is a portrait of dreariness in the twilight years of the Soviet Union: store windows displaying goods that are not for sale; restaurants with food so bad and service so rude that the Philbys stop eating out.
The paradox that pokes through this dismal round is the contradiction between Philby's clearsightedness and his blind loyalty. Should the Soviets have gloated when the Iranians seized American hostages in 1979? Philby writes his friend Graham Greene, "Allah alone knows whose embassy is not next on the list for sacking, looting, burning or occupation." He captures the futility of the cold war in a single sentence: "I have no belief in doomsday, I don't believe in the Soviet threat to Europe, I don't believe in a NATO threat to the Soviet Union." Yet the same man could mouth the most god-awful party claptrap to explain Stalin's murder of thousands of fellow Communists: they "fell victim," Philby lectures a class of K.G.B. students, "to cases of unfortunate disregard of socialist legality."
His unshakable fidelity to the Soviet Union was not, however, reciprocated. During his first years in exile, so little use was made of Philby by the K.G.B. that he sank into alcoholic despair and attempted suicide. Fourteen years passed before he was invited to K.G.B. headquarters. He was finally taken off the shelf by Mikhail Lyubimov, a K.G.B. officer and a co-author of this book. Lyubimov needed a poster boy to make life in the Soviet Union appear more appealing to potential defectors. He helped Philby secure a post teaching a course of stunning shallowness for a master spy, coaching K.G.B. officers in how to pass in polite English society. As Lyubimov puts it, when he read in the Western press that Philby had become a key K.G.B. strategist, "I had to laugh. Sadly, Philby was a run-of-the-mill, semi-unemployed pensioner."
Rufina Philby's memoir takes up less than half the book. The rest is a pastiche, including two previously unpublished chapters of Philby's autobiography, the lecture he delivered to the K.G.B. and a Lyubimov essay on Philby in which the faithful Communist is consigned to "a generation of fanatics and idealists, whose blood was sucked by the Idea itself." In the book's final section, Hayden Peake, a former C.I.A. officer, delivers an insightful critique of the vast literature that Philby's life spawned -- five books, for example, in one year alone.
For the espionage aficionado, the most rewarding pages in this collection consist of Philby's views on his craft. He makes a convincing case, for example, that a spy caught in the West can very likely beat the rap simply by refusing to confess. Philby's case is weakened, however, by the fact that he confessed his own treachery before fleeing to the Soviet Union.
Kim Philby did not die until 1988, when the cracks in the Soviet Union were already gaping. Still, he never recanted. He apparently preferred to stick with the hand he had dealt himself rather than face the truth of a life wasted in a failed cause. Or was it merely Philby's penchant for irony, his singing, along with Ol' Blue Eyes, "And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing"?

BYLINE: By Alice M. Rivlin; Alice M. Rivlin, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, was vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve from 1996-1999.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With much fanfare, the press is building the suspense around tomorrow's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. Will the Fed raise the short-term interest rate by a quarter point or will it -- gasp! -- go for a half? One might think the committee was facing a contentious decision whose resolution could affect the course of economic history.
Actually, conducting monetary policy right now is a no-brainer. The economy is growing too fast, and the Federal Reserve needs to keep raising the short-term rate -- the only instrument it has -- until growth slows to a more sustainable pace. Whether the committee raises the rate by a quarter-point tomorrow or a half or even more has little economic significance. The choice is tactical: how best to send a message to businesses, investors and consumers to slow things down a bit so the economic engine can keep moving forward without overheating. 
 That much of the attention has been focused on the size of the rate increase highlights the fact that few disagree that tightening the economy is appropriate right now. Some critics, especially in Europe, even believe the Fed has not moved aggressively enough to rein in what they regard as a fragile bubble economy, based more on equity speculation than solid growth.
But the remarkable productivity increases of the last three years are in fact solid. They are based on rapid technological change, and tight labor markets have clearly opened enormous opportunities to workers at all levels. If the Fed had raised rates sooner or faster, some benefits of the digital economy might have been delayed and many people would have been worse off.
Other critics regard all interest rate increases as pernicious and dismiss the risks to future expansion from incipient inflation, extreme worker scarcity and consumer spending out of paper wealth. They argue that economists used to say that unemployment rates below 5 percent, or growth rates over 3 percent, would cause inflation, but those limits have been breached for some time without ill effect, so why not push unemployment down to 3 percent and growth up to 6?
These folks overlook that some of the special factors that have kept inflation low for the last several years are turning around. Medical costs, after long quiescence, are climbing rapidly once more. The weak foreign demand that held down the price of commodities and other products traded on world markets is reviving.
That the United States economy can, under favorable conditions, drive safely at high speeds, does not prove that it is safe at any speed, even when the road worsens.
Congress and the stock market have helped keep the economy in check. Congress, in not acting to reduce the mounting federal surplus by devoting the money to big tax cuts or major new spending programs, has helped slow the economy in the short run. And the recent drop in the stock market has also helped keep the economy from growing out of control. It seems that investors are remembering that earnings, or the firm prospect of earnings, ought to have some influence on stock values. An additional market correction would help, but even if equity prices just wander sideways for a while, consumer spending is still likely to weaken and help ward off inflation.
So, stay in your seats. Tomorrrow's Fed decision won't change the course of history. But with any luck it will help to keep the economy growing at a healthy and sustainable clip.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Click Here For Glamour, Drama and Michelangelo

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN 

 BODY:
Until a 43-year-old Dutch software executive and self-described neophyte collector bid $135,805 last week for a painting on eBay, the online auction company, skeptics assumed that no one would spend real money for art over the Internet. Too risky. You can't see the work firsthand.
Besides, there's no theater to sitting by yourself in front of a computer screen and clicking a mouse. And theater had become a big part of why people spent crazy sums for dubious paintings: the theater of the salesrooms, which helped to propel the auction house boom of recent decades. 
 Starting in the 1970's auction houses capitalized on it, as did the media. Before then, old-money collectors worked often through private dealers, quietly. But new fortunes sought headlines in the media age. Buyers with freshly minted egos got swept up by the black-tie, pressure-cooker arena at Christie's and Sotheby's -- by the television cameras, the prospects of front-page articles and the associative luster of the contemporary art world -- and they bid prices for Julian Schnabels, Sandro Chias and Enzo Cucchis through the roof.
These tyros were not just speculating in cultural junk bonds. They were paying for the satisfaction of being seen to buy art, something new. Owning art had always been about acquiring status, and starting in the 19th century it increasingly became a financial investment. But now the act of purchase, publicly done, was a commodity.
Along comes Rob Keereweer of Nieuwkoop, the Netherlands. At the close of online bidding last Monday, he had offered $135,805 for what appeared over the Internet as an indistinct abstract painting, with the signature "R.D. '52." As he tells it, the hook was that it might be by Richard Diebenkorn, the California painter. A Diebenkorn from 1955 had sold for $1.8 million at Sotheby's in 1998.
The painting on eBay went up for auction at 25 cents. The seller used the Internet name "golfpoorly." He was from Berkeley, Calif., he said. Diebenkorn lived in Berkeley.
In addition to a photograph of the painting (incorrectly oriented vertically) he posted a story about having bought the picture at a garage sale a long time ago. His wife had not let him keep it in their house, so he was finally getting it out of the garage to please her. His son at one point had put a hole in it with his plastic tricycle, and you could see the hole in another close-up photograph, located so that the photograph conveniently included the signature, about which "golfpoorly" said nothing.
He turned out to be Kenneth A. Walton, 32, single, a lawyer in Sacramento and online seller under various names, who had made up wife, tricycle and garage. EBay voided the sale, not because he had lied (this is virtual reality, after all), but because he had bid on the painting himself, a violation of eBay rules.
Theater!
Farce, to be precise, although farce of a different kind than takes place in the auction rooms. Mr. Walton seems to have borrowed a trick from the auction houses: underselling his hand.
Every buyer wants to outsmart the marketplace. Vanity is a salesman's oldest friend. Who wouldn't be proud of himself for discovering a valuable painting that some guy with the poky handle of "golfpoorly" was offering for 25 cents? Call it reverse psychology.
Online auction fraud is rampant. No surprise. EBay, which guarantees none of what it sells, tried to minimize the problem, saying fraud occurs in one-tenth of 1 percent of its auctions, which works out to 50,000 scams during the first three months of this year alone. Mr. Walton's made-up story and shill bid -- never mind whether the picture turns out to be by Diebenkorn -- makes this at least 50,001.
Sotheby's says that it uses its customary controls and guarantees on its online sites. Better controls and guarantees are obviously needed, but notwithstanding them, online buyers probably still won't be more cautious after this debacle, maybe the reverse. A flush economy breeds innumerable fools ready to squander new fortunes, trading in start-ups when they aren't surfing for Michelangelos or at least Furbies on eBay.
Skeptics who had doubted that people would buy expensive art online, which they couldn't see firsthand, hadn't factored in several things. People have long bought art they haven't seen for themselves, based on reproductions in auction catalogs, and there's no big difference between that and buying a painting on the basis of a reproduction on eBay, except that at least someone vetted the art for the catalogs before printing the pictures. The Internet is a free-for-all.
The prospect that the Web is the world's biggest garage sale, still unregulated, may make it more, not less, attractive to fortune hunters who think that unrecognized treasures are to be found there, below the experts' radar screen, uncontrolled.
This is the art world's version of the Wild West, after all. Smart money had it that only prints and photographs -- produced in multiple copies, therefore somewhat predictable -- would sell successfully on the Web. Actually the condition of prints and photographs varies, so that experienced collectors know they have to see them firsthand, too. But if Mr. Keereweer is as he seems, online buyers are neither experienced nor prudent, just aggressive.
And we shouldn't underestimate the straightforward appeal of the democracy of the Web, attuned to a new age of prospective collectors. As the auction houses catered to 80's-style tycoons, eager to make a splash, so the Internet suits regular folks, even schleps, and the dot-com rich, less ostentatious, more technologically oriented. The auction houses seem elitist by comparison.
Finally there's glamour. Sure, computers are geeky, but they're also cutting edge, and cutting edge is another term for avant-garde, which spells glamour. The glamour of any vanguard, by association, causes frogs to think they're princes. Blending art and technology makes a particularly potent cocktail for rubes.
So who needs black-tie auctions and television cameras any longer? The 11-day unfolding sale of Mr. Walton's painting, accessible to anyone with a computer, was drama on a public level at least equivalent to what Christie's or Sotheby's can manage, weirdly captivating like a crash in slow motion.
As for Mr. Keereweer in the Netherlands, just before the auction closed last Monday, he wrote to a reporter, by e-mail: "I myself would like to concentrate on the auction right now. The final moment of the auction is in the middle of the night for me, and I need time to explain to my wife why I am bidding so much money on a painting that I have not seen in the flesh."
Assuming he actually has a wife, one suspects that the two of them had a nice long chat.

HEADLINE: Intel to Spin Off Company Of Customized Technology

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation plans to announce today that it will spin off a tiny Internet company it hopes will help consumers and business custom-order technology products.
The spinoff, Developonline.com, is creating a Web site that any individual or business can use to specify the features and options they want in an array of Web appliances, Internet networking equipment and cellular telephones, giving them the ability to choose the color or style of a product, for example, or to add features or fine tune technical capabilities. The Web site will go online some time in the third quarter. 
 Executives of the new company, which will be based in Tempe, Ariz., say they are entering an explosive new arena that will get new technology devices to market faster and enable consumers to take part in shaping them.
"This changes the rules for mass customization," said Alan Steinberg, a 20-year Intel executive who helped conceive the project and is now chief executive of Developonline.com. "We think this will be a tremendous shift in the development of products; this will create a new category."
The company expects to capitalize on a new trend that allows people to use the Internet to customize everything from clothing to Internet-access gadgets. Developonline.com, like others, says that a model for this new-economy development model is Linux -- the popular variant of the Unix operating system that various programmers around the world have been improving and refining because it is freely available on the Internet. Besides being able to customize features, users can also tinker with the technology behind it.
Company officials declined to provide many specifics ahead of the announcement. But the plan apparently calls for Developonline.com to act primarily as a custom sales agent on behalf of other manufacturers. Executives would not discuss how the Web site would make money or deal with intellectual property issues, but the company said it had already signed agreements that would allow it to offer various technology products for sale on the site.
Developonline.com has already received $15 million in funding from two venture capital firms, the Carlyle Group and 3i Technology. After the spinoff, Intel will have a 25 percent stake in Developonline.com.
Mr. Steinberg said Intel helped "incubate" the company, which has about 30 employees, with the help of the University of California at Berkeley and Harvard University.

HEADLINE: PATENTS;
A flood of trademark applications clearly shows that the Internet is a place businesses want to be.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
FOR Glenn Gundersen, a law partner at Dechert Price & Rhoads in Philadelphia who specializes in trademark, copyright and Internet law, the numbers are particularly striking: "This is wild, something I've never seen in my 20 years in this field."
He was marveling over a study that his office had just released on trademark applications that gives unique evidence of the trends driving the current economic boom. 
 The study found that in 1999, the United States Patent and Trademark Office received 33,731 applications for trademarks that covered an Internet-related product or service. Five years earlier, in 1994, it received only 307.
The report also revealed that once businesses decided the Internet was the place to be, many wanted the same kind of brand or logo: in 1999, 12,000 trademark applications included the ".com" suffix. In 1994, a mere four had it.
Since most applications are for products and services that have yet to hit the market, trademark requests can tell tales about continuing expectations for the digital economy.
In the last year, trademark applications have also tested the boundaries of what types of products and material the government views as eligible for protection. Those challenges have come, not surprisingly, from applications seeking trademarks that include ".com," "i" for Internet or "e" for electronic.
The explosion of interest in those trademarks appears to have contributed to the largest annual increase in total applications -- a 32 percent jump last year, to 265,341.
"What is so fascinating about this huge jump," Mr. Gundersen said, "is it shows, boy, are we optimistic. And that helps quantify what you're feeling and seeing around you about the economy, and puts it in numbers and percentages that give a feeling for how much of a boom there is in new companies and new businesses launching new ventures."
Dechert has made such reports annually for the last 10 years, analyzing the number and type of trademarks and trade names that businesses and manufacturers want to protect. The report is usually for internal purposes, but Mr. Gundersen said he was so struck by this year's results that he decided to publicize them.
The number and type of trademark applications serve as a barometer for the economy because they reflect confidence in starting new businesses and introducing new products and services, as well as willingness and ability to spend money on brand names, logos and other trademarks. At the same time, the applications raise questions about the value of trademarks compared with Internet address -- or domain name -- registrations, and about the use of descriptive or generic terms, which in the past have been ineligible for trademarks.
Applications sagged in 1991, when the economy was in a recession. They have increased steadily every year since, in parallel to the economy's growth throughout the 1990's.
Dechert's report also found that:
*In 1994, just 89 applications included the word "Internet" and only 60 used "Web"; in 1999, 1,041 included Internet and 1,808 used Web.
*Between 1998 and 1999, applications for "e" trademarks increased 325 percent, while applications for "i" trademarks jumped 175 percent, as companies looked for succinct alternatives to Internet, Web and .com.
*In 1998, 12,235 trademark applications described Internet-related products or services; in 1999, that number more than doubled, to 33,731.
*New Internet domain names were registered last year at a rate of one every two seconds, while new trademark applications were filed at a rate of one every two minutes.
(Domain name registration is done through private companies under the supervision of the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann.)
The escalation last year in requests for the .com suffix, and for i-marks and e-brands, forced the Patent and Trademark Office to restate its definition of what terms are eligible for trademark status. As a result, some of the most valuable Internet domain names may not qualify for trademark protection.
Names like business.com, drugstore.com or airplane.com are crafted out of the kind of generic terms that have long been ineligible for trademarks. At first, the Patent and Trademark Office awarded some of those trademarks, but after some confusion over its policy, it decided to ignore the .com suffix in the same way it ignores terms like "Inc."
"Generally, .com doesn't have any trademark significance," explained Sharon Marsh, an administrator at the trademark office. The agency has posted the policy on its Web site at www.uspto.gov. "If a mark is descriptive or generic, with .com added, it doesn't change that."
But some .com requests are approved, she said. And the overall increase in applications is continuing.
"Our total filings are up 40 percent for 2000," Ms. Marsh said. "They're not all .com marks, but it's still a huge increase. It's a great economy."
Mr. Gundersen says that Internet branding and trademark law may be on a collision course. Applicants whose requests are denied under the agency's new .com policy have a right to appeal to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.
And yet, such a conflict may lose its significance. After all, trademarks are valuable because they provide exclusivity. But in the Internet world, the same exclusivity can be assured with a domain name; a company that has registered a generic domain name like bank.com is the only one using it. So the domain name -- especially if it becomes a brand in the minds of consumers -- is valuable even if it cannot win a trademark.
"Before, you looked to trademark law to give exclusivity under a trademarked name or phrase," Mr. Gundersen said. "Now there's a new form of exclusivity to a string of characters. Some people are saying, if the trademark office takes a position that it won't register a trademark, maybe I can live with that because I have an exclusivity that they can't confer."
He predicts that principle will be tested when companies register domain names that are similar.
"There are similar trademarks pending with garden.com, pets.com and others of that ilk," he said. "The real question will be what happens when you have a generic.com and someone else comes real close. What happens when you stick on an i, or an e, or make it a plural?"

HEADLINE: MEDIA;
Good Times Add Ring of Truth to TV Networks' Spring Celebration

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
The invasion of the network programmers begins in New York today with the start of "up front week," an annual television industry ritual in which the year's new comedy and drama models will be unveiled, accompanied by parades of stars, promises of sure-fire entertainment and plenty of parties.
At least some of the celebrating will be justified. After years of gloom and doom, the clouds circling network television parted this season, thanks to two factors: the ABC game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," which provided evidence that a network can still command the attention of much of the viewing audience on a regular basis; and a sizzling advertising marketplace that has seen more money spent on commercial time during network programs than ever before. 
 Nor is the end of the sunny days immediately in sight. In a presidential year that promises an influx in political advertising, as well as the extra boost of a Summer Olympics, projections suggest the networks will be able to command rate increases of 15 percent or more for the new lineups of shows they will be avidly pitching to advertisers this week.
"Millionaire" will surely be leading the charge. That show, which as of late last week ABC was leaning toward expanding to four nights every week, is poised to shatter every previous record for revenue generated by a single show. Even according to conservative estimates by ABC's competitors, "Millionaire" will generate more than $400 million in profit for ABC next season. Other longtime television industry executives say the profits for "Millionaire" may eclipse $600 million. Entire networks have rarely made that much in profit.
As good as the year has been, it has not exactly translated into a golden era for viewers. Aside from "Millionaire," relatively few new programs have made it to a second season, much less qualified as outright hits. Indeed, advertising and network executives agree that the money the networks are making is not particularly linked to how well their schedules are doing.
"Right now the marketplace and 'Millionaire' are providing a blanket to cover the programmers' mistakes," said Warren Littlefield, the longtime NBC program chief who now operates his own production company.
Even with a number of worthy additions -- "The West Wing" on NBC, "Judging Amy" on CBS, "Malcolm in the Middle" on Fox -- the current television season has proved mostly a struggle for network programmers, with numerous longtime favorites heading for the sunset, leaving the networks with gaping holes to fill. (All but ABC anyway, which fills most of its holes with more editions of "Millionaire.")
The networks will begin the patchwork this week. NBC kicks off the new-show exhibitions with a presentation at Lincoln Center today. By Thursday night, six networks will have introduced between 30 and 40 new series to the television world.
For advertisers with any memory, the new crop may not not look much different from last year's entries, which were replete with such offerings as "Oh Grow Up" (ABC), "Work With Me" (CBS), "The Mike O'Malley Show" (NBC) and "Manchester Prep" (Fox). The latter show never got even one episode on the air before it was canceled, as all the others were eventually.
Still, even with flops rampant, the six broadcast networks as a whole set a record this season for total advertising revenue, taking in about $16.8 billion. And they enter showcase week for next fall's programs fully expecting to be richly rewarded by advertisers for their efforts -- lackluster or not.
Nobody in the advertising industry is about to disabuse the networks of this confidence.
"This year was beyond strong," said Gene DeWitt, chairman of Optimedia International, a media buying firm. "From the network point of view, it was phenomenal. People were raining bucks down on them."
The likelihood, Mr. DeWitt added, is that the take is only going to go up when the networks start booking commitments for the new lineups they will show to advertisers beginning today. According to a projection by Jack Myers, the chief executive of Myers Reports, a research firm that specializes in media, the four biggest networks, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, can expect at least a 15 percent increase in advance sales.
Including the two smaller networks, UPN and WB, Mr. Myers projects the total network advertising take during the upfront sales to hit a new record of $7.5 billion this spring, up from $7 billion last year. The figures could go even higher, toward the $8 billion level, he said, because his original projection did not take into account the decision by cable networks to begin selling their commercials in advance of the networks. "That may allow the networks to charge even more," he said.
Not all of the boost in ad revenue is going to Regis. But the presence of "Millionaire," which is hosted by Regis Philbin, has helped lift most network boats. The three oldest networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, have seen their combined rating rise by about 0.4 rating point this season. The year before, those three networks saw their combined rating fall 2.2 rating points.
Mr. Myers projects ABC's sales gains to be biggest, at 17 percent, but he puts Fox, a network that has suffered steep ratings declines all season, at a 16 percent increase, with NBC and CBS, both down slightly for the season, at 14 percent each.
"You would think somebody would begin to notice that the networks are being rewarded for not doing their jobs," said one longtime network program executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The falloff has been noticed; but it has not made any difference. Even with the paucity of hits beyond "Millionaire," demand from advertisers has been so great that virtually any available network commercial slot has been snapped up. One big factor in the surge in demand has been, as Mr. DeWitt put it, "The coming of the high-tech advertisers, who have lots of bucks to throw around."
Innumerable dot-com start-ups sought instant recognition by buying up commercial time on network television in the season ending this month. That provided two benefits. It was new advertising money, and it also tightened the number of spots available to sell to other advertisers, which pushed up the prices.
Indeed, despite the growing conviction that the weekly series format of network television is a dying form, soon to replaced by an even greater multiplicity of choices through the digitalization of channels, personalized menus of programs and interactive formats for both shows and commercials, most advertisers still view network television as pre-eminent. "It's still the engine that drives the media train," Mr. Myers said.
But most of the popular shows are not particularly new. "E.R." has been on seven years, and NBC just made a deal to keep it on another three. "Law and Order" has been on 10 years, and NBC just made a deal to keep it on another five.
Not every projection sees the current gold rush continuing for the networks, especially if they fail to pull more "Millionaires" out of their hats. Some wonder if the cooling of technology stocks on Wall Street will lead to a shutoff in the spigot of money flowing in from the dot-com businesses.
Mr. DeWitt suggested that a greater threat, however, would be a serious downturn in the national economy. He also noted that a serious failure in any of the schedules the networks announce this week will eventually prove costly because of ratings point guarantees made to advertisers. If they do not reach those guarantees, the networks will be forced to offer free commercials to make up the difference.
"We aren't all completely nuts," Mr. DeWitt said. "Obviously there's a cost-benefit line that hasn't been crossed."
But for the moment, he said, demand for commercial time is not slackening.
"Advertisers are obviously feeling they're getting value from network television," he said. "Unless something truly cataclysmic happens to the economy, I don't see that changing any time soon."

HEADLINE: Some A.I.G. Shareholders to Press for More Independent Board

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
When the American International Group, one of the world's biggest insurance companies, holds its annual meeting in New York on Wednesday, it will be confronted by several shareholder proposals challenging the dominance of Maurice R. Greenberg, its chief executive.
None of the challenges is likely to prevail. Advocates rarely succeed in storming the corporate gates, and Mr. Greenberg, at 75, has for more than 30 years led what analysts say is consistently America's most profitable insurer. 
 But experts in corporate governance say the shareholder demands that A.I.G. create a more independent board underscore the gap between A.I.G.'s management structure and prevailing practices at most American corporations. They say the structure has also allowed Mr. Greenberg to designate his 45-year-old son Evan as his successor, even though the family does not control the company.
Of American International's 18 board members, 10 are company executives, including Mr. Greenberg and his son, A.I.G.'s president. Two others are consultants to the company, leaving only six truly independent directors. In contrast, more than 90 percent of American corporations have boards with a majority of independent directors.
"You can't question their success and their profitability," said John Nash, founder of the National Association of Corporate Directors, a nonprofit group in Washington that sets standards for corporate governance. "But let's say the company starts to go downhill. Who's going to fire Mr. Greenberg?"
In its proxy statement for the meeting, A.I.G. denies that the board is run autocratically. "Your board of directors stresses the complete participation of all members in the Board decision-making process," it says. A spokesman for A.I.G. said the company would have nothing to add to that.
Barber B. Conable Jr., a former Congressman and past president of the World Bank who is one of the six independent board members, noted that shareholder groups have pressed for similar changes in A.I.G. governance in the past. One group last year got the support of 24 percent of the shareholders.
"They make a pitiful performance," Mr. Conable said. "What are these people yelling about? A.I.G. has gone from a very small company in 1969 to a corporate giant that is three jumps ahead of everybody else in the insurance business. We have some strong people among the outside people, people who are not easily rolled over."
Some experts and advocates have taken Mr. Greenberg's selection of his son as his successor as a strong sign of the senior Mr. Greenberg's hold on the company. The elder Mr. Greenberg says he has no plans to retire.
For years, Mr. Greenberg, who along with other executives controls more than 20 percent of A.I.G.'s voting stock, has run the company as if it were his own. And many analysts say that has been all to the good.
"This is not some guy who is milking the company," said Alice Schroeder, an analyst for PaineWebber who has just completed a nearly 300-page study of A.I.G. after five months of research. "He gives the company 100 percent of his time and energy. His goal is to make A.I.G. the best company on earth, and he's very shareholder-oriented."
Still, governance experts say, A.I.G. is out of step with corporate practice. "Board independence is critical," said Nell Minow, an expert on corporate governance who has co-authored three books on the subject and is editor of the Corporate Library, a Web site that publishes corporate governance information (www.thecorporatelibrary.com).
"The single most important task for a board is C.E.O. succession," she said, "and that task cannot be accomplished right unless the board is independent in both practice and appearance."
People who have dealt with the younger Mr. Greenberg, who did not graduate from college, say he works hard and seems devoted to the company. But they say it is difficult to compare him with his father, who is regarded with awe throughout the industry.
"The son has yet to be proven," said Charles Elson, a specialist in corporate governance at the Stetson University law school. "That's not to say the son won't be good. But you'd feel a lot more comfortable if a non-management dominated group had approved the succession."
One group raising a challenge is the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), which wants A.I.G. to establish a committee of independent board members to select future board members.
"Decision making at A.I.G. is a very closed process dominated by one individual, and we do not think that is healthy in the long term," said William Samplatsky-Jarman, who is in charge of corporate responsibility at the Presbyterian Church.
In her report on A.I.G., Ms. Schroeder depicts a robust company poised for further growth. Its compound annual return since going public in 1969 has been about 20 percent, Ms. Schroeder said, compared with just over 9 percent for the S.& P. 500-stock index.
At about $115 a share, the company is trading at more than five times book value, or about twice the level of most other insurers. And its market capitalization of about $178 billion is nearly twice as great as the next closest insurer, the German company Allianz, at about $91 billion.
A.I.G., with assets of $268 billion, is the nation's leading commercial insurer, with growing businesses in life insurance and auto coverage. With operations in 130 countries, it is by far the most global of American insurers. A.I.G. also runs a big aircraft leasing business that provides planes to the major airlines and operates pension and asset management businesses.
Ms. Schroeder, who previously distinguished herself with detailed studies of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett, said A.I.G.'s single greatest competitive advantage is the solid grounding it has in so many countries. "In many markets," she said in her report, which is being sold for $500 a copy to people who are not clients of PaineWebber, "A.I.G. may well be the only foreign insurer that can successfully go head to head with local companies and take share profitably."
Mr. Greenberg, who serves as chairman of the Asia Society in New York, travels heavily, often to China and other parts of Asia, where his close ties to political leaders have given him opportunities to begin selling insurance while competitors were waiting for official approval.
Ms. Schroeder, who upgraded her rating of A.I.G. shares from "attractive" to "buy" with the issuance of the report, said three things could cause A.I.G. to stumble as an investment -- a global downturn, big regulatory or political changes in the countries where it operates or "a management succession that is poorly timed or executed."
In her analysis, Ms. Schroeder focused on the process of transferring power from Mr. Greenberg to his son rather than on the questions raised by activist shareholders and governance experts about whether there was sufficiently wide participation in the choice of a new chief executive.
"As the company's business becomes more developed in certain critical countries such as China and India, the risk in the transition should be mitigated," she said.
"Mr. Greenberg has gotten licenses in those countries based partly on personal relations developed over many years. Once he's got developed businesses going in those countries, some of the risk of losing those relationships goes away. We believe he is also working to graft some of those relationships onto his successor."
Some of the challengers plan to demonstrate outside A.I.G.'s headquarters in lower Manhattan on Wednesday dressed in revolutionary-era costumes, accompanied by fife and drum.
"Corporate independence is our theme, playing off some of the themes in the original Declaration of Independence," said Scott Klinger, co-director of Responsible Wealth, a nonprofit organization in Boston whose members say they are among the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans.
Mr. Klinger's group is asking that A.I.G. begin nominating 50 percent more candidates for board seats than the seats available, something no company in America now does. "We filed this resolution," Mr. Klinger said, "to provoke discussion and debate about the way directors are elected. We picked A.I.G. because it is one of the few remaining large companies that do not have an independent board."

'Friends' Stars Accept Deal That Will Keep Show on Air
Under pressure to take a deal worth more than $40 million a year each, or face cancellation of their series, the stars of the NBC comedy "Friends" agreed to a deal that will bring the show back for two more seasons.
The six stars of the show -- Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc -- accepted $750,000 an episode for the next two seasons as well as a higher percentage of future profits in the show. Page C8. 

Microsoft Cites AT&T in Defense
As the Microsoft antitrust case hurtles toward its conclusion, both sides are drawing on the experiences of the AT&T breakup to support their legal and political arguments, though in some cases the references are inaccurate or incomplete. And a few of the predictions made by Microsoft and its chairman, William H. Gates, mirror arguments AT&T made 20 years ago -- predictions that never came to pass. C4.
 
United Against Outside Interference
If Microsoft worries the government, then what about the giant that will be created by the merger of America Online and Time Warner?

STORK CLUB
America's Most Famous Nightspot and the Lost World of Cafe Society
By Ralph Blumenthal
Illustrated. 296 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $25.95.
 From the 1920's to the 1960's the Stork Club was a glittering fixture of New York night life. During its Depression heyday, Sherman Billingsley's club became a playground for celebrities from society, screen, radio and the rackets, and for the well-heeled who flocked to drink and dance in their aura. If not indisputably America's most famous nightspot, it was certainly in the front ranks of Cafe Society, whose effervescent goings-on (as reported in daily columns, glossy magazines and sophisticated Hollywood comedies) furnished material for the fantasy life of millions in that bleak era.
In "Stork Club" Ralph Blumenthal has deftly recaptured its evanescent glamour. He evokes its convivial din: 'the rattling of ice in cocktail shakers, the pop of Champagne corks and the sudden blare of rhumba music" and its "air violet with pleasurably exhaled smoke," a haze punctuated by "the flare of flicked lighters" and "roving photographers firing blinding barrages from silvery Speed Graphics." 
 Mr. Blumenthal, who reports on the arts for The New York Times, has dug up notes Billingsley made for a never-written autobiography; interviewed the proprietor's family, friends and former employees; and ransacked appropriate archives. His accumulated data give heft to what is in effect a twin biography, of the club and its owner-manager.
There are times when Mr. Blumenthal seems in thrall to his sources, and the lengthy lists of celebrity attendees and ceaseless flow of family anecdotes and business arcana tell us more than we care or need to know. But his good-humored style keeps the story moving. His tight focus on Billingsley and his club does, however, emphasize description over analysis and circumscribe his investigation of "The Lost World of Cafe Society."
"Cafe Society" was a new kind of elite Manhattan socializing in which formerly reclusive upper-crust men and women began partying in public alongside entertainment celebrities, with the collective merriment sped to mass audiences by various media. Mr. Blumenthal dates the phenomenon's emergence to the early 1920's, when Billingsley arrived on the New York scene, and its passing to the 1960's, when he died. Arguably, however, there has been a series of Cafe Societies, beginning in the 1890's, when venturesome blue bloods and Broadway stars began stepping out to spectacular restaurants and naughty cabarets, their doings trumpeted by a hungry press.
Prohibition wiped away this first generation of clubs and cabarets, and turned the entertainment business over to gangsters and bootleggers, providing Billingsley with his entrance cue. A man with impeccable criminal credentials, Mr. Blumenthal makes clear, this youthful Oklahoman had traveled around dry states, watering parched inhabitants with whiskey, until he landed in Leavenworth prison. When Prohibition went national, Billingsley moved to New York, failed to make it in the violent big leagues of bootlegging and settled for running one of the innumerable new gangster-backed speak-easies.
The 1929 crash, in turn, swept away many of these second-wave nightspots, but the Stork Club hung on, partly thanks to mob connections but mainly because in 1930 the columnist Walter Winchell plugged it, in print and on radio, as "New York's New Yorkiest place." Better yet, Winchell moved in as resident scribe and tout, guaranteeing a steady flow of customers and allowing Billingsley to catch the third wave in 1933, when repeal sent respectable nightlife surging.
Mr. Blumenthal makes clear the grubby backstage reality behind the swanky front, notably Billingsley's provision of free food and drink to the columnists who served as shills, and to the well-born (or merely well-dressed) youths who served as bait. Blacks were distinctly unwelcome.
Brilliantly successful through its wartime peak, the Stork began to lurch and wobble in the 1950's, before crashing to earth in the 1960's. Mr. Blumenthal suggests the problem was "a growing distaste for the self-indulgence of a spoiled class." True enough, as far as it goes, but the passing of the club, and the top-hatted, high-heeled version of Cafe Society itself, seems insufficiently situated in the context of the times. What Mr. Blumenthal does demonstrate is how much of Billingsley's fall was of his own making.
In the case of television, a general threat to all nightspots, Billingsley was at his most active, trying to ride the electronic wave lest he drown in it. He signed with CBS to do an interview program live from the Stork, but proved an awkward on-screen presence. The big beneficiaries of television were new clubs like the Blue Angel, whose daring comics or breakaway singers often wound up on the Ed Sullivan or Jack Paar shows. But Billingsley wasn't into novel entertainment forms.
As Billingsley's cultural caution cost him, so did fallout from his racial, political, and economic stances. Mr. Blumenthal presents these as separate issues, but they might more advantageously be seen as linked conservatisms. The Stork's (and other nightspots') restrictive racial policies came under indirect assault when in 1938 a club in Greenwich Village, provocatively named Cafe Society, began courting black patrons as well as performers. Then in 1950, after an incident at the Stork involving Josephine Baker, the desegregation struggle came directly to Billingsley's doorstep, with N.A.A.C.P. pickets bearing signs reading "Famous Nite Spot Just a White Spot."
The Stork's standing was not improved when Billingsley and the previously New Dealish Winchell made the club a haven for the Cold War right. J. Edgar Hoover had long been a Stork habitue (and to an amazing degree a fix-it man for his buddy Billingsley). Now the club played host to Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn (who struck up their chumship there) and got Billingsley involved in damaging wars with liberal media. Billingsley also fought a ferocious and losing battle against unionization -- with Cohn as his pugnacious lawyer -- a fight that cost him clients and cash, including his children's trust funds.
Finally, with office buildings swallowing up the surrounding brownstones, Billingsley sold the Stork to CBS, who had it torn down and the site on East 53rd Street turned into a vest-pocket park. Billingsley died in 1966, a year after his club's demise. When the latest incarnation of Cafe Society took to the dance floor at Studio 54, he would not be around to join the party.

HEADLINE: E-COMMERCE REPORT;
Catalog companies show the upstarts that they know a thing or two about Internet retailing.

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
IN this season of comeuppance for Internet-only retailers, catalog companies that also sell on the Web may finally be getting their due.
Even as the stock prices of so-called "pure play" electronic retailers spiked last Christmas season, the e-tailers acknowledged that they would still need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing and warehouses to make their businesses viable -- investments the catalog companies had made long ago. 
 Internet merchants also acknowledged their need for direct marketing expertise -- an admission that might have seemed downright flattering to catalog companies, if they were not too busy trying to keep the dot-coms from luring away their best executives.
But now that investors have turned their attention to profitability, the old-line catalog companies that have built the most extensive Web operations are stepping into more favorable light. Companies like Lands' End, Hanover Direct and BMG Direct are already generating profits from their e-commerce sites. And, thanks to the Web, the prospects for their catalog businesses are improving.
"Their numbers are staggering," said Barbara Wykoff, an analyst with the investment firm Buckingham Research. "It's frightening how fast they're growing."
Lands' End, for example, generated 3 percent of sales from its Web site (www.landsend.com) in 1998, Ms. Wykoff said. But last quarter, that number was 12 percent. BMG Direct, a Bertelsmann unit that sells CD's, generated 10 percent of its sales from the Web last year, and could reach 15 percent this year.
Ms. Wykoff said that companies with a catalog pedigree -- including J. C. Penney, Lands' End and L.L. Bean -- not only have some of the most visited e-commerce sites on the Web, but they have proved to be the best at converting browsers to buyers. Those three companies each have conversion rates of 13 to 16 percent online, according to Nielsen/ NetRatings, an Internet research firm, compared with an average of about 1.8 percent among all Web retailers.
But perhaps the most important statistic separating catalog companies from their Web-only competitors is customer acquisition cost. According to a recent survey by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the industry association Shop.org, catalog retailers spent $11 on average for each new customer last year. In comparison, e-tailers spent $82 per customer.
The reason for such a disparity, of course, is that e-tailers are still burning through tens of millions of dollars in advertising to attract customers to their sites.
Catalog companies, meanwhile, have a built-in marketing vehicle that can sit around a consumer's house for weeks before it reaches the trash. And to make sure customers remember the Internet sites, catalog companies often print their Web addresses on every page.
Catalog companies also report that instead of the Web cannibalizing their catalog sales, it is creating new customers.
Hanover Direct, which owns several catalog operations, including Gump's, International Male and the Company Store, said that 50 percent of its online customers last year had not previously purchased goods from their catalogs.
"We've found that taking a print catalog and using targeted marketing principles is the most efficient way to create online customers," said Rakesh K. Kaul, Hanover's chief executive. "It's no contest," he said, when compared with "e-tailers who go out and buy ads on the Super Bowl."
The Web has also helped build the overall profit the company can squeeze out of each customer over repeat visits, he said. Rather than send an existing customer a new catalog each month, Mr. Kaul said, the company complements the catalog mailings with e-mail messages, thereby reducing marketing costs. "So the Web now becomes a very efficient way to maintain customer contact," he said.
Catalog businesses benefit from the Web in other ways as well.
George McMillan, chief executive of BMG Direct, said the company could use the Web to test and create new catalog ideas that might not otherwise be viable.
"If you can't identify a market of 400,000 to 500,000 users, you can't justify the product development costs and research necessary to test it," Mr. McMillan said.
"With the Web, you don't have any paper or printing costs associated with testing an idea," he continued. "You can try more things without getting burned, and maybe find niches of the market that are smaller, but still make sense economically."
Mr. McMillan declined to say if BMG would roll out new catalogs aimed at BMG customers as a result of this testing. But he said the company was "experimenting with some things" among BMG's 10 million customers -- 2.8 million of whom are online. "There are a lot of segments in 10 million people," he said.
Happy as they are with their core businesses, catalog companies recognize that it is far more economical to close a sale over the Web than over the phone, so they are pushing to convert more of their customers to the Web with every passing month. According to Ms. Wykoff of Buckingham Research, catalog companies "won't save a significant amount of money" on overall customer costs "until the Internet gets to 20 percent of their business."
There are exceptions. The Bear Creek Corporation, which owns Harry and David, a food catalog and Web site (www.harryanddavid.com), generates about 9 percent of its sales on the Internet, and saves about $4.60 for each order placed through the Web, according to Nancy Tait, the company's executive vice president. Given the orders the company handled on the Web last year, that amounts to about $1.1 million saved.
But as Lands' End found out last year, companies cannot rely too much on the Web to deliver profits. Lands' End mailed about 9 percent fewer catalogs last holiday season, analysts said -- a move that might help explain its 17 percent dip in holiday sales and a substantial decline in its stock price.
"There's an inextricable link between the catalog and the site," said Bill Bass, vice president of e-commerce for Lands' End. "Our traffic always spikes when the catalogs arrive."
But that will not stop the company from an Internet-only approach in other countries. This summer, Mr. Bass said, Lands' End will roll out sites in several European countries where the company does not mail catalogs. As for marketing in those countries, he said, "online, word-of-mouth means a lot."
For catalog companies, one of the most satisfying aspects of the recent slide in e-tailing stocks is that their own employees are now less inclined to jump ship when a dot-com recruiter calls. "That's been a real drain on our industry," said Ms. Tait of Bear Creek. "I'm hoping those days are over."
They may be. Mr. Kaul of Hanover said that dot-coms were now more interested in forming partnerships with catalog companies than luring away their employees.
"We've seen a number of Internet companies approach us recently saying, 'Gee, why don't you create a catalog for us and help us understand how this works?' " he said. "So I wouldn't be surprised if you see more and more combinations in the catalog and Internet world."

HEADLINE: 'Super-Editor' Spot May Be Created At Post-Merger AOL-Time Warner

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Last Thursday night, Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., boogied to the sounds of Barenaked Ladies, the Canadian pop group, at a party at San Francisco's Pacific Bell Stadium.
The occasion was an invitation-only party for a 1,000 guests to introduce Time Inc.'s E-Company Now, an offshoot of Fortune magazine that will focus on the Internet economy. 
 The party was supposed to mark the first time that executives from Time Warner and America Online celebrated the birth of a Time Inc. magazine together. And the gala took place far from Time Warner's New York headquarters, in a city more closely linked with the new-media culture that America Online so embodies. Gerald M. Levin, chairman of Time Warner, and Don Logan, chief executive of Time Inc., joined Mr. Pearlstine. Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, was supposed to attend, but could not get away from the East Coast. He sent remarks along by videotape.
Which raises the inevitable question: can the current executives of Time Warner and America Online all boogie to the same corporate tune?
That question was addressed, at least for the moment, last week, when the two companies released an organization chart with a mother lode of corporate turf under the name of Robert W. Pittman, an America Online executive and the designated co-chief operating officer of the new company, to whom Mr. Logan and his magazine division, pushed farther down the food chain, will now report.
And within the last six weeks, Mr. Pearlstine has seemingly answered questions about his own immediate future. A year ago, it was widely believed inside Time Inc. that he would leave the job of editor in chief at the end of 2000, a belief that led to an internal guessing game about whether John Huey, managing editor of Fortune, or Walter Isaacson, managing editor of Time magazine, was more likely to take his job.
But the 57-year-old Mr. Pearlstine has renegotiated his contract and in an interview last week said he would stay at the company for at least another three years.
Still, the corporate tinkering may be far from over. Two senior Time Inc. executives said last week that an editorial job might be created above Mr. Pearlstine's, a sort of AOL Time Warner uber-editor who would oversee -- and try to create synergies between -- the journalistic activities at Time Warner and America Online. In this scenario, one person would supervise the journalistic work of CNN, Time Inc. and America Online.
The notion of an editor in chief for the integrated company would please both Mr. Case and Mr. Levin, who have discussed the notion, the executives said. Both men are determined to show an integrated company to Wall Street -- and Time Warner has never been perceived as particularly well integrated by the business community. And Mr. Levin, the Time Inc. executives said, has not been excessively pleased with the level of synergy within his own company, particularly between Time Inc. and CNN.
Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc., said no plans had been made for the editorial czar position. But with Mr. Pittman now overseeing subscription and advertising sales not only at Time Inc. but for other Time Warner and AOL divisions as well, some believe it might make sense to have an executive with the same breadth of editorial responsibility reporting to him. If the position is created, it will not be happen before the end of the year.
Or, as another Time Inc. executive, put it: "Until the merger is done, you never know how things will play out."
America Online has long argued that the separation of editorial church and commercial state does not jibe with the new-media concept that success comes from the integration of commerce and content.
But does it make sense to alter a magazine division that is thriving so mightily? Time Inc. -- a division that includes both magazines and book publishing -- took in $4.6 billion in revenue in 1999, according to the company's annual report, up from $4.4 billion in 1998. The magazines the division publishes range from the outrageous puffery of In Style and Teen People to the authoritative business coverage of Fortune magazine. (Only 6 percent of the division's revenue was attributable to book publishing, according to industry estimates.)
Mr. Pearlstine, at a conference sponsored by the Industry Standard and New York magazines two weeks ago, said he was less worried about interference from America Online on the editorial front than about the internal distribution of corporate resources. How does one convince Wall Street, he asked, that investing in a new magazine is better than say, expanding a cable system?
Of course, there are more pressing concerns for Mr. Pearlstine. As Time Warner is absorbed into America Online, there is a question within the company about whether Time Inc. magazines will receive special treatment from America Online and whether America Online might even get preferential treatment in the pages of Time magazines -- which have so far in fact gone out of their way to cover Time Warner and America Online with a brusque and sometimes biting fairness. (Time magazine clearly portrayed Time Warner as the loser in the company's public relations battle with the Walt Disney Company over the Time Warner cable blackout of ABC two weeks ago.)
And there is some minor turbulence within the magazine division: Real Simple, the new magazine for women from Time Inc.'s immensely successful People division, has met with disappointment both on the newsstand and within the company. Last week, Henry Muller, Time Inc.'s editorial director for seven years, gave up that position to become an editor at large. At the same time, Isolde Motley -- the former managing editor of Life, which was closed last month -- was named corporate editor. But no replacement was named for the editorial director position Mr. Muller left behind.
In an interview last week, Mr. Pearlstine addressed the issue of editorial independence -- which has been assured to him from all angles, he said -- and whether or not Time Inc. magazines would receive preferential treatment on America Online.
"From a distance, you might say, 'Why do this merger if you don't do that?' " Mr. Pearlstine asked. "But I think it winds up being more an issue of right of first refusal. If it makes sense, you obviously want to cooperate. But if you try to force everything through those filters, you will probably get in trouble."
The situation, Mr. Pearlstine said, is not unlike that in which Time Inc. found itself when Time magazine sought a television network as a partner in producing a special based on Time magazine's Person of the Century issue.
"We went to CNN first and they said, 'We don't have a lot of money to put into this, and we don't have 50 years of archives because we haven't been around that long, and we don't have that many customers for this kind of appointment viewing,' " he said. "Meanwhile, CBS was there saying, 'We have fifty years of archives, and lots of eyeballs and money to put into it.' So we wound up doing the deal with CBS."
All the instincts within the company, Mr. Pearlstine said, "will be to -- the old Wall Street cliche -- 'unlock shareholder value' by finding more synergy in the deal." But he added that "Gerry, and certainly Case, at least to date, have been saying that where it makes sense, we will do deals, but where it does not, we will not."
Mr. Pearlstine insisted there were no substantial problems at Real Simple -- although one senior staff member said the new magazine might better be described as "real complicated."
"It has some work to do, and it is a hard concept to execute," he said. He added that because of the swift success of Teen People and In Style, both of which also originated in the People division, the introduction of Real Simple faced higher expectations from the outset than most magazines. The first issue was also released at the same time as the first issue of Hearst Magazine's "O: The Oprah Magazine," which Mr. Pearlstine described as "first rate."
In the meantime, the larger corporate structure has yet to affect Mr. Pearlstine, or his relationship with Mr. Logan. It is known throughout Time Inc. management that Mr. Logan and Mr. Pittman get along well. They share the ideas about using each other's companies to get more subscriptions and about using the two companies together as a formidable advertising platform -- and they share similar Southern backgrounds.
"I'm from Mississippi, and he's from Alabama," Mr. Logan said. "So we both know the difference between hush puppies and barbecue."
As for filling the uber-editor job, candidates mentioned include Mr. Pearlstine, Mr. Isaacson and, to a lesser, degree, Mr. Huey.
Mr. Logan would not comment on whether the new position will be created. As for any other changes, he said: "You will see some movement within the management teams. But it too early to say what."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
His Civil Rights Challenge: Equal Access to Technology

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SITTING in his eighth-floor office as he prepared to deliver the commencement address at Howard University, William E. Kennard found himself torn.
Mr. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said he was simultaneously rejoicing and disappointed about the way things had changed for blacks since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson used the commencement at Howard, a historically black school here, to deliver a landmark address on civil rights. What bothered Mr. Kennard most was the growing economic divisions among blacks themselves -- and the failure of the most well-off in times of prosperity to take care of those who remain behind. 
 "There's cause for lots of celebration. African-Americans have made tremendous progress in 35 years," he said. "But it's also sobering to think that by all objective indicators of success we are still disproportionately represented. And I get particularly frustrated because I think successful African-Americans focus too much time and attention on achieving more success and wealth at the upper ranks. Nothing diminishes our success more than to realize as a people we're still behind."
"Sure, we've made progress and some of the policies Johnson announced in that speech are responsible for that," he added. "But at the same time, we have a long way to go."
The F.C.C. may seem an odd pulpit from which to be preaching social justice and racial equality, as Mr. Kennard, the agency's first African-American chairman, has been doing since he took the job nearly three years ago. It is a place, he said, where he and others typically spend their time "refereeing fights between the rich and the very wealthy."
But then again, in the current technological and political climate, the F.C.C. is not such an unusual forum from which to advance change.
At the vortex of a telecommunications revolution and a whirlwind of corporate deal-making that faces regulatory review, Mr. Kennard said he was ideally positioned to advance interests that some civil rights leaders say have caused a deep digital divide between the haves and have-nots, a gap that has been ignored by Congress and only belatedly recognized by the White House. With his agency buffeted daily by the competing interests of some of the nation's most powerful industries, Mr. Kennard views his mission as providing a voice to those who cannot hire a K Street lobbyist.
"I believe one of the main civil rights challenges of this new millennium is the challenge of ensuring equal access to technology," he said. "W. E. B. Du Bois said, 'The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line.' At the dawn of this century, our challenge is preventing the color line from determining who is online."
As such, Mr. Kennard has championed an unusually liberal agenda in a town controlled by a moderate White House and a Republican Congress. He has made political enemies by fighting for more money for a program to provide the Internet to schools and libraries, paid for through a tax on telephone bills. He has incurred widespread opposition from the nation's largest broadcasters for promoting a plan to approve hundreds of new low-power FM radio stations for churches, schools and community groups. And he has alienated telephone companies by blocking them from expanding into lucrative new markets while pressing them to provide service in less profitable underserved areas, including Indian reservations.
"If you look across the nation, 94 percent of homes in America have telephones," he said. "When you look at people living on tribal lands, the average drops below 50 percent. And in some areas, such as the Navajo nation, telephone service is down at 20 percent. We're not talking about Internet access, we're talking about basic phone service. In an era of wireless technology and satellite technology, that shouldn't exist."
Mr. Kennard's views are a byproduct of his upbringing. "My parents had a sense that the way to raise children is by teaching them about the benefits they had enjoyed, and the importance of helping the disadvantaged," he said.
He described his parents, a successful architect and a teacher of bilingual education, as "first-generation middle class." One of his grandfathers was a Pullman porter and school janitor; the other was a chauffeur who later owned a restaurant.
Mr. Kennard was 7 years old at the time of the Johnson speech at Howard, living in an integrated community in Los Angeles. His parents worked for the farm labor movement and against the Vietnam War. Before he left for college, he and his family helped run an orphanage in Mexico.
After attending Stanford University, he briefly worked for an NBC television affiliate in California before entering Yale Law School. There he met his future wife, Deborah D. Kennedy, who recently left her job as a corporate lawyer at the Exxon Mobil Corporation and is now raising the couple's infant son, Robert, named after Mr. Kennard's father.
Mr. Kennard's oldest sister took over their father's architectural firm after he died a few years ago. Another sister runs the Los Angeles Airport Authority and, like Mr. Kennard, is a lawyer.
AT the F.C.C., which he joined as general counsel in 1993, Mr. Kennard has occasionally been both amused and frustrated by the way some companies have reacted to his agenda. Some have retained black lobbyists and lawyers in a transparent attempt to curry favor. Others opposed to his regulatory regime have run to Congress and enlisted the support of Democratic and Republican lawmakers to rein in the agency.
He said his greatest frustration was the inability of members of Congress even to consider the commission's policy recommendations.
"I'm frustrated that oftentimes the debate focuses on winners and losers in terms of who will make money and lose money and not what I think is most important, which is how will something benefit the public," he said. "And I'm frustrated that members of Congress often don't want to engage with me on policy but have made up their minds, often after hearing from big interests who are constituents.
"When I got here I thought, maybe naively, that we could really grapple and engage on issues of policy. Some do, but most don't."

HEADLINE: Hints of New Inflation May Draw Sharp Fed Reaction

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Judging that rapid advances in technology were making businesses and workers more productive in ways that tempered inflation, the Federal Reserve has given the economy more or less free rein over the last five years to find its own limits.
It may have finally found them. 
 After a long spell in which the Fed's patience was rewarded with an almost perfect combination of strong growth, declining unemployment and stable prices, there are tentative but worrisome signs that inflation is emerging from hibernation.
With that in mind, when the Fed meets on Tuesday to consider whether to raise interest rates, it may feel compelled to adopt a more aggressive inflation-fighting stance than it has employed in years.
Although Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has provided no clear signal that he has made up his mind, analysts and investors expect the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate by a half-percentage point at the meeting, abandoning a steady path of smaller rate increases favored of late by Mr. Greenspan.
Should the Fed opt to go with a half-point rate increase, it would be the first time the Fed has made such a big tightening move since February 1995. Such a move would bring the federal funds target rate to 6.5 percent, its highest level since January 1991, and would be felt by homebuyers looking for mortgages, by anyone financing a car loan or carrying a credit card balance and by companies deciding whether to build a new factory or invest in new equipment.
Inflation is still more a threat than a reality, and some economists think the Fed is again proving too willing to sacrifice jobs and prosperity in a fight against a phantom enemy. But there is growing evidence of upward pressure on wages and prices.
Wage growth seems to be accelerating -- good for workers in the short run but a development that could lead employers to push through price increases to maintain profit margins. The employment cost index, which tracks both wages and benefits, surged in the first quarter.
Broad price measures like the Consumer Price Index are starting to edge up, even after the jump in oil prices is factored out.
Other indicators, like the Producer Price Index for April, which was released on Friday, provided no firm evidence that inflation has taken root. And if the economy were slowing or running at a more moderate pace, the Fed might be less concerned.
But despite a string of five quarter-point rate increases by the Fed in less than a year, the economy continues to barrel along, suggesting that inflationary pressures are more likely to intensify than to abate.
"The free lunch we enjoyed in terms of inflation," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One and president of the National Association for Business Economics, "is clearly over."
The Fed's experiment with giving the economy more running room dates back to the last prolonged episode of prolonged monetary policy tightening, in 1994. Back then, the conventional wisdom among economists held that inflation was all but inevitable if the pace of growth exceeded 2 percent to 2.5 percent a year or if unemployment fell much below 6 percent.
But even as he was raising rates aggressively during that period to choke off budding inflation pressures, Mr. Greenspan began to notice two things: that inflation was not as strong as might have been anticipated, and that the growth rate of productivity, or output per hour, seemed to be increasing faster than was being captured in the official statistics.
In March 1994, according to recently released transcripts of one of the Fed's closed-door policy meetings, Mr. Greenspan asked a provocative question of his colleagues around the 28-foot-long conference table in the central bank's ornate board room.
"Is it automatically the case," Mr. Greenspan asked the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, "that when the economy is tightening up that inflation takes hold?"
Mr. Greenspan did not venture a firm answer. But he cited the possibility that "we are getting extraordinary productivity increases that are keeping unit labor costs down." At that point, almost no one else was detecting any improvements in productivity growth, which appeared to be stuck at a lackluster rate of 1 percent, dooming the economy to a tepid performance.
Out of such musing on Mr. Greenspan's part grew considerable research by the Fed's staff into productivity -- and a growing conviction on the Fed chairman's part that the economy might be capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth than the traditional models suggested.
The result has been monetary policy that has helped nurture the longest expansion on record, the lowest unemployment in a generation, a resurgence in real wage growth, a flood of business investment that has allowed the United States to reclaim its position of economic pre-eminence and the rise of a stock market that until the last few months seemed rocket powered.
To some extent, the economy's performance was helped by factors that clearly were not going to last forever, including several years of extremely low oil prices, the downward pressure on compensation costs from the advent of managed health care and the way in which falling import prices helped drive inflation down after the global financial crisis a few years ago.
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan and the Fed never quite bought the notion of a "new" economy that was immune from the forces that ignited inflation in the past. And indeed, should the central bank raise rates by a half-percentage point on Tuesday, it would be making the point that America's vaunted technology-driven, globally oriented economy is still subject to the same forces behind the old, discredited speed limits, even if not to those specific limits themselves.
"There is a tendency to go too far and talk as if we're in a world where there are no limits and where we don't need to think in terms of the old concepts at all," said George L. Perry, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the research organization. "We're in a position where there's not much doubt about what we have to do -- we have to tighten monetary policy to slow the economy."
It is unclear precisely what the economy's new boundaries are and whether they are any more permanent than the old ones. Economists now talk about sustainable growth rates not of 2 percent to 2.5 percent a year, but of as much as 4.5 percent a year.
Where economists once pinpointed the "natural" rate of unemployment -- the level at which inflation begins to accelerate -- at about 6 percent, they are now debating figures like 4.5 percent and even lower.
But whatever the new speed limits, it is all but certain that the economy is breaking them today.
The economy grew at a 7.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year and at a 5.4 percent pace in the first quarter of this year. Unemployment in April dropped to 3.9 percent, the lowest rate since January 1970.
"We don't know exactly what the limits are, but the current rate of growth and the current rate of unemployment go beyond the economy's capacity," said Mark Zandi, an economist at RFA Dismal Sciences, a consulting firm. "What's going on now is just too much."
Too much, economists fear, to keep a lid on inflation.
In March, consumer prices jumped 0.7 percent, pushing the consumer price index 3.7 percent above where it was a year earlier. That compares with an inflation rate of 2.7 percent in December and January. And even excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices rose 0.4 percent in March, pushing the "core" inflation rate to 2.4 percent, up from 1.9 percent in January.
Meanwhile, compensation per worker rose at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, up from 3.8 percent the previous quarter. Unit labor costs rose by 1.8 percent after falling during the previous six months.
While not overly alarming yet, such signs suggest that more troubling news on inflation is yet to come unless the overheated economy slows down.
Still, for the Fed, trying to slow the economy to a more manageable 3 percent or 4 percent annual growth rate gives Mr. Greenspan a lot more room for error than if he had to slow growth to the old speed limit of 2 percent. That is a critical difference given that most expansions turn into recessions only when the Fed tightens the interest rate screw too much or too quickly to squelch inflation.
The degree to which the Fed becomes more aggressive in attacking inflation this week and for the rest of the year depends on a host of factors. The stock market, which Mr. Greenspan had identified as the source of much of the excess demand in the economy, remains volatile, and a sustained move up or down would no doubt heavily influence Fed policy.
The degree to which inflation actually materializes will clearly play a role. There could be further clues in the Consumer Price Index for April, which is to be released on Tuesday morning just before the start of the Fed meeting.
There are other factors that are harder to pin down, including the fact that it is an election year. The Fed has not shied away from raising rates during presidential campaigns -- it did so through much of 1992 -- but it might prefer to get any big rate increases out of the way well before the race heats up in the fall.
But the central question is whether the imbalances in the economy -- particularly the potential for the economy to run short of workers, setting off a spiral in wages and prices -- are substantial enough to overpower the benefits the economy has derived from the rebound in productivity.
Since he first started raising the issue in the mid-1990's, Mr. Greenspan has become increasingly convinced that widespread technological advances have ignited a resurgence in productivity growth, allowing employers to pay more to workers without facing a choice between higher prices or diminished profit margins. Last month he told a conference at the White House that productivity growth -- which in the last few years has been running at about 3.5 percent -- may still be accelerating.
But Mr. Greenspan, ever cautious, also made clear that even the magic elixir of improving productivity has its limits.
"Should the pool of available workers continue to shrink, there is a point at which this safety valve for excess demand will eventually close," Mr. Greenspan said, "even in the face of accelerating productivity."

Chart: "Letting the Economy Hum"
 
The economy has been growing strongly for years, driving down unemployment. But after years in which inflation remained dormant, wage and price increases appear to be picking up, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to become more aggressive in raising interest rates.

HEADLINE: Keizo Obuchi, Premier Who Brought Stability as Japan's Economy Faltered, Dies at 62

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 14

 BODY:
Keizo Obuchi, a bland, self-effacing politician who as Japan's prime minister brought some stability to the country's faltering economy and fractious politics, died this afternoon in Tokyo.
He was 62 and had been relieved of his duties as prime minister after suffering a stroke in early April. 
 Mr. Obuchi died here in Juntendo University Hospital, where he had been hospitalized in a coma since last month, the prime minister's office said. Doctors said he died from complications of the stroke.
News reports earlier in the day said that Mr. Obuchi's blood pressure had dropped to a near-critical level and that he was becoming unresponsive to medication to stimulate circulation.
Because many Japanese considered him to be pedestrian and lacking in charisma, Mr. Obuchi was the least popular choice for prime minister when he was selected in 1998 by the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan for most of the period since World War II.
Although he had served as foreign minister and chief cabinet secretary, Mr. Obuchi was considered too cautious to pursue the far-reaching reforms needed to resolve Japan's worst financial crisis in decades. The country's banking system was collapsing, unemployment was rising and the public pension fund was running dry. Critics predicted that Mr. Obuchi would not last more than a few months.
But his quiet, unassertive manner belied his political skillfulness and daring, and he quickly reversed longtime policy and pushed a huge spending package and a number of other economic measures through Parliament that temporarily halted Japan's economic slide, though at a heavy cost to taxpayers.
Although the results of Mr. Obuchi's policies were mixed, the economy showed some signs of improvement and his popularity soared, reaching a 51 percent approval rating last summer.
But support for his government waned considerably in the months before his stroke following his decision to forge an alliance with opposition parties and a string of corruption scandals.
Thomas S. Foley, the United States ambassador to Japan, said that Mr. Obuchi's record in office refuted critics who had dismissed him as a lightweight and that Mr. Obuchi would rank high among postwar Japanese prime ministers.
"When he became prime minister I was shocked that he was received with such low expectations and publicly dismissive comments by people who suggested he would be a short term or transitional prime minister," Mr. Foley said. "He confounded everyone's estimate."
John F. Neuffer, a noted analyst of Japanese politics, had described Mr. Obuchi as having "all the pizazz of a cold pizza," -- a characterization that haunted him throughout his tenure. But Mr. Neuffer maintained that his statement had been widely misunderstood.
"Cold pizza was a comment on his leadership style, but in Japan you don't have to be an especially tantalizing political leader to get things done, and Obuchi proved that," Mr. Neuffer said. "In many ways he was the right man for the job and far more clever than the mainstream media gave him credit for being."
Mr. Obuchi became prime minister after a frenzied race within the Liberal Democratic Party to replace his predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who had been forced to resign after an upset in the upper house elections in 1998. Critics said Mr. Hashimoto's tenure was marked by an insufficient effort to turn around a failing economy.
Mr. Obuchi, Japan's 23rd prime minister since World War II, was by all accounts a shrewd tactician, skilled in the back-room negotiations and consensus-building that are the hallmark of Japanese politics.
But former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone once referred to Mr. Obuchi as "a vacuum prime minister," contending that he had no valuable policies or principles of his own but simply absorbed the ideas of the talented ministers and advisers that he kept around him.
"Emptiness helps me avoid confrontation with others," Mr. Obuchi said in an interview last year. "It also allows me to absorb whatever available ideas seem good. I am affable to everyone."
Mr. Obuchi turned his low-key style into a genuine asset, and the Japanese people were enamored with his humility and the stability he imposed on politics.
"He restored people's confidence in leadership," said Yukio Okamoto, a political consultant. "He did not appear to be smart, and he deliberately tried not to convey an air of intelligence. He pretended to be a commoner and this was his unique way of disarming people of their criticism of politicians."
While Mr. Obuchi gained legislative approval for a $400 billion pump-priming stimulus plan and a bank recapitalization program that were popular with the public, some of his critics feared that his pork barrel politics would undercut these efforts. Tough reforms on health care, corporate taxation and other areas have been stalled or weakened while the national debt is ballooning.
Mr. Obuchi honed his political skills by sparring with some of Japan's heavyweights. Early in his career, he competed for votes in the same district as two former prime ministers, Mr. Nakasone and Takeo Fukuda, under a multiseat constituency system that was recently abandoned.
Reflecting on those years, Mr. Obuchi often described himself as "a noodle shop sandwiched between two skyscrapers" -- the rival prime ministers. But it was in this grass-roots environment that Mr. Obuchi mastered the art of the Japanese political deal, especially in cultivating personal relationships.
When he became prime minister, Mr. Obuchi never abandoned the tactics that served him well at the local level. For example, he was said to make as many as 50 "courtesy" telephone calls a day, often to people he did not even know. This practice proved effective in establishing Mr. Obuchi as a man of the people.
While traveling in the United States last year, Shinichi Kitaoka, a history professor at Tokyo University, returned to his room to find a message from the prime minister on his answering machine. "I had no connections with him, but he just called to say hello and to thank me for writing and doing research on him," Mr. Kitaoka said. "Yes, it was calculated but it certainly made me feel like he cared."
Perhaps Mr. Obuchi's most notable political coup came last August when he assembled the largest governing coalition that Japan had seen in decades and began pushing through Parliament a variety of measures long stalled in the political gridlock of past administrations. The measures included the adoption of the Japanese flag and imperial anthem as official national symbols and laws to crack down on terrorist groups like Aum Shinrikyo.
Keizo Obuchi was born on June 25, 1937, into a middle-class family in the town of Nakanojo in the mountainous Gumma Prefecture. His father, Kohei, managed a silk mill and was elected to Parliament. Mr. Obuchi's older brother is the mayor of Nakanojo.
A graduate of the prestigious Waseda University in Tokyo, Mr. Obuchi vowed to pursue a political career after the death of his father. He was elected to the lower house in 1963 at age 26, the youngest Japanese ever to win a seat in Parliament. He was elected to that seat, previously held by his father, for 38 years.
He held a number of ministry and cabinet positions before being named chief cabinet secretary for his political mentor, former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, in 1987 and minister of foreign affairs in 1997.
Mr. Obuchi is survived by his wife, Chizuko; two daughters, Akiko and Yuko; and a son, Takeshi, all of Tokyo.
At the height of Mr. Obuchi's popularity last year, Beat Takeshi, a popular comedian, picked up on Mr. Obuchi's own references and said that instead of cold pizza, Mr. Obuchi was more like the low-cost noodles that are sold at public beach houses in summer. The noodles are generally regarded as bland but after a long day of swimming and frolicking at the beach, many Japanese find that they taste pretty good.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
For 22 Years, Rickey Has Bedeviled Both Pitchers and Managers

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Only a week earlier Kirby Puckett had become baseball's first $3 million-a-year player with a three-year, $9 million contract with Minnesota and now Oakland was about to announce a new contract for Rickey Henderson that would pay him $3 million a year over four years.
But Henderson was not happy. In November 1989, he wanted to be the highest-paid player, bar none, and he had groused to his agent, Richmond Bry, that he had failed to get him there. They were on their way into a news conference at Oakland Coliseum when an electrician, working in the area, spotted the Athletics star. 
 "Hey, Rickey," the workman shouted, "it better be $4 million a year."
Turning to Bry, Henderson said, "See, I told you."
With Henderson, it has always been about money. That attitude has made him no different from most players, most people; it's just that Henderson has often reacted more severely to perceived economic slights than most.
It was his unhappiness with his $2 million salary this year that plunged him into a preseason funk that undermined his performance and fueled his premature departure from the Mets.
Had Henderson had a .315 batting average and a .423 on-base percentage, the figures he attained last season, the Mets would not have released him in his 22nd year in the major leagues. Had the Mets been winning three out of every five games, they would have given Henderson more time to get back to the leadoff hitter who caused consternation every time he reached base.
The problem was that he was providing virtually no production (.219 batting average) but creating much consternation for Mets management. His teammates had no problem with Henderson, at 41 years old a senior player always willing to help younger players. But it has always been thus with Rickey.
Long before the 2000 salary fallout fell into Bobby Valentine's lap, Tony La Russa, with Oakland, and Lou Piniella, with the Yankees, endured the Rickey brand of aggravation.
The second spring after Henderson signed that $3 million-a-year contract, he boycotted the early days of spring training. In the interim 15 months, dozens of players had signed more lucrative contracts and Henderson wasn't happy.
"I still don't like the contract," he said. "I never liked the contract from the day I signed it."
La Russa acknowledged that the Athletics knew Henderson, by his absence, was making a statement. "We can appreciate it," the manager said on the day Henderson was officially late for spring training. "But once he makes his statement, he has to be here for the team. At some point, get in camp."
In an attempt to lure Henderson to camp, the manager and the players good-humoredly established a "Rickey Appreciation Fund," stuffing a 10-inch-high jar several times over with dollar bills.
"We're just trying to make the point," La Russa said, " 'You're worth more than $3 million. We know it; we want you.' "
Henderson had won the American League Most Valuable Player award the year before, the first year of the contract. But in 1991, the year of his boycott, his production plunged, and he was suspected of not playing hard because he was unhappy with his contract.
It was a scenario that would be repeated this year.
"People mix my business with my job," Henderson said at that time. "It's two different things." He blamed his below-average season on an injured body, not a disgruntled state of mind.
"I get hurt, and the press says you're dogging it," he said. "Like I'm supposed to be a robot. If I get hurt and I play, they say, 'Why do you play?' But if I don't play, they don't believe me. They say, 'Why aren't you playing?' How can I win? I can't win."
Henderson did not win in 1987, when he was out with a hamstring injury. Neither did the Yankees, who had been in contention, after George Steinbrenner delivered one of the most destructive acts in his ownership of the team.
Piniella had become impatient waiting for Henderson to return and made some comments privately to other club officials.
But Piniella himself became embroiled in a dispute with Steinbrenner. The owner retaliated by disclosing Piniella's comments, saying that the manager had called the general manager about Henderson and said: "He's a dog. I want him out of here. Trade him."
Henderson has moved around in his career. He has played for the Athletics four different times and the Yankees, Toronto, San Diego, Anaheim and the Mets once each. Based on his performances with the Padres and the Angels in 1996 and '97 and with the Athletics in '98, he appeared to be closing in on the end of a brilliant career.
But the Mets, seeking a left fielder and a leadoff hitter, signed him for the 1999 season and added an option for this year. He was a pleasant surprise for them last season, helping fire them into the playoffs. His performance in the series against Arizona was also exceptional.
But the year ended sourly, when he was accused of playing cards in the clubhouse with Bobby Bonilla in the final innings of the final game with Atlanta. The mood didn't improve in the ensuing months as he complained about the $2 million salary that vested automatically when he reached his 500th plate appearance last season.
The Mets will formally place him on unconditional-release waivers today. He will clear waivers Wednesday, then pursue a job with another team, perhaps Detroit or Seattle.
"A change of atmosphere always gives a person new life," Henderson once said. "I'm looking to play even better than I have this year."
Rickey has almost always responded positively to change. He will surprise no one if he does it again in the coming weeks.

HEADLINE: Los Alamos Residents View Their Ravaged Homes as Wildfire Spreads

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., May 14

 BODY:
As David Lewis explained, you have to hit bottom before you can bounce back.
And this morning, when Mr. Lewis had his first opportunity to look out of a bus window and observe the blackened ruins that were his house in Los Alamos, he said he found himself plunging to an emotional nadir after the fire that has swept through the deeply scarred, austerely beautiful canyons here. 
 "I've started all over before, but I've always carried those boxes that have those mementos that are really heavy duty," said Mr. Lewis, who works as a systems specialist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which conducts nuclear weapons research. "I don't have that this time. There was nothing."
The fire that has destroyed more than 42,000 acres continued to expand today, driven by a resurgence of the winds. But today also marked the symbolic beginning of the area's emotional recovery.
The New Mexico National Guard organized bus tours for residents whose homes had been destroyed, which left every 20 minutes starting at about 8:30 a.m. from an armory outside town.
The people who joined these emotional journeys were told they could not leave the buses or collect any belongings; the purpose was just to end one process, clinging to false hopes, and begin another, rebuilding.
The scene at the armory under a scorching sun was solemn, melancholy and resigned, with only faint sparks of the kind of restorative energy that will be needed to rebuild the city of Los Alamos, 30 miles to the north.
The authorities, however, announced one particularly satisfying piece of news: the roughly 7,000 residents of White Rock, a suburb of Los Alamos that suffered no actual fire damage, were permitted to return to their homes. They said the roads to White Rock were crowded, but people were moving in an orderly manner.
The roughly 11,000 residents of Los Alamos may have to wait until the end of the week to return home.
That was little solace to the more than 300 people who had accepted the offer to take the sobering bus trip back to their neighborhoods in Los Alamos. These were people who had already been told their homes had been reduced to cinders and twisted scraps of steel and plastic.
The roughly four-hour trips began quietly. Each bright yellow school bus took 20 to 35 residents, along with two grief counselors and several National Guard troops.
As they boarded, many residents were handed little brown teddy bears and a bag containing work gloves donated by an insurance company.
"I just kept thinking: none of those things we had can be replaced," Lou Pierotti, a retired store owner who had lived in Los Alamos for 49 years, said after he got off his bus. "People were kind of emotional, but it was quiet, very quiet. All you could see was the outlines of where our house had been."
Mr. Pierotti said he had lived on Arizona Street, where all the houses had been destroyed. As he stood by his car in the armory's parking lot, absorbing what he had experienced this morning, he said his most painful feelings were for the small, sentimental losses, like his softball trophies.
"You just realize you can never, never get those things back," he said.
Kim Lalley, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico National Guard, said that in spite of the warnings that no one would be allowed to get out of the buses in Los Alamos, several people had demanded a closer look at what was left of their homes.
"They were upset, and they wanted to inspect their property," Ms. Lalley said. "We can't force them to stay on the buses. So we let them off and then informed the state police they were there."
Robin Peterson, who works for Los Alamos County, said people on the buses mostly watched, took photos and stared in silence. There were a few tears, she said.
Mr. Lewis said he had decided to take the trip because, "I just wanted the closure.
"But you still don't know what it's like until you really see it," he said.
Robert Olson, who also lost his home, said: "I'm numb. I'm confused."
Firefighters said today that they did not expect the fire, which had been set on May 4 by the National Park Service in what was supposed to be a controlled burn, to return to heavily populated areas. But swifter winds were causing the flames to leap across some canyons.
The more than 1,100 firefighters were focusing their efforts in three zones, mostly to the north and northeast, as the fire threatened archaeological sites on the Santa Clara Pueblo, an Indian reservation, and the Baca Ranch, 95,000 acres of meadows and fir-covered mountains that is home to about 7,000 elk.
A spokesman for the United States Forest Service, Jim Paxon, said that if the high winds continued, firefighters might be pulled back and the fire allowed to run its course.
Many of the people getting off the buses here today expressed appreciation for the efforts being made by firefighters and relief officials.
"You truly can't believe how generous people have been," Ms. Peterson said. "You see it everywhere. It just feels great. They had computers at one of the relief centers and my 16-year-old daughter was able to get online and find her friends. It just made us feel really good."
She said there had long been some resentment in the region of the people who lived in Los Alamos because, with their jobs at the nuclear weapons laboratory, they were generally wealthier and better educated.
"You saw none of that, not even a little," she said.
But there was also a steady undercurrent of anger at the park service for starting the blaze.
"When all is said and done, I had to ask myself this morning, 'Why was I on that bus?' " Mr. Lewis said. "Darn right, I'm mad."

HEADLINE: State Agencies Make Pataki the Star of $20 Million in Ads

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 14

 BODY:
Over the last several months, Gov. George E. Pataki has become one of the most visible pitchmen of the airwaves, starring in no fewer than five television advertising campaigns paid for by state agencies under his control, for causes from children's health care to energy conservation, at a total cost to taxpayers of about $20 million.
Put another way, the state is spending as much money from the public treasury to put Mr. Pataki's face before the public as the total spent in his 1998 re-election campaign. 
 The spots advertise Mr. Pataki at least as much as their ostensible subjects, prompting the charge by government reform groups and Democrats that they are nothing more than a veiled political campaign at government expense. "To use public funds to do what are essentially P.R. spots for the governor is ridiculous," said Rachel Leon, executive director of the New York State chapter of Common Cause. "It doesn't pass the smell test. If it looks like politics, it's politics."
Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's communications director, said of such criticism, "The world is, unfortunately, full of cynics who would rather play politics than applaud accomplishments."
The governor, a Republican, is not the first politician to use his power to advertise himself with public money, nor the first to be criticized for it. In fact, the immediate response from several administration officials was that the same thing has been done by the governor's predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and by Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut.
But Mr. Pataki's current exposure is extraordinary, and it far exceeds the others' efforts. In addition to ads for children's health care, energy conservation and the environment, which are all new this year, the governor is starring in perennial campaigns promoting tourism and the state's economic recovery. And while some governments, like New York City's and Connecticut's, prohibit politicians from appearing in advertising at public expense when an election is approaching, New York State's has no such restrictions.
Politicians in both parties say -- Republicans with a hint of admiration, Democrats with exasperation -- that the commercials are an extension of an administration that has turned governing into a perpetual campaign.
Although Mr. Pataki has said he has no interest in running for the United States Senate this year, state Republican leaders are talking about Mr. Pataki as a possible replacement candidate if Mayor Giuliani decides to drop out. Mr. Pataki has said he might run for a third term in 2002, when his Democratic opponent could be the state's comptroller, H. Carl McCall.
But Mr. Pataki has been battered by his leading role in state Republicans' ultimately unsuccessful efforts to keep John McCain off the presidential primary ballot. And he has also been harshly attacked, both through paid ads and on op-ed pages, by Change New York, a conservative group of onetime Pataki supporters who now call him a big-spending liberal. At the same time, the governor's poll numbers have slipped. His approval rating remains above 50 percent in most published surveys, but a year ago it was more than 60 percent.
"Is it about helping the governor?" a Republican political consultant asked rhetorically about the ad campaigns. "Well, duh."
Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said, "We are seeing a remarkable attempt at the rehabilitation of George Pataki at taxpayers' expense."
The promotions all showcase Mr. Pataki in the kind of warm-and-fuzzy ways that are too leisurely for the frantic pace of a real campaign. They deal with issues that let him appeal across party lines to centrists and liberals and that rank high with women, who tend to prefer Democrats to Republicans. The ads have been most prevalent during morning and daytime television, when most viewers are women. The best example is also the biggest of the current campaigns, one intended to encourage parents to enroll their children in Child Health Plus, a state-subsidized health insurance program for low-income parents. The State Department of Health spent $8 million on the ads.
In the television ad, Mr. Pataki, wearing a baby-blue V-neck sweater, speaks into the camera, sitting in a bright room amid happy children of all races. Next to him sits the state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, who happens to be one of the few women, and the only Hispanic, among the administration's top officials. The ads have been broadcast in every part of the state since October, including a Spanish-language version in some markets, and will continue through late June.
"These ads are clearly to promote him, and they're another example of how he's not acting like a person who's getting out of public life at the end of his term," said Jeffrey M. Stonecash, a professor of political science at Syracuse University who conducts polls for Democratic and Republican politicians. He added that it was as if Mr. Pataki was "worried about the liberal base getting mobilized in ways that it didn't in '94 and '98."
The ads represent a certain contradiction. During the 1994 gubernatorial campaign, William D. Powers, the state Republican Party chairman, attacked Mr. Cuomo for planning a government-financed ad campaign featuring himself, an effort that ultimately fell through. "If Mario Cuomo wants to develop an ad campaign for his re-election bid, he ought to pay for it himself," Mr. Powers said then.
This is just one instance of Mr. Pataki's doing much the same thing that he or his surrogates criticized his predecessor for doing: Mr. Cuomo's proposed buyout of the Long Island Lighting Company, his frequent use of state aircraft and his paid speaking engagements.
Mr. McKeon contended that "people know and trust the governor," making him the logical spokesman for each of the ads' causes. "The governor has made no secret of the fact that he's going to do everything he can to promote the changes he's made in New York's economic climate," he said. "It's not enough to do it; you need to tell the world about the changes. No one has better credibility on environmental issues than Governor Pataki. He is the perfect spokesman for encouraging energy conservation."
John Signor, spokesman for the Department of Health, said that enrollment in Child Health Plus had climbed rapidly since the campaign began. When asked why the governor should appear in them rather than, for instance, a pop culture figure who would be more familiar and appealing to young parents, he said, "Well, the ads are working."
The state's Empire State Development Corporation is spending $5.5 million from early April through late May on a collection of ads -- $4 million on television, $1.5 million on radio and print media -- that showcase the governor promoting tourism in New York. The ads are running both in New York markets and in a few other Eastern cities. The development agency sponsors a springtime tourism campaign every year, in ads that have often centered on the governor, but the budget this year is up sharply, from $3.7 million last year.
The same agency paid for a $4 million television and radio campaign in March and April, celebrating the state's economic recovery and promoting the state as a fine place for businesses. Again, the ads ran in New York and other states, and they featured the governor.
A television ad campaign still under way has Mr. Pataki promoting the Energy Star program, which encourages people to buy energy-efficient appliances. The primary sponsor is the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.
Tom Collins, spokesman for the agency, said he was not sure how much the agency was spending or how long the ads would run. But state officials said the energy agency was spending several times as much as the Long Island Power Authority, which contributed $500,000 to the effort in March.
In February, the Long Island Power Authority spent $175,000 on radio and television ads starring the governor, to let people know of its commitments to clean sources of energy, like wind power.
"The governor probably is the best pitchman for the state of New York," said Nelson Warfield, a Republican political consultant who is on good terms with Mr. Pataki. "If it benefits him politically, it doesn't mean it comes at the detriment of the state. This is one of those happy political happenstances of everybody benefiting."

HEADLINE: Free Trade: Why Labor Is Wary

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 9) argues that a good way to reduce the unions' resistance to free trade is by having the government empower them and enable them to thrive in the new, open economy. This can be done, he believes, by reducing management's capacity to permanently replace striking workers and by increasing penalties on employers who interfere with their workers' right to unionize. 
 Why does labor law reform have to be linked to free trade? Even without the threat of expanding trade, workers would deserve broadly defined and strongly enforced rights to join unions and engage in collective bargaining.

HEADLINE: Free Trade: Why Labor Is Wary

 BODY:

To the Editor:
James P. Hoffa, the teamsters' president, says (Op-Ed, May 11) hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost since passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and uses this example to argue against permanent normal trade status for China. The flaw in his argument is that the unemployment rate in this country is the lowest it has been in decades. It is impossible for hundreds of thousands of jobs to have been lost if more people have jobs now than in the past. 
 What has, in fact, occurred is that low-paying manufacturing jobs have been moved to foreign countries, while the United States has created a surplus of higher paying, higher skilled jobs. The net effect is not that Americans have lost jobs but that Americans have changed jobs to their economic advantage.

HEADLINE: The Economy Rises, And Crime Falls

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Serious Crimes Fall for 8th Consecutive Year" (news article, May 8):
Attributing crime reduction to "get tough" policing and mandatory sentencing policies, minor gun control legislation and baby boomers aging past their crime-prone years ignores one very important determinant of crime in the United States: improvements in economic opportunity. 
 Crime rates are very much a function of labor market opportunities, especially for minorities and low-wage workers. The tight labor market that has prevailed since the mid-1990's is an important reason for the steep fall in crime. Punitive factors have contributed, but so has the increase in low-wage earnings and employment.
Creating good, paying jobs is one of the best deterrents to crime that money can buy.

HEADLINE: The Economy Rises, And Crime Falls

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A striking and generally unexamined factor in the rise of crime from the mid-1960's to the mid-70's and in its current decline (news article, May 8) is the Vietnam War.
The war was the determinant factor in American life precisely during these 10 years, when so many of the past generation's problems took off: from the rise in crime to the epidemic divorce rate, from the drug culture to the decline of America's cities. Not only does the periodization (as historians would call it) of these issues parallel our involvement in Vietnam, but such broad negative effects are also just what one would expect in a country that, for a decade, waged an unjust and divisive war that bred nihilism and moral breakdown. 
 The decline in crime is one sign, among several social indicators, that we are now emerging from that great trauma.

HEADLINE: Casinos Put Money in Race In New Jersey

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
State Senator William L. Gormley, a leading contender for the Republican nomination for United states Senate from New Jersey, slipped away from the campaign trail one day in early March for an unpublicized visit to Las Vegas. He was not treated like a typical tourist.
 
 There to greet Mr. Gormley at Le Cirque restaurant in the Bellagio Hotel, Steve Wynn's sumptuous new fun house, was the gambling magnate himself. Mr. Wynn had gathered casino executives for a fund-raiser that drew about $40,000 in donations for Mr. Gormley, who in recent years has championed an effort by New Jersey to spend more than $200 million to subsidize the opening of a Wynn casino in Atlantic City.
 Later in the month, another casino impresario, Donald J. Trump, held a similar event for Mr. Gormley at Trump Tower in Manhattan. The proceeds: $55,000.
 Mr. Gormley has amassed far more money than this three Republican opponents, in large part by attracting support from casinos and others tied to the gambling industry - donors over whom he wields considerable authority as Atlantic City's state senator and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which handles most casino legislation.
 Under New Jersey law, Mr. Gormley and other state officials are usually barred from accepting donations from casino executives and employees. The law is intended to prevent corruption, or at a minimum the appearance of a conflict of interest, when state officials render decisions that affect millions of dollars in Altantic City casino profits.
 But the law applies to state and local elections in New Jersey, not to federal ones. And Mr. Gormley has declined to abide by it voluntarily in the Senate race to succeed Frank R. Launtenberg, a Democrat who is retiring.
 In a Republican race between little-known candidates relying on advertising to break through to voters, Mr. Gormley's casino ties and stockpile of contributions, now about $1.9 million after expenditures, could prove a critical asset in the final days before the June 6 primary.
 When it comes to gambling in New Jersey, it would be difficult to overstate the influence of Mr. Gormley. He spearheaded measures that allowed companies to expand their casino holdings, permitted casinos to stay open around the clock and let gamblers use credit cards to pay for chips. He wrote a plan to channel a state tax on casino revenues back into subsidies for new casino properties.
 Mr. Gormley said the donations from the casino industry were legal and did not affect how he carried out his job in Trenton.
 "I don't think that it's an issue," he said in an interview. "I have represented my district well, and I have represented the state with integrity. This is an industry that is a vital part of the state and has a right on the federal level to participate."
 But his casino ties could turn into a major issue if he becomes the Republican nominee. Pamela Garfield, a spokeswoman for group that seeks tighter campaign finance laws, criticized Mr. Gormley, saying he was following the letter, not the spirit, of the law.
 Ms. Garfield said Mr. Gormley's decision to raise casino money underscored flaws in the system. "As candidates are feeling more and more pressure to raise money, they are going to be forced to press their ethical boundaries," she sad. "His acceptance of casino money is a symptom of a broader problem."
 Mr. Gormley is not the only candidate in the priary to reap money from people with an interest in official action. One rival, United States Representative Robert D. Franks of Union County, has been a favorite of political action committees based in Washington. Another, James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, has raised money from county employees and from law firms and others with county contracts.
 Still, Mr. Gormley's connection to the casinos has provided him with an edge. He has taken in more than $200,000 from casino executives and their spouses, out of $2.1 million in total contributions. He has raised about $68,000 from Nevada alone, nearly as much as he has raised from New York State, the records show.
 Park Place Entertainment, Mirage Resorts, Boyd Gaming, Mandalay Resort Group, Showboat, Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza, Trump Marina, Resorts, Treasure Island, Harrah's, Goldn Nugget, Bally's Park Place, Caesars, Tropicana, Sands, Atlantic City Hilton - executives from most of the major casinos in Atlantic City and in Las Vegas and their corporate parents have given, mindful that even if Mr. Gormley loses, he will remain a state senator. (He is up for re-election for his state term in 2001). He has even received contributions from executives in the Mississippi riverboat gambling industry.
 In interviews, the casino executives asserted that they were not looking for something in return from Mr. Gormley, though they acknowledged that it was not a good idea to offend him.
 "I would say he is somebody with a great deal of power in Atlantic City, a great deal of respect in Atlantic City," said Mr Trump, who has feuded with Mr. Gormley in the past over the state's effort to court Mr. Wynn. "And certainly it is a lot easier if he is on your side."
 Alan Feldman, a spokesman for Mr. Wynn, whose company, Mirage Resorts, is being bought by MGM Grand, said Mr. Gormley "has shown leadership that stands out from the pack."
 Mr. Trump said he opposed the ban on casino donations to state candidates in New Jersey, adding that no such rule existed in Nevada. He contended that the New Jersey ban infringed on the industry's right to take part in the political process. That view was echoed to some extent by Mr. Gormley himself, who said he would support weakening the ban, though he would not push to change it because he did ot think that a majority of lawmakers would approve such a move.
 In defending the donations, Mr. Gormley said they formed a relatively small percentage of his total treasury. But he acknowledged that he had also received hundreds of thousands of dollars more from donors who were tied to the industry and cared about his decisions, including lawyers and real estate developers, but would not be barred from giving under the state law because they were not casino employees.
 For instance, Mr. Gormley attracts money from people whose firms and companies have contracts with the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, a state agency that collects taxes from casinos and spends the revenues on projects in Atlantic City and elsewhere in the state. In Trenton, Mr. Gormley is considered to possess virtual veto power over the development authority's activities.
 Lawyers at Connell, Foley, a law firm that received $1.3 million in fees from the authority last year, donated about $28,000 to the Gormley campaign. Lawyers at another firm that has worked for the authority, St. John & Wayne, gave $20,000, while lawyers at a third firm with authority contracts, Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland & Perretti, gave roughly $20,000.
 Executives at Frederic R. Harris, an engineering company that is helping to construct a $330 million tunnel intended to help Mr. Wynn build a new property in the marina area, contributed $17,000.
 Asked about those donations, Mr. Gormley said: "What I have tried to do over the years is to create an environment of economic growth. People who have participated in that in one form or another think that I have done a pretty good job. Even my critics would say that."
 To parry questions about casino money, Mr. Gormley's aides have sought to draw attention to fund-raising by Representative Franks and by Mr. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, both of whom have not collected as much money as Mr.Gormley has but have raised significant amounts from people with business before their offices. (A fourth candidate, Murray Sabrin, a college professor, has raised $300,000).
 Mr. Franks has collected 25 percent of the $1.35 million he has raised from political action committees, particularly those interested in legislation before two committees he serves on, the Budget Committee ad the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He has received money from PAC's representing the American Pilots Association, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association and the United Transportation Union.
 Charlie Smith, an adviser to Mr. Franks, dismissed suggestions that those contributions were related to Mr. Franks's votes in Congress.
 "Political action committee contributions," Mr. Smith said, "are nothing more than the aggregated contributions of an industry or group of people who wish to compete in the political process, alongside special interests such as the casinos."
 Mr. Treffinger, who took office as the county executive in 1995, has raised more than $100,000 from people who work for the county and another $100,000 from lawyers at firms with contracts with county agencies, out of his total of $1.1 million. He is not accepting PAC money.
 Matthew J. Kirnan, Mr. Treffinger's treasurer, said the campaign had not focused fund-raising appeals on county workers.
 "With respect to Essex County employees, most of them are residents of Essex County and rally respect the fact that Jim has changed things," Mr. Kirnan said.
 Of the law firms, the biggest contributor was DeCotiis, Fitzpatrick, Gluck, Hayden & Cole, whose partners have close ties to both major political parties. Its lawyers donated $55,000 to the Treffinger campaign. Another significant benefactor was McCarter & English, whose lawyers gave about $10,000.
 Decotiis, Fitzpatrick represents the Essex County Improvement Authority, which paid the firm $514,000 last year, officials aid. McCarter & English handles the authority's bond work, receiving $380,000 last year.
 Mr. Kirnan said, "Both firms were doing work for the county long before Jim got here, and they will be doing work afterward."
 Eric D. Wisler, a partner at Decotiis, Fitzpatrick, said his firm was retained by county agencies because of its skills, not its donations.
 "I'm not naive to say that if you don't contribute and support your firends in their endeavors, that others won't step in behind you and try to take your place," Mr. Wisler said. "But certainly Jim has never exhibited to me the kind of vindictiveness that people associate with politicians - that if you don't contribute to politicians, you're gone."

HEADLINE: Seas and Soils Emerge as Keys to Climate

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
Over the last 150 years, the burning of coal, oil and natural gas has released some 270 billion tons of carbon into the air in the form of heat-trapping carbon dioxide. If all that had stayed in the atmosphere, much of the substantial global warming predicted for a century from now might have already taken place.
Luckily, more than half the carbon dioxide emitted by fossil-fuel burning is absorbed from the air by the oceans, by plants (which use it in converting sunlight to chemical energy) and by soils. Fewer than half the emissions, scientists believe, remain airborne to warm the earth. 
 All of this is part of one of nature's grand and endlessly complicated global recycling networks. In it, carbon is constantly exchanged among the air, the terrestrial biosphere, the oceans and the solid rock of the earth at varying rates on time scales ranging from hours to millions of years.
Now, as the economic and political difficulty of reducing carbon dioxide emissions at the source becomes ever more obvious, a broad-based move is under way to manipulate the carbon cycle so that it will remove more of the heat-trapping gases from the air. It is an ambitious idea, but on closer inspection one surrounded by questions, potential risks and obstacles.
In one approach, researchers are investigating ways to remove carbon chemically from industrial and automotive emissions before they are released to the atmosphere, then to sequester it at some other way station in the natural carbon cycle -- by injecting the removed carbon back into underground reservoirs or into the ocean, for instance.
The United States Department of Energy has expanded research into carbon-removal technologies at eight of its national laboratories. But this option, the department said in a recent study, is "truly radical" and most experts believe it is some distance from providing a practical alternative.
More promising in the near term, many scientists believe, are prospects for increasing the absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by what is called the terrestrial biosphere: that is, the whole complex of living things on land, mainly plants and various tiny inhabitants and detritus of the soil.
Every time a plant sprouts and grows to maturity, it absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, breaks it down chemically and uses carbon as construction material for roots, stem, branches, flowers and leaves. When the plant dies, some of the carbon goes back into the atmosphere, but some is also released into the soil as the dead plant decays. Decomposing animals, including people, further add to the carbon reservoir in the soil. Globally, soil contains about five times as much carbon as vegetation.
The expansion of these carbon reservoirs, or "sinks," in vegetation and soil has been sanctioned as one way industrialized countries might meet their obligations under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which is aimed at reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases.
Lately, intense argument has developed over the degree to which countries like the United States, which may have great potential for expanding its carbon sinks, ought to be allowed to meet their emissions reduction targets under the protocol by means like planting trees, improving forest management and conserving soils rather than reducing carbon dioxide emissions from cars, factories and power generating stations.
Delegates from more than 100 countries are to grapple with the issue when they meet in November in The Hague for what is widely seen as a make-or-break effort to make the Kyoto Protocol operational.
The rules governing carbon sinks are among the many sets of yet-to-be adopted regulations necessary to put the protocol into effect, and only a few countries have ratified the agreement pending action on them. The United States, where the protocol has encountered strong opposition in Congress on several grounds, is one of those holding back.
In preparation for the critical November meeting, scientists of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, created by the United Nations more than a decade ago to advise the world's governments, issued a report on the carbon issue at a meeting last week in Montreal. The analysis suggested that expansion of terrestrial carbon sinks in the industrialized countries could potentially more than enable them to meet their entire combined emissions reduction quota under the protocol.
But experts associated with the report questioned how much of that potential could be achieved, given the difficulty of actually expanding the world's carbon sinks in practice.
"Judging the technical potential is easy," said Dr. Robert T. Watson, chairman of the intergovernmental panel, who is also the chief atmospheric scientist and environmental adviser of the World Bank. "The real question is, what is the likelihood of realizing that technical potential?"
Under the Kyoto Protocol, the rich industrial countries as a group are obligated to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels by about 2010. The reductions are widely seen as a first step in eventually stabilizing atmospheric concentrations. If emissions are not reduced, prominent scientists say, the average global temperature will rise by about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit by the year 2100. (By comparison, the world is now 5 to 9 degrees warmer than in the depths of the last ice age 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.)
This much warming, the experts say, would bring rising seas, more severe droughts, rainstorms, heat waves and floods, along with broad shifts in climatic and agricultural zones that would benefit some regions but seriously harm others.
Environmentalists and some parties to the Kyoto Protocol, especially the European Union, strenuously object to allowing any country to meet all or most of its emissions reduction goal by expanding carbon sinks.
"Sucking carbon out of the atmosphere is not the same as preventing it permanently from leaving the exhaust pipe or power plant," said Jennifer Morgan, director of the World Wildlife Fund's climate change campaign.
Environmentalists argue that since forests can always be cut down as well as planted, and soils can always be plowed up as well as conserved, the terrestrial biosphere is not nearly as secure a carbon reservoir as the underground reservoirs where coal, oil and gas are contained. So, they say, why remove them from that secure spot in the first place?
They also fear that reliance on sinks to meet the Kyoto targets could delay the adoption of measures to reduce fossil fuel use and replace it with other energy technologies.
In any event, scientists say, carbon sinks will eventually probably reach a saturation point, at which they will be unable to absorb any more carbon dioxide. The dominant view therefore remains that if the world is serious about reducing and stabilizing the atmospheric concentrations, emissions must be cut at the source by burning fossil fuels more efficiently, switching from relatively high-carbon fuels like coal to lower-carbon natural gas, and replacing fossil fuels altogether by alternatives like hydrogen fuel cells.
Given the slow progress in that direction, though, proponents of the carbon sink idea argue that it could be a valuable interim measure.
In many ways, however, human activity has been shrinking carbon sinks rather than expanding them. Deforestation and farming have obliterated great stretches of forest and grassland that once absorbed carbon dioxide. Farming has also chopped up soils in ways that cause them to give off carbon dioxide rather than to sequester it.
In fact, said the scientific report issued in Montreal, human use of the terrestrial biosphere, including the burning of wood, has released some 135 billion tons of carbon into the air since 1850 -- about half as much as has been emitted by fossil fuel burning.
The net result of all this is that overall atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide are about 30 percent higher now than at the start of the industrial revolution.
A de facto counterattack has been under way for some time in the Northern Hemisphere, where the replanting of forests on deforested lands has made headway in recent decades. One provision of the Kyoto Protocol allows for industrialized countries to gain credit toward their reduction targets for tree planting since 1990 -- but also to incur debits for any deforestation since then. To reap meaningful credit, a country would have to show a net gain.
The protocol also allows countries to gain credit for reductions through a variety of other ways of expanding terrestrial carbon stocks should the parties to the agreement so decide. These include, for instance, expanding carbon stores in soil through no-till agriculture, in which no plowing takes place and seeds are sown in the carbon-rich detritus of the previous year's harvest.
Other possibilities include conversion of cropland into grassland, fertilization of pastureland and forest management practices designed to increase carbon stocks -- for example, lengthening the period between harvests of a forest's timber, or promoting faster tree growth and thicker stands of trees, plantation-style.
Estimates suggest that these kinds of measures might allow some countries to achieve large cuts in net carbon dioxide emissions. The potential of such measures in the United States, Canada and Russia is great, according to a recent calculation made for the World Wildlife Fund by Kevin Gurney, an atmospheric researcher at Colorado State University who studies the carbon cycle.
Mr. Gurney estimated, for example, that without planting any trees, the measures would potentially enable the United States to remove about 150 million tons of carbon a year from the atmosphere. This exceeds its Kyoto emissions reduction target by tens of millions of tons. "They're pretty big," Mr. Gurney said of the estimates.
The Montreal report estimated that in theory, measures other than tree-planting by the industrialized countries could remove nearly 290 million more tons of carbon a year from the atmosphere by about 2010 than are removed by such measures now. By comparison, the Kyoto Protocol would require the rich countries to cut emissions by about 200 million tons a year below 1990 levels by about 2010.
The report also raised caveats about how much of this estimated potential might be achieved. Even with "an ambitious policy agenda," it said, the estimates were "likely to be on the high side."
Far smaller gains could be achieved by the rich countries by planting trees and slowing deforestation, the report concluded. It said that a 20 percent increase in forest planting would probably offset no more than 3 million tons of carbon emissions a year, while slowing deforestation by 20 percent could offset about 18 million tons.
Even if the potential for carbon sequestration can be realized to a substantial degree, many headaches still present themselves. For instance, forest growth is spurred -- and terrestrial carbon stocks are increased -- by a warming climate, and by rising levels of carbon dioxide and of atmospheric nitrogen deposited on forests as a result of industrial emissions.
In assessing a country's carbon stocks for purposes of assigning credit, how can these effects of human activity be separated from the growth in carbon stocks brought about by tree-planting efforts alone? It is almost impossible to make such a separation, Dr. Watson said.
Another difficulty for some kinds of carbon sequestration efforts is that of monitoring and accounting for carbon stocks. Although there are well-established means of measuring the increase of carbon in a stand of growing trees, other sinks may present problems. One way to get around the difficulty in the case of agricultural soils might be to set up a business-as-usual control plot, in which conventional farming methods are used, against which to measure the change in carbon stocks as a result of no-till farming.
Then there are ecological concerns. For instance, managers of carbon-sequestration projects might be tempted to replace naturally functioning forests with tree plantations, which in biological terms are comparatively poor and sterile, with little of the biological richness and variety of the wild woods. Likewise, managers might be tempted to cut down mature forests so as to plant new, faster-growing ones that sequester carbon at a higher rate.
It is on questions of detail like these that the success or failure of the Kyoto Protocol may ultimately hinge.

Chart: "Manipulating the Carbon Cycle"
Scientists believe that more than half the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere by the burning of fossil fuels is absorbed by the earth's oceans, plants and soils. The rest of the carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere, trapping the sun's radiation and warming the earth. Researchers are now exploring ways to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide further by expanding plant and soil carbon reservoirs, or sinks, on land.
 
THE GLOBAL CARBON CYCLE
Carbon atoms -- many in the form of carbon dioxide, organic compounds, fossil fuels or carbonate rocks -- cycle through the earth among air, water and land.
 
Ocean
 
MARINE PLANTS, ANIMALS
Carbonate shells fall to the ocean floor when an animal dies.
 
Respiration and Decomposition
A carbon atom, on average, will remain in the ocean for 350 years as aquatic life uses it in photosynthesis and respiration.
 
Land and the Living Earth
The average residence time for carbon on land is 35 years, but atoms can be buried for millions of years, becoming fossil fuels if subjected to high temperatures and pressures
 
Atmosphere
On average, an atom stays in the air only five years before it gets cycled.
 
Carbon taken up by plants may return to the air through decomposition and other processes, or it may be buried.
 
Combustion
For 10,000 years, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere was stable. But since the advent of industry in 1850, levels have been rising.
 
The Route to a Cleaner, Perhaps Cooler, Earth: Pulling Carbon Out of the Atmosphere . . .
Scientists on the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggest that increasing plant and soil sinks in industrialized countries may help those countries meet quotas for emissions reduction.
 
SOME RESEARCHERS PROPOSE TO:
Plant forests and lengthen the period between timber harvests to extract carbon from the atmosphere.
Convert cropland into grassland because plowed land releases carbon dioxide rather than absorbs it.
Use no-till agriculture, in which seeds are sown in the unplowed soil of the previous harvest.
 
... Or Not Putting It There at All?
Some environmentalists question this strategy, arguing that added carbon sinks are a less reliable approach and that they have limits in their capacity to store carbon.
 
SOME ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WOULD RATHER ENCOURAGE:
Using nonfossil fuel energy sources like solar power and hydrogen fuel cells.
Switching from high-carbon coal to lower-carbon natural gas.
Finding greater efficiency in burning fossil fuels.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
A Human Pez Dispenser Of Jokes and One-Liners

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
Bruce Vilanch, who has written scripts for dozens of award shows and variety shows and supplied patter for celebrities, has become known as something of a Hollywood laugh-dispenser, a 24-hour grocery of wisecracks, show biz in-jokes and snippy bons mots. "Got any lines?" is the question Mr. Vilanch, in his new one-man show, "Bruce Vilanch: Almost Famous," says he is perennially asked. Interestingly, he's not referring to cocaine.
If you are wondering about what makes these credentials worthy of an evening of theater -- Mr. Vilanch has written for the Osmonds, among others, and even the Oscars aren't exactly known for consistent drollery -- it's a good question. For the show, which is running through June 10 at the Westbeth Theater Center, is not so much a theatrical presentation as a party at which the funniest kid in the class is expected to be the center of attention. 
 "I have no act," Mr. Vilanch says early on, an invitation to criticism that won't be accommodated here. The idea is that the audience is eager to hear him reminisce in a chatty, off-the-cuff fashion about the backstage antics of Bette Midler, Cher and the like, and that's a bit of an assumption. To judge from his enthusiastic reception at a recent performance, there is an audience for the kind of inside scoop he can provide, a niche market in diva flapdoodle. But the world in which Mr. Vilanch travels isn't all that -- what's the word? Significant? And anyone who brags about writing the script for the Miss Black Teenage Utah pageant is at least a bit self-trivializing.
Mr. Vilanch, a paunchy, hirsute fellow who has the look and demeanor of a weird, antisocial child that Santa Claus's parents kept hidden in the attic, enters in a sequined T-shirt designed to suggest an evening gown, bare-shouldered and in bad taste. "Hi, I'm Linda Tripp," he says, then sings a campy song about gay men who work in the wardrobe and wig departments. He is accompanied by an onstage pianist, Dick Gallagher, who is otherwise deployed throughout to no substantial effect.
Mr. Vilanch's show is organized along vaguely autobiographical lines. Against a backdrop of pastel-colored T-shirts pinned to the wall, many of them in children's sizes -- "Michael Jackson's laundry," he explains -- he speaks about growing up as an ungainly boy in Paterson, N.J.; doing some modeling (for Lane Bryant) and acting; and his early career as a journalist in Chicago, where he met Ms. Midler 30 years ago while writing about her nightclub show.
From then on, apparently, his life followed one long, upwardly mobile path from variety show to awards show to movie bit to movie subject (the recent documentary about him is called "Get Bruce!") to the apparent pinnacle, as head writer and frequent guest on the game show "Hollywood Squares."
Mr. Vilanch does have some amusing stories to tell, most of them vulgar. There's one about Tallulah Bankhead and flatulence that would be priceless if he learned how to tell it more economically for the stage and not as though he were holding court at a drunken dinner party. But his best lines (unprintable here) are those he recounts as delivered by others, namely Sophie Tucker and Paul Lynde, the latter of whom he describes as having been dull when sober, incredibly charming and funny on one drink "and on two drinks, Josef Mengele."
Jewish and openly gay -- "Now you have to get up and say, 'I'm Spartacus,' " he says, with some appropriate scorn, about the social pressure to declare one's sexual credentials -- he delivers some otherwise standard-issue material about gay pride and Jewish stereotypes in Hollywood. Much of the second act depends on questions from the audience.
Over all, the evening yields insight only into the blandness of Hollywood-style entertainment. This is the kind of storytelling that relies far too much on the presumption of a man who is quite used to being told, "Oh, you're so funny," by people who have a stake in its being so.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Visionary of the Opera Inspires a Turnaround

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

 BODY:
When Paul Kellogg became the artistic and general director of the New York City Opera in 1996, the company was carrying a $5 million debt, had lost its sense of artistic direction and was coping emotionally with the death from AIDS of its previous director, the conductor Christopher Keene. Revitalizing the City Opera was going to be a formidable challenge. And the greatest impediment to doing so, in fundamental ways, was the New York State Theater itself, the City Opera's home since 1965, which is shared with the New York City Ballet. Rehearsal space and administrative offices had always been woefully inadequate there.
The immediate problem Mr. Kellogg confronted was the poor acoustics of the 2,700-seat auditorium. Two earlier attempts to correct the problem with minor architectural adjustments had not appreciably improved the sound in the house. In exasperation, Mr. Kellogg, with the support of the City Ballet, finally approved the installation of an electronic sound enhancement system before the opening of the season last fall, surely the most controversial decision of his tenure. Natural sound has been a hallmark of the classical music heritage, and there are few places left in the world, other than opera houses and concerts halls, where audiences can experience music without the sound being processed electronically. 
 But Mr. Kellogg maintains that the sound system has been an enormous success over all. Without exception, he asserts, the company's music staff, orchestra players and singers support its use. And the vast majority of City Opera audiences either strongly approve, he says, basing his observations on feedback and mail he has received, or at least are not bothered by it.
During a recent interview, Mr. Kellogg vigorously defended his decision to resort to an electronic solution for the house's poor acoustics. Yet he also indicated for the first time that the system was an "interim solution" for a problem that he hopes will be solved architecturally by a major renovation of the house. Discussions are under way about renovations of the entire Lincoln Center complex. A major redesign of the State Theater auditorium to improve the acoustics is on the table, though the project could easily be derailed by the sheer expense involved, which could exceed $30 million for the State Theater alone. Moreover, the auditorium is a historic and justly acclaimedspace for dance. The City Ballet, which actually prefers to minimize sound from the stage, has more interest in preserving it as is.
If the renovation plan does not come to pass, Mr. Kellogg stated unequivocally, the company will find "another solution." He refused to specify what that might entail, but the only apparent solution would be to relocate the company to a site outside Lincoln Center. That idea was raised unofficially by Mr. Kellogg's exasperated predecessors. Such a move would be Mr. Kellogg's boldest stroke by far, challenging the idea of the urban arts complex.
What Mr. Kellogg mostly wanted to talk about during the interview was good news about the company's current finances and artistic strength. The City Opera is thriving, and he has compiled the facts and figures to back his case. Debt has been erased, and the company now boasts a $12 million endowment. Fund-raising is up 50 percent since 1996. The operating budget has increased some $5 million over the same period, to $31 million for the 1999-2000 season, which ended three weeks ago. In the last year attendance has increased by 10 percent: this season the company sold an average of 83 percent of the house.
How did this happen? Soon after arriving, Mr. Kellogg announced a three-year revitalization plan with specific goals. Because the Metropolitan Opera was right across the plaza at Lincoln Center, it was essential, he felt, that City Opera distinguish itself by performing repertory the Met was not known for, especially Baroque operas and 20th-century American works. Even when the City Opera presents the staples -- "Carmen," "Tosca" and such -- it should do so, he believed, in innovative modern productions that contrasted with the Met's grand traditionalism in the standard repertory. If the City Opera could not afford to hire renowned vocalists for, say, "Madama Butterfly," then it should present casts of fresh-voiced, younger singers who looked like the characters they were portraying and were strong actors.
Yet every aspect of Mr. Kellogg's vision for the company was contingent on making the house more acoustically vibrant. If attractive singers with young voices were going to flourish there, the sound in the auditorium had to become more alive. If Baroque operas were going to be presented effectively, and if audiences new to opera were going to be attracted to it, then the house had to be made to feel more intimate.
"For so long, so many people complained about the acoustics of the State Theater, its unfriendliness to young voices, the dryness and unevenness of the sound in the house," Mr. Kellogg said. The press complained continually, he added. The company had to find an interim solution.
Of course, until recently, the idea that the sound system might become a permanent feature of even a renovated State Theater was very much alive. When the system was installed, Mr. Kellogg asked wary critics and audiences for a grace period. He promised to present a demonstration for critics and patrons to hear just how subtly, in his opinion, the system works. Excerpts from operas would be performed with the system switched off and on. That demonstration has never occurred, he conceded, citing the expense involved.
Last fall he also said that once the system was installed and fine-tuned, the controls and levels would be set and never tampered with. It was important, he felt, that the State Theater have a distinctive house sound.
But even at the Met, with its quite good acoustics, the house sound varies from production to production, mostly depending on the size and placement of sets. Wouldn't it be impossible for technicians at the State Theater to resist fiddling with the controls from night to night? If the capability exists, it is human nature to utilize it.
Sure enough, not only has daily tinkering become commonplace, Mr. Kellogg conceded, but on some nights the system has been turned off completely, he said, though no announcements were made to the press and public. This put audiences, but especially critics who are expected to offer informed evaluations, in an impossible situation. Can we trust what we are hearing?
That singers and musicians apparently support the sound system is not really surprising. Why shouldn't they take advantage of electronic assistance in an acoustically unfriendly house? That audiences have largely embraced it is also to be expected. Amplification has become pervasive, and the younger audiences the company is attracting, having grown up with electronic sound, are unlikely even to notice.
"The fact is, no matter what, people are going to complain about the sound in this house," Mr. Kellogg said. "This system is a way of solving the problem on an interim basis. The audience is not reacting, for the most part, on a matter of principle. Nor am I." Critics can "wring their hands as much as they like," he added. "It works for me."
Defenders, even among critics, argue that there is a difference between real amplification, typical today in Broadway theaters where singers wear body microphones, and systems that enhance the acoustical properties of a hall itself. But whatever labels are coined to describe the equipment, voices are still being picked up by microphones, carried through wires and disseminated through dozens, even hundreds, of tiny speakers that cover the walls.
And just as on Broadway, the use of sound systems in opera and concert music will eventually affect the way singers sing, musicians play, audiences hear and composers write. Mr. Kellogg maintains that the State Theater system "allows voices to be heard as they really are," and that it "does not make a small voice large or an ugly voice pretty."
I am not convinced, nor are some other critics, and at least a vocal minority of audience members. Because of the enhancement system, certain sounds -- a soprano's sustained, full-voiced high notes, for example -- are almost always piercingly present. Some sounds get oddly emphasized. During a recent performance of Virgil Thomson's "Mother of Us All," the opera sounded at times like a concerto for snare drum.
Of course, we have this adventurous and increasingly essential company to thank for finally bringing us the first production ever by a major New York opera house of Thomson's great American opera, as well as many other important works, like Rameau's "Platee" in the imaginative production by Mark Morris (which sold 95 percent of the house in six performances). Next season come other rarities and treats, like Prokofiev's "Love of Three Oranges" and Handel's "Rinaldo" with the splendid countertenor David Daniels in the title role.
Mr. Kellogg readily agreed that there was "no substitute for a house whose good acoustics are architectural." He hopes this can be achieved at the State Theater. It falls to critics, then, to point out the shortcomings of the current system.
Last week the company presented "Showcasing American Composers 2000," an invaluable contribution to the city's cultural life and the future of American opera. Over a period of two weeks, excerpts of roughly 25 minutes each from 12 American operas, either works-in-progress or existing operas that have yet to be produced, were performed in open readings with a full orchestra and strong vocal soloists at the Great Hall of Cooper Union.
This is the second consecutive year that these free performances were presented. The rehearsal schedule was tight but sufficient to give the composers, interested singers and operagoers and, most important, potential producers a good sense of the various works. That Mr. Kellogg and his company secured funds for this important project demonstrates how fully they are committed to the future of American opera. The Met has done nothing remotely as helpful to the cause.
That the City Opera's showcase was taking place off-site, downtown, not far from the home of the most famous organization to bolt Lincoln Center, Joseph Papp's Public Theater, seemed significant. What other bold ventures could the newly energized City Opera undertake if it could just scrap that sound system and fix up its house, or, maybe even get out of Lincoln Center and start afresh?

HEADLINE: Production Surged in April, And the Fed Was Watching

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities grew 0.9 percent in April, the fastest pace in nearly one and a half years, as businesses scrambled to meet demand, the Federal Reserve said today.
Analysts said the report underlined the economy's momentum and made it nearly certain that the central bank would raise interest rates by half a percentage point when its policy makers meet on Tuesday. 
 The Fed wants to slow the pace of growth in the economy to avert a possible surge in wages and prices, especially with the unemployment rate at a 30-year low.
The rise in industrial output in April was the strongest since a 1.8 percent pickup in August 1998. The Fed also said output grew by 0.7 percent in March, faster than the 0.3 percent it reported a month ago.
As a result, businesses ran at 82.1 percent of their maximum capacity last month, the highest rate since 82.4 percent in May 1998. The factory use rate in March was 81.7 percent, implying that the industrial sector was picking up speed at the start of the second quarter instead of slowing.
"This is bound to further bolster the Fed's perception that it must become more aggressive about reining in demand," said David Orr, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
Mr. Orr said that excess global manufacturing capacity that developed in late 1997 when Asia entered an economic crisis had now largely disappeared as overseas economies recovered and worldwide demand picked up.
While April's heightened factory operating rate remained well below the 85 percent level that is generally taken as a signal of potential production bottlenecks, it implied that businesses were beginning to strain to meet robust consumer demand.
The report said that virtually every manufacturing industry posted gains in production last month as output climbed 0.8 percent after a 0.9 percent rise in March. The rate of new-car and truck assemblies was pushed up to 13.3 million a year during April from 13 million in March.
At utility companies, production of gas and electricity rebounded 2.8 percent last month after falling 1.8 percent in March, while mining companies raised their production by 0.4 percent in April after a 1 percent gain in March.

HEADLINE: Panel Fears Security at Labs Hurts Foreign Hiring

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ 

 BODY:
A panel of scientists and engineers who advise the president and Congress issued a statement yesterday expressing concern that heightened security measures at federal laboratories appeared to be damaging their ability to hire and retain foreign-born and minority scientists.
If the laboratories could not attract those scientists, who make up a large portion of the technical talent in the United States, the labs' abilities to perform tasks as diverse as ensuring the safety of the nuclear stockpile and cleaning up toxic wastes could be threatened, said the panel, the National Science Board. 
 Energy Secretary Bill Richardson immediately disputed the board's contention that the security measures are behind the laboratories' hiring difficulties, pointing instead to "an atmosphere of fear" generated by Congress.
The Energy Department, which runs the labs, "is doing its best to strike the proper balance between protecting that which legitimately requires protection while encouraging the openness that science requires," Mr. Richardson said.
Security requirements have been tightened at federal labs since Wen Ho Lee, a former nuclear scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, was arrested and charged with mishandling nuclear secrets more than a year ago. Rules involving close scrutiny of scientists' contact with foreign nationals, polygraph tests and limitations on scientific collaborations have been imposed.
Some of the measures have been criticized as needlessly intrusive and unfairly burdensome to Asian and Asian-American scientists at the laboratories and are said to create a hostile and discriminatory workplace.
The issue is a serious one, since, for example, more than a quarter of doctorates in technical fields awarded in the United States each year are given to Asians or Asian-Americans.
The statement from the National Science Board, which also governs the National Science Foundation, said the security concerns at the labs have led to a "growing difficulty" in attracting foreign-born and minority scientists "because of perceptions based on nationality, ethnicity, or other characteristics."
Dr. Eamon Kelly, president emeritus of Tulane University and chairman of the science board, said: "There's an accumulation of evidence that the current environment is becoming a detriment to the hiring of foreign-born and minority American scientists. This can have an impact on the integrity of the scientific process, which would be detrimental both to our national security and our economic growth."
He said that while the board was mindful of suspicion surrounding Asian scientists at federal laboratories, its concerns went further, covering all foreign-born scientists.
Congress has also placed a moratorium on visits to the labs by scientists from numerous countries, except when special waivers are granted by Mr. Richardson. An Energy Department official said the routine paperwork generated by the security rules was "overlaid with this sense of suspicion" only because of the intrusion of needless restrictions imposed by Congress.
Mr. Richardson said the security requirements by themselves did not discourage international collaborations or intimidate lab scientists. Rather, he said, "It is Congress, by creating an atmosphere of fear, that has caused concerns among the foreign-born scientists."

HEADLINE: Crop Genetics On the Line In Brazil;
A Rule on Seeds May Have Global Impact

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA with SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO

 BODY:
He was dazzled by the vast fields of soybeans in Brazil, and the efficiency of the farms in Argentina frankly frightened him. But nothing that Harold H. Dyer, an Iowa farmer, saw on his working vacation in South America last year surprised him more than finding out that his competitors freely used genetically modified soybeans in ways that would have landed him in a heap of trouble.
He knew that most farmers in Argentina planted modified soybean seeds, but he did not know that they saved seeds from one year to plant the next, a practice that is legal in Argentina but not in North America. The Argentinians told him they never pay a technology fee for the seeds, which cost American farmers an extra $6.50 a bag. 
 And in Brazil, where such seeds are still outlawed, Mr. Dyer was convinced -- though no one came right out and said so -- that the seeds were being smuggled in. The Brazilian government insists that no genetically altered soybeans are grown there, but Mr. Dyer said he saw soybean fields that were as free of weeds as the parts of his own 2,500-acre farm in Iowa and Missouri where he sows the superseeds.
"They have to live by their rules, of which there aren't any, and we have to live by ours, which are numerous," said Mr. Dyer, 75, who also runs several grain elevators in Iowa and Missouri. "It's not fair, and I would like for it to be changed, but that's the way it is."
Brazil is in the process of deciding whether to make the new technology legal. And there is a growing sense that what happens in Brazil -- the world's No. 2 soybean producer, after the United States -- could tip the balance on genetically altered crops around the world.
Should Brazil officially reject biotechnology's lure, it would be a big setback for American companies that have already been hurt financially by fierce resistance in Europe from consumers and large companies that refuse to buy modified produce. But if Brazil's huge agricultural sector joins the biotech fold, experts say, it may someday be difficult for consumers anywhere to find any food free of genetically modified material.
That is because the United States, Brazil and Argentina, the No. 3 producer, together grow 80 percent of the world's 157 million metric tons of soybeans, an extraordinarily versatile crop that is pressed into oil, processed into food, and added to countless foods.
"Once Brazil starts harvesting transgenic soybeans, there will be no turning back," said Joao Carlos Carvalho, president of Agropecuaria Basso, a Brazilian company licensed to sell the seeds if they are approved.
The situation in Brazil also shows how difficult it is to control this new technology in the absence of any global regulatory mechanism. The Brazilian government approved the use of modified seeds developed by Monsanto in 1998, but a consumer group challenged the approval in federal court in Brazil. Delmiro Silva, a spokesman for Monsanto in Brazil, expects a ruling sometime this year.
Technically, it is still illegal to plant high-technology seeds in Brazil. This is such a sensitive issue that the minister of agriculture, Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, would respond only to a written question. "The commercial planting of genetically modified soybeans in Brazil is not permitted," he wrote. Frequent government testing, he added, confirmed that the harvest is free of genetically modified organisms.
Still, many agricultural experts, Brazilian and American alike, suspect that modified seeds are being smuggled in from Argentina. Dwain L. Ford, chairman for international affairs at the American Soybean Association, estimates that up to 30 percent of Brazil's soy crop could already be genetically modified. South American farmers are thus using the new technology without paying for it or necessarily understanding how to control it.
"There are no strict controls on highways or in warehouses, so no one really knows how many seeds have been smuggled in," said David Brew, a partner at Brasoja Corretora de Cereais, a grain trading company in Porto Alegre, Brazil. "Now the concern is that the smuggling has resulted in the trafficking of second-generation seeds as well."
While suspicious consumers stopped such farming in its tracks in Europe, the rush to biotech on this side of the Atlantic appears to be picking up steam. The big biotech companies, led by Monsanto, have made the Western hemisphere a vast proving ground for farmer acceptance of the seeds, government regulation of the crops and the limits to which intellectual property rights can be claimed.
The companies' progress has been formidable. In 1996, altered crops were planted on little more than four million acres worldwide. Today, altered soy, corn, cotton, canola and other crops are grown on nearly 100 million acres, 99 percent of it in just three countries: the United States, Argentina and Canada.
Although American consumers generally have been less upset than Europeans by the new crops, the Clinton administration plans to tighten regulations on the development and marketing of genetically modified plants and foods.
The reason farmers in many countries, even a few in Spain, France and Portugal, embrace the new technology despite consumer fears is simple: lower costs. With declining prices and an oversupply of soy, farmers look for every advantage.
By altering the seeds, Monsanto enables plants to withstand the widely used weed killer Roundup, which Monsanto also manufactures. Farmers who use Roundup Ready seed save on chemicals and labor because they can apply a single herbicide without harming the soy plants.
A study by Auburn University found that farmers who use the seeds can cut costs 4 percent, reduce the need for pesticides, and save time as well. For someone like Mr. Dyer, this is incentive enough to switch entirely this year.
But he will have to live by several conditions imposed by Monsanto, at least in North America. Farmers must pay a fee for each bag of seed. They must agree not to save seed for the following year, a practice farmers have used for years. And they must agree that if they ever stop using the seed, Monsanto investigators -- farmers call them gene police -- can walk their fields to take plant samples.
Monsanto has fought hard to define its intellectual property rights broadly, and to defend them vigorously. Thousands of calls have come into its informers' hotline about farmers planting saved seed. Monsanto has brought charges against "a fraction of a fraction" of the roughly 250,000 farmers who have ever used Roundup Ready seed, a spokesman said, declining to be more specific. Nearly all quietly pay their fines.
But in Saskatchewan, Monsanto is bringing a farmer to court for illegally growing genetically altered canola. The farmer, Percy Schmeiser, acknowledges that Monsanto investigators found altered plants on his land, but he insists he did not plant them. They were grown, he said, from seed that had blown off passing grain trucks or drifted in on the wind.
"I never had anything to do with Monsanto," Mr. Schmeiser said. "They were simply trying to see how far they could exercise property rights over farmers -- even those who hadn't planted their seed."
When he refused to pay the fines, Mr. Schmeiser was taken to court by Monsanto. The case, scheduled to be heard before summer, is widely seen as a test of Monsanto's intellectual property rights.
"If I lose my case," Mr. Schmeiser said, "every farmer in North America will become a serf." Monsanto declined to discuss the case.
In South America, Monsanto has been far less vigilant. In 1995, its application for a patent on Roundup Ready seed in Argentina was rejected. It appealed, but went ahead with plans to introduce the seed. Without a patent, Monsanto had no legal right to charge a fee or inspect farms to see if unauthorized seed was being planted.
With no patent, a black market flourished, forcing Monsanto to lower prices to less than half what it charges American farmers.
Today, as much as 90 percent of Argentina's soy crop may be genetically altered, the highest percentage in the world.
Monsanto's decision to enter this market without patent protection puzzled many people, including its fiercest critics.
Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends -- which is suing Monsanto in federal court for for what the group contends are antitrust violations -- said Monsanto has long argued that it cannot make money unless it controls intellectual property rights. But its decision to sell the seeds in Argentina anyway, he said, shows "they don't have to do that."
Monsanto says it will eventually have adequate patent protection in Brazil. Executives insist that despite the experience in Argentina, patent protection remains essential.
"But we have to deal with realities as well," said Robert L. Harness, director of international government affairs at Monsanto. "The consideration entering Argentina was that we wanted to obtain patent protection. We also wanted to provide our new technology to this market. We wish the situation were different, but it's not."
In Brazil, police have raided fields in the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Mato Grosso do Sul, where officials have said they intend to declare their states free of modified seeds.
The attraction is clear. European customers have reportedly already started asking for Brazilian soybeans because modified seeds are illegal there.
But segregating vast quantities of a commodity produced at thousands of farms would be daunting even in the United States. The ability of a developing country like Brazil to pull off such a task is questioned, even by Brazilians.
"Is someone going to sift through each truck of soybeans that arrives at port for export?" said Mr. Carvalho, president of Agropecuaria Basso.
Linda Thrane, a spokeswoman for Cargill, the large American commodities company, said the company "certainly wouldn't represent soybean shipments from Brazil as being 100 percent nongenetically enhanced."
Opinion about the future is deeply divided in South America, as elsewhere. While some see salvation in keeping the seeds out, many farmers are eager to enjoy an edge in a tight global market.
"How can we compete against the Americans and the Argentinians if they're allowed access to this technology and we're not?" said Armando Carlos Roos, a soybean farmer in Rio Grande do Sul. "Everyone knows transgenic soybeans have been smuggled in from Argentina," he said, and the pressure to use the new technology, legally or not, is intense. "I will go broke if I don't get to use transgenic beans. It's as simple as that."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Supreme Court's Decision on the Violence Against Women Act

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's decision today declaring unconstitutional the civil remedy provision of the Violence Against Women Act, referred to by the court as Section 13981. The vote, in United States v. Morrison, was 5 to 4. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote the majority opinion, and Justice David H. Souter wrote the dissent.
 
FROM THE DECISION
By Chief Justice Rehnquist 
 Section 13981 was part of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. It states that "all persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender." To enforce that right, subsection (c) declares: "person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any state) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate." . . .
Congress explicitly identified the sources of federal authority on which it relied in enacting Section 13981. It said that a "federal civil rights cause of action" is established "pursuant to the affirmative power of Congress under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution." We address Congress's authority to enact this remedy under each of these constitutional provisions in turn. . . .
As we discussed at length in United States v. Lopez, our interpretation of the Commerce Clause has changed as our nation has developed. We need not repeat that detailed review of the Commerce Clause's history here; it suffices to say that, in the years since N.L.R.B. v. Jones Laughlin Steel Corporation, Congress has had considerably greater latitude in regulating conduct and transactions under the Commerce Clause than our previous case law permitted.
Lopez emphasized, however, that even under our modern, expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, Congress's regulatory authority is not without effective bounds.
As we observed in Lopez, modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence has "identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power. First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce. Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities. Finally, Congress's commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce." . . .
Several significant considerations contributed to our decision in Lopez .
First, we observed that Section 922(q) of the Gun-Free School Zones Act was "a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms." . . . Lopez's review of Commerce Clause case law demonstrates that in those cases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate activity based upon the activity's substantial effects on interstate commerce, the activity in question has been some sort of economic endeavor.
The second consideration that we found important in analyzing Section 922(q) was that the statute contained "no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce." Such a jurisdictional element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of Congress's regulation of interstate commerce.
Third, we noted that neither Section 922(q) "nor its legislative history contains express Congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone." . . .
Finally, our decision in Lopez rested in part on the fact that the link between gun possession and a substantial effect on interstate commerce was attenuated. . . .
With these principles underlying our Commerce Clause jurisprudence as reference points, the proper resolution of the present cases is clear. Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity. While we need not adopt a categorical rule against aggregating the effects of any noneconomic activity in order to decide these cases, thus far in our nation's history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature.
Like the Gun-Free School Zones Act at issue in Lopez, Section 13981 contains no jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. . . .
In contrast with the lack of Congressional findings that we faced in Lopez, Section 13981 is supported by numerous findings regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence has on victims and their families. But the existence of Congressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the constitutionality of Commerce Clause legislation.
In these cases, Congress's findings are substantially weakened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method of reasoning that we have already rejected as unworkable if we are to maintain the Constitution's enumeration of powers. Congress found that gender-motivated violence affects interstate commerce "by deterring potential victims from traveling interstate, from engaging in employment in interstate business, and from transacting with business, and in places involved in interstate commerce; by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products."
Given these findings and petitioners' arguments, the concern that we expressed in Lopez that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to completely obliterate the Constitution's distinction between national and local authority seems well founded. The reasoning that petitioners advance seeks to follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime (the suppression of which has always been the prime object of the States' police power) to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce. If accepted, petitioners' reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or any other type of violence since gender-motivated violence, as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part.
Petitioners' reasoning, moreover, will not limit Congress to regulating violence but may, as we suggested in Lopez, be applied equally as well to family law and other areas of traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of marriage, divorce, and childrearing on the national economy is undoubtedly significant. Congress may have recognized this specter when it expressly precluded Section 13981 from being used in the family law context. Under our written Constitution, however, the limitation of Congressional authority is not solely a matter of legislative grace.
We accordingly reject the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce. The Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local. In recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that has been consistent since the Clause was adopted. The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the States. Indeed, we can think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.
Because we conclude that the Commerce Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact Section 13981, we address petitioners' alternative argument that the section's civil remedy should be upheld as an exercise of Congress's remedial power under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment. . . .
Section 5 states that Congress may enforce, by appropriate legislation, the constitutional guarantee that no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law, nor deny any person equal protection of the laws. . . .
Petitioners' Section 5 argument is founded on an assertion that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gender-motivated violence. This assertion is supported by a voluminous Congressional record. . . . Petitioners contend that this bias denies victims of gender-motivated violence the equal protection of the laws and that Congress therefore acted appropriately in enacting a private civil remedy against the perpetrators of gender-motivated violence to both remedy the states' bias and deter future instances of discrimination in the state courts.
As our cases have established, state-sponsored gender discrimination violates equal protection unless it serves important governmental objectives and the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives. However, the language and purpose of the 14th Amendment place certain limitations on the manner in which Congress may attack discriminatory conduct. These limitations are necessary to prevent the 14th Amendment from obliterating the framers' carefully crafted balance of power between the states and the national government. Foremost among these limitations is the time-honored principle that the 14th Amendment, by its very terms, prohibits only state action. . . . Section 13981 . . . is directed not at any state or state actor, but at individuals.
 
FROM THE DISSENT
By Justice Souter
The court says both that it leaves Commerce Clause precedent undisturbed and that the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 . . . exceeds Congress's power under that Clause. I find the claims irreconcilable and respectfully dissent.
Our cases, which remain at least nominally undisturbed, stand for the following propositions. Congress has the power to legislate with regard to activity that, in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. The fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for the courts in the first instance, but for the Congress, whose institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceeds ours. By passing legislation, Congress indicates its conclusion, whether explicitly or not, that facts support its exercise of the commerce power. The business of the courts is to review the Congressional assessment, not for soundness but simply for the rationality of concluding that a jurisdictional basis exists in fact. Any explicit findings that Congress chooses to make, though not dispositive of the question of rationality, may advance judicial review by identifying factual authority on which Congress relied. Applying those propositions in these cases can lead to only one conclusion.
One obvious difference from United States v. Lopez is the mountain of data assembled by Congress, here showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce. Passage of the Act in 1994 was preceded by four years of hearings, which included testimony from physicians and law professors; from survivors of rape and domestic violence; and from representatives of state law enforcement and private business. The record includes reports on gender bias from task forces in 21 states, and we have the benefit of specific factual findings in the eight separate reports issued by Congress and its committees over the long course leading to enactment. Congress thereby explicitly stated the predicate for the exercise of its Commerce Clause power. Is its conclusion irrational in view of the data amassed? True, the methodology of particular studies may be challenged, and some of the figures arrived at may be disputed. But the sufficiency of the evidence before Congress to provide a rational basis for the finding cannot seriously be questioned.
Indeed, the legislative record here is far more voluminous than the record compiled by Congress and found sufficient in two prior cases upholding Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Commerce Clause challenges. While Congress did not, to my knowledge, calculate aggregate dollar values for the nationwide effects of racial discrimination in 1964, in 1994 it did rely on evidence of the harms caused by domestic violence and sexual assault, citing annual costs of $3 billion in 1990, and $5 to $10 billion in 1993. Equally important, though, gender-based violence in the 1990's was shown to operate in a manner similar to racial discrimination in the 1960's in reducing the mobility of employees and their production and consumption of goods shipped in interstate commerce. Like racial discrimination, "gender-based violence bars its most likely targets -- women -- from full participation in the national economy." . . .
The Violence Against Women Act would have passed muster at any time between Wickard v. Filburn in 1942 and Lopez in 1995, a period in which the law enjoyed a stable understanding that Congressional power under the Commerce Clause, complemented by the authority of the Necessary and Proper Clause, extended to all activity that, when aggregated, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. As already noted, this understanding was secure even against the turmoil at the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in the aftermath of which the court not only reaffirmed the cumulative effects and rational basis features of the substantial effects test . . . but declined to limit the commerce power through a formal distinction between legislation focused on "commerce"and statutes addressing "moral and social wrongs."
The fact that the act does not pass muster before the court today is therefore proof, to a degree that Lopez was not, that the court's nominal adherence to the substantial effects test is merely that. Although a new jurisprudence has not emerged with any distinctness, it is clear that some Congressional conclusions about obviously substantial, cumulative effects on commerce are being assigned lesser values than the once-stable doctrine would assign them. These devaluations are accomplished not by any express repudiation of the substantial effects test or its application through the aggregation of individual conduct, but by supplanting rational basis scrutiny with a new criterion of review.
Thus the elusive heart of the majority's analysis in these cases is its statement that Congress's findings of fact are "weakened" by the presence of a disfavored "method of reasoning." This seems to suggest that the "substantial effects" analysis is not a factual enquiry for Congress in the first instance with subsequent judicial review looking only to the rationality of the Congressional conclusion, but one of a rather different sort, dependent upon a uniquely judicial competence.

Markets, and Jitters, Rise Ahead of Move By the Fed on Rates

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
As Federal Reserve policy makers meet today, investors are wondering more about what comes next than how much the central bank will raise its short-term interest rate target when it announces its decision early this afternoon.
Wall Street is forecasting an increase of half a percentage point in the central bank's federal funds target rate on overnight loans, raising that target to 6.5 percent. Until recently, most analysts had expected a quarter-point move, matching the five increases the Fed has made since June. 
 But, more important, most analysts now think that the Fed will have to move well above 6.5 percent, perhaps this summer, before economic growth is curbed and new inflationary pressures are contained. And if inflation data worsens -- as some signs now indicate -- the outlook may shift to even higher rates.
Investors "are going to see the decision, then immediately thoughts will jump ahead," said Ethan Harris, senior economist at Lehman Brothers. "How much more do we have to go?"
What all this means for the stock market, however, is hard to predict, both immediately and in the near term. Yesterday, equity and bond investors did not seem concerned.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 198.41 points, or 1.9 percent, to 10,807.78, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed 78.59 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,607.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 31.40 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,452.36. But all three indexes are below where they were when the new, disturbing data on inflation began appearing April 27.
In the bond market, prices rose as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. The Treasury's 10-year note rose 15/32 , to 100 14/32 , with its yield falling to 6.44 percent yesterday, from 6.51 percent on Friday. The yield remains well above the 6.13 percent on April 26.
The size of the Fed's rate increase, and the outlook statement it will issue today with the announcement, could have a crucial bearing on the markets. The April report on consumer prices, which is expected to be released this morning ahead of the Fed meeting, could also have a major impact.
If the Consumer Price Index's monthly increase, especially in the core inflation rate that excludes food and energy, is surprisingly big, as it was in March, both the bond and stock markets could have sell-offs. With such a surprise, investors would immediately speculate that interest rates would have to move much higher this year, no matter how aggressive the Fed is today.
However, analysts are forecasting a tame C.P.I., with the core rate up 0.2 percent and the overall rate flat or up just 0.1 percent.
The change in the atmosphere on Wall Street has been almost palpable over the last three weeks. In that time, new employment figures have shown the economy still to be growing briskly, and new data on prices and wage-and-benefit costs have signaled that inflationary pressures are building.
"We got this overpowering private sector demand in conjunction with some real inflation sparks," said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney. "This is not a false alarm," he said of the data pointing to higher inflation rates.
The new data forced him to raise his forecast for the Fed's short-term interest rate target to 7.5 percent by the end of the year, from 6.75 percent. Mr. Harris of Lehman said his firm's forecast was now for a federal funds target of 7.25 percent by August, up from 6.75 percent.
Various indicators of investor sentiment on the Fed also show expectations that rates will move much higher than was thought just a few weeks ago. For example, on April 24, the federal funds futures contract for September indicated that investors expected an average rate of 6.45 percent for September. That average for September has now jumped to 6.93 percent.
Mr. Harris said "it will be hard to find a silver lining" in today's Fed action if, as he expects, the Fed does raise its target by half a percentage point and signals that inflation is still a concern, meaning that more rate increases are in the offing. While Lehman is in the minority, he said there is better than a 50 percent chance the Fed will raise its target another half a percentage point when policy makers meet in the last week of June.
What might soothe the markets some, he said, is the expected increase of half a percentage point and a neutral statement that investors could interpret to mean that Fed policy makers do not think rates have to be pushed much higher. In 1994, the Fed made two increases of half a percentage point each in its interest rate target that came with such neutral outlook statements. Both the bond and stock markets rallied. But Mr. Harris does not expect such a soothing statement this time and in 1994 the Fed ended up pushing rates much higher, despite the reassuring statements.
Mr. DiClemente said that a surprisingly big increase in the core rate of the Consumer Price Index, just a quarter-point rate increase in the Fed's interest rate target or a soothing statement from the Fed about the outlook for inflation could end up troubling investors in the longer term. In all cases, he said it would be possible for investors to begin to worry that the Fed was not acting aggressively enough to curb inflation by slowing economic growth.
If that opinion begins to influence investors, he said, two bad things could happen. First, investors would believe the Fed would have to make bigger-than-expected rate increases later to regain the offensive against inflation. More important, the threat of larger rate increases and falling behind in the fight to curb inflation would make investors fear a "hard landing" for the economy. That is Wall Street jargon for the threat of a recession.
But Mr. DiClemente said if the Fed raised its interest rate target half a percentage point and if the core price figure rose just 0.2 percent, then these might be comforting because investors would not conclude that the Fed was losing the battle. That is what he is predicting.

HEADLINE: Coalition Urges Easing of Immigration Laws

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Jack Kemp, the former Republican candidate for vice president, and Henry G. Cisneros, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, are leading an unusual coalition of conservatives and liberals that is beginning a major campaign to persuade Congress to ease the nation's immigration laws.
Mr. Kemp and Mr. Cisneros are scheduled to announce an initiative today in conjunction with immigrant groups and the nation's Roman Catholic bishops that calls for admitting more immigrants into the United States and granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. 
 The coalition brings together conservatives who view immigrants as an important engine for the economy with religious leaders and immigrant organizations who worry that many hard-working illegal immigrants are consigned to exploitative jobs and lives with little stability.
"What we're seeing is the beginning of a new pro-immigrant alliance that is likely to reshape immigration policy," said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a Washington-based group that supports the easing of restrictions on immigrants.
The coalition includes Americans for Tax Reform, the United States Catholic Conference, the Arab-American Institute, the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium and the National Coalition for Haitian Rights. Another coalition member is the National Retail Federation, one of many business groups that says that with the unemployment rate so low, businesses sorely need immigrant workers to fill their jobs.
"I was at a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce, the truckers organization and other businessmen, and they all said the biggest problem we face is, we're running out of workers," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.
The coalition's statement comes as the presumptive presidential nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, have sought to outmaneuver each other in wooing Hispanic-Americans and other immigrant groups.
For Mr. Kemp, the new effort is consistent with his longtime practice of prodding many Republican leaders to jettison their anti-immigrant proposals.
In a statement to be issued today, the coalition will back a proposal, embraced by President Clinton and the business community, to increase the annual ceiling for the number of immigrants with high-tech skills. But the coalition said Congress should not stop there in changing immigration laws.
The coalition called for granting legal status to more than 300,000 immigrants who fled wars and political chaos in Haiti, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and applied unsuccessfully for refugee status. The coalition said these immigrants should be treated the same as those from Cuba and Nicaragua who have been granted refugee status.
The coalition also backed granting legal status to more than 100,000 other longtime residents who have been in the United States since before 1986.
"It is getting irritating that the only immigration crisis that Congress is prepared to address is the high-tech community's crisis, while there is crisis in many other areas in immigration policy," said Cecilia Munoz, vice president for policy of the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic civil rights group and a signer of the statement.
Last Thursday, President Clinton asked Congress to provide 200,000 visas for high-tech workers in each of the next three years, a major increase from existing law, which limits the number of such visas to 107,500 in 2001.
Mr. Clinton also called for granting legal status to some groups of longtime illegal immigrants, although many lawmakers have balked at that proposal in the past.
K. C. McAlpin, deputy director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which pushes for stricter rules on immigration, opposed the proposals to grant amnesty and increase immigration quotas.
"Our reaction is basically the same as the American people -- every time they're polled they say they want less immigration not more," Mr. McAlpin said. "The American people are adamantly opposed to rewarding people who break our laws to come here illegally."
That view clashed sharply with the one adopted by the Roman Catholic bishops. Kevin Applebee, director of migration and refugee policy for the United States Catholic Conference, said, "The bishops strongly believe that the groups involved have lived in this country for several years, established ties and built equities and thus are deserving an opportunity to remain in our country on a permanent basis."
Officials who helped negotiate the statement said several labor unions with many immigrant members were debating whether to sign. The officials said those unions hesitated for fear of clashing with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has opposed expanding programs that grant visas to high-tech and other skilled workers.

HEADLINE: AstraZeneca to Sell a Genetically Engineered Strain of Rice

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 15

 BODY:
AstraZeneca P.L.C., a giant pharmaceutical company, said today that it would sell a genetically altered strain of "golden rice" in the developed world and also help make the technology freely available to the world's poorest countries.
The London-based company, which announced the agreement here in a news conference with one of the scientists who invented the rice, said it would be made available in three years. The rice, which is fortified with beta carotene that converts to vitamin A, would be given away in the developing world in the hopes of improving the health of undernourished people and curing some forms of blindness. 
 The rice, which has been under development for seven years, has been hailed by the biotechnology industry as a symbol of the promise of agricultural biotechnology, which up until now has largely created an array of crops that benefit farmers by increasing yields.
These crops have led to controversy in Europe and the United States, with many critics saying the crops have not been properly tested, an accusation the industry denies.
The industry hopes that crops like golden rice will be more acceptable to the public, particularly if they serve humanitarian purposes. Scientists said they believed more than 124 million people worldwide suffer from a vitamin A deficiency, and that up to 2 million children die each year in early childhood and another 500,000 become afflicted with an irreversible form of blindness each year because they rely on a rice diet that is deficient in vitamin A.
The scientists, Peter Beyer, a professor at the University of Freiburg in Germany, and Prof. Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich first announced their discovery in January in the journal Science. Today, Mr. Beyer said they had reached a licensing agreement with Zeneca Ag Products, a division of AstraZeneca.
Robert Woods, the president of Zeneca, said the crop had great nutritional benefits. "And if we do the right things in verifying the safety, it will take out the political and emotional issues that have surrounded biotechnology," he said.
Critics say that however noble the effort, they remain concerned about the safety of genetically altered crops, and see the announcement as an effort by the biotechnology industry to put a more favorable spin on those crops. "It's a very laudable goal," said Joseph Mendelson III, a spokesman at the Center for Food Safety in Washington, an environmental advocacy group. "But from our standpoint, genetic engineering has a host of unknown health risks; you can create new toxins and allergens." He said that while the new strain of rice might help cure blindness, it could also create unforeseen health or environmental risks.
The research that led to the golden rice technology was initially financed by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York, which was searching for ways to improve the health of children in developing countries.
Dr. Beyer and Professor Potrykus say they used a biotechnology process to integrate two genes from a daffodil and one from a bacterium in the rice genome to create a new strain of yellowish or golden rice that has high levels of beta carotene, which is the precursor of vitamin A. The scientists assigned their patent and the rights to Greenovation, a company in Freiburg, Germany, which in turn licensed the technology exclusively to Zeneca.
Gary Toenniessen, director of food security at the Rockefeller Foundation, said the organization was pleased by the public-private collaboration. But he said biotechnology was just one tool. "We're not believers that biotechnology is a silver bullet," he said. "But when traditional breeding is not available, genetic engineering can be applied."

HEADLINE: Fire Is Largely Contained in Los Alamos

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: SANTA CLARA PUEBLO, N.M., May 15

 BODY:
The battle to contain the wildfire here has broken down into several diverging fronts, with modest signs of hope in the town of Los Alamos, where most residents were allowed to return today, but growing anger over the fire's threat to ancient Indian dwellings and lands that tribal officials say had initially not been well protected.
A visit today to Santa Clara Canyon, at the northern perimeter of the fire, brought encounters with swirls of thick white smoke, brush fires just yards from the road, occasionally exploding pine trees and nervous teams of firefighters known as hotshots. Some of them conceded that they were able to do little more than hope that blazes along the southern edge of the canyon would not be blasted by the winds toward the invaluable archaeological sites. 
 In the town of Los Alamos, at the southern edge of the wildfire, and at the nuclear weapons laboratory nearby, officials said the fire was largely contained and that about two-thirds of the 11,000 evacuated residents were permitted to return this afternoon, earlier than had been expected.
But officials continue to take stock of the staggering losses, which include 405 housing units and, at the lab site, five dilapidated but historic structures where parts of the original atomic bomb were assembled for the Manhattan Project during World War II.
Just one of the old wooden structures remained: the building where the conventional explosives portion of the first bomb, known as Trinity, was put together. The building where the Trinity bomb was assembled was taken down years ago, said Turnel Martinez, a lab spokesman.
Fire officials said in Los Alamos that while the fire had consumed at least 44,323 acres the pace of destruction has slowed. More important, they said, the fire was 28 percent contained, mostly along its southern and southeastern edges, near the city of Los Alamos.
A total of 1,268 firefighters are now battling the blaze in the forested areas and 250 or so protecting homes and other structures in populated areas, a level that Jim Paxon, a spokesman for the Forest Service, said would probably be the peak.
The fire was set 11 days ago by the National Park Service as a prescribed burn in an effort to thin dense ponderosa pine forests, before high winds helped create a blaze out of control.
Though the news was generally good concerning containment in the south, winds are expected to pick up, and a cold front is predicted for Tuesday.
Many residents have continued to fear possible leaks of radiation from the grounds of the lab, either from structures that might have been damaged by fire, or from old dump sites where, years ago, the lab placed low-level radioactive waste.
Officials at the lab said that no buildings containing radioactive materials had been damaged and that their sensors had detected no radiation leaks. Also, Gregg Dempsey, director of an Environmental Protection Agency unit that monitors radiation, said the government had placed 20 more monitors around the Los Alamos region.
"At this time, we're not seeing any cause for concern for radiological release," said Jim Straka, a Department of Energy official involved in the monitoring.
But to the north, Indian officials expressed concern over what they said was a slow initial response to the fire in their area, and the heavy blow they could suffer if the fire jumped across the Santa Clara canyon on the pueblo, or reservation, northeast of Los Alamos.
The Santa Clara Pueblo covers almost 50,000 acres and has about 1,500 residents. It is also home to spectacular ancient dwellings believed to have been built about 800 years ago into the buff-hued sandstone of the Puye cliffs.
"If we lose that canyon and the creek, we lose quite a bit of our resources," said Denny Gutierrez, the governor of the Santa Clara Pueblo tribal authority.
He said a major source of revenue for the tribe were the fees for permits to hunt, fish and camp in the canyon and for visits to the Puye cliffs. A big concern is that the fire could dump huge amounts of ash into the Santa Clara creek, in the bottom of the canyon, choking it off and making it unusable for irrigation or recreation.
"Economically, that would probably devastate the pueblo," Governor Gutierrez said.
He said that firefighters were now doing an excellent job but that when the fire first burst out of control, they were slow in responding to suggestions to build fire lines on its northern edge, not just in the south near Los Alamos.
"It just sounded to us like this was not a priority," said Charles Sisneros, a tribal council member. "They just wanted to let the fire burn itself out up here. That's not the way we see it. This is our home and we have an obligation to protect it."
Dale Baca, another member of the tribal council, stood in the bottom of the canyon today watching the blaze send up huge plumes of white smoke and brush fires burn to the road, and said he was also angry.
"The indecision was the problem," he said. "We asked them to cut the fire lines on the Forest Service land and they just said they hadn't gotten the permission."
Mr. Paxon of the Forest Service said the firefighters had done all they could. "Our object is to minimize the impact on the Santa Clara Pueblo," he said. "We do take their needs to heart. We feel we have adequate resources there. We didn't delay."
Firefighters said the pueblo lands were now among the most vulnerable, particularly if the wind does whip up as expected. Jerry Soard, a member of a hotshot crew from Carson City, Nev., watched as the fire spread its dark fingers down the canyon and tightened its grip over the heavily wooded Indian land. He expressed some optimism because the fire was moving slowly and removing highly combustible brush that could feed an even fiercer fire if the winds picked up.
"It's doing pretty much what we want it to do at this point," said Mr. Soard. "This is beneficial. It's a real nice backing fire."
Asked if this meant the fire might be brought under control here, another hotshot team member, Chris White, laughed.
"Control? You can't say that," said Mr. White. "Not with these winds. The problem is that when they get into the canyon they get so squirrely. They blow every direction."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CONTEXT;
Challenges to Bedrock of Retirement

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Since it was established in 1935, Social Security has had two fundamental principles. It has been a guaranteed government benefit. And it has been self-financed, paid for out of payroll taxes levied on workers and employers.
In reopening the debate today over how best to maintain the solvency of the retirement system as the population ages, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush each challenged one of those principles. 
 Taking one of the biggest political risks of the presidential campaign so far, Mr. Bush proposed allowing individual workers to invest a part of their payroll taxes through private accounts. His plan would give workers an opportunity to capture some of the riches that Wall Street creates, but would also leave those workers to suffer the financial consequences if their timing or judgment is off.
Mr. Gore wants to maintain the guaranteed nature of the Social Security benefit, allowing it to remain a bulwark against poverty in old age. But through a somewhat complicated mechanism, Mr. Gore is calling for the bill to be paid in part over the long run out of general tax revenues -- in effect, heaving the problem onto the shoulders of taxpayers three decades from now.
Those differing approaches to dealing with the financial problems that threaten to afflict Social Security are at the heart of a longstanding ideological dispute about the relationship between government and individuals.
Like most Democrats, Mr. Gore is comfortable with government as a guarantor and sees Social Security as a collective commitment that binds the generations. Like most Republicans, Mr. Bush is dedicated to giving more power and responsibility to individuals.
A few years ago, President Clinton and the Republican leadership in Congress tried to find some common ground and failed.
In elevating the call for private accounts to the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush is asking for a mandate to break the deadlock. Although Mr. Gore's approach would eventually require a fundamental change in the nature of the system as well, the vice president has cast himself as the defender of a program that has proved to be perhaps the most popular and most effective of any administered in Washington.
It is already clear that the clash between the two candidates will be supercharged, with Mr. Gore in particular unleashing a sustained attack on Mr. Bush's position. And the more heated the clash, the greater the risk that the debate will so polarize voters and unnerve politicians that it blocks progress for years.
"It is a good issue to debate as long as the discussion remains civil," said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now president of the Urban Institute, a research group. "It could easily backfire and lead to a situation where the lesson coming out of this campaign is, 'Don't try and deal forthrightly with the American people on this issue when there isn't an immediate crisis.' "
Polls suggest that voters are split. In a survey conducted last week, The New York Times/CBS News Poll found that 51 percent thought allowing individuals to invest a part of their payroll taxes was a good idea, and 45 percent thought it was a bad one.
Many Democrats and some Republicans wonder why Mr. Bush has chosen to wade into such a polarizing issue. "Politically it's not" a great idea, said Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire who is one of the most prominent advocates of adding private accounts to Social Security.
"But it's a genuine act of leadership," Senator Gregg said, "because if he's successful, he will have broken the iron triangle of demagoguery -- Gore, Gephardt and the labor unions. And he'll have a national mandate to do something in this area." His reference was to Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader.
But both sides also have electoral strategies in mind. For Republicans, putting Social Security on the front burner is an effort to attract what they see as an emerging investor class. More than 50 percent of households now invest in the market directly or indirectly. Many of them have had great success as Wall Street has boomed, and are presumed by Republicans to want greater control over their finances.
Republicans also see private accounts as a way to grab the attention of young voters, who tend to believe that Social Security will not be around when they retire.
Yet Democrats think that in the end the only groups that will be motivated to vote on the basis of the candidates' positions on Social Security will be the elderly and those workers nearing retirement. Those groups have consistently opposed any fundamental changes to Social Security.
"The Bush campaign is betting that young people will end up voting on this issue," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. "But recent history is pretty clear that the people who vote on Social Security tend to be in their 50's and older, and their vote is based on making sure that the system that's protecting their parents is there to protect them."
Mr. Bush is trying to turn attention to the trade-off at the core of Mr. Gore's plan, which is built around eliminating the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public and capturing the interest savings for Social Security.
When all the complexities are stripped away, Mr. Gore's plan would leave the government in financially sound condition -- but would also transfer to future generations of taxpayers the burden of keeping Social Security solvent.
"The Gore plan will eventually require a 25 percent increase in income taxes -- the largest in our history -- or a substantial reduction in benefits," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Gore is trying to keep the debate focused on the risks inherent in investing Social Security money in the financial markets -- and is emphasizing that Mr. Bush's plan would leave less money to pay down the debt. The Bush plan "would weaken our national economy," Mr. Gore said, and create the risk of millions of retirees "left without enough to make ends meet."
Mr. Gore said one thing today that Mr. Bush would no doubt agree with.
"There is a fundamental difference on this issue in this election," Mr. Gore said, "which offers the country the most critical choice on Social Security since it was first enacted in 1935."
 
"BUSH AND GORE PROPOSALS"
 
Different Approaches to Social Security
Social Security faces a financial shortfall as the baby boom generation ages. Based on current estimates, the retirement system would spend its reserves by 2037, leaving it able to pay only 75 percent of promised benefits after that point. To deal with that problem, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are proposing different solutions.
 
THE GORE PLAN
It is built around paying off the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public and using the savings that would have paid the interest on the debt to bolster Social Security.
The vice president would use the portion of the projected federal budget surplus generated by excess Social Security payroll revenues -- or more than $2 trillion over the next decade -- to reduce the federal debt. His plan calculates that the debt could be paid by 2013.
Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would begin transferring to Social Security an amount equal to the interest saved through reduction of the public debt. The amount would start at around $100 billion a year, and would grow to more than $200 billion a year by 2015. By doing so, Mr. Gore's plan would extend Social Security's solvency to 2050 without any cuts in benefits.
The money Mr. Gore would transfer into Social Security would not be cash, but instead i.o.u.'s that would have to be paid out of general tax revenues. In that way, Mr. Gore's plan would obligate taxpayers decades in the future to pay to keep the system afloat out of general revenues from income taxes -- a change from the current system under which Social Security is financed out of payroll taxes.
 
THE BUSH PLAN
Mr. Bush's approach is built around the idea that the only alternative to cutting benefits or raising taxes is to increase the rate of return on the money going into the Social Security system. The best way to accomplish that goal, in his view, is to allow all workers to invest part of their payroll taxes in private accounts.
Mr. Bush has provided few details, saying that the specifics would have to be worked out in bipartisan negotiations. There are a variety of approaches to establishing individual investment accounts, and most would use about 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that goes to pay Social Security benefits.
Any investment plan that used 2 percentage points of the payroll tax would use about $1 trillion of the Social Security surplus over the next decade. That money would otherwise go to debt reduction, so Mr. Bush's plan would leave the nation with a larger debt than Mr. Gore's plan.
Historically, investing in the stock market has yielded a high rate of return, better than 7 percent from 1926 through 1997, according to the Bush campaign. But there have been long periods when the market has been down, and not every investor has chosen the right stocks. Investing in safer alternatives, like bonds, reduces the rate of return along with the risk. And Democrats point out that most workers are already subject to considerable risk through 401(k)'s and other retirement accounts.

HEADLINE: Key Democrat Seems to Lean In Support Of Trade Bill

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
An influential senior House Democrat from New York signaled today that he is leaning in favor of a decisive China trade bill, as the measure's supporters and opponents geared up for a furious week of lobbying before next week's scheduled vote.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a telephone interview that he is still officially undecided on a measure to grant China permanent normal trading privileges. 
 But then Mr. Rangel challenged several of the opponents' main arguments. "I don't understand why labor would make this their litmus test on human rights or give a priority to human rights in China when there are so many problems in the U.S.," he said.
On the question of whether the World Trade Organization could adequately police Chinese trade violations once Beijing joined the international body, as is expected, Mr. Rangel said, "If we have no leverage in the W.T.O., what do we do?"
Organized labor and the Clinton administration have heavily courted Mr. Rangel, in part because they believe he may influence the votes of at least two other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Gregory W. Meeks of New York and Eva M. Clayton of North Carolina.
Mr. Rangel said he still wanted to discuss the measure with fellow Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee before the panel meets on Wednesday to vote on the measure. Approval by the pro-trade committee is considered all but certain.
One factor Mr. Rangel said he is weighing is how the China vote will affect labor's support for Democrats in the November elections. If Democrats reclaim the House, Mr. Rangel would become the committee's first black chairman. "We need labor's enthusiastic support," Mr. Rangel said.
And in a significant lift for the Clinton administration today, the United States International Trade Commission voted to levy punitive anti-dumping duties on apple juice concentrate imports from China. The administration is trying to convince lawmakers that it can regulate trade with China to make sure that American producers are not swamped by Chinese imports produced at prices deemed below cost.
The 5-0 ruling by the trade commission imposes a 52 percent duty on Chinese apple juice concentrate. It backs up a ruling by the Commerce Department, which determined last month that China was selling the juice concentrate in the American market for about half of what it cost to produce.
At the White House today, the spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton will hold individual meetings this week with many of the undecided lawmakers -- about 25 to 30 in both the Democratic and Republican camps -- and step up a campaign that has involved Mr. Clinton, Vice President Gore and Cabinet members who are calling wavering legislators.
Mr. Meeks has already felt the brunt of the lobbying onslaught. The freshman Democrat said he heard Mr. Clinton's most persuasive arguments while he and a handful of other uncommitted lawmakers flew aboard Air Force One last week after the funeral of Cardinal John O'Connor. But labor leaders have also buttonholed Mr. Meeks, whose district includes Kennedy International Airport.
"It's been intense," Mr. Meeks told Reuters. "Any number of labor leaders have called and continue to call, even when I was at Cardinal O'Connor's funeral. There were a few labors who came up to me and said, 'We need your vote. We want to talk to you some more.' "
Many state governors are also turning up the pressure, including the Republican governor of Massachusetts, Paul Cellucci, who is lobbying three undecided House Democrats from his state: Martin T. Meehan, Richard E. Neal and Edward J. Markey.
Ratcheting up pressure from business groups, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday will launch a new radio campaign targeting about 10 undecided and opposed lawmakers.
Opponents also planned a week of rallies and counter-advertising campaigns. Representative John Baldacci, a Maine Democrat, said today he would vote against the measure "absent serious and substantive" parallel legislation that permits Congressional oversight of China's compliance with trade and other international agreements.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Prepared Remarks by Bush and Gore

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the prepared text of Gov. George W. Bush's speech yesterday about Social Security and Medicare, as provided by the Bush campaign. Mr. Bush spoke at a center for the elderly in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. Also included are excerpts from the prepared text of Vice President Al Gore's speech on those issues yesterday at Beaver College in Glenside, Pa.
 
Mr. Bush's Remarks
We are nearing Social Security's greatest test. Eight years from now, the massive baby-boomer generation will begin drawing benefits. Their lives will be long and healthy. And within two decades, there simply won't be enough younger workers to pay the benefits earned by the old. 
 If we do nothing to reform the system, the year 2037 will be the moment of financial collapse. The system will be insolvent, with deficits in the trillions of dollars, requiring either a massive cut in benefits or a massive increase in taxes.
At a time for leadership, for long-term thinking, my opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach. He says, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." But in the lifetime of some people in this room, it will be broke, and we must fix it. With every day of delay this becomes more difficult. For eight years, the Clinton-Gore administration has failed to act. And now Al Gore wants to pass the burden on to future generations. The Gore plan will eventually require either a 25 percent increase in income taxes, the largest in our history, or a substantial reduction in benefits. . . .
First, we must not change Social Security for those now retired, or nearing retirement. Let me put this plainly. For those on Social Security or close to receiving it, nothing will change. Government has made a commitment, and you have made your plans. These promises will be honored. Yet, without reform, younger workers face a great risk -- a lifetime of paying taxes for benefits they may never receive. The reforms I have in mind will actually increase their retirement income.
Second, all Social Security funds in the federal surplus must stay where they belong, dedicated to Social Security. In my economic plan, more than $2 trillion of the federal surplus is locked away for Social Security. For years, politicians in both parties have dipped into the trust fund to pay for more spending. And I will stop it.
Third, the payroll tax must not be raised. We cannot tax our way to reform.
Fourth, reform should include personal retirement accounts for young people, an element of all the major bipartisan plans. The idea works very simply. A young worker can take some portion of his or her payroll tax and put it in a fund that invests in stocks and bonds. We will establish basic standards of safety and soundness, so that investments are only in steady, reliable funds. There will be no fly-by-night speculators or day trading. And money in this account could only be used for retirement, or passed along as an inheritance.
Right now, the real return people get from what they put into Social Security is a dismal 2 percent a year. Over the long term, sound investments yield about a 6 percent return. Investing that 4 percent difference, over a lifetime, can show dramatic results. A worker who invests even a limited portion of his or her paycheck could, over a career, end up with hundreds of thousands of dollars for retirement. . . .
There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and me. He trusts only government to manage our retirement. I trust individual Americans. I trust Americans to make their own decisions and manage their own money.
Let me be clear. Personal accounts are not a substitute for Social Security. They involve only a limited percentage of the payroll tax, so the safety net remains strong. Let me say this again: For those who are retired or near retirement, there will be no changes at all to your Social Security. But we can and must give younger workers the option of new opportunities. . . .
Our nation must reform Medicare, and, in doing so, ensure that prescription drugs are affordable and available for every senior who needs them. As with Social Security, Medicare reform must be guided by clear tenets. . . .
When I am president, I will lead Republicans and Democrats to reform and strengthen Medicare and set it on firm financial ground.
And I make this pledge to seniors: Every senior will have access to prescription drug benefits.
Prescription drugs are becoming the treatment of choice. Drugs are often more cost-effective than surgery or hospitalization, with fewer risks and better results. And the picture gets better year by year. By one estimate, suppliers are now working on more than 600 new medicines to treat the causes of disability among seniors.
But prescription drugs can be expensive. The average senior already pays $450 each year in out-of-pocket drug expenses. Twelve percent of Medicare beneficiaries have drug bills of $1,000 or more. Ninety-eight percent of health plans today offer some form of prescription drug benefit. Yet Medicare does not. And this must change.
 
Mr. Gore's Remarks
Social Security is a solemn compact between the generations. It is a basic guarantee of retirement security, built on a guaranteed minimum benefit. No matter what is happening on Wall Street, no matter how the economy is doing, Social Security is supposed to be there to guarantee a decent retirement for every American.
We know that many people can build up extra retirement savings through private investment and I.R.A.'s. That's important, and I support it. Investing in the stock market is not only good for individual Americans, it's good for America.
But that kind of private investment is meant not to replace Social Security, but to build on the foundation of Social Security. If we turn Social Security into a system of winners and losers, we will be jeopardizing retirement security for too many Americans and, in the end, we will all have to pay to make up the difference.
I've laid out a detailed plan to reform and strengthen Social Security, a plan that is based on fiscal responsibility and debt reduction.
If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I'll balance the federal budget every year, and pay down our national debt every year, putting America on the road to becoming debt-free by the year 2013. That's the only way we can get ready to meet our obligations through Social Security.
Then I'll make sure we use the budget surplus and the money we save from paying down the debt to save Social Security first. I'll devote all the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security trust fund. That way, we can keep Social Security solvent until at least 2050.
There is a fundamental difference on this issue in this election, which offers the country the most critical choice on Social Security since it was first enacted in 1935. Because there is a right way to reform Social Security, and a wrong way.
George W. Bush outlined his approach in a speech this morning. We still don't know all the details of his plan, but we do know that he is proposing to partially privatize Social Security.
Today, when Wall Street is booming, I know that plan sounds appealing. It probably sounds like an easy way to make more money, and have more control over your retirement.
But in reality, the Bush Social Security privatization plan would weaken our national economy and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum decent retirement. It would weaken our economy because it would make it impossible to pay down our national debt. It would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years to meet today's obligations through Social Security while allowing people to set up these individual accounts. And at the same time, Governor Bush is proposing a huge tax cut of nearly $2 trillion.
The numbers just don't add up, and under the Bush plan, a serious reduction of our national debt is simply impossible. . . .
The Bush Social Security privatization plan also threatens the Social Security guarantee for future generations of retirees. That guarantee is the whole purpose of Social Security. Yet under the Bush plan, you could lose some or all of the money you invest, and millions could be left without enough to make ends meet.
Today, in The Dallas Morning News, Governor Bush was asked whether his plan would guarantee that future beneficiaries would receive no less than they would have under today's system. His answer, "Maybe, maybe not."
In other words, Governor Bush admits that his plan takes the "security" out of Social Security. Well, I believe you deserve a guarantee, not a "maybe."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PIVOTAL ISSUES;
Bush Presents Social Security As Crucial Test

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL with JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: RANCHO CUCAMONGA, Calif., May 15

 BODY:
Casting the overhaul of the Social Security system as a "test of presidential candidates," Gov. George W. Bush today proposed a fundamental change in the retirement system that would allow workers to choose how to invest some of their payroll taxes.
With his formal call for the introduction of individual retirement accounts, Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, began a debate that could dominate the campaign. He and Vice President Al Gore differ sharply over how to meet the fiscal challenge posed by the retirement of baby boomers. 
 Although Social Security has long been considered the "third rail" of politics that a candidate touches at his peril, Mr. Bush took a gamble that in the new economy, with nearly 50 percent of American households now owning stock, his proposal would prove appealing.
"There is a fundamental difference between my opponent and me," Mr. Bush said in an appearance at a center for the elderly here. "He trusts the government to manage our retirement. I trust individual Americans." Excerpts, Page A18.
"I trust Americans to make their own decisions and manage their own money," he said.
Mr. Bush also embraced a bipartisan proposal for Medicare that would reshape it by giving beneficiaries fixed amounts of money to choose from various health plans.
A few hours later outside Philadelphia, Mr. Gore came out squarely against the plan, calling it dangerous for individual taxpayers and for the economy overall. "If we turn the Social Security system into a system of winners and losers," he said, "we will be jeopardizing retirement security for too many Americans, and in the end we will all have to pay to make up the differences."
The sharp debate comes at a time when demographic changes will soon threaten the solvency of Social Security. The retirement system will start paying out more in benefits than it is taking in in payroll taxes starting in 2015 because of the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Under current projections, by 2037 it will be able to pay out only 75 percent in benefits.
Shifting some of the payroll tax into individual retirement accounts would amount to the most far-reaching change in Social Security since its inception in the Depression. As Social Security has worked for decades, current retirees are paid from the payroll taxes of current workers; under the Bush plan, workers would be able to use a portion of their payroll taxes and invest them for their own retirement.
Mr. Bush argued that it would both provide an infusion of cash to make the system solvent and give people "the security of ownership."
But he largely skirted specifics, preferring to talk about broad principles. It was unclear, for instance, exactly how much money people could set aside for individual accounts and what sort of investment options they would have. Mr. Bush did say the investments would have to be in "steady, reliable funds," adding that "there will be no fly-by-night speculators or day trading."
He also pledged that benefits would not change for current retirees and those who are near retirement. He said he would dedicate the entire $2 trillion Social Security surplus to the retirement program. He ruled out any increase in payroll taxes, but was silent on whether to raise the retirement age.
Much of the Texas Republican's address was devoted to drawing a contrast between himself and Vice President Gore, casting himself as a leader who would pave the way for a bipartisan agreement on a pressing policy matter.
"I am here with a message for America and to put my opponent on notice," Mr. Bush said. "The days of spreading fear and panic are over. The days of delaying, dividing, demagoguing are over. When I am elected, this generation and this president will solve Social Security."
He said that President Clinton and Mr. Gore had squandered eight years when they could have addressed the problems posed by the baby boomers. "At a time for leadership, for long-term thinking, my opponent proposes a Band-Aid approach," Mr. Bush said. "He says and I quote, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' But in the lifetime of some people in this room, it will be broke and we must fix it. With every day of delay this becomes more difficult."
Mr. Gore has in large part staked his candidacy on the health of the economy and made paying down the debt the centerpiece of his economic plan. He has proposed extending the life of Social Security until 2054 by devoting the interest saved in paying down the debt to the retirement system.
Mr. Gore, in his own appearance, asked what would happen to investments if economic prosperity abated. "Today, when Wall Street is booming, I know that plan sounds appealing," he said. "It probably sounds like an easy way to make more money and have more control over your retirement. But in reality, the Bush privatization plan would weaken our economy and undermine the basic guarantee of a minimum basic retirement."
Asked later about his lack of detail, Mr. Bush called his speech "pretty darned detailed to be talking about a framework to get something done." His aides said he had avoided specifics because Hillary Rodham Clinton's abortive effort to craft a plan for universal health coverage had shown that being locked into one plan was a recipe for legislative disaster on a complicated issue.
But the lack of specifics on matters like what percentage of payroll tax would go to accounts and what age group would see the change opened Mr. Bush to charges that he was masking some of the hard choices ahead and trying to sidestep questions about how he could afford the transition as well as his sweeping call for a $1.3 trillion tax cut in the next decade.
The costs of making the transition to such a system would be significant -- as much as $1 trillion -- because the government could have to pay out full benefits to current retirees at the same time that some amount of payroll taxes were being diverted into individual accounts.
Supporters of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore feuded all day over which plan was more risky and which would entail more of a shift of general tax revenue into Social Security. Such a shift would require cuts in other programs or could lead to tax increases.
The vice president asserted that Mr. Bush's plan would make it nearly impossible to pay down the national debt. "By leaving us with a multitrillion dollar debt for as far as the eye can see, the Bush plan could trigger higher interest rates and slower long-term growth," Mr. Gore said. "That undermines our chance to meet other challenges, such as keeping Medicare solvent or providing an affordable prescription drug benefit for seniors."
Mr. Gore has been lagging in recent polls and his advisers said privately they were pleased that Mr. Bush had taken on Social Security because it set up a clear policy difference between the candidates and provided a big target to shoot at, much like former Senator Bill Bradley's universal health care plan in the Democratic primaries.
Indeed, Mr. Gore intends to talk about Social Security two more times this week, before younger voters at Fordham University in New York on Tuesday and before older voters in Florida on Wednesday.
In the past few years an array of Republicans and Democrats have proposed Social Security overhaul plans that include an element of private accounts. But the ideas have all died because of sharp ideological differences, distrust between the parties and fear of alienating the elderly, who are a reliable voting bloc.
Mr. Bush's advisers, however, believe that the politics of Social Security is changing and that their plan will appeal to younger voters who are comfortable with the market and doubt that the government will provide a secure retirement.
Generally the plans would allow 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax to be put into individual accounts. But the programs differ quite significantly in the details.
Because of the economic complexities involved, a number of them also call for benefit reductions like raising the retirement age or scaling back cost of living increases. And under one plan workers would have to return their accounts to the government when they retired and then receive a fixed monthly sum back.
Today, Mr. Bush also expressed support for an approach to Medicare that had been drafted by a bipartisan commission, which would have converted Medicare into an arena for public and private competition. The approach would have given each beneficiary a fixed amount of cash to use when choosing from public and private health care plans.
Mr. Bush said the elderly should be given a choice of health plans to buy, including one providing prescription drug coverage. He said Medicare itself should provide full drug coverage for the most low-income elderly.

HEADLINE: THE SUPREME COURT: THE COURT ON FEDERALISM;
WOMEN LOSE RIGHT TO SUE ATTACKERS IN FEDERAL COURT

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Declaring that "the Constitution requires a distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local," the Supreme Court today invalidated a six-year-old provision of federal law that permitted victims of rape, domestic violence and other crimes "motivated by gender" to sue their attackers in federal court.
The 5-to-4 decision, striking down the civil remedy provision of the Violence Against Women Act, was the latest application of the court's newly restrictive view of Congressional power and of the degree of deference that Congress is owed by federal courts. Although one of the most sweeping of the justices' decisions in this area recently, it will almost certainly not be the last. 
 Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's majority opinion rejected each of the two sources of constitutional authority that Congress had asserted as the basis for the legislation. The majority concluded that the civil remedy provision was neither a valid regulation of interstate commerce nor a proper means of enforcing the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment. Excerpts, Page A20.
The decision affirmed a ruling last year by the federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., dismissing a suit brought by a college student against two varsity football players whom she accused of raping her in her dormitory room shortly after the start of her freshman year.
The plaintiff, Christy Brzonkala, withdrew from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and brought her suit after learning that the football players, Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, would not be disciplined by the college. When the defendants then challenged the constitutionality of the Violence Against Women Act, the federal government intervened in the suit to defend the law.
The law's supporters argued that widespread violence against women, and fear of violence, had a negative effect on the nation's economy, measured in the billions of dollars a year, by impairing the productivity and the mobility of female employees and students. To accept that reasoning, the chief justice said today, "would allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit or consumption." But a general police power is something "which the founders denied the national government and reposed in the states," he added.
The Violence Against Women Act also has a criminal provision, making it a federal crime to cross state lines to engage in domestic violence or stalking. The Supreme Court last year refused to hear a challenge to that provision, which was not at issue in the case today but which the chief justice suggested in a footnote was constitutional because of the explicit requirement of interstate conduct. The law also provides federal money to the states for programs to prevent violence and assist victims.
Much of the attention and debate surrounding the law has focused on the civil damages provision at issue today, which the lower courts have applied some 50 times, a number that would probably have been larger had the law not been under a constitutional cloud. While most states have laws permitting people, including victims of sexual assaults, to seek damages against their attackers, Congress acted after dozens of studies showed that women seeking such relief faced considerable obstacles from state judicial systems that regarded sex offenses as unworthy of serious attention.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the chief Senate sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act, said at a news conference today that "this decision is really all about power: who has the power, the court or Congress?"
Senator Biden, a Democrat from Delaware, said there had been notable improvement in the states since Congress put the issue on its agenda in the early 1990's. He predicted that the decision today "will have a lot less impact on violence against women than on the future role of the United States Congress," adding, "The damage done to the act is not as bad as the damage done to American jurisprudence."
Both Senator Biden and Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who was the law's chief sponsor when he represented Brooklyn in the House of Representatives, said years of hearings before the legislation was passed had been aimed at compiling a record of the scope of the problem, to persuade the Supreme Court that a national solution was warranted.
"Just at a time when the economic and social conditions of the world demand that we be treated as one country and not as 50 states, the Supreme Court seems poised to undo decades and decades of a consensus that the federal government has an active role to play," Senator Schumer said in an interview.
In a dissenting opinion today, Justice David H. Souter included three pages of the findings from various Congressional reports, and predicted that the majority's "new judicially derived federalism" would eventually prove as serious a wrong turn for the court as the decisions of the 1930's that, in rejecting elements of the New Deal, provoked the court-packing crisis of 1937. Referring to that episode's "pedigree of near-tragedy," Justice Souter said that "today's decision can only be seen as a step toward recapturing the prior mistakes."
The justices' 5-to-4 division was familiar from a series of decisions over the last five years that have struck down federal laws or created new state immunities from the application of federal law. Beginning with its ruling in United States v. Lopez in 1995, which overturned a law against carrying a gun near a school and marked the first time since the New Deal that the court had invalidated a law as exceeding the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, the court has also struck down part of the Brady gun control law and laws making states liable to suit in federal court for patent and trademark violations. Earlier this year, the court ruled that states could not be sued by their employees for violating the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
Joining Chief Justice Rehnquist in the majority today, as in all the other decisions, were Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. Justice Thomas wrote a brief concurring opinion to say that the court should have put Congress under an even tighter rein. Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion and also signed Justice Souter's dissent, as did Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Although the tone of the opinions today, totaling 71 pages, was quite muted, the gulf between the two factions of the court is wide and growing wider. The court has already granted review in three more federalism cases, and the decision today, United States v. Morrison, No. 99-5, is likely to inspire more challenges to the reliance of Congress on its authority to regulate interstate commerce. Federal environmental regulations that restrict the use of private property might present an inviting target for such a challenge, some students of these recent developments believe.
Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion today reiterated that the "economic nature of the regulated activity" was at the heart of any analysis of Congress's exercise of its commerce authority. "Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity," he said.
The opinion stopped short of adopting a categorical rule that Congress can never do what it claimed to do in this law: address the aggregate economic effect of activity that itself may not be inherently economic. But the chief justice noted pointedly that the court had never endorsed such an approach. In any event, he said, the court is and will remain "the ultimate expositor of the constitutional text."
In his dissenting opinion, Justice Souter said that when it came to "supposed conflicts of sovereign political interests implicated by the Commerce Clause," the court should step back and let the political system work out the problem. Noting that 36 states had filed briefs supporting the law, he said it was "not the least irony" of the case that "the states will be forced to enjoy the new federalism whether they want it or not."
Chief Justice Rehnquist said the provision could not be sustained under the 14th Amendment because that amendment prohibits discrimination by states or "state actors" rather than the private individuals whose conduct is the target of this law.
Kathryn J. Rodgers, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which represented Ms. Brzonkala (pronounced brahn-KAH-lah), criticized the decision, saying it took "the federal government out of the business of defining civil rights and creating remedies."
Michael E. Rosman, general counsel of the Center for Individual Rights, which challenged the law on behalf of the defendants, said the decision was a welcome reminder that "democratic majorities are limited by the text of the Constitution."
"This was an effort by Congress to aggrandize its authority," Mr. Rosman added, "and the court is now requiring Congress to toe the constitutional line."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Complete And Utter Nonsense

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN; Gail Collins is on vacation.

 BODY:
During a visit to Shanghai last year my Times colleague Seth Faison and I interviewed the top managers of one of China's largest food companies, which had been partially privatized. While Seth interviewed the Chinese executives in Chinese, I leafed through the company's annual report. On the first page there were four pictures: the chairman, the vice chairman, the general manager and "the Communist Party representative" to the company. At one point I interrupted Seth's interview, pointed to the picture of the Communist Party rep and asked our Chinese hosts: "Say, what does this guy do?" They waved at the picture with disdain, as if to say: "He doesn't do anything. Just ignore him."
That encounter always stuck in my mind because it illustrated one of the political implications of the rise of the private, free-market economy in China. When managers and workers, students and intellectuals are no longer totally dependent on the state or the Communist Party for jobs, they are much more likely to speak their own mind and act on their own interests. That is a fact worth remembering as the U.S. Congress now debates whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations with America. 
 To be sure, the claims by some Clintonites or business types that trade will lead inexorably to democracy in China are exaggerated and too deterministic. But even more ridiculous is the claim by John Sweeney, head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., that "there is no information showing that China is improving its human rights situation or workers rights situation," and thus no reason to support permanent normalized trade ties with China.
As any regular visitor to China can see (unfortunately the U.S. unions have been discouraging members of Congress from visiting China and seeing for themselves), there is ample evidence that the strengthening of private enterprises and free markets in China, and the surge in Internet usage there, is creating the space and private incomes for more Chinese to live independent of the government and thereby expand their personal freedoms. And the more Chinese can live without the state, the more the democrats among them can afford to speak their minds and the more other Chinese can afford to listen.
Read Elisabeth Rosenthal's May 8 front-page piece from Beijing in this newspaper. It details the messy reality of today's China, where the leadership, terrified about the political fallout from China's joining the World Trade Organization, is cracking down -- and will continue to do so -- at the same time that Chinese liberals are becoming more self-confident and willing to challenge the state.
"In the China of today," writes Ms. Rosenthal, a Times Beijing reporter, "threats from the central authorities have diminished influence. Bookstores are still filled with provocative books. And people fired from government institutes can now often find a way to make a living in the expanding private sector. . . . Even as Chinese intellectuals bemoan the current climate, they feel more inconvenienced than terrified by the government's wrath. 'The methods are pretty much the same as in Deng Xiaoping's and even Mao's time,' a professor said. 'What's different is that nobody pays attention anymore. . . . Intellectuals don't feel that much pressure.' "
Ms. Rosenthal also notes that several recent devastating critiques of China's rulers, and disclosures about corruption in the Communist Party, have been circulated first on the Internet in China, and the Chinese leadership has been powerless to stop it. The China trade pact Congress is currently debating greatly enhances the ability of U.S. companies to invest in Internet development in China.
The truth is the A.F.L.-C.I.O. couldn't care less about political change in China. That is just a cover for their head-in-the-sand protectionism. China could become a democratic paradise tomorrow and Mr. Sweeney and his union would still oppose this trade bill, because they see it (wrongly) as just a vehicle to move U.S. manufacturing jobs to China.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is free to argue that this bill will hurt U.S. workers. Republican hard-liners are free to argue that China's entry into the W.T.O. will make it a more formidable geopolitical rival to the U.S. But for either of them to say that this bill will hurt the cause of democratization in China, or that it won't help create more islands from which Chinese democrats can operate and more tools by which they can communicate, is to speak utter nonsense, and, one hopes, a majority of Congress will see it as such.

HEADLINE: Rodman Rockefeller, 68, Dies; Active in Latin Trade Efforts

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Rodman C. Rockefeller, the eldest son of Nelson A. Rockefeller, who was active in efforts that led to the North American Free Trade Agreement and in forging closer ties between the United States and Latin America, died on Sunday night at his home on the East Side of Manhattan. He was 68 and also had a home in the Pocantico Hills section of Tarrytown, N.Y.
The cause was cancer, said Fraser P. Seitel, a spokesman for the Rockefeller family. 
 Mr. Rockefeller was the longtime chairman of Pocantico Associates, a private venture capital and real estate investment concern. He was also long active in Rockefeller family affairs.
Nelson Rockefeller was President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs during World War II, and Rodman's first journey to Mexico was as a teenager with his father in 1946, when President Miguel Aleman was inaugurated. Nelson Rockefeller went on to become governor of New York and vice president of the United States.
From the late 1960's into the 1990's, Rodman strove to spur trade with Mexico and other countries in Latin America and worked for the liberalization of foreign investment there.
During that period, he became a high executive of the International Basic Economy Corporation and co-chairman of the Mexico-United States Business Committee, an organization focusing on economic and political issues of interest to both nations' business communities. The passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the mid-1990's has been called the culmination of his and the committee's efforts.
Mr. Rockefeller was president from 1968 to 1972 and chief executive from 1972 to 1980 of International Basic Economy, a commercial genetics and agribusiness concern based in New York. Its activities, all in Latin America, included developing corn production there and building thousands of low-cost homes in three places in Mexico.
He was also chairman of IBEC Inc. a successor concern, from 1980 to 1985, and of Arbor Acres Farm, based in Glastonbury, Conn., a seller of genetic material for poultry stock, for some years.
In a 1988 interview, he said, "Our chickens are the grandparents of the ones you eat."
He was on the board of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund for nine years. For many years, he was a trustee of Rockefeller Financial Services, which in effect manages the family's office, its investment company and its foundations.
He was the head of the finance committee of Rockefeller Financial Services for years and was a longtime trustee of Rockefeller Financial's holding company, Rockefeller & Company.
He was also a trustee of the Institute of International Education, a nonprofit organization that works for international student exchanges and manages many such programs.
He was recently active in the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, of which he was a trustee. Its programs include the restoration of Jefferson's estate, Monticello, in which Mr. Rockefeller was particularly interested.
The honors he received included a high Mexican decoration, the Order of the Aztec Eagle.
He was also a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, the Americas Society and the New York Blood Center.
A native New Yorker, Rodman Clark Rockefeller was the son of Nelson Rockefeller and his first wife, the former Mary Todhunter Clark. He recalled years later that he and his siblings "called my father Dad, and later on we called him Chief," adding that "he was very enthusiastic, exciting, outgoing, very much of a family leader."
Rodman graduated from Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Mass., and received a bachelor's degree in international economics in 1954 from Dartmouth College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received a master's degree in 1957 from Columbia's Graduate School of Business Administration. He was in the Army from 1954 to 1956.
As a young man, he recalled years later, it never occurred to him not to work despite the family's fortune. "It would have been boring just to go to the country club," he said.
He married Barbara Ann Olsen, a graduate of Wellesley College, in 1953. They were divorced in 1979.
He is survived by his wife, the former Alexandra von Metzler, known as Sascha, an interior designer and graduate of the Parsons School of Design, whom he married in 1980. He is also survived by four children from his first marriage: a daughter, Meile Louise Rockefeller of Manhattan; three sons, Peter, Stuart and Michael, all of Manhattan; and five grandchildren.
A private burial and a memorial service are to be held on June 1.

HEADLINE: Who Lives Here? Who's Asking?;
In a Black Community, Official Mistrust Hinders Census

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW 

 BODY:
When Millicent Gillespie pulled the 38-page Census 2000 form out of her mailbox, on 171st Street in Jamaica, Queens, she tossed it in the trash.
First of all, the questionnaire, which arrived in March, was too long -- like a book, she said -- and the questions struck her as too personal and, in a few instances, simply ridiculous. 
 But there was more to Mrs. Gillespie's reluctance to fill out the form and mail it back: she has no faith in the government. And when she explained her reasoning, Mrs. Gillespie, a special education teacher at a nearby school, repeated the views of many of her neighbors in Census Tract 414, a quarter-mile slice of southeastern Queens.
The middle-class neighborhood of 3,800 people, 89 percent of them black, borders affluent St. Albans but is not far from dirt-poor pockets of Jamaica, with some of the borough's fanciest and most downtrodden blocks just around the corner.
A lot has changed in Tract 414 since the 1990 census. Renovated duplexes and newly constructed homes and churches are visible now on almost every block, on the same streets that at the end of the 1980's were lined with burned-out buildings or abandoned homes and swarming with drug dealers.
Another big change in the neighborhood was participation in the census, which plunged in Tract 414 to 33 percent of households mailing in their forms this year from 46 percent in 1990, according to a New York Times analysis of 2000 census data collected so far. Low responses to the 2000 census in tracts like 414 helped drag down the citywide response in black neighborhoods to under 40 percent, the analysis showed, a decline of five percentage points over 1990, which is a sharp drop in the census-taking world.
The low response rate in black neighborhoods appeared to be well below this year's response among other races, both nationally and in New York City and State. Only one other city, Baltimore, saw such a notable decline in the response among black residents, according to census officials, who were mulling over preliminary census data last week and said they could not yet give an explanation for the decline in Baltimore.
Census officials say they were puzzled by results from New York City's black population, which were calculated by analyzing the initial response rates from largely black neighborhoods. Late last month they reported significantly higher responses this year from largely black cities like Detroit and Oakland, Calif., and, on average, no decline among blacks elsewhere in New York State or across the country. An unusually high response among minority members, particularly Hispanics, helped lift the national response rate to about 66 percent, exceeding the bureau's expectations after dramatic declines that began with the 1980 count, officials said.
"It'll be studied for the next 10 years," Steve Jost, the United States Census Bureau's associate director for communications, said of the low black response rate in New York City. "It's way too early to try and diagnose."
But inside Tract 414, there was little mystery about the low response there. Resident after resident, from pastors to postal workers, described a deep sense of mistrust and suspicion of the government, even among those employed in the public sector.
The mistrust of the government drew no distinction between local, state and federal agencies, though residents say their suspicions have worsened in recent years because of several high-profile police brutality cases in New York City.
"There's a combination of mistrust and the feeling that we're not going to get counted anyway," said the Rev. Samuel L. Zimmerman Jr., associate pastor of St. Paul Baptist Church of Jamaica on 171st Street, who has rented an apartment near the church since 1992.
For many neighborhood residents, who are concerned about giving information to government agencies, all levels of government are "clumped in the same basket," Mr. Zimmerman said, and the most visible arm of the government to the people of Tract 414, once a high-crime area, is the Police Department.
"The fact that the Census Bureau has said that this information is confidential probably carries less credibility when they see other institutions that don't necessarily honor that," Mr. Zimmerman said during an interview in his one-room church, a converted house that has served as a church for 23 years. "For example, the Police Department is to protect and serve, but there is some prominent evidence that it would seem to be otherwise."
Mr. Zimmerman, who said he mailed in his census form immediately because he believes the neighborhood needs federal aid that is doled out based on population figures, read announcements from the Census Bureau during church services every Sunday in April, as did other neighborhood clerics, urging residents to fill out and return the forms. But Mr. Zimmerman said the response from his 45-member congregation was, at best, lukewarm, and, more often, dismissive.
But the reluctance to send in questionnaires has not stopped many residents of the neighborhood from taking advantage of job opportunities with the Census Bureau, and several said they had applied for jobs doing door-to-door surveying. The jobs, which require passing an exam, pay $18.50 per hour in New York City.
Census workers, living both inside and outside the neighborhood, said they were encountering much resistance in Tract 414.
"They don't believe that the census is being taken for the good of the community," said Joyce Sweeting, a census taker working in Tract 414 and a resident of another neighborhood of Jamaica, who began knocking on doors on April 26. "I'm having trouble. They believe it's just a sly way for the government to get into their business."
A census taker eventually persuaded Mrs. Gillespie to fill out a two-page questionnaire -- the long form she had received in the mail was sent to one-sixth of the nation's households -- but it was a hard sell.
Mrs. Gillespie, 59, and several of her neighbors said their unwillingness to respond stemmed from the feeling that the people of the neighborhood had lifted themselves to middle-class status. (The median income in Tract 414 has risen gradually since 1990 to $45,000.) And the residents had turned around the area from a place that was literally tumbling down after the crack epidemic of the 1980's. When they needed help, they said, the government gave them none. So it is now difficult to see the point of getting counted to receive government assistance, they said.
"Slowly, this place is coming along," said Mrs. Gillespie, who moved to 171st Street with her husband, James, a supervisor with the city's Department of Transportation, 11 years ago from a nearby section of Jamaica. "But my thing is that in 11 years in other neighborhoods, it would have all been done by now. In better neighborhoods. If you want to put it bluntly, in white neighborhoods."
Mrs. Gillespie said that her block, 171st Street, between 107th and 108th Avenues, was "torn up with potholes," when she moved there, and that the street remained so bad that no one could drive down it for another five years. She said that she and her neighbors got no action after making dozens of calls to city officials and politicians.
Finally, Mrs. Gillespie said, a friend of hers who also worked for the Transportation Department called someone she knew in the Giuliani administration, and the street was paved within a few weeks.
"We spent years just to get a decent street to park our cars and have people on the street," Mrs. Gillespie said. "Most of the people here have put down their own sidewalks. They didn't put down a sidewalk for us. We have what the people put down, but we don't have one from the city."
Mr. Zimmerman and others, noting the strong response to Census 2000 in places like Detroit, where Mayor Dennis Archer began an all-hands effort to get that city's population of 970,000 over the 1 million mark, said another cause of the low black response in New York may be a lack of effort on the city's part to get the word out to the black community.
Comparing the census to voting, which has historically drawn low turnout from black constituents, Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, director of the Social Justice Center at Pace University's law school, said, "We haven't got the habit yet, and it works against our own interest.
"There is a cycle of distrust at work here, but also maybe you have to help people out," said Professor Scott-McLaughlin, a resident of Jamaica Estates, north of Tract 414. "It seems like other cities did something about it, and now we're going to say there's an undercount again. Surprise, surprise, that's like saying there's gambling at Rick's," he said, referring to the scene of most of the action in the movie "Casablanca."
City officials said that while they had not seen a racial breakdown of the census response, they had talked to elected officials and others from neighborhoods with historically low response rates and concluded that not much had changed since 1990. The overall 2000 census response rate for the city, 53 percent, was equal to the 1990 response.
"We went out with a full-press" effort, said Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington, who oversaw what he described as a two-year effort costing the city several million dollars to persuade New Yorkers to respond to the census. This included, he said, an advertising campaign that put 8,000 posters on subways, buses and garbage trucks and notices in residents' utility bills.
"But you know we are faced with a problem, and this is from California to New York," Mr. Washington said. "Why is it that within the African-American community people are suspect of these forms? There's a systemic problem, and I don't know what the answer may be."
Some residents of Tract 414, like James Terrell, 35, who now owns the house he grew up in on 171st Street, a few doors from Mrs. Gillespie, gave another reason for suspicions about the forms.
Mr. Terrell said that he and several of his neighbors were afraid that giving too much information to the government, like a Social Security number or details about their jobs, would somehow jeopardize their newfound economic security, some of it pieced together with earnings from second and third jobs that are off the books.
"In a lot of poor neighborhoods, people don't have anything to lose," said Mr. Terrell, who works at a nearby auto shop and also installs car stereos on the side. "But here, I figure you have more to lose. I think that a lot of black people don't trust the American government. They feel that if I tell them all about myself, then all I'm doing is digging a bigger hole for myself. Maybe some people feel like they're getting away with something, let's just say. And this is the first time they've really had money to get out of a jam, you know."
As he was leaving for work, Mr. Terrell added, "People finally have something now, and they don't want to lose it."

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE;
Nike's Power Game

BYLINE: By Sarah Edith Jacobson; Sarah Jacobson, a senior at the University of Oregon, is active in United Students Against Sweatshops.

DATELINE: EUGENE, Ore.

 BODY:
When Phil Knight, the chief executive of Nike, withdrew a promised $30 million donation to the University of Oregon last month, his announcement had the tone of an angry parent. He chastised the university for joining the Worker Rights Consortium, a group that monitors conditions in factories that make clothing with college logos. He accused the university of "inserting itself into the new global economy where I make my living" and doing so "on the wrong side, fumbling a teachable moment."
Mr. Knight, an Oregon graduate, was angry that the university had joined this consortium rather than the Fair Labor Association, a group that includes as members the same industries that have profited from sweatshop conditions in their production plants. The Worker Rights Consortium is based on the premise that work conditions will not be changed by codes and monitors that come from industry, but by involvement of workers, through collective bargaining with management. 
 In joining the consortium, the University of Oregon pledged to use its influence to improve conditions at factories producing clothes with the university logo. Mr. Knight, accusing his alma mater of shredding its "bonds of trust" with him, seemed offended that it had not asked his permission.
The university's decision was not made lightly. In March, a referendum sponsored by the student government yielded a three-fourths majority vote in support of membership. A committee accountable to the the university president, David B. Frohnmayer, and made up of students, faculty, administrators and alumni, voted unanimously the same month in favor of joining. Then the University Senate, composed of faculty and students, passed a resolution calling for membership. It was only after all these steps that President Frohnmayer signed the university into membership.
Mr. Knight's punitive reaction really questions the autonomy of the university itself. If the voice of one alumnus held more weight than a year of university-wide deliberation, what role would there be for shared governance on campus? If donations from corporate America depended on toeing a corporate line, the university would be better off without the money.
The goal of students across the country who are organizing around sweatshop issues is to create widespread change in an industry where insufficient wages and mandatory overtime are common. In many third world and American apparel factories, there have been reports of intimidation of workers who try to speak out. And because it is easy for these factories to cut and run, vanishing across national borders and abandoning workers, many people are hesitant to organize unions or demand a living wage.
The Worker Rights Consortium and the student anti-sweatshop campaign challenge companies like Nike not only to let the public know the conditions in apparel factories, but to begin long-term change.
Will the debate about sweatshop conditions move beyond the specifics of monitoring and toward establishing the right to organize? Phil Knight's withdrawal of money from the University of Oregon sends the signal that his company is resisting a move in that direction.

HEADLINE: Good Propaganda, Bad Economics

BYLINE: By Jaime Sneider; Jaime Sneider is editorial page editor of The Columbia Daily Spectator.

 BODY:
College students continue to propagate the myth that Nike and other apparel companies contract out to foreign "sweatshops" where overworked and underpaid workers toil in unhealthful conditions. They are especially outraged by the recent decision by Phil Knight of Nike to withdraw a promised $30 million donation to the University of Oregon in protest of the school's decision to join the Worker Rights Consortium, a labor rights group.
Rather than condemn Mr. Knight, students should commend him. 
 The Worker Rights Consortium, which was established last fall by students, unions and human rights groups, accuses Nike of failing to pay its workers a "living wage," ignoring safety concerns, and forcing employees to work overtime. But, comparatively speaking, conditions at third world factories where Nike goods are made are remarkably benevolent. For example, a number of the plants have air conditioning in countries where it is a rarity. Some factories also have clinics that can be used by employees' families, who otherwise would have little if any medical care. Several others even have schools where workers' children can learn everything from reading and writing to biology and physics.
A typical worker in a Nike factory in Vietnam makes about $564 a year, which may not seem like much, but is more than twice the country's average annual income. The employee turnover rate in Nike's factories in Indonesia is consistently below 2 percent, low even by American standards. Such loyalty suggests that workers do not have better prospects.
Many statistics cited by student activists are misleading and originate with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which has endorsed the Worker Rights Consortium. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has a direct economic interest: the regulations advocated by the consortium would increase American companies' foreign manufacturing costs, thus encouraging them to abandon their operations abroad and manufacture products domestically instead -- employing union labor.
Phil Knight has agreed to an open monitoring of Nike factories through the Fair Labor Association, a group composed of consumer groups, corporations and universities that has been endorsed by the White House. Nike has said that many students have genuine concerns about working conditions abroad, and that the company recognizes that there is always room for improvement.
But, according to a Nike spokeswoman, "the way to get true reform is to have all the players at the table." The Worker Rights Consortium, on the other hand, has not prescribed clear goals or monitoring procedures, and does not yet have legal status as a nonprofit organization. It has been reluctant to include companies like Nike in the dialogue, claiming that corporate participation of any kind threatens workers' rights.
While many students uncritically believe the Worker Rights Consortium, they ignore the fact that Phil Knight and Nike have championed the well-being of workers internationally. By trying to punish Nike, these students threaten to impoverish the workers they claim to protect.

HEADLINE: Closing the Achievement Gap

 BODY:
Over the last five years, the New York State Board of Regents has enacted a series of public school reforms that have placed the state in the lead of the national movement for standards and accountability. At the same time, however, local educators and politicians who claim to want reform have sometimes reacted with skepticism and resistance when confronted with the discomfort that comes with change. Defenders of the status quo whipped up a fuss, for example, when the Regents raised graduation standards across the state, demanded a tougher curriculum and began to issue "report cards" that exposed as mediocre schools that many citizens thought were excellent.
A similar backlash has emerged since the Regents announced that they will soon begin reporting student performance by income and race, to focus attention on the achievement gap that often exists between rich and poor and between white and minority students within the same school. Critics say that holding districts accountable for closing the achievement gap is onerous and unfair, some of them suggesting that nothing can be done. But national studies indicate that the gap can indeed be closed and that disaggregating data by race and income is a crucial first step in the process. 
 Pessimism about closing the performance gap is widespread, but it is not supported by the facts. The most recent study of national achievement data by the Education Trust, a Washington foundation devoted to school reform, shows that while black and Latino students continue to trail white students on reading scores, schools that serve those students made great strides in recent decades. Between the mid-70's and mid-90's, the gap in achievement between African-American and white students, as measured by a federally sponsored test called the National Assessment of Educational Progress, narrowed by about half. The progress stopped in the late 1980's, when poverty became more concentrated and educators began to focus on remedial studies instead of much-needed high-level instruction.
Several states now report performance by race, most notably Texas. It began its effort in the 1980's with the Perot Commission, whose work culminated a decade later in a novel accountability system that rates the public schools by how well their minority students perform. Simply put, a school cannot receive the highest state rating unless 90 percent of its students -- including 90 percent of minority students -- perform at the highest levels on all state assessments. Texans looked at the data and recognized that the schools were jeopardizing the state's future by writing off minorities -- who make up more than half the public school enrollment. Since the reform effort, more minority students than ever are taking the Scholastic Assessment Tests, setting their sights on college.
The New York State Board of Regents created a similar momentum when it raised standards, requiring all students to pass Regents exams to graduate from high school. By disaggregating performance scores by race and economic status, the Regents hope to focus public opinion on the achievement gap in New York, forcing schools to work harder on minority achievement.

HEADLINE: Sad Realities for Doctors

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The column "The Demise of Reflective Doctoring" (May 9) accurately describes the sad direction doctors are being forced to take by the need for fiscal stability.
This dangerous situation pervades both the university and the community. Solo practitioners and groups that would ordinarily spend quality time with patients must now spend it on increasing volume, filing forms and deciphering the coding. 
 The traits of the "clinical champions" that the authors feel are required to halt this downward spiral are indigenous in most medical students, but the realities of the economic environment, the predominance of poor role modeling and the need now to scramble for a living are causes for even the most optimistic of us to become cynical in thinking that any of our wishes will be achieved until such time that the practice of medicine is restored to its original luster.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: PUBLIC OPINION;
Poll Shows Bush Ahead of Gore, With Leadership a Crucial Issue

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE with JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
While many Americans find Vice President Al Gore's stands on issues more appealing, he is not as well liked or considered as commanding a leader as Gov. George W. Bush, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
Mr. Gore's lackluster personal favorability ratings may help explain why Mr. Bush has emerged at this early stage as the preferred candidate across the demographic spectrum, including three critical groups that voted Democratic in 1996: Catholics, independents and Northeasterners. Voters polled, in fact, are so lukewarm toward Mr. Gore that he is widely perceived as a loser in November: by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1, they expect Mr. Bush to capture the White House. 
 Despite Mr. Bush's advantages six months before Election Day, Mr. Gore may be heartened that vice presidents are often overshadowed by the presidents they serve until they can distinguish themselves on a national stage at their nominating convention. In fact, at this time 12 years ago, Mr. Bush's father, then the vice president, trailed Michael S. Dukakis by 10 points, but went on to a lopsided victory in November.
And the survey illuminated potential rough patches for the Texas governor. For one thing, voters polled had qualms with his plan, which he outlined yesterday, that would allow workers to invest part of their payroll taxes in private accounts. Most of those polled said the stock market was a perilous place to invest.
Voters also seemed skeptical of Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut of $483 billion over five years -- a measure that Mr. Gore has condemned as a "risky tax scheme." Even 57 percent of people who said they planned to vote for Mr. Bush were uncertain of the effect of that proposal.
Mr. Bush will also have to cautiously navigate roiling factions in his own ranks. Three of every 10 Republican voters polled said that if the governor picks a running mate who supports legalized abortion they would be less likely to support him. About a third of all voters said religious conservatives carry too much influence in the Republican Party.
The nationwide telephone survey was conducted last Wednesday through Saturday with 947 adults, including 716 registered voters. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 to 4 percentage points.
Perhaps the most promising news for Mr. Gore was that he scored well with voters on issues they said were at the top of their agenda, like health care, education and Social Security. He was also seen as more caring than Mr. Bush, despite the governor's slogan that he is a "compassionate conservative."
Given that his issues are popular and that the economy seems hearty, the nagging difficulty that has confounded the vice president's advisers and many Democrats is why his overall ratings are not more competitive with Mr. Bush.
Among all voters, Mr. Bush led Mr. Gore by 8 percentage points, 47 to 39. Mr. Bush held a wide advantage among men, 50 to 36 percentage points; among women, Mr. Gore drew 42 percent, Mr. Bush, 44 percent.
The vice president's lagging ratings appear to have more to do with personality than policy. Mr. Gore was seen favorably by 34 percent of registered voters and unfavorably by 36 percent. By contrast, Mr. Bush was seen favorably by 40 percent and unfavorably by 28 percent.
A related problem that has dogged Mr. Gore is that Mr. Bush is viewed as more of a leader. Fifty-three percent of registered voters in the new poll said Mr. Gore had strong leadership qualities; 63 percent said the same thing about Mr. Bush.
The contrast is striking, particularly since Mr. Gore has been an elected official since 1976, when he was elected to the House from Tennessee; Mr. Bush was elected governor, his first office, in 1994. That said, Mr. Gore has spent the past seven years in the shadow of a president who consistently draws high ratings for the job he has done in office.
Several people who responded to the poll explained in follow-up interviews that there were not specific issues on which they split sharply with Mr. Gore. Rather, they often cited more intangible personal factors.
"Gore has not really shown a lot of leadership qualities or abilities to be in a position to run our nation," said Ken Bogler, 27, a labor representative from Somerset, N.J., who is an independent. "It's a presence, really. The way he carries himself, the way he speaks, does not seem presidential."
He added, "Issues don't play a big part in my support. Nine times out of 10, the candidates change their positions once they get into office any way. He may have the experience, but if you don't have the confidence and the abilities of someone who can handle the job, you don't give him the job."
Vera Jeane, 71, a retired nurse from Bay City, Tex., who is a Democrat, put it this way: "Al Gore acts as if he's not sure what he's thinking, as if he doesn't have a mind of his own. He doesn't seem to be strong enough in his opinions and as a leader to be president. Bush seems to be a stronger man with more definitive opinions. And I think he would make a better leader."
Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said he was not discouraged by such critiques and insisted that voters would defect from Mr. Bush when his policy stands are articulated in detail.
"You take the issues that are out there today," he said. "As we get to the general election, we're going to be forcing a debate."
Citing how Mr. Gore has inched up in the polls since last year, Mr. Coelho added: "We've made up a lot of points with George Bush. I'm not worried about George Bush at this point."
With fewer than 3 in 10 voters saying they were paying a lot of attention to the campaign, the candidates have not yet been able to fully define themselves to the electorate.
Mr. Bush, in particular, has made little headway in trumpeting his programs for cutting taxes and overhauling the Social Security system. Only 9 percent of registered voters in the poll said they knew a great deal about Mr. Bush's tax blueprint; 58 percent said they had no idea whether his plan would help or hurt the economy.
By a ratio of 4 to 1, those polled preferred using any budget surplus to shore up Social Security rather than to cut income taxes -- even as a majority said it might be possible to do both.
In a finding that raises questions about the Social Security proposal Mr. Bush discussed yesterday, those polled were closely divided over whether individuals should be allowed to invest portions of their Social Security taxes on their own.
When asked to put aside their presidential preferences and focus on issues, Mr. Gore was considered more capable in tackling Social Security and education, traditional Democratic strengths.
But the candidates were viewed about evenly in handling gun control, which has long been viewed as a Democratic issue, and taxes.
Voters also identified stark ideological differences between the candidates. For all the efforts by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore to court moderates, voters did not see them as moderates.
Forty-three percent of registered voters said they thought of Mr. Bush as a conservative while 34 percent said they thought he was a moderate. Similarly, 43 percent cast Mr. Gore as a liberal, while 30 percent said he was more a moderate.
Mr. Bush has been unable to shake the idea advanced by gun control advocates that the National Rifle Association would wield considerable influence in a Bush administration. Voters were three times more likely to say that Mr. Bush would be influenced greatly by the N.R.A. than Mr. Gore would.
In the follow-up interviews, some voters, citing character considerations, lamented that Senator John McCain, who was defeated by Mr. Bush in the Republican primaries, would not be on any ticket. In fact, Mr. McCain has maintained far more impressive favorability ratings than Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore: 46 percent have a favorable view of him; 14 percent hold an unfavorable view.
"I don't see in Gore or Bush that clear definitive leadership quality that McCain had," said Tim Olkar, 22, a student in Wheaton, Ill., who is an independent.
Speaking of Mr. Gore, he said: "He seems kind of wishy-washy as a candidate and seems to be running a negative campaign. Bush seems a little more genuine to me."
Beyond the candidates themselves, the Democratic and Republican parties are now seen more favorably than less so by voters. The Republican Party, in particular, has rebounded to its standing before the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton, which took a toll on the party.
There was no upswing for the Reform Party, which seems poised to nominate Patrick J. Buchanan as its standard bearer. The party is seen twice as negatively as positively.
 
"How the Poll Was Conducted"
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Wednesday through Saturday with 947 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 716 said they were registered to vote.
The telephone exchanges called were randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges in the United States.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to account for household size and the number of telephone lines in the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than four percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by talking to all registered voter in the United States.
For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: Tread Dread: Solving The Mystery of Tires

BYLINE: By TIM MORAN; Tim Moran writes on the automotive business from Grosse Pointe Park, Mich.

 BODY:
IT is common to feel foolish at the tire store. What should you ask for? Should you stay with the kind of tire that came with the car, or try something different, maybe sportier? Is it O.K. to go for low-cost tires, or do you sacrifice safety and handling? Can buying top-of-the-line tires turn your station wagon into a roadster?
Though many replacement tires are sold -- 184 million passenger car tires and 30.5 million light-truck tires in the United States in 1998 alone -- tires are an enigma to most people. Throw in a raft of technological innovations (even tires will have computer sensors soon) and coding systems that seem to combine algebra and Urdu, and it is clear why the humble tire is so mysterious. 
 Here is a starting point: the tire chosen for a new American passenger car is carefully engineered to do a good job at sometimes conflicting tasks.
* It must last 40,000 miles. That is what buyers expect.
* It must have low rolling resistance to save gas and help the car company meet its fuel-efficiency mandates.
* It must offer a comfy, quiet and slightly road-deadening ride. (Most Americans do not like to "feel" the road.)
* It must provide decent traction in all weather conditions on a variety of surfaces.
Those are the criteria the builders set when they mate a car with its first set of tires, and for most driving the choices remain good. The car's suspension is tuned to the weight, size and rolling resistance of those tires.
"The tire is a product of -- I'll say compromise," said Donald L. Botka, a vice president at Continental General Tire in Charlotte, N.C. The company takes at least two years to design and fine-tune its products, working with a manufacturer.
What makes a tire appealing to automotive engineers may not be what a performance-oriented driver wants. Or it may not even appeal to a driver who does not live in a part of the country where weather changes significantly by season.
While premium tires may not necessarily make your staid sedan stand up and howl, different tires do change the ride. Up to 20 percent of a car's noise, vibration and ride harshness can be attributed directly to tires, engineers say. If your sedan's tires tend to squeal during turns, a stiffer sidewall may cure the condition. Some drivers may want more road grip, better mud-and-snow traction or a longer life span for tires.
"The replacement market is a different animal," said Robert Carroll, the vice president of original equipment marketing for Michelin. "What you're looking at is trying to service a customer to meet his consumer needs."
Getting a grip can mean sacrifices, Mr. Carroll and other tire experts point out. Speed-oriented tires may compromise fuel efficiency, tread life and all-season traction in favor of dry-pavement performance. To gain the latter, such tires often have more rigid sidewalls than their cushier brethren, meaning a harsher ride.
"Comfort is what Americans crave," Mr. Carroll said. But he also noted that Americans are very image-conscious. A fast driver may try to buy his way up the performance-tire chain but find himself sorely disappointed by what he gets. "The normal American, who is buying that tire for image, perhaps, would find that car so nervous when he's driving down the highway that he couldn't even have a cup of coffee because he has to have both hands on the wheel," Mr. Carroll said.
For the driving enthusiast who wants total road feel and catlike traction, the cost of high-end performance tires, like the $145-a-tire Goodyear Eagle F1, makes sense. Such a buyer may own a multiseason set of tires, and a winter set, perhaps Firestone's $80 FT 70 C cold-weather tire, with its special rubber compound, mounted on separate wheels.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, customers who are looking for extremely long-lived tires -- those that guarantee 80,000 or even 100,000 miles of tread wear instead of 40,000 miles, or those that can run for miles even after the air has leaked from them -- may not realize they could be trading away handling and gas-mileage advantages by paying a premium for peace of mind.
Michelin's X-1 tire shows one trend in long tire life: for $120 a tire, the company guarantees six years of driving with no mileage limit.
Some tires may complicate driving in the name of safety. Take the case of what manufacturers call extended-mobility tires, commonly called run-flats. Such tires have been appearing recently in luxury cars; Chevrolet's Corvette comes with them. Extended-mobility tires are designed so that for 50 miles or so, the sidewalls can hold the weight of the car even after air leaks out.
"I don't think the problem has been with them working," said Lloyd Stoyer, the editor of Modern Tire Dealer, a trade magazine. "The problem has been with cost, the cost of the sensors needed to tell you when the tire is flat.
"These tires are not as fuel efficient," Mr. Stoyer continued. "They don't handle as well. On the off chance that you have a flat, you drive on a tire that is not as efficient."
Some manufacturers are hailing breakthroughs in new, lightweight materials as a sign that run-flat tires are improving and will become the norm. Tire dealers are not jumping on the bandwagon just yet. Equipment to install and service $2,000-to-$3,000 run-flat tire systems is costly, and there are not enough of these tires on the road to make them standard items at any dealership.
"Run-flat requires special everything," said Darin Ode, the general manager of Ode Tire and Service in Warren, Mich. "When you get the flat, you know what's happened, but you don't know how far it's going to be before you can find a distributor who can replace your tire."
At the opposite end of the price spectrum, four-tires-for-$100 campaigns have appealed to thriftier buyers.
IS low price sufficient reason to buy a particular tire?
"Why are people willing to spend more for a pair of sneakers than for tires when their life depends on the tires' performance for thousands of miles?" a tire engineer asked at a recent online automotive forum.
His point is well taken; it is all too easy to get wrapped up in price without thinking about what the tires cost over their life span. But if buying tires at rock-bottom prices is a big issue, be sure to check the Uniform Tire Quality Grade traction and temperature ratings molded into sidewalls. (Every tire company assigns an "A," "B" or "C" grade to its products, with "A" being the highest.)
Tires can be inexpensive because the cost of their materials has fallen markedly over the last five years, new automated assembly methods have been introduced, which have cut labor costs, and fierce competition between retailers has slashed margins to the bone. Tire technology has matured to the point that competition is based more on price than on manufacturing advances.
But the industry thinks it is on the cusp of a new era in technology. More functions may soon be packed into tires beyond traction and handling abilities. Continental Teves Inc. introduced its "intelligent tire" last fall with test-track demonstrations for the Frankfurt Auto Show in Germany.
The tire uses magnetic stripes molded into the sidewall to send traction information to sensors mounted near each wheel.
"When you drive a car, when you accelerate, brake or turn, basically what's allowing you to do that is friction or forces between the tire and the road," said Philip Headley, the chief engineer of advance technology at Continental Teves's North American headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich. "What the 'intelligent' tire does is actually allow us to measure those forces."
Mr. Headley said that the tire's feedback could tell the onboard car computer whether a tire was skidding or slipping, or about to skid. The tire could replace more expensive sensors in electronic stability systems that help drivers avoid accidents.
At Michelin, the Pax tire system changes the entire wheel, clamping a tire onto a precision wheel, which includes a rubber insert ring. The ring and the rim provide more than 100 miles of run-flat ability. Michelin is seeking to license the technology and make it an industry standard. Pax has recently appeared on "concept" cars, like the Cadillac Evoq, designed and built but not ready for mass production.
Such complex tire-wheel systems may run at much higher inflation pressures than current tires do -- more than 50 pounds a square inch, rather than the 32 to 35 pounds common today -- to increase fuel efficiency. They could also include pressure- and temperature-sensing technology to give drivers early warning of changing tire conditions, prompting drivers to maintain tires and thereby extend tire life.
Eventually, tires may also change shape, morphing from a wide, cushy "boulevard" ride at 35 miles per hour to a tough, thin freeway mileage-maker at 65 m.p.h.
That is an automotive generation away, though. For drivers who must replace their radials today, Mr. Stoyer suggests being prepared to answer three questions at the tire store: "How long are you going to keep the car? What kind of driving do you do? And what do you expect of a tire? If they listen to the answer to those, any type of tire dealer ought to be able to give you a tire you're going to be happy with."

HEADLINE: Cars You Drive for Just a Little While, Then It's Their Turn

BYLINE: By BILL DONAHUE; Bill Donahue, a correspondent for Outside magazine, has also written for The New York Times Magazine.

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
"NICE car," said a man in a black T-shirt, walking past the little European sedan at a conference here last month on transportation and the environment. "Is it yours?"
It was the sort of comment that usually stokes the male ego. But Conrad Wagner, the 40-year-old Swiss entrepreneur who was standing beside the car, was not stoked. He rolled his eyes in exasperation and launched into a little discourse. 
 "No, it's not mine," said Mr. Wagner, who started the world's first successful car-sharing program in 1987, in Lucerne. "Owning a big piece of metal -- that is Iron Age. It is much better for the environment -- it is much more cool, you know -- to rely on a number of transportation modalities: the bus, the train, a fleet of shared cars."
The guy in the T-shirt walked away unconvinced. But throughout Europe and Canada, and in small green-minded enclaves in the United States, people are beginning to buy Mr. Wagner's idea.
Four American cities -- Portland, Seattle, Boston and Traverse City, Mich. -- now have programs inspired by Mr. Wagner's Mobility CarSharing Switzerland, which has 1,600 vehicles available for sharing in hundreds of places throughout the country. These businesses are essentially short-term car-rental agencies with a public purpose: reducing car ownership and, by extension, fuel use and pollution.
The companies park their cars in residential neighborhoods, so that they can be used -- and returned to their designated parking slots -- by members, who usually pay annual dues plus hourly and mileage fees. Each car must be reserved.
Boston and three smaller American cities also have a variant known as station cars, in which small electric vehicles are parked at rail stations. Commuters take the train to the station, then hop into a station car, drive it to their workplace and park there; the car is then available for participants returning to the rail station, and the reservation system assures that the first driver will find a car to take back to the station.
While Seattle's car-sharing program, Flexcar, is considered the nation's most ambitious, the soul of American car sharing lies here in Portland, a vast city whose four-lane thoroughfares and serpentine residential streets were built for the auto, but which has lately become preoccupied with anti-sprawl planning and green living.
In 1998, David Brook, a home-energy-conservation specialist, opened a car-sharing enterprise here, down the street from People's Food Co-op. His business, CarSharing Portland, now has 17 vehicles, mostly Dodge Neon sedans; the cars are shared by 275 drivers, who pay dues of $100 a year, plus $1.50 an hour and 40 cents a mile.
Members tend to be young professionals who don't need a car to get to work. Kassim Ferris, a 31-year-old patent lawyer who bikes to his office, said that he uses the service only three or four times a month, when he needs to "pick up dry cleaning, say, or drive to a concert that's far away."
Xander Patterson, a CarSharing member who is the co-chairman of the Pacific Green Party, also drives as little as he can. "Usually," he said, "I tow my golf clubs to the course in a cart attached to my bicycle."
But not all CarSharing members spurn the auto. Some are couples who use shared cars rather than buy a second car, and some are frequent drivers who don't own a car.
Bud Erland and Lisa Morrison, who are married, use the white Neon parked two blocks from their home about three times a week -- to carry groceries and garden supplies, and to shuttle their 7-year-old son, John, to Little League. When Mr. Erland's mother died last month, they rode to the funeral in a shared car. "We don't have to hassle with car ownership," said Ms. Morrison, a hospital worker. "We don't have to think, 'Where can we park it? Is the car being broken into?' "
It does not necessarily save them money. Mr. Erland, a meticulous recordkeeper, calculated that car sharing cost them $2,268 for 2,965 miles driven last year -- 76 cents a mile. When they owned a 1970 Volvo station wagon, they spent an average of $2,620 a year, which included gas, maintenance, repairs, depreciation and insurance, and drove an average of 9,755 miles -- 27 cents a mile.
Still, Mr. Erland, a city bus driver, said that not owning a car "feels right -- even if, economically, it proves that we're fools." And it has certainly kept their total mileage down. "We didn't have a car out in the driveway," he said with pride. "So, yeah, we didn't drive as much. We didn't, say, pop out to the grocery store for a quart of milk."
Mr. Brook, CarSharing's president, said that is just the point. "I don't want to make car use too easy for people," he said. "If you make driving a little less attractive, people will walk; they'll take the bus." He cited a Swiss study indicating that after people joined CarSharing, their total fuel consumption decreased 55 percent.
Some experts doubt that car sharing will catch on in the United States. Kenneth Orski, editor of Innovation Briefs, a Washington newsletter focused on transportation, said it was far more suitable for Western Europe. "In the crowded, medieval cities there," he said, "it's very hard to park a car; gas is extremely expensive. In the United States, though, gas is cheap and everything is spread out. People want to drive; they want to own a car."
The urge is profound even in the greenest of Portland homes. On a recent evening, as Lisa Morrison was washing the Earth Day mug in which she had just served chamomile tea, 7-year-old John Erland spoke up.
"Ever since I saw this ad on TV," he said, "I've been wanting a car -- a Chevy minivan with a TV right inside! I want one of those cars, real bad."

HEADLINE: From Moscow to Malaysia, a Look at What's on the Road

BYLINE: By RICHARD FEAST; Richard Feast is the editor at large at Automotive World magazine in London.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
THE wave of consolidation that has swept over the auto industry has been accompanied by much verbiage about the need to achieve economies of scale. The message is clear. Competition among automakers has never been tougher, so they must work together to share costs.
In the process, they are creating more global products. This makes economic sense, of course, but there is a problem: a car is not a Coke. 
 The Ford F-Series pickup truck may be the best seller in the United States, but its size and fuel consumption dictate that it will never find much favor among European buyers, who live in medieval cities with narrow streets and have to cope with startlingly high gasoline prices. In Japan, the best-selling model is a Suzuki minicar that could almost be popped into the cargo hold of a Lincoln Navigator.
Not that global cars do not already exist; they do, and have for years. Henry Ford's Model T, which did so much to bring mobility to the United States in the 1920's, was manufactured around the globe. Volkswagen's original Type 1 -- the Beetle -- was conceived in the mid-1930's with a similar mobility goal for Germany. When it went into production after World War II, the Beetle became a best seller worldwide.
Today, specialized market producers like Porsche and Ferrari sell the same models around the world. So do some prestige automakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar, although in many instances their suspensions and specifications are adjusted to suit local tastes.
And in cars, those tastes can be quite pronounced. For example, Europeans favor passenger cars with diesel engines, which have never made much of a dent in the United States market. They now account for a quarter of all new-car sales in Europe and appear to be headed higher. The popularity is a reflection of the diesel engine's economy and the generally lower prices for diesel fuel.
Europeans also like hatchbacks, while Americans prefer sedans. That can be seen in last year's sales figures for the Volkswagen Golf hatchback and its sedan equivalent, known in Europe as the Bora and in the United States as the Jetta. In Europe, the Golf is the most popular model, outselling the Jetta 6 to 1. In the United States, the Jetta four-door sedan is nearly seven times as popular as the Golf hatchback.
Automatic transmissions, the norm in the United States, are comparatively rare in the most popular models in Europe, where manual shifting still seems to be regarded as a symbol of virility.
Big-volume automakers know, then, that choosing a car is a complex exercise influenced by regional culture and national pride, and by more fundamental local issues like road space, tariff and trade barriers, taxes, currency exchange rates and household income.
It is difficult to categorize all national markets, but they fall into three broad types: those like, say, Finland, which are completely open; those that favor local production by placing heavy taxes on imports (South Korea, for example); and those that are the exclusive preserve of local producers, like China.
Although firm sales figures are not yet available, a random tour of the globe shows how these influences and realities affected consumer buying patterns last year.
 
China
In a country like China, where consumer credit is tight, buying a big-ticket item like a car is not done lightly. Volkswagen -- Germany's "people's car" -- is now China's people's car. The old Volkswagen Santana model, a sedan version of the 1980's Passat hatchback, was the most popular car there last year, followed by the Santana 2000, a long-wheelbase version of the same car. Both are made in conjunction with a local producer, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. The Daihatsu Charade hatchback, VW Jetta sedan and Citroen ZX hatchback are other popular models, each made in collaboration with a local partner.
Michael J. Dunne, the president of Automotive Resources Asia Inc., which has offices in Beijing and Bangkok, said the Chinese bought about 571,000 new passenger cars last year, and a total of 1.83 million vehicles of all types.
VW dominates the car market, with 55 percent, for several reasons: it got an early start in China, in 1985; it offers good value for money; and it has strong local partners. But it is facing new competition. "VW's leadership will be challenged by new entrants like Toyota with its Vitz model, Honda with the Accord and G.M. with its Buick Century and Opel Corsa," Mr. Dunne said.
 
India
Like Volkswagen in China, the Suzuki Motor Corporation has a tight grip on the closed Indian market because it pioneered local production in the early 1980's in association with Maruti Udyog Ltd. Today, as any traveler to India can observe, Maruti sells two-thirds of all cars, with Suzuki-based economy models known as the 800, Zen and Omni occupying the top three sales slots.
But that may change in time. Ford, General Motors and Hyundai of South Korea have focused on India for expansion. So has Telco, an Indian company that is part of the large Tata Group, which is developing a car line. There are already indications of the challenge Maruti is facing in India: the Hyundai Santro and Tata Indica were fourth and fifth best sellers last year.
 
Russia
Russia is much more open these days than in the old Soviet days, but local products still dominate the market. The devaluation of the ruble in August 1998 instantly made imports a great deal more expensive without affecting the prices of Russian-made cars; Western and Asian importers, which had been making good progress, suddenly found their cars priced out of the market.
So Russian manufacturers sold 955,000 new cars last year, and importers only 79,000, some of them locally assembled. On the other hand, secondhand cars imported into Russia accounted for an estimated 400,000 registrations, said Dmitri O. Choulga, a General Motors spokesman in Moscow.
Russia's most popular model last year was the Riva, a boxy, rear-wheel-drive sedan based on the old Fiat 124 and made by AvtoVAZ, the country's largest automaker. Nearly 282,000 were sold. The same company's Samara, a front-wheel-drive hatchback, was the runner-up with 201,000, followed by the Volga 3110 sedan made by AvtoGAZ.
 
Far East
As in Russia, importers do precious little business in South Korea. Three local brands dominate the market there. The Hyundai Sonata/Marcia midsize sedan was comfortably the best seller last year, with 122,600. It was followed by the Daewoo Matiz, a minicar; the Daewoo Nubira midsize sedan; and the Kia Carnival minivan.
For American and European manufacturers, South Korean trade is something of a sore point. In theory, the South Korean market is open to foreign cars, but in fact only 2,400 imports were sold there last year. By contrast, South Korean producers sold 1.1 million cars and light trucks locally and exported 1.5 million more.
"The forces of protectionism are alive and well in Korea's domestic market," says a joint statement issued by the Automotive Trade Policy Council in Washington and the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association in Brussels.
The issue has taken the pressure off Japan, which used to be the favorite "unfair trade" target for American and European automakers. In fact, car imports accounted for 6.5 percent of the Japanese market last year, and Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, the two leading importers, sold nearly 50,000 cars each.
The real automotive sales successes in Japan, though, are those of the Japanese producers. But the best sellers are not the cars, like the Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords, that Americans immediately associate with Japan. The best seller last year was the tiny Suzuki Wagon R, which looks like a narrow, boxy cross between a minivan and a station wagon, followed by the Daihatsu Move and Honda Life.
They all belong to a peculiarly Japanese segment known as minicars, which have engines with displacements of no more than 660 cubic centimeters and are about 134 inches long by 58 inches wide. By comparison, a Ford Taurus four-door sedan, one of the most popular cars in the United States, has a three-liter V-6, and a body that measures 197.6 inches by 73 inches. An estimated 60 percent of the minicars, which miraculously seat four or five, are bought by women in their 20's.
Outside the minicar segment, the Toyota Corolla was Japan's most popular car last year, followed by the small Toyota Vitz (a hatchback version of the Echo) and the large Toyota Crown sedan.
The influence of Japan's automakers is evident right across the rest of the Far East. Thailand is a good example. It wants to become the major automotive force in Southeast Asia, and since 1995, it has attracted $1.5 billion worth of new factories from G.M., Ford, Honda and Toyota.
The country's best sellers, however, are all locally made Japanese models. And what Thai buyers prefer -- even more than American buyers -- are pickup trucks. They accounted for 56 percent of Thailand's total sales of 218,000 vehicles last year, with models from Isuzu, Toyota and Mitsubishi leading the list.
Even in Malaysia, which is trying to forge an indigenous automotive industry through daunting tariffs on imports, all the most popular models are based on Japanese designs. The best seller last year was the Proton Wira, a locally made Mitsubishi Colt, followed by the Perodua Kancil, a version of the Daihatsu Mira. Other Protons and Peroduas accounted for the next most popular sellers.
Singapore, with no domestic manufacturers to protect, takes a totally neutral view of all imports -- and then turns them into some of the most expensive cars on earth through quotas and taxes. At the same time, Singapore has invested heavily in public transportation, which is cheap and efficient, while it levies tolls for driving downtown at certain times. The result is a remarkably congestion- and pollution-free atmosphere.
Singapore's best seller in 1999 was the Nissan Sunny, which achieved a market share of 18 percent on sales of a mere 6,600. Other top sellers were the Toyota Corolla, Mitsubishi Colt/Lancer and Honda Civic.
 
Other Points
South Africans, too, prefer Japanese-based products, all of which are assembled locally. The Toyota Hilux pickup was the best seller last year, with the Toyota Conquest sedan second. There was a more even spread in popularity in Israel last year. Various Mazdas led the Volkswagens and Hyundais.
European and United States automakers hold more sway in South America. The best seller in Brazil, the continent's biggest national market with just over one million sales last year, was the VW Golf, with nearly 231,800, followed by the Fiat Palio, Chevrolet Corsa, Fiat Uno and Chevrolet Astra. In Turkey, the Renault R12, Megane and R19 outsold models from other local assemblers.
 
Europe
Predictably perhaps, sales across Europe were dominated by European producers and by G.M. and Ford, whose long presence in the region effectively makes them local producers. Over all, VW's Golf was the leader in Western Europe, with more than 707,000 sold. General Motors' Opel/Vauxhall Astra was not far behind, followed by the Renault Megane/Scenic, Ford Focus and Renault Clio.
With strong local industries in several countries, there were obvious national differences in buying patterns. The Golf and Astra were comfortably top sellers in Germany last year, and the Megane/Scenic and Clio were well ahead in France. Assorted Fiats held sway in Italy. British buyers favored Fords above all else, a reflection of the company's nearly 90 years as a local producer.
Similarly, in Eastern Europe, the companies that invested in local production are now reaping the rewards. In Poland, for instance, the country's best sellers last year were the Fiat Seicento and Daewoo Matiz, both economy models made in Poland. A few weeks ago, G.M. also began making its European economy model, the Agila, in a new Polish factory. That is bound to influence local buying patterns in the future.
But for less partisan views of European preferences, it is instructive to turn to the sales returns from a couple of countries with no tradition of vehicle manufacturing. In Finland, the two most popular models were G.M.'s Opel Astra and Ford's Focus. Toyotas and Volkswagens also sold well.
And in Greece, the top model was again the Astra, followed by the Hyundai Accent, Citroen Saxo and Toyota Corolla -- a truly international group.

HEADLINE: Lovable Sore Thumb In Bedford Hills' Eye

BYLINE: By ABBOTT COMBES 

 BODY:
THE commuter parking lots at the Bedford Hills train station are lease-to-lease with cars right out of the promised land -- you know, the ones that can climb mountains, ford streams, ferry soccer leagues, shake traffic, repel mud and after all that drop off a couple of beautiful people at the Plaza.
The makes and models are showroom perfect for a New York suburb that doesn't mind wearing its affluence pretty much everywhere it can: Audi, Acura, BMW, Caravan, Expedition, Grand Cherokee, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lexus, Mercedes, Outback, Pathfinder, Saab, Suburban, Volvo. . . . And then there is that 1982 Chrysler LeBaron convertible. 
 Know my station car, know me. If you are what you drive, I am a machine who has gone a certain number of miles and seen better days but keeps on making it up the hills and around the corners, somewhat the worse for wear but able to catch an eye or two, dented but not bowed, still bound for glory even if bound by duct tape.
A few particulars, though not too many, because the past isn't always an ideal prologue. Moby, as my daughter christened the LeBaron four years ago when it became mine (she knows a great white whale when she drives one), was purchased from a friend's son for $100 cash and the assumption of a $360.97 garage bill. It has a 2.2-liter engine, an automatic transmission and four cylinders. The odometer, which rolls when it feels like it but hasn't felt like it lately, says 111,746. (Maybe it's the number's third time around, making it the real charm.)
The top goes up and down, with help (arms). It keeps out rain and snow, also with help (duct tape, strategically and stylishly placed). The power windows work. The original rear window does not. The once-clear vinyl became so opaque that the blurs were blurry, and the canvas trim securing its zipper rotted so badly that there was no cloth left to restitch, much less hold the safety pins reinforcing the thread. A piece of heavy plastic, ingeniously attached with Velcro, has taken the guesswork -- and some of the fun -- out of reverse and thus far has resisted most of the elements.
The heater, defroster and (unnecessary) air-conditioner operate just fine; their fan does not. The back-seat floor is, to put it delicately, brittle. There is a broken-off key in the driver's-side door.
As to the essentials, engine and chassis, the car starts and it goes, and as long as it does I don't go out of my way to lift the hood or crawl under the body. It creaks; I creak. When we do, we find Mario Chiacchia at Haines Road Servicecenter or Dave Zasso and his son-in-law, Rob Cantisani, at Meineke, and they make things right.
The third essential, the radio-tape deck, is groovy enough for a middle-aged guy who won't grow up.
Moby, ersatz mean machine that it is, is also something of a fop and does not go quietly into the parking lot, literally or figuratively. When in doubt, accentuate the negative. For example, when the trim on the doors, a hideous vinyl-and-chrome concoction, began to fall off, I replaced it with a wood crown molding stained mahogany. Having long railed against vanity plates, I got them myself (AKA KIT -- you figure it out) and encased one of them in a bejeweled license frame so tacky that the manager of the auto-parts store didn't want to sell it to me.
The back bumper is prime promotional space, of course, and I've tried to add to Moby's, and my own, mystique. There is a 1978 Red Sox sticker (one disappointing year is as good as the next) and one for the Washington Redskins. The Ivy League is represented by my daughters' schools, and one of my own, Dartmouth and Princeton, which is another reason I couldn't drive a fancier car even if I wanted to. A Grateful Dead sticker tells everyone that "my other car is a tour bus."
My favorite, though, which I have to duplicate periodically, broadcasts how The Washington Star (where I worked) has hijacked "Doonesbury" from The Washington Post. (The Star, alas, was hijacked right out of existence shortly thereafter, 18-plus years ago, and "Doonesbury" hurried right back to The Post.) Rounding out the mobile bulletin board are the Beastie Boys, the Bahamas National Trust and the 1995 women's America Cup team, a trio that definitely wasn't made for one another but get along famously here.
INSIDE, not quite as public but hanging from the mirror for all to see, are a disco ball and a religious medal. (The medal is supposed to be St. Christopher, but may in fact be St. Francis, left over from a blessing-of-the-pets church service. Whoever -- what's good for the traveling goose must be good for this gander.) Completing the interior design are Pearl Jam and Mountain Dew stickers, which came with the car; a remnant of red carpet around the gearshift; and a doormat welcoming the Publisher's Clearing House check bearer, which no one wanted at home because he never came.
That's Moby: what you see is what you get, or maybe less, shoddily presentable yet decrepit enough to quell any passing fancy of restoration. (A new top, installed, would cost $700, which would lead to bodywork, which wouldn't make sense without a new motor, which would. . . .) Unlike most of his neighbors occupying the other 157 parking spots in Lot 4 at the Bedford Hills station, Moby cannot climb mountains, ford streams, etc. What Moby can do, and do faithfully, is get me to the train and home again five days a week, and on the weekends through my appointed rounds. Hitting on three of four speakers, he can also help me reacquaint other joy riders with the great rock 'n' roll and folk artists of ages past, the likes of Bill Haley, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly, the Kingston Trio, Clyde McPhatter, Darlene Love, Freddy Cannon, Cat Stevens, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp (with and without Cougar), Meat Loaf. . . . So many tunes, so little driving time.
I am by no means the first to note the demise of the station car, but even in an area like upper Westchester County, showcase as it is to the rich and richer (and some others), it continues to mystify. My fellow travelers, many of them friends, insist that their late-model transports are not meant to bespeak prosperity, status, but merely to ensure reliability: why should they put up with question marks when they can afford exclamation points? (Even the relatively pedestrian cars, the Fords and the Chevys, the Hondas and the Toyotas, all seem to be as shiny as a dealer's brochure.) These commuters have outgrown the rattletrap station cars of myth, they say, and then they inevitably add their own tearful remembrances of clunkers past. Right. It certainly is a sign of modern maturity to leave a $40,000 machine, which can climb mountains, ford streams, etc., in a parking lot where its only job is not to get stolen.
On the other hand, almost no one is crass enough to offer a truly discouraging word in Moby's presence. In my town, surface politesse rules. Behind all the eyebrows that Moby raises, however, I wouldn't be surprised to discover disdain. Where I see resourcefulness, economy and individuality, others probably see shallowness, stinginess and erosion of community values. They also see, we would both agree, someone who doesn't have more money than he knows what to do with.
There may also be some regional differences working here. (Remember the Red Sox sticker?) In Massachusetts, when I grew up there, new cars were never a distinguishing characteristic of the aristocracy. Old money tended to be cheap, so that it didn't give away any to the new money. Frugality was what counted, and the more miles you got for your buck, the better. New York, on the other hand, has always been a lay-rubber, flash-your-wad kind of place. It's the difference between believing that getting there is what counts and believing that how you get there is what counts.
Well, as far as this transplanted New Englander is concerned, Moby gets me there, and he gets me there in style. Our journeys together have not always been bumpless. There have been collisions between my optimism and his obstinance; he always wins, and I always pay: axles, cylinders, starter, radiator, gas tank, muffler, rotors, brake shoes, brake drums, coils, battery, tires, ignition switch, rear-view-mirror glue. . . . And I must confess, having just finished with a calculator and receipts, that Moby's welfare has helped the local economy more than I might have wished (as some naysayers warned from Day 1). Total investment, from purchase to crown molding and all geriatrics in between: $6,106.93. Not exactly a bargain, but what price enlightenment? Amortizing it over four years, that's only $4.23 a day. As a Zen master would say, be happy with your paradoxes.
And so I am. My station in life may well leave something to be desired, but my station car does not.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plays a Wild Card in France

BYLINE: By JACK SMITH; Jack Smith, a Pennsylvania writer, is connoisseur at large for The Robb Report.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
IT is easy to lose one's way when driving through the neighborhoods of this city, especially in those hours before dawn when the street signs above the corner tabacs, boulangeries and patisseries fade into darkness. The new Cadillac Seville that had cruised so majestically down the Champs-Elysees the night before now crept tentatively through the narrow, deserted streets while the driver rehearsed his supplicative refrain: "Excusez-moi de vous deranger, Monsieur; ou est la rue. . . . ?"
Up ahead, a figure emerged from a small hotel lugging cartons to the street and the car slid over to the curb. But before the driver could utter a word, the grinning hotelier approached to ask, in perfect English: "Hi. Are you lost?" In a manner of speaking, yes. But, how could he tell the driver was American? 
 "Ah, that is easy," said the hotel man, who introduced himself as Mory Mirza, the night manager at the Hotel Britannique. "Who else would be driving around Paris in a brand-new Cadillac but an American?"
That was a good question, and there are billions of dollars riding on the answer, as slumping sales at home have prompted General Motors, the maker of Cadillac, to explore markets overseas.
According to G.M.'s plan, there will soon be thousands of well-heeled French citizens rolling through the tonier arrondissements of Paris behind the leather-wrapped steering wheels of gleaming new Sevilles, and tens of thousands more Cadillac owners motoring across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean.
Ultimately, G.M. intends for 1 in every 5 Cadillacs to be sold through a dealership outside the United States. General Motors is revamping the overseas distribution network that John Smith, a former Cadillac general manager in Detroit, once described as a "loose, spontaneous confederation" and converting importers to factory-franchised dealerships, of which there are currently 87 in Europe and 700 in 70 countries worldwide.
The model charged with revitalizing Cadillac's sales overseas is the Seville, which, with its more compact wheelbase (more so, at least, than the DeVille) and its understated styling, was anointed Cadillac's "world car" upon its debut in 1998.
Soon to come, though no date has been announced, is the sleek, supercharged Evoq roadster; the two-seater has been such a hit on the auto show circuit that it has spawned yet another concept car, the Imaj, an aluminum-bodied, four-wheel-drive sedan with a Northstar-based, 425 horsepower V-8, designed with the high-performance European market in mind. Next month, Cadillac will return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time in a half-century with a Scott Riley-built prototype powered by a twin-turbo version of the Northstar engine; a Seville will serve as pace car for the race.
Heady stuff, and if Mr. Mirza's reaction to the Seville is any index of the car's appeal overseas, Cadillac's prospects of cracking the European market should not be underestimated. "The French cars are nothing, next to this," Mr. Mirza exulted, running a hand along the car's flanks. "This is gorgeous."
There was just one catch: "Too bad I can't afford one," he sighed. "I guess I'll go on driving my old Mercedes."
These days, every Cadillac sale, at home or abroad, counts. General Motors' global ambitions notwithstanding, Cadillac registrations in all of Europe dipped to 984 in 1999 from 1,259 in 1998.
But nobody said it would be easy. "Our first job is to erase the prejudice against big American sedans," said Michael Klaus, G.M.'s marketing director for North American Vehicles, Europe. "Seville has the design, the handling and the power to do this. Our fuel economy is competitive, too, considering the car has a big V-8 engine. But it's going to take several years; the European market just doesn't know the product."
Indeed, a sense of wonder pervades French reviews of the car, as if the metaphysics of the Seville's very presence on European soil outweighed petty technical considerations. According to Paris Match, the car "emanates a sense of stately grace,which certain European lines might envy."
The automotive weekly L'Argus observed that General Motors "possesses in its fishpond of marques a true treasure: Cadillac." Accompanying these raves was some minor grousing about the car's handling on the back roads, the lateral support of the seats, the styling and the way the car downshifted.
In the greater scheme of things, however, Cadillac's problem is not so much those who do not know the product, but rather those who know it best -- American car buyers.
IN 1998, slumping stateside sales spurred Cadillac to fabricate the figures needed to claim pre-eminence in the domestic luxury market, a position it had enjoyed for 49 years. When the figures were revised and cars still standing on Cadillac dealers' lots were subtracted, Lincoln emerged as the 1998 luxury champ, with sales of 187,121 compared with Cadillac's 182,570.
In 1999 Cadillac's malaise was compounded when the marque slumped to third place in the luxury arena, with sales of 178,507, tailing Mercedes's 189,437 and Lexus's 185,890.
"The problem is, Cadillac has lost sight of what it stood for," said John Grace, director of Interbrand, a Manhattan-based brand consultancy. "In the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, everyone aspired to own one; it made a statement about the owner. Since the 1980's, its values have faded into ambiguity.
"Everybody knows what Mercedes stands for: uncompromising quality and reliability. BMW is the ultimate driving experience. But there are no Cadillac values any more. It's been driven by expediency; it's chasing the demographic-of-the-month."
Whatever it stood for before, Cadillac's descent on the slippery slope of ambivalence accelerated in May 1981 with the introduction of the Cimarron; behind that gold Cadillac crest, car buyers found a Chevy Cavalier econobox with an underpowered four-cylinder engine.
In 1994, with gas lines gone the way of mood rings, Cadillac introduced the Concours, a slab-sided, fender-skirted, six-passenger behemoth with a 270-horsepower V-8 beneath the hood. The Concours was designed to woo baby boomers with sporty performance in a car that looked like what their grandparents were driving; after four years it joined the Cimarron in memory.
The incongruities mounted in 1996 when Cadillac boasted the most powerful engine ever in a front-wheel-drive production car: the 300-horsepower Northstar. This contradicted the luxury market's preference for the comfort and performance of rear-wheel-drive, which is why every other upscale carmaker -- Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Audi and Lincoln -- eschews front-wheel-drive in its most expensive sedans.
Nonetheless, Cadillac abandoned the full-sized, rear-wheel-drive paradigm at the end of the 1996 model year, and eliminated the Brougham from the lineup.
About the same time, the carmaker unveiled its new Catera, a rear-wheel midsize sedan based on the German-made Opel that evoked echoes of the Cimarron. "We told G.M. the Catera would have made a great Saturn," said James Hossack, the senior vice president at Auto Pacific, an automotive product and market research firm in Orange County, Calif., whose clients include General Motors. "But it makes a terrible Cadillac. Who wants a luxury car with a six-cylinder engine and no more horsepower than a Honda Accord?"
In 1998, Cadillac clambered aboard the sport-utility-vehicle bandwagon with the Escalade, a $46,900 version of the $28,520 Chevrolet Tahoe. "Funny," Mr. Hossack said. "The Tahoe got a new, improved platform for 2000 while the far more expensive Escalade retains the old one."
If Cadillac's luxury lineup is bemusing, most people in the automotive industry consider its advertising of recent years a disaster. Cadillac executives turn apoplectic when reminded of 1997's "Catera Duck" campaign with its tag line, "The car that zigs." Now playing in prime time is Cadillac's new theme, "The power of &."
"It says absolutely nothing," said Mr. Grace, of Interbrand.
On the other hand, Mr. Hossack observed: "How can you advertise a lineup that includes a six-cylinder luxury car and a luxury truck based on an outdated Chevy platform? And who wants a front-wheel-drive, full-size luxury car?"
Well, the French might. "We've grown up with front-wheel drive; we know how to handle it," said Jean Claude Dutailly, who conforms precisely to the demographic profile projected for the Seville. Mr. Dutailly, 53, is general manager of the battery division of Saft, a division of the French conglomerate Alcatel, and as such drives a company car, a Peugeot 605. "When you are an executive in France, it's expected that you will drive a French car," he said, while wheeling the Seville through the Paris traffic on a test drive.
"This is really very nice, very comfortable," he continued. "It feels like you can drive it 500 miles and still be fresh. And compared to the Mercedes S Class or the BMW 7, it is a bargain. And the guarantee, you can keep it 10 years without much trouble, non?"
So, would he buy a Seville? "With all that it offers," he said, "the style, the ride, the performance, the comfort -- yes. Oh, not as long as I'm working in France. But if I lived in the States, definitely."

HEADLINE: In Automobilia, a Yearning for the Days of Youth

BYLINE: By CLIFF ROTHMAN; Cliff Rothman writes on culture from Los Angeles for Vanity Fair and The Nation.

 BODY:
LEILA DUNBAR remembers the family outing to search for old tin automotive signs at the antiques fair in Brimfield, Mass. It was 1973, and she was 12. "We slept in a borrowed van, right on the side of Route 20, the tractor-trailers rolling by and causing the van to sway all night," she said.
They would spend the two-day fair scouring the field for the handful of road signs for sale, like those for Champion Spark Plugs or Mother's Root Beer. Her dad, she remembers, paid maybe 50 cents for the 1-by-2-foot artifacts from the 1930's and 40's. 
 Brimfield now comprises 15 to 20 shows over eight days, with vast sections devoted strictly to automobilia, as the artifacts have come to be known. And those tin signs? They are about $175 to $200 each.
Ms. Dunbar, who is the director of collectibles and a senior vice president at Sotheby's in New York, has automobilia in her blood. She is not alone. According to Mobilia magazine, a niche publication, an estimated three million fans and collectors are into everything pertaining to the culture of cars, motorcycles, even tractors: toy and die-cast car models, signs, gas station maps, original workshop car manuals and John Deere equipment.
Industry sales figures for 1998 are estimated at a billion dollars, not including untabulated transactions that involve private sellers, flea markets or garage sales.
A strong economy and baby boomers, who grew up as the car culture hit its stride, are the twin spark plugs that ignited the hobby, which has exploded since the mid-90's, said Eric Killorin, the publisher of Mobilia. The magazine, a monthly, began as a newsletter with 3,000 readers in 1992 and has grown to more than 88 pages, with 59,000 readers and a popular Internet auction site that recently attracted $6 million in venture capital. The Web site (www.mobilia.com) was introduced in January 1999 with 2,000 items, and within a week had 17,000 items for sale. It now has about 20,000.
Driving the craze, however, is something less tangible and more potent than potential profit or equity: dreams. "We're not selling cars; we're selling memories, bringing collectors back to a gentler time in their lives," said Lewis Checchia, who develops and markets die-cast miniature cars as director of marketing for the Franklin Mint, which has issued more than 300 castings since the early 1980's. "They might remember when they were out with their brother, saw a '63 Corvette on the sales lot for the first time and went crazy."
Bob Knudsen, a potato farmer in American Falls, Idaho, started collecting full-size vintage Pontiac Super Duty cars. He then bought a closed-down car dealership to house his cars. Then came showroom paraphernalia -- and a new mania. "I wanted some signs, so I bought some neon, a Pontiac sign with the big Indian, which goes way back to the 30's and 40's," Mr. Knudsen said. He said that he has spent about $400,000 in the last five years on signs.
Stephen Babinsky, who restores antique cars in Bernardsville, N.J., experienced a similar quantum leap. He said he started out with porcelain signs and trinkets. "Then I got into rarer signs, like car manufacturers from the 1920's, like United Motors, a General Motors subsidiary," Mr. Babinsky said.
His prize? A Cadillac LaSalle authorized sales and service sign from the late 20's, one of only three such signs known in the United States. He still relishes this "steal" -- misidentified as a reproduction at a Christie's auction three or four years ago. "Even back then, it was worth, maybe, $7,500," Mr. Babinsky said. "I paid $2,000." The sign is valued at $10,000.
Objects that once beckoned travelers or children have gone beyond collectibles to objets d'art. The Museum of Miniatures, across from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wilshire Boulevard, features a 396-piece exhibition of die-cast miniatures from the Franklin and Danbury Mints, on loan from a collector. The collection, with an estimated worth of $64,000, takes up an entire room.
"Men just love it," said Carole Kaye, a cofounder of the museum. "Actually, women, too. They really study them."
But automobilia has humbler roots than the Miracle Mile district of Wilshire Boulevard. "The original stuff came from gas stations and dealerships that were boarded up," Ms. Dunbar said. "Signs and cans would be stored in people's attics or basements." Collectors, she said, "would scour junkyards and scrap yards, abandoned dealerships and gas stations, and often would be given the items." Or they would take them.
But when items started turning up at yard sales, flea markets and at auctions, a market was created. "Once it was determined that these pieces had value, less and less were out there for the taking," she said.
Car-memorabilia collecting has been through five cycles, said Ms. Dunbar, who has published three books on the hobby. "The first generation of collectors were in the automotive business, former dealers, repair or auto-body shops, or worked for a large car company," she said.
The first wave, she said, came in the late 60's and early 70's, when the bulk of collectibles was miniature cars and vintage memorabilia. The second cycle appeared in the late 70's, after the oil embargo. Collectors, Ms. Dunbar said, welcomed to their ranks lawyers, doctors and self-employed business people with disposable income and a passion for automobiles. Toys also entered the mix.
The third generation, from 1983 to 1985, experienced an influx of collectors, flush with Wall Street money, who drove up prices. As the hobby gained recognition, the next generation, 1988 to 1991, may have exhibited "the biggest leap in prices," Ms. Dunbar said.
Automobilia was quiet from 1991 to 1995, Ms. Dunbar said. But in 1995, it entered its fifth cycle, and has been rising steadily since, she said.
Today, collectors are "anyone from Joe Six-Pack to a doctor," said Evie Black-Dykema, a senior industry analyst with Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass. "Most prevalent is the lower-than-average-income collector," she said. "They may be willing to spend a few thousand in a weekend that reminds them of their youth."
The nostalgia epicenter is the baby boomers, who grew up as cars came into their own as a mass-market, affordable entity. "Thirty-something is when people start collecting," said Mr. Checchia, of the Franklin Mint.
As collectors age, the epicenter shifts. "And the next generation will want its own artifacts," Ms. Dunbar said. Maybe they will covet replicas of farm equipment.
Farm collectibles took off at the start of this decade. A leading player is Racing Champions-Ertl, based in Iowa and known for its high-end replicas of the John Deere tractors, balers and such. The company sells about 500 models at any one time. Prices range from $5 to $150, based on size.
Then there is Nascar collecting. Mr. Killorin, of Mobilia, said he estimated that it constitutes a third of the market. "It's gone from a standing start to the checkered flag," he added. "I have a 9-year-old boy who cares about Nascar, motorcycles and pickup trucks. I know he's not alone."

HEADLINE: More Speed? Power? Now Drivers Can Have It Their Way

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE; David J. Wallace is a Boston writer who covers business and technology.

 BODY:
ONE winter several years ago, Jim Conforti of Bonneville, Utah, had trouble getting his BMW 325i to start. At an altitude of 4,000 feet, the pre-programmed fuel mixture flooded the car's spark plugs when temperatures hovered near 32 degrees.
Mr. Conforti, a software engineer, was puzzled and set out to chart the fuel mixture programmed for the car. He adjusted it to a leaner setting, and the car started up promptly thereafter. Eventually, Mr. Conforti decided to open a sideline business, Bonneville Motor Werks (the German spelling is deliberate), to create and sell high-performance parts for BMW's that are "reverse engineered" from factory specifications. 
 Bonneville is one of dozens of companies, along with uncounted individual motoring enthusiasts, that are fine-tuning engines to meet personal needs -- that is, redoing or undoing the work of car manufacturers.
Such tinkering is growing, thanks to the On-Board Diagnostic II system, known as O.B.D.-II, a computer the size of a paperback book that has been installed in every car sold in the United States since 1996.
As happens so often with new technologies, O.B.D. has spawned an industry of its own. Reprogramming cars by tweaking the computer's chips has evolved from a hobby to a multimillion-dollar business. Companies like Dinan Motorsports in Mountain View, Calif., tout high-performance chips. Web sites provide detailed instructions on how, for a few hundred dollars, car owners can swap the chip boxes themselves and turn their sedan into a speed demon.
Where shade-tree mechanics once adjusted carburetor fuel mixtures and timing by working under the hood with hand tools, now any computer equipped with the proper programs can read, reprogram and change a car's performance.
By remapping some data points, torque settings can be reprogrammed, horsepower can be increased, and top speeds, limited electronically at the factory, can be extended. On the other hand, a parent might want to control speed, not increase it to prevent, say, a teenager from exceeding 55 miles per hour. One man in Michigan, who bought a Ford Mustang police car programmed for high-performance highway driving, recently asked an online chat group how to reset the car for a calmer ride.
"In some cases, people will have a drivability issue they want to solve, not just more power," said Mr. Conforti, who has a patent application pending on a small device that can change BMW settings from normal to high performance and back again. "One car has a tendency to slowly decelerate when you hit the clutch and it hangs -- the idle control valve seems to open or electronic throttle takes over -- which makes for smooth shifting. But for people who have to hold the clutch, it can be annoying waiting for the revs to match up. For those drivers, maybe the problem can be tuned out."
Factory settings are designed to be forgiving, accommodating a wide range of drivers and behaviors. For example, some drivers do not use the proper high-octane gasoline when prices rise; others don't change the oil on time. Factory presets allow the car to compensate for such variables. But reprogrammed cars can lack that flexibility, causing the engine to be damaged by seemingly innocent corner cutting.
Michael Vaughn, a spokesman for the Ford Motor Company, warns that changing settings could void a car's warranty and affect engine durability. Reprogramming a car can also strain its brakes, tires, suspension and other parts.
Nonetheless, there is nothing illegal about changing a car's performance, as long as the vehicle passes state inspection and emissions tests, and reprogramming is not likely to render a car unsafe. In fact, car company engineers are watching the so-called aftermarket carefully for solutions to problems they might not have considered, or improvements for ambitious drivers. All this makes for an uneasy truce between car manufacturers and those who want to change their hard work.
At heart, O.B.D.-II is the car's brain: it monitors various systems to ensure peak performance, and has become a crucial diagnostic aid for mechanics.
The system was originally intended to control emissions. In the mid-1980's, carmakers began using electronics to manage engine functions that affect emissions, like idle settings and fuel mixture. California was the first state to mandate use of the O.B.D. system, recognizing the benefit of controlling pollution through computerized controls. National standardization of O.B.D. by the federal Environmental Protection Agency followed in 1993.
Oxygen sensors, knock sensors and other tiny tools let the car "learn" how well its pollution-control system is working. The engine then adjusts to different temperatures, altitudes and other conditions to ensure optimal emission control, fuel economy and overall performance.
To most dashboard watchers, the O.B.D. system is apparent only when the red or orange "Check Engine" light glows. After a few miles, it might go out, just as unexpectedly as it came on. Problem solved: the car's sensors reported a change in operation and corrected it by adjusting a setting. Sometimes, however, when a part is wearing out or already broken, the "Check Engine" light is stubborn.
The computer tucks away a few kilobytes of data about the problem that caused the light to go on. It will then divulge details about the vehicle's operation to a mechanic with a scanning tool. Depending on the car manufacturer, the diagnostic tools and the system itself, up to 300 facts can be stored about a car, including the maximum speed it was driven, the engine's peak r.p.m. level, emission levels and the condition of sensors throughout the vehicle. Mechanics can plug a sensor into a small jack near the driver's seat, download a file that taps the O.B.D.-II chip's memory and use the data to locate, identify and repair what is wrong.
The increasingly intricate electronic connections throughout cars are making replacement parts more expensive, and the sophisticated O.B.D. system has complicated the mission of more than a few manufacturers -- from NAPA Auto Parts, which makes basic replacement-part items, to makers of high-performance exhaust, fuel injection and air filter systems.
"Now that we're monitoring performance of parts or systems through the emissions system, they're concerned their part may not be compatible and cause the 'Check Engine' light to come on," said John Trajnowski, principal engineer with vehicle and environmental engineering at Ford.
Original-equipment manufacturers are cautiously sharing engineering details, without drawing the curtain too wide. They are keen to know where chip tuners are able to improve performance and eager to capitalize on the market.
"We've set up a system where aftermarket part manufacturers work through a third party, enabling them to make parts that comply without giving up proprietary information," Mr. Trajnowski said. "They can market their part, and our trade secrets won't get out to G.M. or Toyota -- things like how we run the engine, how we do the monitoring, control timing, fuel, etc. We wouldn't want that leaked to our competitors."
Security has also been an issue for car owners. Paul Olsen, an electrical engineer with B&B Electronics Manufacturing Corporation in Ottawa, Ill., which builds the diagnostic tools that read the chips, recalls the conspiracy theories that bubbled up when the O.B.D. system first came out.
Motorists feared that mechanics would invade their privacy by sharing information about driving habits with manufacturers, who might void their warranties, or with law-enforcement officials, who might note the driver's need to speed. The fear has apparently not been realized.
"People were concerned about privacy and Big Brother, but now look at it more favorably," said Mr. Olsen, who has created a Web site devoted to O.B.D. (www.obdii.com) for mechanics and curious car owners. But Bob Redding, a lobbyist for the Automotive Service Association, which represents auto repair businesses, wrote an article recently for its Web site about one Orwellian possibility. He pointed out that the technology exists to monitor the onboard computers of eight lanes of traffic traveling, theoretically, bumper to bumper at 100 m.p.h. By remote, computers could scan each car for the code indicating excess emissions.
Drivers with cellular phones, he posited, might then receive a call telling them the bad news: they had just flunked an emissions test.

HEADLINE: Caught Between Payday and Principle

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU 

 BODY:
When she was a securities broker in Florida for the NationsBank Corporation in the early 1990's, Catherine Hovis knew that the elderly clients she was selling mutual funds to did not have the financial or emotional means to take on risky investments. One couple, both in their 70's, were living on Social Security and wanted something as safe as a certificate of deposit but with a better return -- maybe 7 to 8 percent.
Ms. Hovis convinced the couple that the bank's mutual funds were safe and, at her bosses' urging, reassured them they had made a smart investment even after the value of the funds declined. 
 Today, Ms. Hovis, 43, acknowledges that she had begun to suspect the mutual funds were not as solid as bank management had led her to believe. Yet, she continued to sell them to risk-averse elderly clients because, she says, she was doing what her bosses told her to do. She was also motivated by her supervisor's praise, a six-figure salary, financial bonuses and a free trip to the Cayman Islands, becoming one of the top 25 sellers of the funds for NationsBank, now part of Bank of America.
"Money makes people do very strange things," Ms. Hovis said. "As a single mother, I was willing to do what I had to do." Besides, she added: "I'm human. I wanted to be a team player."
The practice of pressuring the elderly to buy mutual funds, which Ms. Hovis said was pervasive throughout the bank, led to a $29 million class-action settlement by NationsBank in 1997 with people who had been sold the funds. Despite the settlement, the bank vigorously denied the assertions in the suit. Last week, bank officials declined to comment on Ms. Hovis's assertions.
As she describes it, her moral plight was unusually stark. But the basic choice she faced between her paycheck and her principles is one that most workers eventually encounter. And with hordes of people now fixated on stock market riches and million-dollar game shows, ethicists warn that ordinary Americans are having an even harder time holding on to their moral bearings.
The transgressions that tempt them can be as seemingly trivial as fudging an expense report and as troubling as lying to law enforcement officials to protect their boss. Sometimes, they make headlines, as happened this year when Christopher M. Davidge, a former chief executive of the Christie's auction house, was said to have told government investigators that Sir Anthony Tennant, a former chairman, had ordered him to carry out a price-fixing scheme.
"Most people just go along with what other people do and respond to the expectations of those around them," said David Vogel, an ethics professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. "This encourages and permits ethically dubious behavior."
Paradoxically, the tight labor market -- which logically ought to diminish worries about job security -- might actually encourage ethical lapses, some experts say. "In a rising economy, you don't want to be left out," said William Lundin, author of "When Smart People Work for Dumb Bosses" (McGraw-Hill, 1998). "To be at the big table and play with the big guys, you take chances and risks, and bend your ethics."
Many companies have adopted codes of conduct and other ethics programs in recent years. Yet, a new survey by the consulting and accounting firm KPMG shows that unethical behavior is still rife in the workplace. The survey of 2,300 workers in a broad range of industries was conducted in 1999 and released last week. More than three-quarters of the respondents had witnessed illegal activities or breaches of company rules over the previous 12 months, and 38 percent said they believed that senior managers would "authorize illegal or unethical conduct to meet business goals." Factors that they said encouraged unethical behavior included the pressure to meet unrealistic production and earnings goals.
"We're still seeing fairly significant levels of misconduct," said Richard Girgenti, KPMG's national director of investigative and integrity management services. "Ethics programs need attention and nurturing."
Crossing certain ethical boundaries may be endemic to certain industries. In a recent survey by the trade journal PR Week of 1,700 public-relations executives, 25 percent acknowledged lying on the job, 39 percent said they had exaggerated the truth, and 44 percent said they had ethical qualms about tasks they had been asked to perform.
A common catalyst for wrongful behavior is common to every industry: blind devotion to a boss. Nan DeMars, an ethics consultant in Minneapolis, cited an Atlanta secretary who, trusting her boss, notarized a document for the sale of his wife's car without witnessing the wife's signature -- a breach of the law -- because he insisted it was hers. It wasn't, the wife said in a lawsuit, and the secretary ended up with a felony conviction.
Richard O. Mason, head of the Maguire Center for Ethics and Public Responsibility at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said that people guilty of ethical missteps usually have a "moment of truth" in which they either decide to rationalize their behavior or try to make amends.
Ms. Hovis is trying to make amends. "I paid for the blood money," she said, fighting tears. "All the calls and cries for help" from clients gave her sleepless nights, she said, and led to occasional heavy drinking.
She decided in 1994 she did not want to sell the funds anymore and soon left the bank. Since then, she said, she has cooperated with federal and state regulators, including testifying to the Securities and Exchange Commission. On top of the $29 million class-action settlement, in 1998 NationsBank agreed to pay $6.75 million to settle charges by the S.E.C. and other regulators that it had misled investors about their investment risks. NationsBank neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
"It's the least I can do to repay my part of what I did," said Ms. Hovis, who is now trying to make a career out of teaching financial education. "When I'm dead and gone, at least my son will say, 'My mom tried.' "

Chart: "The Ethics Audit"
Five questions you should ask yourself if your boss wants you to do something that doesn't seem quite right:
 
1. Would you be ashamed to tell your spouse or children you did it?
2. Would you mind if the local newspaper reported that you had done it?
3. Would you be upset if somebody else did it to you?
4. Is it legal?
5. Are you tempted to seize on rationalizations like "Everyone else is doing it" and "It won't hurt anyone?"

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Civic Theater: Shakespeare, O'Casey And Ventura

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, May 14

 BODY:
Last weekend Austin, Minn., a pleasant, if not exactly mythical city of 22,000, two hours south of here, had a visit from a number of sprites, fairies, gods and foolish Athenians, as the Guthrie Theater's traveling production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" ensconced itself in the high school auditorium.
It was the penultimate stop on a 17-city tour through the northern Midwest, the first time the Minneapolis-based Guthrie, one of the nation's most prominent regional theaters, had toured a show since the mid-1980's, when funds from the National Endowment for the Arts dried up. It provided a rare opportunity for Austin, which proudly declares itself Spamtown U.S.A., a homage to its leading corporate citizen, Hormel Foods. And the locals took advantage; nearly a quarter of Austin's population attended the four performances. 
 The production, staged by the Guthrie's artistic director, Joe Dowling, and featuring a number of young actors the Guthrie has developed in its summertime pre-professional program, was no skimpy road show. It was a three-hour extravaganza, full of inviting theatrics: colorful sets, gaudily witty costumes, lighting wizardry, gymnastic choreography, Shakespearean verse set to doo-wop and disco music, and not least, in a broad satire that no one in Austin (or anyone who has seen the film "Fargo") could fail to appreciate, the commoner craftsmen, Shakespeare's goofy, would-be thespians, done up as dimwitted Minnesotans.
O.K, it wouldn't have played so well at Lincoln Center. The acting was uneven -- a lot of youthful overenthusiasm there -- and the overall concept, which placed the denizens of Theseus' palace in modern dress and the denizens of the forest in outfits that would have made them comfortable in the "Star Wars" wookie bar, took "anything goes" as its through line. Most egregiously, the "Pyramus and Thisbe" skit was milked for far too much slapstick and for far too long. But at least two young performers, Cheyenne Casebier as Helena and Randy Reyes as Puck, had the glow of genuine talent, and Shawn Hamilton, an experienced actor in regional theater, provided authoritative ballast as Theseus and Oberon.
Mr. Dowling has a gift for moving actors effectively around the stage, and his purpose in emptying his substantial bag of tricks was wonderfully achieved: to make the theater a place of welcome, with Shakespeare the friendly host and teacher. It would be hard to imagine better theater in a high school auditorium. And to judge from the lusty standing ovation at the end of Friday night's show, it was much appreciated. Indeed, the show's reception in Austin couldn't have been a more timely demonstration of popular support for the Guthrie, whose ambition is currently both on display and at issue.
Best known for its full-throttle productions of classics in its home theater -- its current show, "The Plough and the Stars" by Sean O'Casey, is exemplary -- the Guthrie, founded in 1963, has, since Mr. Dowling arrived in 1996, reached high-water marks, with more than 32,000 current subscribers and nearly $50 million in endowment, making it one of the nation's healthiest theater companies. But it has been restricted by its building, which is attached to the Walker Art Center and has only one performance space, a 1,300-seat auditorium with a thrust stage. It has been unable to compete in the ever more necessary enterprise of developing new work, and its lack of a proscenium stage has limited its ability to transfer shows to commercial houses or engage in co-productions with other regional companies.
Plans for a new, three-theater building have been in the works for several years. Now the search is about to begin for an architect for a site on the banks of the Mississippi in Minneapolis that had once been considered by the city for a new baseball stadium. But for months the Guthrie has been the focus of a political debate over whether the public should help pay for a project estimated at $100 million.
The Guthrie expects to complete the building for the 2004-2005 season, with or without government money. But its initial request to the state for $25 million was whittled down by legislators wary of Gov. Jesse Ventura's antipathy toward government spending on the arts and by newspaper polls that indicated public opinion was uncertain about whether the Guthrie, a nonprofit institution, was of statewide value -- more worthy than, say, a private enterprise like the Minnesota Twins -- or merely a crown for the arts-rich Twin Cities. A bonding bill that would have provided the Guthrie with $3 million in state funds was delivered to Governor Ventura by legislators on Friday. He struck that provision in a line-item veto on Monday; a legislative override is still possible.
It's an odd position for an arts institution to be arguing for itself in the political arena. But Mr. Dowling, an Irishman who is a former artistic director of the Abbey Theater in Dublin, admits to an obsession with politics; he and his wife have applied for citizenship, he said, in the hope of voting in November. He has been busy with the Guthrie's own campaign lately, pointing out, in interviews, meetings with legislators and letters to the editor, the economic benefits to the state from the construction project and noting that 100,000 children attended Guthrie performances free or with privately subsidized tickets last year.
Governor Ventura has never been to the Guthrie for a performance; he's not a theater guy, though there is a musical in the works based on his life as a wrestler turned populist politician, a production of which, Mr. Dowling joked, might help the Guthrie in its fund drive. Had the governor attended over the weekend -- he was fishing -- he would have seen what Mr. Dowling has been up to in his spare time, directing "The Plough and the Stars," O'Casey's portrait, both acrid and affectionate, of Dublin's working class during the turbulent days of the failed citizens' revolt of 1916 against the ruling British, known as the Easter Rising.
Viewing "Midsummer" and "Plough" on consecutive nights, one gets a sense of Mr. Dowling's expansive notion of theater as well as his directorial style. The set for "Plough," by Mr. Dowling's longtime collaborator, Frank Hallinan Flood (he also designed "Midsummer"), is magnificent, a sooty brick tenement front stretching across the back of the thrust stage, with windows lighted and laundry dangling on clotheslines.
An archway between the two wings of the tenement forms a proscenium of sorts, beneath which actors enter from the surrounding Dublin neighborhood in some scenes; for others, whole interior sets -- two apartments and a barroom -- emerge from it on rollers. Behind it the revolt itself, which fills the play's second half, is replete with the light and sound of gunfire, as though a Hollywood movie were being shot just out of view. Mr. Dowling is not stingy with effects.
O'Casey's tenement is aswarm with neighborly conflict, both personal and political, already simmering in poverty and ready to boil in the crucible of imminent revolution. In scene after scene Mr. Dowling sets his large cast -- there are nine principal roles and a substantial company -- in perpetual motion. They dance, threaten, fight, embrace, rally round the flag -- or flags, since one character, has a son serving the crown in World War I -- as their loyalties to one another shift in an increasingly violent milieu.
The cast, alas, is uneven, many with a tenuous hold on the Irish accent that gives a particular poignancy to O'Casey's characteristic poetics. (The contemporary playwright that comes closest to O'Casey's vernacular music of a particular time and place is August Wilson.)
Mr. Dowling has emphasized the hardness of these people, the beleaguered quality that makes them prone to aggravated selfishness, and as a result the American actors often miss the aching romanticism that lies moribund in them but not dead. This is particularly true of Michelle O'Neill and Lee Mark Nelson as Mary and Jack Clitheroe, the young married couple whose once-enviable romance has withered with the rise of Jack's call to patriotism. A climactic tug of war -- when a pleading and pregnant Mary tries to pull Jack away from a wounded comrade -- is staged to squeeze the heart, but the actors don't seem as agonized as they do argumentative.
Happily the show is anchored by the weight of real Irish -- Milo O'Shea as the carpenter Fluther Good, whose live-and-let-drink approach to life has hardened into a sad and self-deluding pride, and the superb Rosaleen Linehan as Bessie Burgess, a bitterly lonesome British loyalist whose humanity is forced to the surface when the revolution visits her living room.
In the production's most affecting scenes, each takes command. Just before intermission Mr. Dowling stages a barroom waltz between Fluther and the prostitute Rosie Redmond (a stirring character turn by Derdriu Ring), which wends its way into the street into the last moments of a political rally that has been commandeered by a demagogue's call to arms. The drunken dancers, unsuited to each other except out of fear and loneliness, twirl obliviously about Jack Clitheroe, whose face is fixed in soldierly anger. Mr. O'Shea's yearning for a private peace brings the lights down with a sweet dream that is clearly a portent of doom.
At the end of the play, when that doom finds Bessie in her own home, O'Casey's tragedy is complete. She bleeds from a gunshot, calling out for help to Mary, who has gone mad; it is a moment of purposefully high melodrama. Ms. Linehan conjures Bessie's death, not with dignity or fear but with sadness and resentment, understanding that she, a worthy woman, is a victim of senselessness. It's a sensational sequence that highlights an actor's probing and craft, a textbook example of subtle thinking and precise performance that makes an audience feel, snapping down the benevolent jaws of the theatrical trap. And that, after all, is what Mr. Dowling and the Guthrie wish to accomplish.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: Return of the Native Executive;
Many Repatriations Fail, at Huge Cost to Companies

BYLINE: By JOBERT E. ABUEVA 

 BODY:
At the height of the Asian financial crisis in 1998, Scott Fedje, an art director for a Fortune 500 apparel manufacturer, returned to his company's headquarters in the northwestern United States from a five-year stint in Hong Kong. Even though he got a promotion and a pay increase as a reward for his overseas performance, Mr. Fedje resigned a few months later to take a job with a design-consulting firm in San Francisco.
"I felt lost," said Mr. Fedje (fed-GEE), who asked that his former employer not be identified. "Most of us who returned went from a position of high responsibility and a dynamic environment to a cubicle, a project and a whole month to make a single decision." He missed old colleagues who had moved on, he said, and he longed for the kind of cultural stimulation he had found in Asia. So when he was offered work in the Bay Area, he grabbed it, and now he heads the retail design division of the firm, Landor Associates. 
 Call it the exodus of the returned expatriates. Every year, thousands of executives like Mr. Fedje arrive home from foreign postings and bolt to greener pastures, often at a cost to their employers of $1 million or more that was invested in training and overseas expenses. Dr. J. Stewart Black, managing director of the Center for Global Assignments, a consulting firm based in San Diego that works with executives going and coming from abroad, said that two-thirds of the returning executives and their family members he had interviewed described repatriation as a more wrenching experience than the overseas postings themselves. "It's a staggering statistic and problematic for employers," he said.
Just as alarming for corporations is the defection rate of returning managers. Twenty-five percent leave within a year, double the proportion of departures by those who never go abroad, Dr. Black said. And the returned managers who leave typically go to the competition.
Dr. Black cited an extreme case of a company that over a two-year period lost every manager it had sent on international assignments within 12 months of their return -- 25 people in all. The company "might just as well have written a check for $50 million and tossed it to the winds," he said.
The biggest shock for managers fresh from foreign postings appears to be the change in their status from a big frog in a small pond to a small frog in a big one. Many also discover that the skills they acquired overseas, and the acquaintances they cultivated, are of little use to them now.
"It has left me depressed," said an executive at a large transportation company who came back to the United States at the end of last year after spending four years in Southeast Asia. The executive, who insisted on anonymity, added that he now felt like "just another cog in a bureaucratic wheel."
Family members can also go through reverse culture shock, compounding the pressure on the breadwinner. When her husband was sent back to the United States after two years in Tokyo for a small semiconductor company, Sylvia Dickinson of Menlo Park, Calif., felt out of sorts and concerned about her daughter's adjustment to American schools.
"People did not want to hear about our life abroad after two seconds," she said. "It's difficult to simply shut out a life-transforming experience like that. You don't just pick up where you left off either."
Her husband, Tom, worked on ad hoc projects until he was recruited away by Cirrus Logic, a competitor that she said now capitalizes on his international background. She has capitalized on it, too, starting Dickinson Consulting, a firm that counsels outbound and returning executives and their families. "Having been there and back, I can offer an empathetic ear," Ms. Dickinson said.
So, what do companies do to hold onto their talent? Robert Greenleaf, executive director at TMC, a consulting firm in Princeton, N.J., that specializes in preparing executives for overseas posts, says rule No. 1 is to write down, in clear terms, what they expect the departing executives to achieve abroad and what they expect them to do when they come back.
Dr. Black cited companies like Monsanto that start thinking about next assignments for expatriates three to six months before they return. At Monsanto, two senior officials with international experience assess the skills that the overseas executive has gained on the tour of duty and review the job openings that are available. At the same time, the returning executive writes a report, assessing his skills and describing his career goals. The three then meet to decide his future.
Paul Kocourek, a senior partner at Booz, Allen & Hamilton, knows about repatriation. He went through it three times, after stints with the Peace Corps in Thailand in the 1970's, Bain & Company in Tokyo in the 80's and Booz, Allen in Australia in the late 80's and most of the 90's.
His familiarity with the process enabled him to draw up a short list of hints for making a successful re-entry. The returning expatriate, he said, should try flying home a number of times during the final stages of the overseas stay to cement relationships with people in the home office, meet with clients and discuss a future role in the company. And the executive should ensure that clients and projects are properly handed over to the overseas successor.
"Maintaining one's network and having a mentor or sponsor back at headquarters to keep tabs on you helps," Mr. Kocourek said.
Re-entry can be especially wrenching if the home office has more or less forgotten about you. That is what Deborah Burks, a 37-year-old Chicago executive, said happened to her. Ms. Burks was dispatched to Hong Kong in 1998 to build a regional presence for the digital-media division of a Fortune 500 chemicals company based on the West Coast. But despite what she said were significant inroads that she had made, the company decided to halt its expansion effort there.
"There was neither a contingency nor any accountability within the division or company," Ms. Burks said.
She returned last year to Chicago, where she had been posted before -- except that now she ended up in an office with little to do. She had sold her Chicago home, believing she would be away for an extended period, and had to shop for a place to stay. Her company told her of jobs available in a small town in Ohio, but she decided not to pursue them. In the end, she found a job as a director for new business development at R. R. Donnelley & Sons. She is not bitter, she said, and in fact believes that her international experience taught her invaluable skills in coping with changes in the corporate world.
"I would still do it over again but be more mentally prepared for the risk," she said.
As for employers, the best thing they can do to keep returning stars is to keep channels of communication open even long after an overseas assignment has been completed.
"If an executive is feeling unease, he should be able to speak up and have a nonthreatening forum to do so in," said Dennis Kaminsky, who spent two tours of duty in Japan for the plastics division of the General Electric Company.
"Coming home is always a wonderful feeling," Mr. Kaminsky said. "It's having the environment to express this and any other feelings that can make a world of difference."

HEADLINE: Profit Up at 2 Retailers, but Penney Drops

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A robust economy kept shoppers in the buying mood in the first quarter, lifting sales and profits at two big retailers that reported results yesterday.
But the J. C. Penney Company reported sharply lower profits before charges amid trouble at its department stores. Nonetheless, its results beat Wall Street estimates. 
 The Target Corporation's earnings topped expectations, fueled by strong demand at its discount stores, while a strong housing market increased Home Depot's profits as shoppers bought supplies to renovate their homes.
J. C. Penney, based in Plano, Tex., said its profits from operations fell 51 percent, to $82 million, or 28 cents a diluted share, compared with net income of $167 million, or 67 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Analysts had expected the company to earn 23 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
The operating profit did not include costs associated with the closing of about 40 Penney and 289 Eckerd drugstores. Including those and other special charges, the company lost $118 million, or 48 cents a share.
Sales rose to $7.7 billion from $7.5 billion.
The earnings slide comes as the retailer struggles to get its business back on track. Penney has closed many underperforming stores, sold some noncore businesses, overhauled merchandise buying and hired more outside executives.
"We don't expect a meaningful pickup in sales until the first quarter of 2001," Vanessa Castagna, the company's chief operating officer, told analysts.
Shares of J. C. Penney fell 37.5 cents, to $18.375.
At Target, based in Minneapolis, profit rose 23 percent, to $239 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $194 million, or 41 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
The results topped Wall Street estimates of 49 cents a share.
Sales at the company, which changed its name this year from the Dayton Hudson Corporation, rose 8 percent, to $7.61 billion from $7.03 billion.
Sales at its Target discount stores open at least a year, an industry gauge of performance, increased 4.7 percent, while comparable-store sales at the department stores dropped 4.9 percent and 1.8 percent at Mervyn's.
Shares of Target rose 43.75 cents, to $71.4375.
Earnings at Home Depot, based in Atlanta, gained 29 percent, to $629 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $489 million, or 21 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
Sales rose 24 percent, to $11.1 billion from $8.95 billion.
The company's results met Wall Street estimates.
Shares of Home Depot fell $2.9375, to $53.50.

HEADLINE: Statement by Fed Panel

 BODY:
Following is the text of the statement by the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy panel, after its decision yesterday to raise short-term interest rates:
The Federal Open Market Committee voted today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 6 1/2 percent. In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate to 6 percent. 
 Increases in demand have remained in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply, exerting continued pressure on resources. The committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance.
Against the background of its long-term goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information already available, the committee believes the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond and San Francisco. The discount rate is the rate charged depository institutions when they borrow short-term adjustment credit from their district Federal Reserve Banks.

HEADLINE: Saudi Reports $1 Billion of Investments

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, May 16

 BODY:
Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia said today that he had spent $1 billion buying shares in 15 American companies, including Amazon.com, WorldCom, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and AT&T.
"We bought all these companies, which are here for the long run, after their share prices had collapsed by as much as 70 percent," Prince Walid said. "We are not old economy; we are not new economy; we go everywhere there is value and growth potential." 
 Prince Walid, who is a nephew of King Fahd and one of the wealthiest people in the world, regularly makes investments in companies with strong brand names and lagging share prices.
The prince spent $200 million on WorldCom shares, the single biggest investment, followed by AT&T with $150 million.
The remainder was divided into $50 million portions and shared among Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, McDonald's, Walt Disney, Ford Motor, Gillette, Procter & Gamble, Amazon, eBay, Internet Capital Group, Priceline.com, Infospace and DoubleClick.
"Between December 1999 and February 2000, everyone deserted old-world stocks and went into the Internet, causing all these old established companies to crash, and I emphasize crashed, so I bought slowly but surely," Prince Walid said. "In April and May, everybody abandoned the Internet stocks and went back into the old world. Then Internet shares crashed, so I went in there."
The purchases increase the prince's technology, media and telecommunications portfolio to $7.8 billion, with technology amounting to $2.814 billion; media to $3.869 billion; and telecommunications to $1.115 billion.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Fed's Rate Increase Fails to Dampen Rally on Wall St.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks held onto early gains yesterday after the Federal Reserve announced its sixth interest-rate increase since last June. Investors snapped up stocks on the hope that the Fed is succeeding in keeping inflation under control, although market analysts warned that rates would continue to rise.
The Fed raised interest rates by half a percentage point, the steepest increase in five years, saying the rapidly growing economy "could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance." 
 The rate increase was widely expected, so after a brief tumble in the wake of the Fed's announcement, stocks resumed a "relief rally." The Dow Jones industrial average rose 126.79 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,934.57.
Broader stock indicators also closed higher. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 109.92 points, or 3.1 percent, to 3,717.57. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 13.68 points, to 1,466.04.
Yesterday's rally was the fourth consecutive day of market gains as investors have convinced themselves that a half-point rise would bring the Fed close to the end of a long run of rate increases.
Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch, argued that many investors were also hoping to capitalize on a pattern of market rallies in the sessions after previous rate increases.
"The market has been improving since last Thursday on very little fundamental good news," he said. "Volume has been low and the broadness of the advance has not been that great, so that raises questions about the rally's staying power."
Stocks rose from the start of trading after the Labor Department offered some evidence that the five previous rate increases may be succeeding in holding inflation down. The Consumer Price Index, after rising sharply for two months, held steady in April as energy prices posted their first decline in almost a year.
The report raised hopes on Wall Street that the Fed would not have to raise rates sharply throughout the rest of this year. Analysts were less sure.
"The Fed was on the verge of falling behind the curve," said Chris Conkey, chief investment officer at Evergreen Investment Management in Boston. "This is a great step in terms of getting ahead of the curve, but we foresee more increases later this year."
Analysts said stocks of every sort, from new-economy technology companies to old-economy industrial and consumer stocks, will face pressure if interest rates continue rising.
Higher rates threaten corporate profits by making it more expensive to borrow money.
What is more, with six weeks before the Fed's next meeting and about two months before most companies report second-quarter earnings, investors may struggle to find reasons to buy stocks, analysts said.
"We may be laying ground for a better rally in June or July, but I don't think we're at the starting point for that yet," Mr. McCabe said.
The stock market drew some additional strength from Abby Joseph Cohen, chief investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs, who told an Economic Strategy Institute conference that she anticipates "good returns, not necessarily abnormally large returns" from the stock market this year.

HEADLINE: Sicuani Journal;
An Outsider in Peru, but at Home in the Inca World

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: SICUANI, Peru, May 13

 BODY:
Alejandro Toledo, running an uphill campaign for president of Peru, has been lagging behind President Alberto K. Fujimori among Indian women, despite his strong Indian features.
So when Mr. Toledo arrived in Sicuani, a town 12,000 feet high in the Andes known for its Indian markets for llama skins and alpaca wool, he warmed up the crowd in the central plaza by handing the microphone to his wife, Eliane Karp. 
 As a strawberry blond, Belgian-born, naturalized American, Ms. Karp seems like an odd campaign weapon in Peru. But she speaks the ancient Inca language of Quechua and she is one fiery speaker.
"There has not been a good government for 500 years!" Ms. Karp bellowed, in a blanket attack on every ruler of Peru since the Spanish conquered the Inca empire in the 16th century. "Do not be fearful and do not listen to the liars. With the force of the Inca, Alejandro can create a great government!"
The crowd cheered wildly, seemingly not caring that Ms. Karp's Quechua, like her Spanish, is inflected with her native French. Ms. Karp looks more like a tourist than a Peruvian, but few Peruvians know their country's traditions and its Huayno folk dances better than she does. All of this makes her one of Mr. Toledo's potent political assets.
Peruvian politics tend to be highly idiosyncratic and unpredictable, and the current election has been no exception with all its charges of fraud and extreme nastiness in the news media. But perhaps the most unusual ingredient of the campaign so far has been Ms. Karp, a 46-year-old anthropologist who says she found her political identity in her Jewish roots.
"My vision of Judaism is one of light and justice that is totally impossible to reconcile with dictatorship," she said in an interview, adding that one turning point of her life was her becoming interested in indigenous cultures while studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in the early 1970's. "I learned in Israel that you don't take no for an answer," she said.
The other turning point in Ms. Karp's life was meeting Mr. Toledo in 1975 when they were students at Stanford University. They have had a stormy marriage marked by years of separation but finally a firm political alliance. "Alejandro and I think together on the pillow at night," she said, "just as we did in university when we used to go to the pinball machine to figure things out when I had problems with my dissertation."
Now she says she plans to break the mold of Peruvian first ladies. She wants to use the experience she had as a consultant for the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development to remake agricultural production in Peru, using many of the techniques that have made the Israeli desert bloom.
Ms. Karp's open ambition and her outspoken criticism of machismo and espousal of feminist causes have opened her up to charges that she is a foreign interloper and a wild-eyed leftist. Newspapers that support Mr. Fujimori have written much about their marital problems, contending that she and Mr. Toledo are actually divorced -- a charge she denied. "She shouldn't intervene in Peruvian politics," said Francisco Tudela, Mr. Fujimori's vice presidential running mate. "She is not a Peruvian."
But whenever Mr. Toledo is in trouble, he turns to his wife. When a report surfaced two months ago that he had an illegitimate daughter whom he refused to support, it was Ms. Karp who denied the charge on a television talk show, saying, "I know the man I am sleeping with."
In the days after the first-round vote on April 9, as charges of fraud mounted, Mr. Toledo and Ms. Karp spoke to the masses from the roof of a Lima hotel. Her words were particularly explosive, with a reference that recalled the defiance of protesters in 1988 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. "I will stand by my husband and we will not move," she said. "Let the tanks roll!"
More recently, Ms. Karp came forward with the fantastic claim that government intelligence agents had twice kidnapped her husband and filmed him in compromising circumstances. So far the videos have not surfaced, but political analysts say she probably took away their shock value if they are released in the final days leading up to the May 28 runoff.
Ms. Karp has been compared to Eva Peron for her populist touch and Hillary Clinton for her ambition in an outpouring of press coverage. The press has found her so fascinating that they published articles about how her father fought against the Nazis in the French Resistance before he was captured by forces led by Klaus Barbie and how her mother was chosen as a beauty queen of a Jewish club in Belgium. "Without Eliane Karp," said Hernan Chaparro Melo, a leading pollster, "Toledo could not have produced a solid image to become an alternative to Fujimori. By speaking Quechua and dancing Huayno, she sent a message that she is with the people."
Still, Ms. Karp is not universally accepted. In one recent poll, 43 percent of 512 people questioned said they did they not approve of the political role she was playing.
Here in Sicuano, however, Ms. Karp donned a red-embroidered flat-top Indian hat and displayed the power of having a common touch. A group of Indian dancers reached for her hand to dance the Quinuoa Saruch, a folk dance that marks the planting of potatoes, and Ms. Karp roughly knew the three-step and smiled widely as she was twirled from one dancer to another.
After dancing, students surrounded Ms. Karp to plead their case for the government to build a science laboratory for the local college. Without consulting her husband or his advisers, she agreed to their request on the spot -- leading to joyful cheers.
"Her word is believed," said Maribel Regina Quispes, 22, one of the students. "She may not be a Peruvian but she speaks Quechua and she is more identified with our culture than many Peruvians."
Then a local radio reporter pulled her aside for an interview, asking her if Peruvian machismo stood in the way of her acceptance.
"It's part of a long educational process," she conceded. Then taking advantage of the open microphone to promote a cause close to her heart, she added: "The woman works just as hard as the man in the house and the fields and is paid less. That should change."

HEADLINE: Behind the Rate Hike

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve aggressively raised interest rates yesterday, and Wall Street cheered. The textbooks say that higher interest rates are supposed to draw investors out of the stock market and into the bond market. Yet the Dow Jones stock market index rose more than 125 points yesterday.
The reason appears straightforward. Investors were worried that inflation is beginning to creep up and that the Fed might be waiting too long to push it back down. They feared that if inflation keeps rising, the Fed might be forced to crack down hard in the future, a reaction that would knock the economy off its high-growth path. So Wall Street reacted warmly when the Fed raised short-term interest rates by half a percentage point, double the size of each of the five previous rate increases. 
 Investor reaction is as much psychological as financial. A quarter-point rate increase carries about as much economic wallop as a half-point increase. What is really going on is a signaling game. By choosing the larger of two possible rate hikes, the Fed signaled to businesses, workers and investors that it intends to clamp down on inflation.
The economy remains strong. Unemployment has fallen below 4 percent. Spending rose by more than 8 percent at the beginning of the year, a pace few economists believe can continue without creating shortages and a burst of inflation.
What worries the Fed are the first signs that inflation is rising above 2 percent a year, a beneficial target. Consumer prices have risen by 3 percent over the past year. Even subtracting out energy and food, two volatile sectors, prices rose slightly more than 2 percent. There is nothing alarming about these numbers -- indeed, producer price inflation remains low -- but fears remain that rapid growth is beginning to drive up prices.
The shocking fact is how slowly wages are rising in the face of severe labor shortages. Indeed, only in the past few years have wages risen faster than prices. The best way to create room for wages to rise further is to keep the economy growing. For that to happen, the Fed believes it must convince everyone that inflation will remain under tight control. That is what the Fed said it would do yesterday. Wall Street believed what it heard.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
The Fed Administers Dose No. 6 of Its Sedative for the Economy

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, still believes that his medicine -- higher interest rates -- will reduce the economy's feverish growth. But it appears that the medicine is much weaker than he thought just a year ago, and that much higher doses will be needed to have the desired effect.
Last June, when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee raised interest rates for the first of what has now become six times, the committee's minutes reflected a general expectation of "appreciable moderation in the trend" of economic growth in the months ahead. 
 At that time, a divided Fed decided not to signal that there would be future interest rate increases. This was despite warnings by some members that the lack of such a signal could be interpreted as meaning that no further raises in rates were likely. In fact, that exact interpretation took hold as financial markets rallied on the news.
Since June, the economy has behaved in a way that few if any would have expected. The boom has continued, and economic growth has accelerated. Housing starts, industrial production and inflation are up, while unemployment is down.
Yesterday, when the Fed announced its sixth rate increase -- and the first in that series to bolster the federal funds rate target by half a percentage point, not the usual quarter-point rise -- it went out of its way to warn that it was still worried about inflation, and to hint that more increases would come unless and until the economy began to cool.
"Increases in demand have remained in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply, exerting continued pressure on resources," the Fed said in its report yesterday. "The committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance."
Translated, said Robert Barbara, the chief economist at Hoenig & Company, "the Fed said we will be more aggressive in our attempts" to slow the economy.
The Wall Street reaction this time was a bit confused and hesitant at first. Stock prices had been up sharply for the day, amid hopes that the expected half-point increase might be accompanied by language hinting that the Fed's series of rate increases was nearing an end. Most of the gains evaporated in the 30 minutes after the Fed's announcement, a reaction that did not seem surprising given the relatively strong language.
But the immediate alarm soon faded, and it appears that many small orders came in for stocks, which rebounded to end the day near the highs set before the Fed acted.
If the market's action indicates that many investors believe the good times will continue, that is understandable. The Fed's efforts to slow the economy have proved unsuccessful, and even if they do succeed there is a general expectation that Mr. Greenspan will ride to the rescue to prevent any kind of economic calamity. That is what he has done in the past, and the confidence that he will do so again makes it harder for the Fed to put a drag on the torrid pace of economic activity.
Perhaps the most surprising economic statistic now relates to housing, an industry that historically has been among the most sensitive to changes in interest rates. The data available to the Fed last June showed housing starts were running at a strong annual rate of 1.65 million over the previous three months. Six rate increases later, the figure is 1.7 million.
The stock market still thinks housing will weaken. The Standard & Poor's index of home builders is down 24 percent since last June, even though profits for most of the companies the index comprises have continued to rise. Many other stocks that are viewed as being sensitive to economic cycles have suffered during the period, reflecting the expectation, at least, that the economy will slow.
But the performance of those stocks was offset by the surge in many technology stocks, as enthusiasm for the new economy heated up. That enthusiasm peaked in early March, and although the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index is down 26 percent since then, it is still up 41 percent since June 29, 1999, the day before the first rate increase.
One reason that the Fed's efforts to slow the economy have not worked very rapidly is that market interest rates have not cooperated. The Fed directly controls the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge on loans to one another. That rate has climbed 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent, since the Fed began tightening.
But the rate on three-month Treasury bills is up only 1.33 percentage points, to 6.02 percent, during the same period. And the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has risen by just under half a percentage point, to 6.42 percent. Rates on corporate bonds, which may have a greater impact on economic activity, have risen more than the rates on Treasury securities but still not by as much as the federal funds rate.
There are always lags in the economic response to the Fed's moves, but the failure of the Fed to have any apparent impact so far remains surprising. One explanation for the economy's persistent strength is the wealth effect -- the feeling of many investors that they are richer after years of big rises in stock prices. Another is that the United States continues to draw in heavy foreign investment, which is reacting both to the healthy stock market and the buoyant economy.
Nonetheless, it is likely that sometime this year the Fed's medicine will begin to take effect. When it does, that will slow the growth in corporate profits and rein in corporate plans to invest in new productive capacity. The dollar may also come under pressure as investments here look less attractive.
But for now, the economy is booming, and investors seem to have no fears that the Fed will do serious damage to an economic expansion that is already the longest in American history.

HEADLINE: Retail Prices Unchanged Last Month

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Consumer prices were unchanged in April and the construction of new homes rose, government figures showed today, signaling that the economy was expanding with little to no inflation.
Declines in the cost of gasoline, clothing and air travel offset increases for medical care, food and housing last month, the Labor Department said. The flat Consumer Price Index came after a 0.7 percent jump in March and was the first report since last June's to show no change. The so-called core index, which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2 percent, half of March's 0.4 percent increase. 
 Housing starts rose 2.8 percent in April, to an annual pace of 1.663 million units, led by an increase in apartments and other multiple-unit developments, Commerce Department figures showed. That partly reversed March's 11.2 percent decline and put housing starts 6.5 percent higher than in the month a year earlier. At the same time, building permits fell, a sign of possible cooling ahead.
A separate Labor Department report showed that average weekly earnings adjusted for inflation rose 0.7 percent last month, after falling 0.5 percent in March. That is good news for home builders, which are counting on rising incomes and low unemployment to outweigh the effects of higher mortgage costs.
The consumer price report showed that retail prices increased 3 percent in the last 12 months. While that is less than the 3.7 percent annual rate in March, it exceeded the 2.7 percent increase for all of 1999.
Energy prices, which account for about a tenth of the Consumer Price Index, fell 1.9 percent in April after increasing 4.9 percent in March.
Transportation costs fell 0.7 percent, the largest decline since May 1997, and included a 0.5 percent drop in air fares. Apparel costs fell 0.5 percent, after rising 0.3 percent in March. Compared with April 1999, clothing costs were down 1.4 percent.
The cost of medical care increased 0.3 percent in April after rising 0.5 percent in March, and prescription drug prices were up 0.4 percent. Compared with April 1999, medical care costs were 3.9 percent higher and drug prices up 4.9 percent.
Food prices, which account for about a fifth of the Consumer Price Index, rose 0.1 percent in April, the same as in March. Housing costs increased 0.1 percent April, after a gain of 0.4 percent in March.
At the same time, the Commerce Department housing report showed that building permits fell 1.4 percent in April, to 1.574 million units at an annual pace, the third consecutive monthly decline. Permits have been issued for 504,800 housing units in the first four months of the year, down 4.2 percent from 526,800 in the first four months of 1999.

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Sweeping Overhaul To Fix Peacekeeping by U.N.

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 16

 BODY:
Richard C. Holbrooke, just back from an extended peace mission in Africa, called today for a sweeping overhaul of the United Nations peacekeeping operations and for more money from member nations to make the operations effective.
"Peacekeeping must be fixed in order to be saved," Mr. Holbrooke, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said at a meeting on the organization's budget. 
 The debate on the cost and future of United Nations peacekeeping opened at a critical moment. The United Nations is on the defensive for its performance under fire in Sierra Leone, and is and in the midst of a painful self-examination -- and some trading of accusations -- about what went wrong and why.
United Nations peacekeeping is stretched almost beyond capacity, with substantial military and administrative operations in East Timor, Kosovo and Sierra Leone, where a renegade rebel, Foday Sankoh, and his Revolutionary United Front took about 500 peacekeepers hostage.
A risky mission is about to be sent to Congo and, by July, the Security Council will be faced with a call for a large force on the Lebanese-Israeli border to move in after the withdrawal of Israeli troops.
Today Mr. Holbrooke recommended expanding the peacekeeping department significantly and allowing Secretary General Kofi Annan more flexibility in staffing it. That matter is a constant battle here, where staff allocations of all kinds are micromanaged by the General Assembly.
Mr. Holbrooke also asked countries that have been given discounts on peacekeeping bills for more than a quarter of a century to offer to pay more as their economies grow. All the organization's member states pay a proportion of the total peacekeeping costs.
For the first time, five nations answered the appeal and said they would pay more: Cyprus, Estonia, Israel, Hungary and the Philippines. Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview that he hoped to see at least four or five more on the list.
In his speech, Mr. Holbrooke announced that a high-level review over how to contribute better to peacekeeping was under way in the Clinton Administration, which many diplomats and officials here say badly let down the United Nations in Sierra Leone. Mr. Holbrooke backed the establishment of a rapid-deployment unit at United Nations headquarters to work with a roster of available military, police and civilian experts to be called on as needed.
Most diplomats here, stung by humiliation in Sierra Leone, would not fault the conclusion that peacekeeping needs to be rethought.
But not all are happy to let the United States take the lead, saying that decisions in Washington, including a vote by Congress to lower American peacekeeping assessments in violation of international agreements, have caused much of the problem.
Ambassador Michael Powles of New Zealand, speaking today for his country as well as Australia and Canada, told the budget assembly that "some countries have been presenting the problems associated with peacekeeping financing as if they were solely the making of the United Nations and attributable to the fact that the peacekeeping scale has not been revised since it was created in 1973."
"This is not the whole story," he said, making a direct reference to the United States position. He blamed debt defaulters instead. The United States owes more than $1 billion.
In Sierra Leone, attacks on peacekeepers began when they were being deployed in rebel strongholds, especially diamond-mining areas. The attacks and abductions changed the character of the United Nations operation overnight.
What happened in Sierra Leone provokes debate -- and some name-calling -- at several levels.
On the ground in Freetown, the United Nations has had problems with both its military commander, Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley of India, and the Secretary General's special envoy, Oluyemi Adeniji, a retired Nigerian diplomat.
General Jetley, who has commanded the peacekeeping force since it was sent to Sierra Leone, is popular with civilian United Nations officials there, and his Indian troops when fully deployed will make up a third of the total force. A second contingent of Indian troops began to arrive today, with a full battalion of 1,000 soldiers expected in the next few days. The reinforcement raises the United Nations peacekeeping force to 9,150 members.
General Jetley has been criticized by leaders of several contingents from other nations taking part in the peacekeeping mission, among them the Zambians and Kenyans. They describe him as high-handed and uncooperative, and there are serious discussions about replacing him, some officials say.
Mr. Adeniji has also created problems by running his own show without keeping officials, including Mr. Annan, informed. Little useful analysis of what was happening in rebel-held areas was ever collected or forwarded to New York, officials complain, although relief organizations say they knew a great deal.
On Sunday, Mr. Adeniji went to Monrovia, Liberia, to negotiate with President Charles Taylor for the release of more than 130 hostages, since the Liberian president continues to influence at least a part of Mr. Sankoh's rebel force, the Revolutionary United Front. But he did not tell Mr. Annan or other officials here of his freelance mission. United Nations headquarters found out through an African-based journalist who got a tip about a hostage release.
Replacing either man, however, would not be easy. India has already taken umbrage at official criticism of its commander, and has threatened to abandon the mission.
Nigeria, which had its own forces in Sierra Leone under a West African regional operation before pulling most of them in recent weeks, appears to have an interest in having a free hand in the affairs of Sierra Leone. The Nigerians had put pressure on the Secretary General to name a Nigerian as special representative.
A more fundamental problem for the United Nations is that it was never party to the Lome agreement last year that created the now-sabotaged peace deal in Sierra Leone.
"In the Lome agreement the U.N. were not supposed to be the peacekeeping force," said Bernard Miyet, the undersecretary general for peacekeeping, who briefed the Security Council on Monday after returning from Sierra Leone. "We were supposed at the beginning to have a few dozen military observers."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. Team in Sierra Leone
 WASHINGTON, May 16 -- Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said that an Air Force team arrived in Sierra Leone today to assess the security of the airport outside the capital, Freetown.
Mr. Annan has criticized Washington for refusing to send American peacekeepers into Sierra Leone. But Mr. Cohen said the United States is continuing to work with Nigeria to figure out how to help that country if it sends in peacekeepers.
"We have in fact been in contact with the Nigerians to see how and if they can participate in a very active role and what will be required to support their efforts," Mr. Cohen said today at a Pentagon briefing.
The United States may provide some equipment to the Nigerians, as well as transportation, according to Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
"The problem isn't people willing to be part of the United Nations or regional forces," Mr. Bacon said. "The issue is to get them to be effective."

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Printer Is Moving, to Aid Both Itself and Landlord

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
Astoria Graphics is a financial and commercial printing company that has been operating in buildings owned by Trinity Church Real Estate for the last 50 or so years. And it will continue to do so as a result of an unusual deal under which it gave up space at an extraordinarily favorable rental rate in one building in return for space in another Trinity location at a higher, but still favorable, rate.
Astoria, a family-owned company in its fourth generation, is fortunate compared with other companies, many of which have been forced out of Manhattan by rising rents and the desire of landlords to replace manufacturing with office tenants. But more than good fortune was involved, executives on both sides agree. Astoria has substantially converted from traditional methods to new forms of electronic printing that have little of the noise and vibration that make office tenants reluctant to share buildings with printers. 
 "We are a digital manufacturing company," said Ronald D. Koff, the president of Astoria. "We do not have heavy, vibrating equipment."
Steven D. Heyman, director of commercial leasing for Trinity Real Estate, which is owned by the Parish of Trinity Church, said: "Office tenants can't live next to or above the noise of a conventional printer. But Ron is in the brave new world of printing, and he doesn't make much noise."
Mr. Koff said he had grown up in Trinity-owned buildings, first at 435 Hudson Street and later at 75 Varick Street. But great change has come to 75 Varick, which Trinity is marketing as 1 Hudson Square. Responding to the strength of the office market in Manhattan, the church has invested nearly $70 million to convert it from light manufacturing to Class A offices.
With asking rental rates in the building now topping $50 a square foot annually, Trinity officials were eager to retrieve the 15,000 square feet occupied by Astoria, all the more because the company was operating under an old lease and paying just $6 a square foot.
Mr. Koff said he was willing to move because he needed more space. But he said he was intent on staying in Manhattan and not following the printing companies that had departed for New Jersey and the city's other boroughs.
"We thought it was prudent to stay in Manhattan," Mr. Koff said. "Clients like to see the plant, even if they only spend a few minutes walking through it. It's good to be close to your customers."
The changes in Lower Manhattan, particularly the influx of dot-com companies, Internet service providers and telecommunications companies, provided a powerful incentive to stay, said Mitchell Koff, Ronald's brother and co-president of the company. "They have enveloped the area and are a big part of our business."
In addition, he said, the presence of the high-tech companies meant that there was a high-capacity telecommunications infrastructure already installed in the area, which is important to printers who now receive much of their source material as electronic files over the Internet.
But finding suitable space in Manhattan proved to be difficult. "Landlords want new-economy companies such as dot-coms, not printers," said Andrew P. Sachs, a director of Insignia/ESG and the broker for Astoria.
After failing to find what the company was looking for, Mr. Sachs said, he went back to Trinity's managers and asked if there was a way for Astoria to stay in the church's portfolio of 5.5 million square feet of space. Although its property was once occupied almost entirely by industrial tenants, Trinity has in recent years converted much of it to office use.
Eventually, the three parties worked out a deal that included buying out the last three years of Astoria's deeply below-market lease at 75 Varick Street and having the company move to 30,000 square feet of space in another Trinity-owned building at 225 Varick Street.
Since buying out the old lease would have required a substantial payment by Trinity to Astoria, the value of that payment was transferred to 225 Varick. As a result, the printing company is paying $18 a square foot for 10 years in a building where asking rents are in the range of $40 a square foot.
"It was a huge benefit for Trinity to get Astoria out of 75 Varick without having to write a check," Mr. Sachs said. And the printing company benefits from getting below-market rent. "This is a good deal for both sides," Mr. Sachs said.
Ronald Koff said the company was now planning for the move north on Varick Street, which will take one to two weeks. "It's not something you want to do very often," he said.

HEADLINE: In Boom Times, the Have-Nots Influence the Dominican Vote

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, May 16

 BODY:
Dominicans turned out in large numbers on Tuesday to elect a president -- either one who would build on the current government's policy of economic liberalization or one who wants to reconsider some of the changes to help the poor and rural residents who say the boom years have overlooked them.
While this Caribbean nation has enjoyed four years of robust and unprecedented growth, dissatisfaction among the poor has been great enough to drive the candidacy of Hipolito Mejia of the left-leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party. Mr. Mejia, an agronomist and businessman who was a cabinet official in the 1970's, has campaigned on a platform of increased social spending, aid to farmers and a reassessment of the current government's privatization policies. Preliminary results based on 27.7 percent of the polling places were giving him 49 percent of the vote early this morning. 
 But the same sentiment has also propelled the unlikely candidacy of former President Joaquin Balaguer, who is seeking his eighth term in office. Mr. Balaguer, an autocrat who was close to the dictator Rafael Trujillo, is 93 and blind. In his infrequent stump speeches, he has had to be helped to the podium by aides.
Nonetheless, his Social Christian Reformist Party was garnering 26.7 percent of the vote. The third main candidate, Danilo Medina of the governing centrist Dominican Liberation Party, known as the P.L.D., has vowed to continue his party's economic policy but with an eye toward having the benefits flow to the neediest sectors of society. This morning, he had 23.6 percent of the vote.
If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff is scheduled for June 30. While some polling places experienced delays, the vote proceeded without disruptions or conflict.
The current President, Leonel Fernandez, a lawyer educated in the United States, has been praised by international groups for having enacted economic changes that have stimulated a growth rate of approximately 8 percent and attracted considerable investment here. Mr. Fernandez, who is prohibited by law from a second consecutive term, also focused on improving transportation and roads.
"This has been a fairly progressive government by Dominican standards," said a diplomat here.
Supporters of Mr. Medina, who was a top aide to Mr. Fernandez, said the recent economic growth -- which last year made the Dominican Republic's economy the fastest growing in Latin America -- should continue under their party's supervision. They said that the country's stable currency and finances would improve the country's ability to invest in schools and health services.
"If you want to work, you can work," said Idelfonso Cora, as he waited to vote for Mr. Medina. "I support Danilo because of the growth under the P.L.D. has been the best.
But the governing party's economic changes and capital projects have not played as well among some poor and rural voters, who feel the initiatives have done little to improve their circumstances. There are continuing complaints about high food prices and a lack of jobs.
"People still have to get on boats and go to Puerto Rico because there is not enough opportunity here," said Samuel Collado, a security guard who was waiting to vote for Mr. Mejia. "We want a government that will help the poor, not just the rich."
He and others have been especially rankled by the government's privatization of state-run sugar and electrical production industries. In Guerra, about 15 miles outside Santo Domingo, voters said the privatization of the sugar company had a devastating effect on their town.
"Sugar cane?" Maria Altagracia Lebron said. "Don't even talk about that. We used to live from that, but not anymore. There is no cane or anything, because the government privatized it. And who does that favor? The millionaires who have the money."
While Mr. Mejia said he would review the privatization policies, he may have no choice but to continue, a diplomat said, because he is also enough of a businessman to know that it was ultimately the only choice the country had.
In some respects, both he and Mr. Medina tout similar promises of helping those who have been left out.
"This is about personality," a diplomat said. "There is also a more direct connection between the parties and the people. The concept that one candidate might do good for the whole nation is alien. It's what can you do for me?"
Perhaps the master of that retail political strategy has been Mr. Balaguer, who has honed it over decades, dispensing jobs, food and favors. "The people who support him got things -- a job, a school or a building," a diplomat said. "I also think there is some sort of nostalgia for the caudillo, the strong leader. They feel they want a society where they do not have much chaos."
The campaign season was seen by many as among the most tranquil in years. Nonetheless, there were disquieting incidents of violence.
In late April, two supporters of the governing party were shot and killed by Mr. Mejia's bodyguards during a campaign swing in the town of Moca. Although the bodyguards said the two were suspected of planning to attack Mr. Mejia, the police dismissed that motive. Several suspects were arrested.
And recalling the violence that racked this nation during Mr. Balaguer's rule, the family of a journalist who was killed by a death squad linked to the military in 1975 tried to block Mr. Balaguer's candidacy, accusing him of complicity. The Central Electoral Council declined to pursue the case, saying there was not enough evidence.
Mr. Balaguer's supporters, in turn, accused the governing party of plotting to assassinate him, saying that his age and frail physical condition made him vulnerable.
Mr. Balaguer could still be in a position to exercise influence should his party come in second in the vote. It is expected that Mr. Mejia could face a challenge from a united front forged by his two opponents. At the same time, Mr. Mejia's supporters say their candidate's strength among the poor and rural voters has not been reflected in the polls.
"He is a good candidate," said Alfonso Bolque Brito, a street vendor. "He is the only one who can put food in the mouths of those who are unhappy."

HEADLINE: Putting the Clamps on Consumers Accustomed to Borrowing Freely

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Consumers will quickly begin to feel the pinch of the Federal Reserve's half-point rate increase as borrowing -- from home equity loans to car and truck financing to credit cards -- becomes more expensive. Rates on fixed-rate mortgages, however, have already climbed and may even retreat some from their current level of about 8.5 percent, specialists said.
And consumers with money to invest will most likely benefit from the Fed's action yesterday, though the rates that banks pay on investments like certificates of deposit and money market accounts tend to rise less fully or with a lag, depending on various factors, including the amounts involved. 
 "People aren't going to wake up tomorrow and find their rates a half-point higher," said James E. Glassman, a managing director at Chase Securities, said yesterday. "But it's progressively growing more expensive" to borrow for millions of consumers whose aggregate personal savings rate, as a proportion of disposable income, has dwindled to virtually nothing, he said.
Indeed, while few real estate deals already in progress are likely to be jeopardized, some consumers in New York and elsewhere who are stretching to buy houses before prices go up further may find prospective lenders increasingly shy about committing to very large loans. An increasing number of buyers lock in financing before shopping for a home.
Michael LaCarrubba of Jersey City, who plans to buy an apartment in Lower Manhattan, expressed the uncertainty of many consumers after learning of the Fed action. "It's kind of scary right now; it's a race against time to get a rate locked in before they rise too much," he said. "It is unnerving because you don't know what to expect."
A financial analyst for Towers Perrin, Mr. LaCarrubba was aware that mortgage money is still relatively cheap compared with what it has been over most of the last 30 years. But he added that the difficult "issue is that prices on properties are so high that you may already be extending yourself." But he was undeterred.
"I guess you just have to find the properties you like and know that there could be a $100 to $300 difference" in higher monthly payments.
In general, the highest borrowing rates -- typically on credit cards for those with subpar incomes or repayment histories -- will be hit relatively lightly because the cost of money is a lesser part of the rate than the lenders' cost of administration and write-offs of uncollectible accounts.
But there will be some direct effect. Citigroup's Citibank, for example, ties its credit card rates to the prime rate, which it raised a half-point yesterday, to 9.5 percent, in lock step with the Fed, as has become the pattern in recent years. The bank's policy is to review these rates on the last business day of the month, meaning that its card rates will rise for July payments on purchases made in June, said Susan Weeks, a spokeswoman.
Deposit rates, governed by competition as well as the costs of gathering the money, are set by the bank each Thursday and are in effect from the following Tuesday through Monday. Preferred money market accounts now yield 4.59 percent, up from 4.45 two weeks ago. Six-month C.D.'s yield 5.35 percent, up from 5.21. The bank gave no indication what it would decide this Thursday.
Chase Manhattan also reviews deposit rates each week; its six-month C.D. rate was 5.40 percent yesterday.
Based on information from the 10 biggest depository institutions in the 10 biggest metropolitan markets, a six-month C.D. was paying 4.99 percent yesterday, compared with 4.12 percent a year ago, and a one-year C.D. was paying 5.39 percent, compared with 4.37 percent.
As for mortgages, which are subject to monthly examination, rates for adjustable loans at Citibank are tied to Treasury bills while fixed-rate loans fluctuate with bills or other benchmarks.
But in housing, said Kory Bockmann, economist at the National Association of Realtors, the Fed's move may not be translated into higher rates except in particular circumstances, like for barely qualified or overreaching buyers.
"There's probably not going to be too much of an impact," he said, "We may actually see a decline in the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage," which is hovering at about 8.5 percent. Rates have already climbed, Mr. Bockmann noted, and by raising short-term rates the Fed may have reassured the markets that it will keep control of inflation, expectations of which over the next decade or so largely determine rates for long-term mortgages.
Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant in Virginia, said, "If anything, mortgage rates ought to hold constant or tick down a little bit." At the same time, he added, the Internet is helping consumers shop for better rates on both savings accounts and loans. "We are starting to see a more national market for deposit-taking."
Rates on small savings deposits and service-intensive products like checking accounts are relatively low and largely impervious to changes in market rates.
According to Sung Won Sohn, economist at Wells Fargo, one of the biggest real estate lenders, many consumers are expressing a belief that the rise in rates may be approaching an end, a view the seemingly shared yesterday by the stock and bond markets.
More than one-third of current mortgage applications are now for floating rates, he said, compared with just 5 percent to 10 percent several months ago. "More and more people are betting that mortgage rates will go down," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PERSONAL FINANCES;
Gore Has Not Bought Stocks for Decades

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
When E. F. Hutton talks, Al Gore doesn't listen.
The vice president does not invest in the stock market. He told reporters yesterday that he had shied away from the market for nearly 25 years because he was worried that as a public official, any investments might look like a conflict of interest. 
 "Twenty-four years ago, when I ran for Congress, for good or ill, I made the decision that in order to avoid even the appearance of any conflict of interest, on the many subjects that would come up for votes, I decided as a matter of personal policy I would not invest in stocks," Mr. Gore told reporters yesterday at a news conference in New York.
"Now, missing the bull market is not the greatest thing in the world, financially," he said a little sheepishly. "But for me, it was the right decision."
The issue came up after Gov. George W. Bush asserted that Mr. Gore had a "substantial amount of his money invested in the stock market." Mr. Bush made the statement Monday in promoting his plan to allow people to invest some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the market. Mr. Bush may have thought it was a safe assumption, given that half of all American households are invested in the market.
Financial experts suggested they would have made the same assumption. David G. Dietze, president of Point View Financial Services, an investment advisory firm in Summit, N.J., said it was highly unusual for someone of Mr. Gore's age (52) and income ($171,500 a year) not to be invested. "There's probably only one chance in 100 that someone of his ilk would not have investments in the stock market," Mr. Dietze said.
A 1998 examination of Mr. Gore's finances by Fortune Magazine concluded that Mr. Gore's assets were dwindling and questioned how he could hope to run the United States economy as president with such a dismal track record with his own finances. Fortune said Mr. Gore had a small amount of money in I.R.A.'s, but that most of his money was in checking and passbook accounts or tied up in property.
"This potential president could be a financial dolt," Fortune wrote, noting that in addition to his salary, the vice president had earned more than $1 million from his book "Earth in the Balance."
"This is a family in dire need of a money manager," the magazine wrote.
