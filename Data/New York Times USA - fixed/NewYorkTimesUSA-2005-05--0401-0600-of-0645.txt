HEADLINE: Latino Victor in Los Angeles Overcomes Division

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Nick Madigan contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 18 

 BODY:
Antonio Villaraigosa on Tuesday became the first Latino in more than a century to win the mayoralty of Los Angeles, by accomplishing what many local politicians here and elsewhere have so far failed to do: fashion an electoral coalition that surmounts the racial, ethnic and geographic divisions that lace American cities.
 Mr. Villaraigosa, in his second bid to gain the mayor's office, won by resounding margins among white, Latino and black voters and prevailed in virtually every corner of this sprawling city. He was aided in his quest by voters' perceptions of Mayor James K. Hahn as a lackluster leader and Mr. Hahn's alienation of black voters and residents of the San Fernando Valley.
 Political strategists said politicians across the country would study this election, as Latinos gain influence not just in the Southwest but also in major cities nationwide -- particularly as ethnic change makes urban coalition politics ever more vital. 
 Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, who is of Puerto Rican descent, is seeking black support in his bid to unseat Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, so far without much success. Mr. Bloomberg is courting Hispanic voters in the Spanish-language media and in visits to ethnic neighborhoods across the city.
 Mr. Villaraigosa (pronounced VEE-yah-ray-GO-suh) trounced Mr. Hahn, 59 percent to 41 percent; the key to his election was reaching far beyond the coalition of Latinos and white liberals he attracted in his first run against Mr. Hahn in 2001. 
 Though Latinos account for about 47 percent of the population of Los Angeles, they are roughly a quarter of the electorate because of low registration rates. Whites constitute 30 percent of the population, blacks 11 percent and Asians 10 percent.
 This time Mr. Villaraigosa won every demographic group except Asian-Americans; they remained loyal to Mr. Hahn, who has served the city in various jobs for 24 years. Both men are Democrats.
 Mr. Villaraigosa made a point at a news conference on Wednesday morning of appearing with two of the city's most prominent black leaders: Bernard C. Parks, who became a councilman after Mayor Hahn pushed him out as police chief, and John W. Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League. Mr. Villaraigosa vowed to work tirelessly to knit together this sprawling pastiche of a city.
 ''I'm an American of Mexican descent, and I'm proud of that,'' said Mr. Villaraigosa, who grew up the son of a single mother in the barrio of East Los Angeles. ''But I intend to be the mayor of all of Los Angeles. As the mayor of the most diverse city in the world, that's the only way it can work.''
 But if Mr. Villaraigosa played down his ethnicity on the campaign trail, running on discontent with Mayor Hahn, his victory was a milestone for many reasons. His ascension -- he is to be sworn in on July 1 -- will make him one of the most visible elected leaders of the country's fast-growing Hispanic minority at a time when both parties are competing hard for the Hispanic vote. 
 Mr. Villaraigosa joins Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado, both Democrats, and Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, a Republican, on the national stage.
 Mr. Hahn was the first incumbent mayor voted out of office in Los Angeles since Tom Bradley defeated Sam Yorty in 1973. Surveys of voters leaving the polls showed that an overwhelming majority were unhappy with the apparent drift in city government, a wave of voter disquiet reminiscent of the recall election of 2003 that swept Gov. Gray Davis from office in favor of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 ''Ethnicity is an absolutely critical element in politics in America, and particularly in California, which is no longer a majority white state,'' said Darry Sragow, a longtime Democratic strategist here. ''What Antonio Villaraigosa did so successfully was update the black-white strategy of Tom Bradley 30 years ago to reflect the enormous increase in the number of Latino voters.''
 Hank Sheinkopf, a New York Democratic strategist, said that the lessons of Los Angeles applied in New York and elsewhere, but only to a point. Mr. Ferrer enjoyed considerable black support in his mayoral campaign in 2001, but is having trouble recapturing it. And an important difference between Los Angeles and New York, Mr. Sheinkopf said, is that Mr. Hahn was a more polarizing figure among black voters than Mayor Bloomberg has been so far.
 Mr. Hahn, 54, who comes from a revered political family in Los Angeles, never really captured the affection of voters. Even his advisers acknowledged that he lacked elementary political skills and that his natural reserve came across to many as aloofness. Although the city's crime rate dropped during his tenure and the regional economy fared reasonably well, he never got credit, in part because he was uncomfortable promoting his own accomplishments.
 Fernando Guerra, director of the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University here, said Mr. Villaraigosa's victory was a watershed in Los Angeles politics, where Latinos have held every major office except the mayoralty, as well as nationally.
 ''Just as we saw African-American mayors win in the 1960's and 70's in Cleveland, Newark, Detroit, Atlanta and Los Angeles,'' he said, ''now you're seeing Latinos win in San Antonio, Miami, San Jose and now here.'' 
 Mr. Guerra added: ''All of this is very much a national trend, impacting urban politics and statewide politics, a trend that will continue for the next 10 years. This is just the beginning.''
 The challenges facing Mr. Villaraigosa in trying to defuse the ethnic tensions that are never far from the surface here were highlighted Wednesday when violence that some parents said may have been racially motivated flared at a high school in the San Fernando Valley.
 The fighting broke out shortly before Mr. Villaraigosa was to visit the school, Taft High in Woodland Hills. School administrators insisted that Wednesday's incident was not racially tinged, but brawls between black and Latino students have erupted at schools across the city in recent months, and black and Latino gangs battle for supremacy on the streets and in state prisons.
 Mr. Villaraigosa did not cancel his appearance at the school. ''I'm going to be a mayor that's going to roll up his sleeves and go there, because the one commitment we have to have in our schools is safe passage for our children, zero tolerance for racial violence and an absolute commitment to ensure that our young people are safe and free,'' he said.
 Mr. Villaraigosa has also promised to end cronyism at City Hall, repair the city's failing schools, add 1,000 officers to the Los Angeles Police Department, extend the city's underused subway line to the ocean and ease traffic congestion.
 Mr. Villaraigosa, 52, was born Antonio Villar but adopted his surname when he married Corina Raigosa, a schoolteacher, in 1987. 
 The son of Mexican immigrants, he grew up in a two-bedroom apartment in the City Terrace neighborhood, east of downtown. He says his father drank and sometimes abused his mother, then abandoned the family when Mr. Villaraigosa was 5.
 Mr. Villaraigosa was an above-average student, but developed problems at school at 15 when a tumor on his spine ended his participation in sports and he began acting up. He was expelled from a Roman Catholic high school, ending up at a large public school in East Los Angeles. He worked his way through the University of California, Los Angeles, and became active in union politics. He completed law school, but failed the bar examination four times. 
 Still, he became president of the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and in 1994 was elected to the State Assembly. 
 Four years later, thanks to his ebullient personality and his fund-raising skills, he was elected speaker, a job he held for just two years before turning his sights on the mayor's office in 2001.
 That race also set him against Mr. Hahn, who unleashed a barrage of late advertisements linking Mr. Villaraigosa to a convicted cocaine trafficker, Carlos Vignali, whose sentence was commuted by President Bill Clinton. Mr. Villaraigosa, who received more than $6,000 in donations from Mr. Vignali's parents for Assembly campaigns, had written a letter on behalf of Mr. Vignali but later said he should not have written it. 
 Mr. Hahn, the son of a beloved county supervisor, Kenneth J. Hahn, won almost 80 percent of the black vote and took majorities among white voters and residents of the San Fernando Valley. 
 After losing the 2001 mayor's race, Mr. Villaraigosa won a seat on the Los Angeles City Council in 2003.
 As mayor, Mr. Hahn made two decisions that shattered his winning coalition. He replaced Chief Parks with William J. Bratton, the former New York police commissioner, angering blacks. And he fought back an effort by the San Fernando Valley to secede from the City of Los Angeles in a way that alienated many Valley voters.
 Those actions, combined with continuing ethics investigations in City Hall and what many viewed as Mr. Hahn's colorless personal style, doomed him, analysts said.
 ''Hahn could have fired Parks and he could have defeated secession and still won,'' Mr. Guerra said. ''It's not that he did it, it's how he did it.''

HEADLINE: Bush Ties Trade Pact With Egypt to More Freedom

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
President Bush met with Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif of Egypt on Wednesday and held out the possibility of a free trade agreement if Egypt continued its political and economic reforms.
 The two men discussed the recent pledge by President Hosni Mubarak to hold open presidential elections this fall, with the implicit understanding that a free and fair election would bolster Egypt's chance for a stronger trade relationship with the United States.
 Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, said the administration was working with Congress on ways to push ahead with a possible free-trade agreement ''in light of the reforms'' that Egypt was undertaking. 
 ''The president has asked our United States trade representative and the prime minister has asked the Egyptian trade minister to look at ways to put in place the conditions necessary to advance that objective,'' Mr. McClellan said.
 Mr. Nazif said after his White House meeting with Mr. Bush that he ''got really a very good response'' on the idea of creating a free trade agreement.
 Mr. Nazif also said the president had given him some counsel: ''His advice was that Egypt should be able to show the world that it can hold a free and fair election.''
 While trade with Egypt has been under discussion for more than five years, Mr. Bush said Wednesday that he had asked his trade representative to press ahead with talks to remove obstacles to formal negotiations for a trade agreement.
 Egypt is one of the countries envisioned in a Middle East Free Trade Agreement -- which includes the northern African countries of the Maghreb region -- that Mr. Bush announced two years ago. Discussions about opening up trade hit a bump several years ago when Egypt dropped out of a lawsuit brought by the United States against the European Union over its policies restricting imports of genetically altered food. The case is still pending before the World Trade Organization.
 Since then, Egypt has taken steps to prepare for a free trade agreement by changing laws and regulations covering intellectual property rights, telecommunications and information technology.

HEADLINE: A 2nd Federal Reserve Board Member Is Stepping Down

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Micheline Maynard in New York contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
Edward M. Gramlich, one of two Democrats on the Federal Reserve Board, said on Wednesday that he would resign at the end of August.
 Mr. Gramlich, who is 65, joined the Fed in 1997. He said he would become a professor at the University of Michigan and had plans to write books on the economics of airlines and on low-income housing. 
 Mr. Gramlich's resignation will leave two open positions on the seven-member Federal Reserve Board. The other vacancy will be created by the departure of Ben S. Bernanke, who has been nominated to become chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
 In recent years, Federal Reserve governors have displayed few partisan divisions over monetary policy. Though board members frequently disagree about the timing or the nuances of policy issues, they have tended to agree about placing top priority on restraining inflation.
 Mr. Gramlich's departure will be part of a broader change at the Fed, which will culminate with the retirement of Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, early next year.
 President Bush, now faced with replacing Mr. Gramlich, has not yet nominated someone to succeed Mr. Bernanke. Nor has he hinted at the biggest decision of all -- a successor to Mr. Greenspan.
 Mr. Gramlich, who was appointed by President Clinton, came to the Fed as an expert on poverty issues. In the early 1990's, he was chairman of a presidential commission on Social Security that recommended a plan to add personal retirement accounts on top of the existing system.
 Mr. Gramlich represented the Fed on the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, and has served as its chairman since its formation. The board was created by Congress after the September 2001 attacks to oversee $10 billion in loan guarantees for the struggling airline industry. After prolonged debates, including a scuffle with the Treasury Department, the board rejected three bids by United Airlines for loan guarantees. United sought bankruptcy protection in December 2002, after its first bid was turned down, and has yet to emerge from it. 
 Mr. Gramlich's exit will leave Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the vice chairman, as the lone Democrat on the board. When President Bush appoints a successor to Mr. Gramlich and Mr. Bernanke, he will have appointed all seven board members.
 In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Gramlich predicted that party affiliations would have little or no impact on monetary policy.
 ''I think there's a good consensus on monetary policy in favor of price stability, and it doesn't really matter whether people come with an 'R' or a 'D' on their backs,'' he said.
 Fed officials do express different opinions on other economic matters. Mr. Greenspan has been comparatively relaxed about the United States' growing foreign indebtedness, while Mr. Gramlich has openly worried about the interaction between high budget deficits and rising foreign indebtedness.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Releases Two More Ads, Recalling Sept. 11

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg began the second phase of his advertising campaign yesterday with long commercials reminding New Yorkers of the grim days that followed the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. And they portray the mayor as fearlessly leading the city back to stability.
 The two new spots are unusually long -- 90 seconds and 60 seconds -- and rely on ordinary New Yorkers and two high-profile New Yorkers, the former mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani and Edward I. Koch, to tell of the city's recovery.
 The spots open with somber piano music, distant sirens and images of the cityscape -- the Brooklyn Bridge, an American flag on the side of a skyscraper, workers on a street corner -- as faceless voices begin to recount the bad times. 
 ''It's easy to forget how scary the whole thing was,'' a man's voice says. ''People were worried,'' a woman says. ''People didn't know if they were going to have a job,'' says another.
 Mr. Bloomberg soon appears, to recall the day he was sworn in: ''The smoke was still coming out of the World Trade Center. Conventional wisdom was people were going to leave this city in droves,'' he says.
 But it is Mr. Giuliani, who is so identified with the attack and whose endorsement was seen as crucial to Mr. Bloomberg in 2001, who begins the section of the commercials in which the city's successes are recounted. ''He had to deal with a city that was going through one of its worst crises ever,'' he says of Mr. Bloomberg, ''And he established himself immediately as a strong and effective leader.''
 With the spots, Mr. Bloomberg's team was clearly seeking to jolt New Yorkers into remembering how tough things were after the attack and just how far the city has come since then. ''In this city that never sleeps, sometimes you have to remind people what you have done,'' said William T. Cunningham, a senior adviser to the mayor.
 He and others said that the campaign had chosen the theme of the city's recovery from the attack as a sort of table-setter for the rest of the mayor's campaign, in which they will aggressively sell his record on jobs, public safety, education and economic development, all in the context of the city he took over in January 2002.
 These are Mr. Bloomberg's first English-language spots, and their theme was similar to the opening theme of President Bush's advertising campaign last year. Those commercials featured scenes of ground zero -- including firefighters removing flag-covered remains from the wreckage -- before making a case that the nation was emerging from tough times. They created outrage, especially among relatives of the victims, who saw them as exploitative.
 But there was no such outcry yesterday for Mr. Bloomberg's spots, at least as of late in the afternoon. (The advocacy group Families of Sept. 11 did not respond to messages requesting comment.)
 Strategists for Mr. Bloomberg said that the controversy over Mr. Bush's spots had been in their minds as they produced theirs, though they said that even had they not been, their sensitivities -- and the mayor's -- were more finely tuned because they have spent so much time with survivors.
 ''From the mayor on down there was a sensitivity not to use the site of ground zero,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''Yet we still need to show what the city was coming through when we took office.''
 Jen Bluestein, a spokeswoman for Fernando Ferrer, a Democratic mayoral candidate, said yesterday, ''Watching Mayor Bloomberg's advertisements and their view of New York City is like watching an episode of 'Fantasy Island.'''
 The spots began appearing on all major stations and some cable outlets yesterday in what was the beginning of a 10-day run.

HEADLINE: Bush Says Patience Is Needed As Nations Build a Democracy

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; David E. Sanger contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
President Bush called Wednesday for patience in assessing the progress of Iraq and other nations toward democracy. He said the United States had gotten off to a rocky start after its independence and that it could take years for newly free countries to establish the institutions necessary for stability and prosperity.
 Speaking to the International Republican Institute, Mr. Bush said the American Revolution had been followed by ''years of chaos,'' and that the first effort to develop a governing charter, the Articles of Confederation, had ''failed miserably.'' 
 ''No nation in history has made the transition from tyranny to a free society without setbacks and false starts,'' Mr. Bush said. ''What separates those nations that succeed from those that falter is their progress in establishing free institutions.''
 Mr. Bush has been criticized for underestimating how difficult it would be to stabilize and rebuild Iraq, and his remarks amounted to an argument as to why the transition from tyranny to democracy there and elsewhere is inherently challenging and prone to setbacks.
 Mr. Bush listed a widely agreed upon set of prerequisites for success, including freedom of speech and assembly, a market economy and the rule of law.
 He added another, freedom of worship, ''because respect for the beliefs of others is the only way to build a society where compassion and tolerance prevail.''
 Mr. Bush used the speech to continue his gradual reversal from a central commitment of the 2000 presidential campaign: that he would never use the United States military for what he called ''nation building.'' 
 On Wednesday night, he celebrated the military's nation-building role, saying that while ''the main purpose of our military is to find and defeat the terrorists overseas,'' members of the armed forces are ''also undertaking a less visible, but increasingly important task: helping the people of these nations build civil societies from the rubble of oppression.''
 Aides to Mr. Bush have said that his change of view began early in his first term, during a visit to Kosovo. But even then, he seemed to draw limits on what kind of nation-building activities he thought were appropriate.
 On Wednesday, he celebrated the military's participation in actions that are normally considered civilian. 
 In Afghanistan, he noted, ''Provincial Reconstruction Teams'' were ''helping the Afghan government to fix schools, dig wells, build roads, repair hospitals, and build confidence in the ability of Afghanistan's elected leaders to deliver real change in people's lives.''
 In Iraq, he noted, the First Cavalry Division began ''Operation Adam Smith -- setting up local chambers of commerce, providing Iraqi entrepreneurs with small business loans, and teaching them important skills like accounting, marketing and writing business plans.''
 He also talked about his proposal to create a new civilian Active Response Corps to help newly formed governments build institutions, including courts and tax systems. 
 The initial budget proposal for the office is small, about $24 million, but White House officials have said they expect the program will expand. 
 The president said promoting democracy was in the national interest because it would ''isolate and defeat the forces of terror, and ensure a peaceful future for our citizens.''
 Mr. Bush, who was introduced by his onetime rival for the Republican presidential nomination, Senator John McCain of Arizona, cited the progress toward democracy across the former Soviet Union and in the Middle East.
 But freedom, he said, can create political vacuums and instability, citing the struggles in recent years in Slovakia, Romania and Ukraine.
 ''Democratic change and free elections are exhilarating events,'' he said. ''Yet we know from experience that they can be followed by moments of uncertainty. When people risk everything to vote, it can raise expectations that their lives will improve immediately -- but history teaches that the path to a free society is long and not always smooth.''

HEADLINE: Witness Says She Was Told To Cut Clinton Gala Charge

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 18 

 BODY:
Thousands of dollars in expenses, including more than $1,000 worth of rose petals, disappeared from a budget for a fund-raising gala on orders of David F. Rosen, who was the national finance director for Hillary Rodham Clinton's 2000 Senate race, a witness testified here today.
 The witness, a party planner named Bretta J. Nock, testified at the trial of Mr. Rosen, who is charged with causing false filings to be made to the Federal Election Commission by underreporting the cost of an August 2000 event, called the Hollywood Gala Salute to President William Jefferson Clinton. 
 In the first testimony that Mr. Rosen deliberately fudged the figures for the event, Ms. Nock said that after it was over, he told her that the overall costs in her budget had to be lower. She could not recall if Mr. Rosen had told her which items to cut, she said, but vendors had already been paid. 
 ''The budget was adjusted to reflect a lower amount,'' she said. She did not protest, she said. ''It wasn't my place.''
 Mr. Rosen, who is expected to take the stand in his own defense, has said through his lawyers that he was misled about the costs of the event by its organizers, who were involved in a now-defunct Internet company, Stan Lee Media. One of those men, Aaron Tonken, hired Ms. Nock. The jury learned for the first time today that Mr. Tonken is in federal prison for fraud involving events he put on for charities. 
 According to the government, Ms. Nock's cuts eliminated almost $29,000 from the $35,000 that she had charged in an earlier budget sent to Mr. Rosen; the lower budget was sent to campaign officials in Washington, according to the government. The true overall cost of the event, according to federal prosecutors, was more than $1 million.
 In addition to the disappearing rose petals, other eliminated items included hundreds of dollars worth of guest towels, matches, and mosquito netting and $20,000 in printing costs for a ''tribute journal,'' a sort of souvenir program of the event. (Couples who paid $25,000 to have dinner with Mrs. Clinton and President Bill Clinton got copies upholstered in fake blue suede.)
 Extravagant spending for the gala, and particularly the expensive demands made by the stars who performed at the concert portion of it, continued to be a theme in the trial testimony. 
 Blossette Kitson, who was in charge of rounding up celebrities to perform and to appear in the audience, was asked if the stars' demands were exorbitant. ''We have to create a new word for it,'' she said. ''It's out of control.'' She cited as examples stars' demands for private planes, hairdressers, makeup artists, and sometimes ''their puppy needs Evian water and not tap water.''
 And Alan J. Krausen, a travel agent, said that more than $31,000 was spent on a private plane for Cher, her entourage and the band Sugar Ray. Muhammad Ali was also transported in a smaller plane, which cost about $24,750. 
 But the organizers of the gala did economize in one way, Mr. Krausen said; they decided against hiring a bigger and more expensive plane that could also have accommodated Rosa Parks, the civil rights figure. She did not attend the gala.

HEADLINE: Transit Riders Keep Buying 30-Day Cards

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The 30-day MetroCard became more popular with subway and bus riders in March, right after its price increased, surprising transit officials who had thought that demand would slacken, at least temporarily.
 Statistics released by New York City Transit yesterday offered the first glimpse at changes in fare-purchasing patterns since fares went up on Feb. 27. 
 Unlike previous increases, the February increase affected only the 7-day and 30-day unlimited-ride fare cards, along with express-bus fares. The base fare, $2 for a single subway or local bus trip, did not change, nor did the discount for regular MetroCard purchases of $10 or more. 
 The price of the 7-day card rose to $24 from $21, or 14.3 percent. The 30-day card rose to $76 from $70, or 8.6 percent.
 In March, the 30-day card accounted for 28.1 percent of all fares sold, the highest proportion recorded since unlimited-ride cards were introduced in July 1998. A year earlier, the monthly card accounted for 23.6 percent of sales.
 In contrast, the 7-day card accounted for just 22.6 percent of sales in March, the lowest proportion since June 1999 and a significant drop from 27.5 percent a year earlier.
 Fares have become far more complicated in the past decade. The MetroCard was introduced in January 1994, free transfers between subways and buses in July 1997, volume discounts in January 1998 and a one-day, unlimited-ride Fun Pass in January 1999.
 Riders face a hodgepodge of calculations in determining which type of fare card makes the most sense. They must take into account not only their regular commute, but their likelihood of using a subway or bus on holidays and weekends.
 The transit agency, which is the largest subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, uses economic models to predict the effects of fare increases.
 The agency predicted that the February increase would result in a shift away from both the 7-day and 30-day cards and toward the regular cards. (With the discount, a $10 card is good for six rides, at a cost of $1.67 a ride.) 
 Instead, customers appear to have moved away from the 7-day card while the 30-day card has kept its customers and may have attracted some new ones. It is possible that many riders take the subway so often that the $6 increase was not enough to deter them from buying the card. 
 Fare revenue in March was $2.9 million less than predicted: about $236 million compared with about $239 million. In addition to the effects of the fare increase, bad weather might have decreased ridership.
 ''What you're really doing is a little crystal-balling as to what people's buying patterns will be,'' said Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit. ''You can't be 100 percent accurate in these models.''
 In an effort to help protect transit revenues, a committee of the authority's board approved changes yesterday to bring the rules of conduct for customers in line with a new state law. The law makes it a misdemeanor, rather than a violation, to sell a ride to another person by swiping an unlimited-ride card or by tampering with an expired card.

HEADLINE: 36 Hours Cleveland

BYLINE: By MICHAEL GOLLUST

 BODY:
THE Cleveland of ''American Splendor,'' the 2003 Oscar-nominated movie, is a dreary 1980's town of thrift stores and shambling eccentrics, a place where you'd barely care to spend two hours, let alone a weekend. Today, Cleveland hardly feels like the same place. In the 1990's, public-private enterprise replaced center-city blight with new sports stadiums and the lakefront Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Meanwhile, downtown's revival spurred gentrification into forgotten enclaves along the Cuyahoga River. There's a thriving art scene in Tremont, and the retooled Warehouse District has become a place to be, rather than flee, after dark. Clevelanders remain, by nature, a self-deprecating lot. But before long, calling their town hip, cosmopolitan -- even splendid -- won't sound so ironic. MICHAEL GOLLUST

Friday
5 p.m.
1 -- Church Hunting
Perched on a bluff across the Cuyahoga River from downtown, Tremont is a tree-lined neighborhood with a small-town feel. Stroll along West 14th Street among the grand churches built by the community's early German, Greek, Polish and Ukrainian immigrants. Farther to the east, fans of ''The Deer Hunter'' will recognize the distinctive onion domes of St. Theodosius Orthodox Cathedral (733 Starkweather Avenue, 216-741-1310), above, consecrated in 1912. Tours are available by appointment.

6 p.m.
2 -- Soho on the Cuyahoga
Until recently, Tremont was a rough blue-collar enclave shunned by Cleveland's more affluent east siders. Today, stylish restaurants and galleries make it a bustling nighttime destination. Visit on the second Friday of the month for the Tremont ArtWalk, when the shops and studios on and around Professor Avenue stay open late and artists mingle over music, gossip and wine. Drop by Mary Zodnik's and Ben Parsons's Azure Stained Glass Studio (2173 Professor Avenue, 216-357-2600), and hit Asterisk Gallery (2393 Professor Avenue, 330-304-8528), where Dana L. Depew showcases hip-hop photography, painting and sculpture. Anchoring the culinary scene is Fat Cats (2061 West 10th Street, 216-579-0200), where Ricardo Sandoval serves up eclectic dishes like seared duck breast with black-eyed peas, rapini, prosciutto and orange ginger sauce ($18). Local art hangs on the walls, but the picture-window view of the Cleveland skyline dominates.

Saturday
9:30 a.m.
3 -- To Market
In Ohio City, Tremont's nearby sibling in urban rejuvenation, start your day at the landmark West Side Market (West 25th Street and Lorain Avenue, 216-664-3387). Every Saturday at 7 a.m., shoppers descend on more than 100 vendors and carry off Cleveland's freshest meats, produce and ethnic foods. Grab a double latte at City Roast Coffee and Tea ($3, 216-241-2479), and an English breakfast pie of egg, potato, cheese and beef sausage, $2.75 at Reilly's (216-322-6144), then climb the stairs near City Roast to the balcony for the best shopper-viewing seats in the house. Across the street in Market Square Park there are live music and local crafts for sale every Saturday through the end of August (216-781-3222, www.openairinmarketsquare.com).

12:30 p.m.
4 -- Beer and a Bullet
It's not too early to belly up to the mahogany bar at the Great Lakes Brewing Company (2516 Market Avenue, 216-771-4404), below, which has produced award-winning beers for 17 years. Go for the Full Taste sampler ($8.50) of nine brews on tap, like the refreshing Holy Moses White Ale, with notes of chamomile and orange, or the hoppy, chocolately Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. There's pub grub, too, like a bratwurst and pierogi plate ($10.95), and free tours of the brewery across the street (Saturdays 2 p.m. to 8 p.m., on the hour). Before you leave, spot the hole in the wall behind the bar, said to have been left by a bullet aimed at Eliot Ness during his years as Cleveland's director of public safety in the mid-1930's.

2 p.m.
5 -- Cleveland Rocks
Elvis Presley made the Memphis sound famous, but it was a Cleveland disk jockey, Alan Freed, who named it ''rock and roll'' in 1951. Thanks to the Freed legend (and some intense lobbying), Cleveland beat out the likes of New York, Chicago and Memphis in 1986 to become home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum (751 Erieside Avenue, 888-764-7625; www.rockhall.com; admission $20). It opened in September 1995 in a 150,000-square-foot pyramidal palace designed by I.M. Pei. Today, half a million pilgrims each year visit the museum's interactive exhibits and collections of pop arcana, from David Byrne's giant padded suit from ''Stop Making Sense'' to Jimi Hendrix's childhood drawings. Live music is a draw, too; in June, the CMJ Rock Hall Music Fest (www.cmj.com/rockfest) comes to town.

7 p.m.
6 -- Dressed Up Downtown
The original site of Cleveland's late-1980's nightlife revival was the Flats, a string of margarita bars and music clubs along the banks of the Cuyahoga River. These days, the more fashion-forward crowd has migrated to the Warehouse District, home to rehabbed lofts and flashy restaurants like Johnny's Downtown (1406 West 6th Street, 216-623-0055). Try its rugged Northern Italian specialties like a veal chop Milanese topped with tomato concasse, arugula and balsamic vinaigrette ($39). Better still, stroll up Ontario Street and dine al fresco at Jacobs Field, the spectacular sandstone and steel home of the Cleveland Indians (2401 Ontario Street, 866-488-7423; cleveland.indians.mlb.com). Seats start at $6, hot dogs are $3, sightlines are outstanding, and even if the team on the field isn't, the stadium's signature brown Bertman Original Ball Park Mustard is the best in the big leagues.

10:30 p.m.
7 -- Frank, Dino and Dickens
Nick Kostis helped kick off the Warehouse District boom when he opened Hilarities Comedy Hall in 1985 on then-desolate West 6th Street. In 2002, he opened Pickwick & Frolic Restaurant & Club (2035 East 4th Street, 216-241-7425) on a sleepy lane known more for its wig shops than its nightlife. Mr. Kostis's eccentric pleasure dome combines a comedy club with a Dickens-inspired restaurant with the 60's-retro Kevin's Martini Bar. Armed with a raspberry-infused Red Sky at Night ($8.50) from Kevin's, swagger into the adjoining cabaret space for the Midnight Martini Show, a boozy salute to Las Vegas lounge lizardism, complete with dueling Sinatra interpreters and a fully feathered showgirl.

Sunday
10 a.m.
8 -- Museum Mile
University Circle, four miles east of downtown along Euclid Avenue, claims to have more cultural and performing arts institutions in one square mile than anywhere else in the country. Fuel up with the continental breakfast ($8) at the Glidden House (1901 Ford Drive, 800-759-8358), then look for the footless bronze cast of Rodin's ''Thinker,'' above, the victim of a vandal's bomb in 1970, on the steps of the nearby Cleveland Museum of Art (11150 East Boulevard, 216-421-7340). Admission is free. The museum's collection of Asian art is internationally renowned, and the medieval Armor Court has been a favorite of generations of Cleveland's children. Head for the tropics at the Cleveland Botanical Garden's two-year-old $37 million Eleanor Armstrong Smith Glasshouse (11030 East Boulevard, 888-853-7091; admission $7.50). Inside, 200 tropical butterflies flutter through the mist of a simulated Costa Rican cloud forest. A doorway away, iguanas and chameleons roam the spiny desert of Madagascar.

1 p.m.
9 -- Form and Function
You can't miss the stainless steel ribbons festooning Frank Gehry's Peter B. Lewis Building on the campus of Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management (11119 Bellflower Road). Sign up for a free half-hour tour, offered Saturdays and Sundays from 1 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., by phone (216-368-4771) or online (www.weatherhead.cwru.edu/tour). Harder to find, and in a different league architecturally, is the Barking Spider Tavern (11310 Juniper Road, 216-421-2863), a former carriage house that offers live music seven nights a week and on Sunday afternoons. Sit down with a cold Pinkus Muller Hefe-Weizen ($4.50) for a set of New Orleans jazz.

THE BASICS

Visiting Cleveland
 Cleveland is served by most major airlines and rental car agencies. Hop the R.T.A. Red Line train (216-621-9500, www.riderta.com) at the airport for a $1.50 25-minute ride to the downtown Tower City Center shopping complex. Amtrak and Greyhound have stations downtown. 
 The grand old Renaissance Cleveland Hotel (24 Public Square, 216-696-5600), in the center of town, has a plush lobby lounge and 491 well-appointed rooms starting at $139. 
 Modeled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, the Arcade has a stunning 100-foot-high skylight and was the nation's first indoor shopping mall when it opened in 1890. After a $60 million restoration, it re-emerged in 2001 as the Hyatt Regency Cleveland at the Arcade (420 Superior Avenue, 216-575-1234) with 293 rooms starting at $149. 
 Clifford House (1810 West 28th Street, 216-589-0121), a comfortable bed-and-breakfast in Ohio City, has two rooms that share a bathroom (starting at $85), a suite and an apartment. Jim Miner, the owner, makes a mean pancake breakfast and is an expert on Cleveland.

HEADLINE: The Chinese Connection

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Stories about the new Treasury report condemning China's currency policy probably had most readers going, ''Huh?'' Frankly, this is an issue that confuses professional economists, too. But let me try to explain what's going on.
 Over the last few years China, for its own reasons, has acted as an enabler both of U.S. fiscal irresponsibility and of a return to Nasdaq-style speculative mania, this time in the housing market. Now the U.S. government is finally admitting that there's a problem -- but it's asserting that the problem is China's, not ours. 
 And there's no sign that anyone in the administration has faced up to an unpleasant reality: the U.S. economy has become dependent on low-interest loans from China and other foreign governments, and it's likely to have major problems when those loans are no longer forthcoming.
 Here's how the U.S.-China economic relationship currently works:
 Money is pouring into China, both because of its rapidly rising trade surplus and because of investments by Western and Japanese companies. Normally, this inflow of funds would be self-correcting: both China's trade surplus and the foreign investment pouring in would push up the value of the yuan, China's currency, making China's exports less competitive and shrinking its trade surplus.
 But the Chinese government, unwilling to let that happen, has kept the yuan down by shipping the incoming funds right back out again, buying huge quantities of dollar assets -- about $200 billion worth in 2004, and possibly as much as $300 billion worth this year. This is economically perverse: China, a poor country where capital is still scarce by Western standards, is lending vast sums at low interest rates to the United States. 
 Yet the U.S. has become dependent on this perverse behavior. Dollar purchases by China and other foreign governments have temporarily insulated the U.S. economy from the effects of huge budget deficits. This money flowing in from abroad has kept U.S. interest rates low despite the enormous government borrowing required to cover the budget deficit. 
 Low interest rates, in turn, have been crucial to America's housing boom. And soaring house prices don't just create construction jobs; they also support consumer spending because many homeowners have converted rising house values into cash by refinancing their mortgages.
 So why is the U.S. government complaining? The Treasury report says nothing at all about how China's currency policy affects the United States -- all it offers on the domestic side is the usual sycophantic praise for administration policy. Instead, it focuses on the disadvantages of Chinese policy for the Chinese themselves. Since when is that a major U.S. concern?
 In reality, of course, the administration doesn't care about the Chinese economy. It's complaining about the yuan because of political pressure from U.S. manufacturers, which are angry about those Chinese trade surpluses. So it's all politics. And that's the problem: when policy decisions are made on purely political grounds, nobody thinks through their real-world consequences. 
 Here's what I think will happen if and when China changes its currency policy, and those cheap loans are no longer available. U.S. interest rates will rise; the housing bubble will probably burst; construction employment and consumer spending will both fall; falling home prices may lead to a wave of bankruptcies. And we'll suddenly wonder why anyone thought financing the budget deficit was easy.
 In other words, we've developed an addiction to Chinese dollar purchases, and will suffer painful withdrawal symptoms when they come to an end. 
 I'm not saying we should try to maintain the status quo. Addictions must be broken, and the sooner the better. After all, one of these days China will stop buying dollars of its own accord. And the housing bubble will eventually burst whatever we do. Besides, in the long run, ending our dependence on foreign dollar purchases will give us a healthier economy. In particular, a rise in the yuan and other Asian currencies will eventually make U.S. manufacturing, which has lost three million jobs since 2000, more competitive. 
 But the negative effects of a change in Chinese currency policy will probably be immediate, while the positive effects may take years to materialize. And as far as I can tell, nobody in a position of power is thinking about how we'll deal with the consequences if China actually gives in to U.S. demands, and lets the yuan rise.

HEADLINE: Aging in City Easily Beats Other Options

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

 BODY:
ROUND-NUMBER birthdays, like one that crept up on us the other day, can be a time to pause and reflect.
 O.K., that's enough stock-taking. Let's talk now about New York and some of its charms that remain constant even if your hairline doesn't.
 If you must grow older -- and the alternative is unacceptable -- this is a splendid city in which to do so. Granted, this is probably not true if you are poor; then again, it is hard to think of a place where poverty is an asset. 
 It also may not be true if you are not mobile. Subway stairs can be rough on the elderly, who are, literally, weak-kneed.
 But for most healthy people, New York has so much going on at any given moment that it will keep their minds active even if they do not work hard at it. There is also evidence that city life, for all its stresses, promotes well-being as the years drift by.
 That thought was reinforced by a study conducted by two RAND Corporation researchers published last fall in the journal Public Health. The researchers, Dr. Roland Sturm and Dr. Deborah Cohen, did not focus on New York alone, but they may as well have had this city in mind in their conclusions.
 After looking at 8,600 people across the country, they decided that life in a sprawling suburb can be rough. Suburbanites, Drs. Sturm and Cohen found, are more prone to assorted woes like high blood pressure, headaches and arthritis than are people living in what the researchers called compact cities. Goodness knows, high-rise New York is compact.
 Sure, the suburbs may be more tranquil than the big city in many respects. But people there also tend to sit more in their cars, often stuck in tension-inducing traffic. All things being equal -- which, granted, they rarely are -- ''living in a more compact area makes you more likely to walk more, and that leads to better health,'' Dr. Sturm said by phone from Los Angeles.
 Makes sense. But the city has lures for the aging beyond possible health advantages.
 It is generally accepted that people become more resistant to change as they grow older. New York in many ways is perfect for them. So many things here are as eternal as the Rolling Stones' going on tour again. One constant is an innate distrust of anything new.
 You can see it in the supercharged dispute over plans to renovate Washington Square Park, a $16 million project approved this week by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Almost every aspect of this project has drawn opposition from someone or another in Greenwich Village. Much of the anger is focused on a plan to ring the park with a spiked iron fence, four feet high or so.
 This, opponents say, is an offense to the spirit of the Village: freewheeling, bohemian, open. Some critics stop just short of suggesting that erecting a fence, which is intended to protect the park's landscaping, would increase the likelihood of jackbooted troops goose-stepping down Macdougal Street one day.
 THE uniqueness of Greenwich Village comes up a lot. Let's do nothing to disturb it, some people say, even the parts that are seedy and sad.
 True, true. You can feel the uniqueness as you emerge from the West Fourth Street subway station. Over there, on Avenue of the Americas by Waverly Place? That must be the Duane Reade where Joe Gould and William Burroughs used to shop. Next to it are other distinctly Village establishments, like Starbucks, Supercuts, Hollywood Tans and Barnes & Noble.
 If you take the RAND researchers' advice and walk, you can wander over to Washington Square. There, you immediately understand the opposition to the fence. Why would anyone want such a fence when there is already a perfectly ugly chicken-wire barrier, more than four feet high, in sections of the park?
 From that unique experience, you can head farther east, past the buildings gobbled up by New York University. At Broadway, there is more uniqueness: Staples, the Body Shop, United Colors of Benetton and, oh yes, another Duane Reade.
 The walk is enough to make you wonder about what is being preserved, or not, in a city that at heart doesn't like change yet cannot resist it.
 You want to grow old? You can do worse than to dwell on why some changes are quietly accepted while others send people to the barricades.
 In the freewheeling, bohemian, open Village, you can think about it over coffee. The neighborhood always had its coffeehouses. Only now you can go to the Starbucks on Astor Place, across from Kmart and mere yards from another Starbucks. So unique.

Previews and Openings

'TERRORISM' Opens Monday. A jet black and ominous comedy about modern Russian life that weaves together six interconnected scenes set everywhere from an airport runway to a lover's bedroom. Written by the Siberian brothers Vladimir and Oleg Presnyakov (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200.

'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Opens Tuesday. Seventeen composers each wrote one song to go with the lyrics of Mark Campbell for this solo show about the heartaches and successes of a gay New Yorker. In repertory with ''Score'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, (212) 239-6200.

'THE ARGUMENT' Opens Wednesday. Trouble in a relationship reaches its climax in this world premiere by Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of ''Omnium Gatherum'' (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303.

'THRILL ME: THE LEOPOLD & LOEB STORY' Opens Thursday.A musical based on the infamous 1920's murder inspired by the philosophy of Nietzsche. Sounds like a joke, but doesn't seem to be (1:30). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, (212) 868-444.

'TABLOID CALIGULA' Previews start Tuesday. Opens Thursday. A comedy about a small-time criminal in the unforgiving underworld, part of the Brits Off Broadway festival (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street (212) 279-4200.

'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Opens June 1. Elaine May's three one-acts is a new comedy on Broadway (remember those?) about married couples and aging singles looking for love. It's being called a play ''about life in the new millennium.'' Daniel Sullivan directs (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club, at the Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200.

'B.F.E.' Opens May 31. A kooky Asian-American family tries to escape its stifling home life, while a serial killer stalks its neighborhood in Arizona (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd (212) 279-4200.

'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' Previews start Wednesday. Opens June 15. Is it a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy? Renew that old debate at Tom Donaghy's new adaptation of Chekhov's last play. (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street (212) 239-6200.

'DRUMSTRUCK' Opens late May/early June. The gimmick of this new spin on ''Stomp,'' which includes 11 percussionists from West and South Africa, is that every audience member plays his or her own drum during the show. David Warren directs (1:25). Dodgers Stages, 340 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200.

'THE PARIS LETTER' Opens June 12. A repressed Wall Street investment banker (is there any other kind?) has a long, hard fall in Jon Robin Baitz's new drama that spans four decades (2:00). Roundabout Theater Company, at the Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300.

Broadway

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)

'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising souffle of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish wind-up music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us. (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Nobert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitous and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'MONTY PYTHON'S SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Broadway

'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the Armenian genocide. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at East 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)

'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' John Belluso's timely drama about girl in a coma who may or may not heal the sick engages the issues raised during the Terri Schiavo media circus. It's a thought-provoking and ambitious play (starring Tim Daly) but unfortunately there's no characters in it you can believe in (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)

* 'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity that any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'KING A' Het Laagland's variation on the legend of King Arthur for children features five energetic actors, 40 tiny chairs, several a cappella musical numbers, occasional swordplay and frequent inspiring affirmations. The show is inventive and full of physical energy but in the end may be a little too talky for its intended audience (1:20.) New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)

'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the two maids (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond and East Second Streets, (212)279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'MEMORY HOUSE' Dianne Wiest's warm, engaging performance provides the juicy filling in Kathleen Tolan's play about a tense stand-off between a mother and her teenage daughter over their differing philosophies of life. As she bakes a pie -- from scratch, mind you -- Ms. Wiest performs the still more challenging feat of keeping our sympathies keenly attuned to the appealing emotional undercurrents in Ms. Tolan's slight but sensitively drawn two-hander (1:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)

* 'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side-effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212. (Isherwood)

'THE PULL OF NEGATIVE GRAVITY' A Welsh man with no seeming interest in politics gets badly injured in the Iraq war and discovers that returning home will not be so easy. In this bruising, intimate and overly familiar play, which is part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, Jonathan Lichtenstein beautifully portrays how the war destroyed one rural family (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. ( Zinoman)

'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village. (212) 239-6200. (Anne Midgette)

'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' The comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)

* 'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'THE FALL' Through Kenneth Nowell's looking glass, Hamlet is reversed, and a daughter; Jill is driven mad by her mother's ghost. Was the mother's expected death natural or an act of murder by her father, who too quickly married her mother's sister? A strong cast and superb director, Kate Marks, manage a tone that teeters effectively between the tragic and the hilarious, and one is left unexpectedly shaken (1:40). Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, (212)307-9467). (Honor Moore)

'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh -- sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street , (212)307-4747. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'LES BELLES SOEURS' There is a good John Waters movie hiding inside Michel Tremblay's all-female play. This likable comedy about a New England woman who wins a million trading stamps wants to be a farce but is just a collection of observations searching for a shape (1:30). Kraine Theater, 85 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)330-8650, closing on Sunday. (Gates)

'CHANTECLER' A version of Edmond Rostand's fable about a rooster and his role in the cosmos bills itself as a family show, but it's pitched way over the heads of the age group that would most enjoy its colorful costumes. But Cory Einbinder, the director, manages to make a smattering of scenes memorable: a parade of mutant roosters; a ridiculous trio of toads (2:20). Teatro La Tea, at Clemente Soto Valez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, second floor, (212)353-3101, closing on Sunday. (Genzlinger)

'JAPANESE PLAYS FROM THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY' The sole reason to see this evening of three one-acts is the rare staging of "Paper Balloon," by Kunio Kishida, one of Japan's most important pre-World War II dramatists. The rest of the program is embarrassingly misconceived (2:00) . Common Basis Theater, 750 Eighth Avenue, room 500, (646)554-6557, closing on Sunday. (Jonathan Kalb)

'LITTLE WOMEN' Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of American Girl dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

* 'LOVE/LIFE A LIFE IN SONG' The year's finest cabaret act has expanded into a brilliant 90-minute concert for the theater in which Brian Stokes Mitchell sustains a remarkable fusion of pop-jazz singing and theatrical expression. A must (1:30). Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, (212) 239-6200, closing on Monday. (Stephen Holden)

* 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women (1:25). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR' Henry Adam's play starts out as a humorous, trenchant fable on how fear of terrorism can distort individual lives, not to say nations, but something mysterious happens after intermission: it mutates into a sitcom. The actors Ronny Jhutti and Mark McDonnell are very much worth watching, though. Part of Brits Off Broadway (2:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Andrea Stevens)

'THE PURSUIT OF PERSEPHONE' A musical inspired by F. Scott Fitzgerald's college romance with Ginevra King jams 26 songs into two and a half hours -- which feels even longer. The evening's most entertaining moments are the drag routines by the Triangle Club, a fraternity to which Fitzgerald belonged when he was at Princeton (2:30). Prospect Theater Company, at the Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, (212)352-3101, closing on Sunday. (Phoebe Hoban)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)

'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes) Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick marks a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)

'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)

'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

* 'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, in part because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

* 'FEVER PITCH' (PG-13, 98 minutes) To watch this new, thoroughly winning if not especially good romantic comedy is to appreciate, yet again, that the great loves of our lives are rarely perfect. (Dargis)

* 'FUNNY HA HA' (not rated, 89 minutes) Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott)

* 'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)

* 'THE HOLY GIRL' (not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)

'HOUSE OF D' (PG-13, 97 minutes) Robin Williams plays a wise and kindly mentally retarded janitor. Enough said. (Scott)

'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes) Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creepshow, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

'JIMINY GLICK IN LALAWOOD' (R, 90 minutes) This frantic comic hodgepodge built around Martin Short's popular Comedy Central character is an intermittently funny free-for-all that suffers from attention deficit disorder. (Holden)

'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy and Robert Duvall (as Mr. Ferrell's father and rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson you'll win big anyway. (Scott)

'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes) A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in for the filmmaker to do the same. (Dargis)

'KING'S RANSOM' (PG-13, 97 minutes) The cinematic equivalent of trampled chewing gum on a subway platform. (Holden)

'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two Dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)

* 'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)

'MA MERE' (NC-17, 110 minutes, in French) Avid sensation seeking in this film is such a grim affair that after a short while, the spectacle of its aimless characters bending themselves out of shape in the pursuit of depravity mutates from titillating to pathetic to laughable. (Holden)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth-graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)

'MINDHUNTERS' (R, 106 minutes) This thriller re-imagines Agatha Christie's ''Ten Little Indians'' as ''Eight Little Profilers'': a team of would-be F.B.I. agents, isolated at a training compound to solve a simulated crime, soon realize that a real serial killer walks among them. The film may find a cult audience among fans of schlock cinema seeking a giggle and a scream. (Dana Stevens)

'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)

* 'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad-boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a little league coach. Superb performances, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)

'PALINDROMES' (not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)

'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)

'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)

* 'STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

* '3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean) A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott)

* 'A TOUTE DE SUITE' (Not rated, 96 minutes; in French) This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden)

'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)

'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (ne O'Shea Jackson). (Dargis)

Film Series

'CELEBRATING THE BLACK VOICES WEEKEND' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Symphony Space is screening George C. Wolfe's ''Lackawanna Blues'' (2005), based on Ruben Santiago-Hudson's play about a boardinghouse matriarch (S.

FRANCOIS OZON RETROSPECTIVE (Sunday through June 5) The Museum of the Moving Image is honoring Mr. Ozon, the genre-bending French director of ''Swimming Pool'' and ''Under the Sand.''

(Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

* THE BLOOD BROTHERS (Tuesday) Screaming lyrics like ''We're scrapped valentines/We're tangerine rinds'' over pummeling, chaotic guitars, this visceral Seattle quintet finds that temperature at which panicky noise-punk explodes into emo shrapnel. 8 p.m., Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, www.spiritnewyork.com or www.ticketmaster.com, $12. (Laura Sinagra)

BOREDOMS (Wednesday) For almost two decades now, the Japanese noise group has been one of the best psychedelic rock bands in the world. Though its latest album doesn't touch its best, its live show always matches sonic exploration with stage charisma. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20. (Sinagra)

* BRIGHT EYES, THE FAINT, MARS BLACK (Tomorrow through Wednesday) The Nebraskan singer-songwriter Conor Oberst is perhaps too jittery to resonate as a New Dylan to diehard fans of the Old Dylan. But his emphatic wisdom, political indignance and wine-soaked laments make him a contender for the best songwriter of his generation. These shows focus on music from the electronic rock half of his recent double-album. With goth-dance band The Faint and self-deprecating rapper Mars Black. 7:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, (212)353-1600, $25, sold out. (Sinagra)

KELLY CLARKSON (Tomorrow) Pulling a hit song from the jaws of assured post- ''American Idol'' obscurity, the amiable Kelly Clarkson wisely ditched light dance pop for attitudinous pop rock. The Max Martin-penned ''Since You Been Gone'' is the catchiest party song since ''Hey Ya.'' 1 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)307-7171, $37. (Sinagra)

COMMON (Monday and Tuesday) The Chicago rapper Common has at times deserved the stigma that attends the label ''conscious rap'' -- the assumption of preachiness and lackluster execution. On his new record, though, he meets the challenge of working with the fellow Midwesterner and current ''It'' producer Kanye West. 9 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, (212)243-4940, $30.(Sinagra)

* THE DECEMBERISTS (Thursday) The weight of the bandleader Colin Melloy's baroque songs about child queens, heartsick cold war spies and vengeful seafarers is lightened by his sweeping lovelorn sing-alongs. 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505, $18. (Sinagra)

* DEERHOOF (Tomorrow and Sunday) This excitingly whimsical band harbors equal amounts affection for No Wave angularity, exuberant noise-pop, and outsider naif art like the Shaggs. Their latest release is an electronically augmented fractured fairy tale about a kidnapping milkman. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $10 (Sinagra)

DR. JOHN: 'ALL BY HISSELF' (Tonight and tomorrow, and May 25-29) Dr. John is steeped in New Orleans barrelhouse piano, swampy bayou funk and the gris-gris mysticism that surrounds it. He has applied his cagey growl of a voice and florid piano playing to jazz standards and songs with a conscience. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., except Wednesday and Thursday when shows are at 8 p.m., Au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-9455, $50. (Jon Pareles)

THE EVENS (Tomorrow) The Evens is the new duo from Ian MacKaye, who will forever be followed (if not always loved) by fans of his pioneering previous bands Minor Threat and Fugazi; joined by Amy Farina, he lends his famous wail to casual (but not passionless) indie-rock songs. With Parts & Labor and others. 2 p.m., East River Amphitheater, East River Park, the Lower East Side, www.eastrivermusicproject.com, free. (Kelefa Sanneh)

FISCHERSPOONER (Thursday) The heavily conceptual art-world buzz and gallery extravaganzas of Fischerspooner didn't turn its electro ditties into hits; now the band is back on a more humble scale. After show party with the D.J. Andrew Andrew ($10). 9 p.m., Canal Room, 285 West Broadway, Chinatown, (212)941-8100, $22.50 in advance, $25 at the door. (Pareles)

JOSEPHINE FOSTER (Tonight) You might call Ms. Foster's eerie warbling old-fashioned, except that it evokes a scrambled past that exists only in her own vision: mountain songs that never were, spaced-out hybrids that never will be. She is to open for Akron/Family and the Angels of Light. 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)599-5103, $15. (Sanneh)

FOUNTAINS OF WAYNE, BEN KWELLER (Sunday) Still underappreciated even after 2002's fluke MTV smash ''Stacy's Mom,'' these 30-something songwriters continue to write clever, pure pop ditties and some of the smartest yuppie satire around. This show benefits the Sing for the Children Fund. The Brooklyn-based melodist Ben Kweller opens. 4 p.m., Rumsey Playfield, Central Park, 72nd Street and Fifth Avenue, $50 for concert-only, $150-$2500 for special VIP access. Information at www.singforthechildren.org. (Sinagra)

* GANG GANG DANCE (Thursday) This sly, angular local band recently released ''God's Money'' (The Social Registry), a beguiling album full of splintered post-punk rhythms that cohere around the dreamlike murmurs of Lizzi Bougatsos. With Bloodlines and Electroputas. 9 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15. (Sanneh)

GIPSY KINGS (Monday) Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, this French pop group is to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street, (212) 247-4777, $39.50 to $79.50. (Pareles)

* GZA, C-RAYZ WALZ, J-LIVE, VAST AIRE (Monday) The most cerebral Wu Tang Clan member, GZA (aka ''Genius''), fronts a tour of rappers who idealize the East Coast's Golden Age of elite M.C.'s. That is, they pursue nuance over histrionics and hubris. 8 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, (212)997-4144, $18.50 in advance, $20. (Sinagra)

SOPHIE B. HAWKINS (Tuesday) Most famous for the gay-positive radio hit, ''Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover'' on a 1992 album adorned with naked photos by David LaChappelle, the intriguingly gutsy Hawkins now plays the singer-songwriter circuit. 7 p.m., Living Room, 154 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-7235, $32 in advance, $35 at the door. (Sinagra)

HOT HOT HEAT (Tonight) In a fray of 80's revival bands with interchangeable frontmen, this Canadian outfit boasts the more memorable bounce of curlicued leader Steve Bays. Problem is, as evidenced by the petulant single ''Goodnight Goodnight,'' his relatively shallow vision and cloying choruses don't often justify the cocky posture and overwrought hiccups. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, (212)353-1600, $20 in advance, $23 at the door. (Sinagra)

BILLY IDOL (Sunday and Monday) Those who played the faux-noir ''White Wedding'' at their weddings, or affected a sexy snarl for old times' sake during pop-punker Billy Idol's quick flicker on MTV's ''I Love the 80's'' can now dance with themselves and others as Idol reprises his radio hits. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Upper West Side, (212)496-7070, $33.50 to $53.50. (Sinagra)

JIM & JENNIE AND THE PINETOPS (Monday) Unlike a lot of younger Alt-Country bands that nod to classic traditions, this Pennsylvania group actually plays accomplished bluegrass topped by high lonesome close-harmonic vocals. 7 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700, $10. (Sinagra)

KING GYPSY ROCKER MASSIVE (Sunday) Gogol Bordello's Eugene Hutz has done for Gypsy music what the Pogues did for Irish traditionals, fusing their dizzy catharsis with visceral punk scuzz. This event fills the entire Knitting Factory complex with musicians occupying points on the Balkan punk rock continuum. Performers include DJ Hutz, World Inferno Friendship Society Nervous Cabaret, and Slavic Soul Party. 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132, $15. (Sinagra)

CYNDI LAUPER, NATALIE MERCHANT, NELLIE MCKAY, SANDRA BERNHARD (Monday) This benefit concert for the family of the well-regarded and recently deceased music executive Theresa Brilli will feature a full set by the 80's new wave rocker Ms. Lauper, as well as guest appearances by the serious-minded singer-songwriter Ms. Merchant, the cabaret wunderkind Nellie McKay and others. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, (212)777-6800, $60. (Sinagra)

* LIGHTNING BOLT (Thursday) This noisy and exuberant two-piece makes a terrifying racket, using fuzzed-into-obliteration bass and galloping drums (with some screaming, too) to create half-abstract pieces that hint at everything from heavy metal to dance music. With Mutant Life Expectancy and others. 9 p.m., the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Columbia Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007, $10. (Sanneh)

SARAH MCLACHLAN (Tuesday) Still singing with epic pop swoon about love, resolute ambivalence, and broadly conceived existential matters, the founder of Lilith Fair is thinking increasingly globally (e.g., last year's ''World on Fire'' single). 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, (212)465-6741, $34.50 to $84.50. (Sinagra)

MONADE (Tomorrow and Sunday) Laetitia Sadier of the pacific, intellectual art pop group Stereolab continues in that vein with music that's charming yet somewhat insular. 9:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side (212)260-4700, $14 in advance, $12 at the door. (Sinagra)

MARK O'CONNOR, DAVID BROMBERG, NATALIE MACMASTER (Tomorrow) Billed as a ''fiddling summit,'' this concert should put some idiosyncratic twists into tradition. It includes Mark O'Connor's mixture of Appalachian and classical music, Natalie MacMaster's rough-hewn Celtic fiddling and stepdancing from Cape Breton and David Bromberg's all-American eclecticism and vintage violins, along with Mr. Bromberg's guests Jay Ungar (whose ''Ashokan Farewell'' was the theme of Ken Burns's ''Civil War'') and Molly Mason. 8 p.m. New Jersey Performing Arts Center, One Center Street, Newark (888)466-5722, $10 to $48.

PINBACK (Tuesday) Overthought pop constructions are an acquired taste, but this band's pointillist songs are at their most compelling when they sound like stripped-down sonic schematics. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, (212)777-6800, $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

PLASTIC PEOPLE OF THE UNIVERSE (Sunday) In Prague in the 1960's, the Plastic People of the Universe transmuted the lessons of Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground into dank, dissonant, precise songs that drew the wrath of Czechoslovakia's Communist government. The band's persecution galvanized a dissident movement that eventually triumphed. But the reconstituted band's songs are more than period pieces; by finding a rock language for Eastern European angst, they turn desperation inside out. 7 and 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, (212)539-8777, $25 in advance, $30. (Pareles)

RILO KILEY, PORTASTATIC (Thursday) This band combines the expansive American longing of Bruce Springsteen with the bedroom introspection of early Liz Phair. The frontwoman Jennie Lewis's humanized star power makes for an explosive live show. The Superchunk leader Mac MacCaughan's long-standing side project Portastatic opens. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, (212)353-1600, $18 in advance, $20. (Sinagra)

TAJ MAHAL (Tuesday through Thursday) The fingerpicking, jazz-loving, globe-hopping yet down-home bluesman measures the persistence of the blues as he traces its kin. 8 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592, $30. (Pareles)

TEAM SLEEP (Wednesday) Though his band, the Deftones, got famous on the frat-friendly nu-metal circuit in the late 90's, Chino Moreno has a reputation as a thoughtful lyricist and eclectic music fan. He's been steadily taking things in a dreamier direction, and this side project looks to explore the expansive desertscapes beyond hard-rock bashing. 8 and 11 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3132, $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sinagra)

THIEVERY CORPORATION (Tonight and tomorrow) Ten years ago this D.C. D.J. duo typified the ''Swingers'' era at its most laconic. Remarkably, they've persisted as a durable act, adroitly integrating various electronic and global strains through a dub sensibility. 8 p.m., Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, www.spiritnewyork.com or (212)307-7171, $35. (Sinagra)

TRACHTENBURG FAMILY SLIDE SHOW PLAYERS (Thursday) Continuing their familial performance art project, Jason Trachtenburg plays lo-fi pop tunes inspired by slides found at yard sales while wife Tina runs the projector. Their 9-year-old daughter Rachel, who has become something of an underground girl-power poster kid, plays drums. 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503, $12. (Sinagra)

U2 (Tonight) After 2000's thrilling ''All that You Can't Leave Behind'' (Interscope), the new ''How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb'' (Interscope) and the ''Vertigo'' tour itself focus on what humans can live without: namely ICBM's and, evidently, some of U2's more shopworn live staples. Hence the vivid resurrection of decades-old rarities like ''Electric Co.'' 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741, $54 to $169, sold out. (Sinagra)

* WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE 20TH ANNIVERSARY BENEFIT CONCERT (Tomorrow) Traditionalists turn eclectic as the tabla master Zakir Hussain gathers percussionists, flutists and string players with expertise in everything from Irish reels to flamenco, Moroccan gnawa music to raga, African polyphony to Chinese pipa (lute) tone poems. 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)840-2824 or (212)545-7536, $30 to $100.

(Ratliff)

* BILL FRISELL TRIO (Tomorrow and Sunday) This group, with the keyboardist Sam Yahel and the drummer Brian Blade, is one of three different trios that the guitarist Bill Frisell now plays with, and it's the one that perhaps goes the furthest out there. 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 p.m. set tomorrow night, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-2232, cover, $30.

Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)258-9800, $30, plus a $10 minimum (Ratliff)

ANDREW HILL 'RETRO' QUARTET (Through tomorrow) The pianist Andrew Hill is one of the most mysterious composers of modern jazz, not just for his fraught harmonies and layered rhythms but for his periodic disappearances from the scene. But he's come back over the last decade, leading a number of bands; this is a quartet with the saxophonist Greg Tardy, the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Leroi Jones. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, (212)581-3080, cover, $30, plus a $10 minimum.

* BOBBY HUTCHERSON QUARTET (Through Sunday) Mr. Hutcherson is one of the great individual voices and better composers in jazz, and he's a vibraphonist, making him triply rare.

The band includes the pianist Mike LeDonne, the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Billy Drummond. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037, cover, $30. (Ratliff)

VISION CLUB: LIFETIME VISIONS ORCHESTRA (Tomorrow night) A band led by the saxophonist Joseph Jarman, one of the founders of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, and the pianist and composer Chris Chalfant.

JUNIOR MANCE (Through tomorrow) In his mid-70's, Mr. Mance is an excitable, physical player who throws himself into fast tempos and splashy, jubilant fancies that are not heard much outside Oscar Peterson. But he is also an earthy blues-and-bop player from Chicago; his resume includes time in the bands of Dinah Washington, Dizzy Gillespie and Cannonball Adderley. 8, 10, and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212)255-3626, cover, $20, minimum, $10. (Ratliff)

KATE McGARRY (Tomorrow) A lot of jazz singers are good at a few devices and punch them out song after song; Ms. McGarry has a deeper supply. You'll find shades of pop singers like Suzanne Vega and Rickie Lee Jones in her voice; you'll also find some of the highest refinements of great jazz singing. She has a breadth of material that runs from jazz standards to traditional Irish ballads to a version of the Kinks' ''(So) Tired of Waiting for You.'' Her new record is ''Mercy Street'' (Palmetto). 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883, no cover (Ratliff)

(Ratliff)

(Ratliff)

* EIVIND OPSVIK 'OVERSEAS' (Wednesday) Mr. Opsvik is a young Norwegian bassist and bandleader with an unusual gift for writing small, poignant pieces of music. His melodic shards are strong, as are the chord sequences moving underneath them; he has the distinction, in a time when jazz compositions are becoming increasingly opaque, of writing catchy tunes, and his fat-toned, unfussy bass sound enhances them. His new record is ''Overseas II,'' on Fresh Sound, and his band includes Tony Malaby, Jacob Sacks, Craig Taborn, and Kenny Wollesen. 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)929-9883, cover, $8 and a one-drink minimum (Ratliff)

OREGON (Through) Celtic music, jazz, swing and classical guitar get all mixed up in the music of Oregon, a band that's been around since 1970.

(Ratliff)

* NICHOLAS PAYTON QUINTET (Wednesday through May 28) The trumpeter Nicholas Payton first grabbed the jazz world's attention with his remarkable feeling for early New Orleans jazz and more recently made an obstinately spacey funk record, but he's spent most of his professional time dealing with the rich languages of post-1960 jazz. Here he'll be mining that territory. 9 and 11, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212)581-3080, cover, $30, with a $10 minimum (Ratliff)

ERIC REED TRIO (Through tomorrow) Always alert and fluent, Mr. Reed, the pianist, has gospel and bebop and a lot of post-50's modernism in him, too.

(Ratliff)

* LINCOLN CENTER ORCHESTRA PLAYS THAD JONES (Through tomorrow) The trumpeter and composer Thad Jones, who died in 1986, always deserves a second look. A member of Count Basie's orchestra during the 1950's and early 60's, he decamped to form his own big band, which played weekly shows at the Village Vanguard, starting a new large-ensemble jazz tradition. Jazz at Lincoln Center's gleaming band takes on his music, with the saxophonists Jerry Dodgion and Billy Harper and the bass trombonist Douglas Purviance, as guests; Vincent Gardner, one of Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra's trombonists, presents new arrangements of the old tunes. 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Manhattan, (212)721-6500, $85to $150. (Ratliff)

* CLARK TERRY (Tuesday through May 29) It's possible that no other jazz musician has as much amusing old-guy charm as Mr. Terry, and when you think he's all sweetness, he'll rattle you profoundly with a cool, beautifully executed piece of fluegelhorn playing. 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037, $30. (Ratliff)

THE TRIO/SEX MOB (Tonight) The Trio includes three jazz-oriented jam-band heroes: the bassist Chris Wood (of Medeski, Martin & Wood), the saxophonist Skerik (who plays with Stanton Moore and Galactic) and the drummer Johnny Vidacovich (of Astral Project). Sex Mob is rowdy quartet led by the slide-trumpeter Steven Bernstein, known to cover songs written by everyone from Wynton Marsalis to Nirvana; Mr. Bernstein is a gifted enough arranger to get the sarcasm-to-respect equation right, 10 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, $20. (Ratliff)

Classical

Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.

Opera

'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' (Tonight) Musically not much of an opera, it does provide a meaty role for the ageless tenor Placido Domingo, who gives a vocally fervent and poignant portrayal of Cyrano, the fearless and noble guardsman cursed with an absurdly huge nose. The cast is excellent, and Francesca Zambello has created a stylish and handsome production. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available. (Anthony Tommasini)

'L'ELISIR D'AMORE' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Run on enthusiasm and a shoestring, the tiny Amato Opera mounts a modest production of the Donizetti classic.

'FAUST' (Tomorrow) In a revelatory performance James Levine cuts through the hokum and captures the music's dignity and elegance. And the Met has assembled a top-rank cast, especially Rene Pape as Mephistopheles. Alas, the Met's new production by Andrei Serban is a jumble. 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, sold out, but returns may be available. (Tommasini)

'TOSCA' (Tomorrow) The Met puts its season to bed with a soothing old favorite: Puccini's classic, in Franco Zeffirelli's lavish and historically authentic production. The high point of the cast should be Marcello Giordani, who has been singing ardently and ringingly, as Cavaradossi. 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000, $145 and $215 tickets remain. (Anne Midgette)

Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212)997-7717, $100 and $250. (Tommasini)

NEW YORK CHORAL SOCIETY (Tonight) It's like Giacomo in the Kentucky Derby: an amateur chorus overmatched in Beethoven's well-nigh unsingable ''Missa Solemnis.'' A risky proposition, it nevertheless affords the opportunity to shine. 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800, $18 to $75. (Oestreich)

NEW YORK NEW MUSIC ENSEMBLE (Monday) Contemporary music often involves a measure of gamesmanship, or at least, a sometimes fluid negotiation between the composer and the performers (and sometimes the listeners). With game-playing as its theme, this first-rate group offers works by Hiroya Miura, Wayne Peterson, John Anthony Lennon, David Rakowski and Andrew Imbrie. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3303, $15; $10 for students and 65+. (Kozinn)

PARTHENIA (Tonight) The sound of a viol consort, though quite rich on its own, is enhanced when it supports the voice. The superb Parthenia and the soprano Jolle Greenleaf will explore that combination in a program of Baroque Italian works and a contemporary piece by John Stone. 8 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212)358-5942, $25, $18 for students and 65+.

Museums

* AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION: AFRICAN AMERICAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses's view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

* ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India; embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700. Also at Queens: ''Fatal Love.'' (Holland Cotter)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)

* BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. (See above.) (Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics; but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, the innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

* EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustin Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with Revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Michael Kimmelman)

* SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Nunez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquin Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)

* JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

* METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS,' through May 30. Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Kimmelman)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. (See above.) (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY 15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)

MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST,' through May 29. Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art. They make a savory anthology, with plenty of textbook staples, and some surprises. 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-7700. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!: SELF-TAUGHT ARTISTS, THE BIBLE AND THE AMERICAN SOUTH,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelists. Many names familiar to followers of 20th century folk and outsider art are on hand including William Edmondson, Minnie Evans, the Reverend Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)

* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)

* MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND,' through May 30. A generally stellar midcareer survey of the 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Kimmelman)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. (See above.) (Smith)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)

NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

* STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art, or music, this country has produced. Also at the museum: ''Chris Ofili: Afro Muses 1995-2005.'' 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Smith)

THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

* WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' through May 29. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high. His midcareer retrospective, like a mad scientists' fair of screwball contraptions, hopscotches from one dexterous tour de force to the next. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (800)944-8639. (Kimmelman)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)

Galleries: Uptown

* JACK GOLDSTEIN A hero of the Pictures generation revered by the new Pop artists and theorists of the 80's. His films from the early 70's (from 20 seconds to five minutes long) have a cool, deadpan quality recalling early videos of William Wegman. Ed Ruscha-style paintings of lightning storms from the 80's, here and at Metro, are thrillingly cinematic. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, through May 27. (Johnson)

* 'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery,125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, through June 4. (Cotter)

* RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)

Galleries: 57th Street

'EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY' Among more than 70 narrative paintings, drawings and prints by a wide range of 20th century artists are works by Max Beckmann, James Ensor, John Heartfield, Kathe Kollwitz, Sue Coe, Martha Rosler and Eric Fischl.

Janet Borden, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, (212)431-0166, through May 27. (Johnson)

TERAO KATSUHIRO, SHINKI TOMOYUKI, YOSHIMUNE KAZUHIRO, YUMOTO MITSUO Four artists, from a Japanese facility for the artistically talented mentally disabled, appear possessed of naive but intense imaginations and formal predilections bordering on compulsive. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, (212)925-1200, through May 31. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' A video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, (212)462-2668, through May 28. (Smith)

DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the hand-made and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)

IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child-star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue, 511 West 25th Street, (212)206-3583, through June 4. (Smith)

CHERYL DONEGAN: 'OLD, TEMPORARY' While video-projected images of colorful cheap toys unfold on the wall, a woman's maniacally cheerful voice recites a rapid-fire litany of affirmations composed for Amway salespeople: ''I am the best at what I do. There is no one better. I get the job done,'' and so on. It is funny and scary. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)255-0979, through June 4. (Johnson)

ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)

AMY GARTRELL: 'HOT HANDS, COLD HEART' The tribulations and infatuations of youth are the subjects of drawings, felt banners and an installation involving faceted glass charms and a lugubrious tree that would have done Edward Gorey proud. Daniel Reich, 537A West 23rd Street,(212)924-4949, through May 28. (Smith)

JAMES GOBEL: 'RIDICULE IS NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF' Fat Rococo-era fops pose on a striped floor against a background of snow-covered rocky peaks in a campy, mural-scale confection made of neatly assembled pieces of colored felt. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, (212)352-2238, through May 27. (Johnson)

'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212)243-3159, through May 27. (Smith)

NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree braches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)

RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by the influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through June 18. (Johnson)

'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)

QIU SHIHUA: 'INSIGHT' At first, the canvases by this painter from Shenzhen, China, look like nothing more than slightly scuffed expanses of raw fabric. Look again and you discover peaceful, luminously misty landscapes realized with amazing subtlety. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, (212)414-1169, through May 28. (Johnson) JOHN F. SIMON JR.: 'ENDLESS VICTORY' Mesmerizing, animated patterns driven by sophisticated software programs and running on laptop screens; they would make excellent screen savers. One plays inventive variations on Mondrian's ''Victory Boogie Woogie.'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646)336-7183, through May 28. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes tear drops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)

* AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock-coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)

Last Chance

JOSEF ALBERS/DONALD JUDD: 'STRUCTURE AND COLOR' Despite the 40-year age difference, this vivacious museum-quality show of two geometric abstractionists -- one proto-Minimalist, the other Minimalist -- is a call and response echo chamber of levitating squares and rectangles of color.

HEADLINE: Is a Salaryman Without a Suit Like Sushi Without the Rice?

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 19 

 BODY:
The fashion models who prowl the catwalks of Japan tend to be long-legged and slinky. But the latest style setter here has a leonine glare and the kind of commanding bark that makes junior executives sit up and take notice.
 Hiroshi Okuda, chairman of Toyota Motor, Japan's largest company, is about to make his runway debut, promenading before the cameras for a new national campaign to cajole Japanese men to help the nation save energy by shedding their jackets and ties in summer.
 This blatant appeal to hierarchy comes as Japan -- the world's second-largest oil importer, after the United States -- charts a sartorial revolution intended to cut summer air-conditioning bills. The dark business suit, the beloved uniform for generations of salarymen, is supposed to stay at home this summer. All public and private offices -- in a bid to save energy and reduce output of global warming gases -- are to set their air-conditioners at 28 degrees centigrade, or a sweltering 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 ''Japanese often feel they cannot do this or that if their bosses are not doing it,'' said Yoshihisa Fujita, the environment ministry official in charge of the campaign. ''We targeted top executives of major corporations to lead the movement because smaller company employees would feel, 'We cannot remove neckties when our customer, company people, wear them.''' 
 Until now, office air-conditioning settings have varied, with some women complaining of glacial temperatures that allow their male colleagues' suits to look crisp. Next Tuesday, a rules committee of the lower house of Parliament is expected to vote to allow members to doff their coats in offices and committee rooms, a throwback to the 1950's, before air-conditioning. 
 With air-conditioners blasting less hot air into streets, the nation's dominant city also hopes to attack its summer ''heat island'' syndrome. With few parks, vast swathes of cement and new high-rises blocking sea breezes, Tokyo's number of ''tropical nights'' -- when thermometers never drop below 77 degrees Fahrenheit -- jumped to 41 last year from fewer than 5 a century ago.
 ''This summer I will not allow anybody with tie or jacket into my office,'' the environment minister, Yuriko Koike, told ministry employees on April 1, well in advance of the June 1 unofficial start of the air-conditioning season. In a press conference, she said that Cool Biz, a vaguely American fashion label pronounced ''kuuru bizu,'' had been chosen among 3,200 suggestions submitted for Japan's new casual summer look. 
 Some Japanese men sniff a plot by the nation's apparel industry to copy the boom enjoyed by American men's clothing stores a decade ago, when Casual Fridays forced office workers to augment their wardrobes with pressed khakis and nice sports shirts.
 ''We welcome the Cool Biz move; it is a favorable wind for us,'' Masaaki Kato, spokesman for Renown D'urban Holdings, one of Japan's largest apparel companies, said in an interview. ''The fence between business and casual has been crumbling recently. There is a decline in the traditional view that the man who is wearing a suit is a businessman and the man who's not is unemployed.''
 The catchy Cool Biz name is essential because many Japanese cringe at memories of a fashion crime committed by a prime minister after the 1970's oil shock. Called the ''energy saving'' look, this short-lived suit featured jacket sleeves cut off above the elbows. This hybrid salaryman safari suit bombed.
 Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi unveiled the casual summer look in April, pitching it as part of Japan's effort to meet its 2012 goal of cutting its emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 percent from 1990's levels. 
 ''The government will take the lead in prevention of global warming,'' he said. ''From this summer, government is planning to start no necktie, no jacket.'' 
 Japan is the birthplace of the Kyoto Protocol, which only adds to the popularity of the global warming pact here. In an Asahi newspaper telephone poll last November, 79 percent of respondents said they believed that global warming was their ''own problem.'' 
 Last month, Mr. Koizumi's entire cabinet approved casual business dress guidelines, a first for Japan. The policy calls on government officials ''during June through the end of September, to work with light clothes with moderation that would not deviate from social norm, except for unavoidable situations brought about by diplomatic protocol, etc.''
 Bureaucrats mortified by informality can wear pins blaming their casual look on the national drive to meet Kyoto targets: ''28 degrees/we are in the summer casual dress campaign to achieve minus 6 percent.''
 But salarymen are not expected to surrender their dark suits without a fight. On a recent afternoon in Otemachi, Tokyo's financial district, men on their lunch breaks predicted little loosening of one of the world's most conservative dress codes.
 ''The main obstacle is outside the company,'' said Seiichiro Yabui, a 36-year-old salesman. ''How you appear when you meet clients, especially old clients.''
 Noriyuki Ushiyama, 51, agreed. ''In Japan, the relationship toward the customers is a very delicate one,'' he said. ''For a dress code change to become real, you have to start right there.''
 Members of the Diet have worried that going tieless would erode ''the authority of the Diet.'' Others have worried about live TV broadcasts.
 Several younger men have shown near panic at the idea of having to improvise a wardrobe beyond a white shirt, dark tie and black suit.
 ''There is something very convenient about wearing suits,'' said Naoto Oshima, 33, a systems engineer. ''It is very easy to get dressed in the morning. I don't have to worry about what to wear to work at all.''
 Tomonari Kori, 25, stated flatly: ''I wouldn't know what to wear if we had to dress down.''
 Shinro Hayashi, editor of Men's Club, Japan's oldest men's fashion magazine, traced the salaryman's comfort in the anonymity of a dark suit to a group ethic that dates back to feudal days.
 ''Japanese wear suits so much because of their sense of belonging to a house, sense of belonging to a clan,'' he said. ''By wearing uniformed suits, you can hide in the uniform and not reveal your individuality.''
 Beyond that, the suit means business. ''The suit represents, in a world language, that the guy you are talking to understands the sense of contract, the rules of business,'' said Mr. Hayashi, who was wearing blue jeans and a white cotton shirt with French cuffs. ''Twenty years ago representatives of the Chinese Communist Party never wore suits. Look at them now.''
 To wean more Japanese men from their suits, the government has asked a famous cartoonist, Kenshi Hirokane, to start dressing his main character, a salaryman, in Cool Biz.
 But bracing for diehard sartorial resistance, the government also is preparing to play fashion hardball.
 Mr. Okuda of Toyota not only leads Japan's largest company, he is also chairman of the nation's most powerful business group, Keidanren, or the Japan Business Federation. That first Sunday in June, when he walks, or marches, down the catwalk, trailed by 12 lesser executives, it will be national news.
 ''Mr. Okuda is the top businessman in Japan,'' Mr. Hayashi said. ''If he is really serious about the no-tie movement, the father of the house must demonstrate it himself.''
 But what happens if the following Monday morning, the business-suited legions march on to Tokyo's trains as if nothing had happened? The next step could be random, unannounced office raids by fashion police.

WOLF, AMBASSADOR MILTON A. PHD.

 BODY:
 WOLF--Ambassador Milton A. PhD. The Officers, Board of Directors and staff of The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) are deeply sorrowed by the passing of our esteemed former President (1993-1996), Ambassador Milton A. Wolf. His distinguished term as U.S. Ambassador to Austria and his continuing involvement in economic policy making and diplomatic affairs, gave Ambassador Wolf the special skills needed to lead JDC during a period of intensive activity and growth. With Ambassador Wolf at the helm, JDC was able to capitilize on a host of new opportunities to serve critical Jewish needs in a post Cold War world. Joined by his beloved life partner, the late Roslyn Zehman Wolf, Ambassador Wolf traveled the world on behalf of JDC and the Jewish people, leading our first mission to Cuba, inagurating the first Jewish community welfare center established in the former Soviet Union-the prototype for a Hesed network that now numbers over 170, and presiding over rescue operations from Sarajevo, Syria, and Yemen. Above all, Ambassordor Wolf was determined to help the Jews of the former Soviet Union reclaim their heritage and ''return to the worldwide Jewish people.'' ''Future generations will never forgive us'' he said, ''if we neglect to meet this challenge.'' A past President of the Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland, an officer and trustee of several distinguished universities and a civic leader, Ambassordor Wolf has been honored for his service to his country, his community, and the Jewish people. 
On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of people benefitting today from the programs he helped bring to fruition, we mourn his untimely loss. We extend our deepest sympathy to his children, including our devoted Board member, Caryn Wolf Wechsler. We will miss his wise counsel and unswerving support. May his memory be for a blessing. Judge Ellen M. Heller, President Eugene J. Ribakoff, Chairman of the Board Steven Schwager, Executive Vice President

HEADLINE: Shares Up for a Fourth Day As Oil Prices Keep Falling

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday for a fourth day, extending their biggest rally in six months, as oil prices dropped below $47 a barrel and technology shares advanced.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 5.52 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 1,191.08. The Nasdaq composite index rose 11.93 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,042.58. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 28.74 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,493.19. 
 The S.&P. 500 fell earlier in the day as gyrating oil prices and a smaller-than-expected increase in Philadelphia-area manufacturing threatened the rally. Crude added as much as 1.6 percent before falling 0.7 percent, to $46.92 a barrel. Oil prices have plunged 9 percent in the last six sessions as rising OPEC production increased petroleum stockpiles.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's general economic index dropped to 7.3 from 25.3. Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast a reading of 17.3. A number greater than zero signals a higher percentage of the factories surveyed reported an improvement in business than deterioration.
 A consumer price report on Wednesday suggested that the economy could sustain growth without igniting inflation. This week's economic data spurred optimism among some investors that the Fed may be close to ending its series of rate increases.
 ''The last month or two the worry has been oil, the second worry has been what's going to happen to interest rates and the third worry has been inflation,'' said Neil Donahoe, chief investment officer of SYM Financial Advisors, which manages $500 million in Warsaw, Ind. ''In the last couple of days, all of those are crumbling.''
 About seven stocks rose for every four that fell on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. Some 1.38 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 15 percent less than the three-month average.
 Motorola, the maker of mobile phones, gained 41 cents, to $17.31. The company said it might buy back as much as $4 billion worth or about 10 percent of its shares over three years. The repurchase would be Motorola's first.
 A measure of technology shares was the second-biggest contributor to the gain in the S.&P. 500 among 10 industry groups, increasing 0.7 percent. Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, advanced 22 cents, to $25.92. The company will release a new version of its Office word processing, spreadsheet and e-mail software in the second half of 2006. Apple Computer, the maker of Macintosh computers, jumped $1.71, to $37.55.
 In contrast with the stock market, prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 6/32, to 100 4/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.11 percent, from 4.09 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Index Falls; So Do Jobless Claims

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The economy offered conflicting signs of growth yesterday. While a closely watched gauge of future business activity fell for the fourth consecutive month in April, job hunters got an encouraging indication when the number of new people signing up for unemployment insurance dropped sharply last week.
 The Conference Board said its composite index of leading economic indicators fell 0.2 percent last month, to 114.5. The decline was in line with what analysts had expected for the indicator, which is meant to forecast the economy's health over the coming three to six months. 
 The April drop came after a revised 0.6 percent decline in March and a 0.1 loss in February.
 Also, the Labor Department reported that the number of new people signing up for jobless benefits dropped sharply last week. New applications filed for unemployment insurance declined by a seasonally adjusted 20,000, to 321,000, for the week ending Saturday. The decline was larger than expected and was the biggest in a month.
 ''The leading economic indicators show continued economic growth, but a definite loss of forward momentum,'' said Ken Goldstein, economist at the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research group.
 Economists were not worried about the fourth consecutive decline in the index because the components that offered positive signs, like manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials and average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, are the most critical barometers.
 Special factors like an early Easter, which hurt consumer spending, and turmoil in Iraq also hurt the index.
 Given higher interest rates, ''We are going to see slower growth in the second half, but if it weren't for those special factors I would have been more concerned,'' said Mark Vitner, senior economist at the Wachovia Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
 Mr. Vitner said there was a chance that the Federal Reserve would ''take pause'' and not push the federal funds rate as high as 4 percent because the economy was slowing.
 But most economists like Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, expect more rate increases throughout this year.
 Of the 10 components of the leading index, the 5 that strengthened in April also included building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours and manufacturers' new orders for nonmilitary capital goods.
 The components that fell were the index of consumer expectations, real money supply, interest rate spread, stock prices and vendor performances.

HEADLINE: After Scandals, New Legal Stars Rise on Wall St.

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Looked across the room at Babbo recently and figured that the man and woman splitting an expensive bottle of wine worked on Wall Street? Good assumption. Did you further guess that they were investment bankers? You may need to expand your portfolio of stereotypes. 
 They just may have been the new face of Wall Street, the newly empowered -- and often newly rich -- compliance lawyer. They are often the only people standing between their investment firms and a lethal blow from the government, and their status is assured and growing. 
 Just as corporate raiders represented the Wall Street of the 1980's (think of Gordon Gekko) and mutual fund managers were the icons of the 90's (Jeffrey N. Vinik, who ran the Fidelity Magellan fund, was a minor celebrity), the lawyers who keep companies in compliance with increasingly tough regulatory laws have become a new prototype of the financial district. 
 They may lack the flash and glamour of earlier models, but this is the compliance lawyer's moment in the sun.
 From 2001 to 2003, when the securities industry lost more than 8 percent of its work force, those toiling in the ranks of corporate oversight grew 30 percent, according to the Securities Industry Association, a New York-based trade organization that analyzed federal labor data.
 It is too early to tell whether hiring these lawyers will stem the tide of corruption scandals on Wall Street that have marred the industry and shaken investors' trust in recent years, or whether they will be largely window dressing. The lawyers are being hired in greater numbers and being paid better, but scandals continue to erupt, and it is not clear that their advice is uniformly heeded.
 ''It is impossible to say at this stage of the game whether this is a gesture or whether it is a genuine attempt to change their culture,'' said Paul Hodgson, a researcher at the Corporate Library, which advocates strong corporate governance. ''If they change their behavior, that is a good thing.''
 Nonetheless, new regulations and several years of aggressive tactics against Wall Street firms by the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, have created a hot commodity out of a legal specialty that five years ago was regarded as the bottom of the food chain. 
 ''These are the people who can blow you up if you have a compliance failure or a rogue trader,'' said Frank Fernandez, chief economist at the Securities Industry Association. 
 And Maureen S. Brundage, head of the securities section in the New York office of the law firm of White & Case, noted: ''The profile of the compliance lawyer has changed. It used to be generally a dead-end job with no future.'' 
 In 1999, White & Case had no corporate defense practice; in the years since 2000, that area of practice has grown to approximately 50 lawyers, including 13 partners, because of the increase in compliance work. Other professionals have benefited as well -- accounting and auditing jobs have increased sharply, according to the government data. 
 For experienced lawyers, especially those with a background in prosecuting companies, the trend has proved lucrative. 
 Many can now command salaries ranging from $300,000 a year, for a midlevel associate position, to seven figures, for heading compliance at a major firm, according to securities and compliance lawyers and those who recruit them. And staff lawyers doing routine work at the Securities and Exchange Commission are in greater demand at big firms, as are former prosecutors who once specialized in corporate fraud cases.
 While the head of compliance once reported to the deputy chief counsel at many companies, jobs have been created with high salaries and important titles, with direct reporting lines to the chief executive. 
 Goldman Sachs recently appointed its first global head of compliance, Alan Cohen, who once served as chief of the securities and commodities fraud task force for the United States attorney in Manhattan. 
 His hiring ''simply underscores the rapidly growing importance of compliance within the culture of an investment bank,'' said Peter Rose, a Goldman Sachs spokesman.
 Last year, Beth Golden, who was deputy for special projects in Mr. Spitzer's office, joined Bear, Stearns as global head of compliance, reporting directly to the board, after a career of prosecuting white-collar crimes. 
 Her hiring came after some bad moments for Bear, Stearns in recent years, including a conclusion by the S.E.C. earlier this year that the firm violated federal investor-protection laws by helping brokers conduct late trades in mutual fund shares.
 ''It is a great opportunity to be in an environment like this,'' Ms. Golden said. ''You have a chance to create or maintain a compliant culture from within, rather than having a culture imposed upon you.''
 Eric R. Dinallo, another of Mr. Spitzer's top aides, was hired by Morgan Stanley as head of regulatory matters in 2003.
 The number of lawyers practicing securities and regulatory law on Wall Street has been a matter of steady growth over the last two years, mirroring a similar trend among publicly traded companies after the corporate scandals that cost shareholders and creditors so much.
 In 2002, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which provided fines and prison sentences of up to 20 years for officers of public companies that violated tough new corporate governance and financial disclosure standards intended to protect shareholders. In turn, companies have hired the compliance experts to strengthen their legal teams.
 The culture of compliance has spread, as well, to nonpublic companies. The S.E.C. and other financial regulators are employing far more resources than they had even three years ago to monitor and investigate financial services companies and broker-dealers.
 Further, most hedge funds, the private investment pools that have not been required to register with the S.E.C., will have to do so next year. That requirement has led scores of those funds to hire their first compliance lawyers, often luring the lawyers away from the government or private firms with big paychecks. 
 ''We have a chief compliance officer at a hedge fund being offered $600,000 right now,'' said Judith Kross, president of Hank-Kross, a legal recruiting firm in Manhattan. 
 It is not exactly the style of compliance lawyers to snap their suspenders and eat fancy meals on the client's dime. ''These are not your typical high rollers,'' said Ms. Kross, ''because they are by nature more reserved and more risk-averse.'' The lawyers headed for hedge funds, she said, ''are buying a new BMW, but it's not like the investment bankers who take friends and family to Aspen.''
 Still, the rise of securities lawyers and their fattening salaries underscore the personal risk these jobs entail. With the Justice Department and the S.E.C. becoming more vigorous -- and punitive -- about the so-called gatekeepers at companies, an experienced compliance expert can be held personally accountable for fraud. 
 And their standing is not likely to wane. ''Before, you were reporting to the deputy general counsel,'' said Lawrence Byrne, a partner at White & Case. ''Now you can walk into the C.E.O.'s office and say, 'We have a problem in Tokyo.' There is just no substitute for direct access to a C.E.O.''

HEADLINE: Budget Office Sees Big City Deficits Ahead and No Plan Yet

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
The current surge in tax revenues will not continue long enough to help the city close multibillion-dollar deficits projected for the near future, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has offered no plan for how to deal with the looming crisis, according to a new report by the city's Independent Budget Office.
 The office, a nonpartisan agency that analyzes fiscal and economic policy, predicts that tax revenues will fall by about $200 million in the 2006 fiscal year that begins in July, as New York's real estate market cools and several temporary tax increases expire.
 The decline in revenue, combined with higher costs for Medicaid, pensions and debt service, is expected to create a deficit of $4.4 billion in the 2007 fiscal year, the budget office said in its report. 
 But unlike this year -- when unexpectedly high revenues from income and real estate taxes contributed to a $3.3 billion surplus that Mr. Bloomberg used to balance his proposed $49.7 billion budget for 2006 -- no such surplus will be available next year, the budget office said. And Mr. Bloomberg has not explained what he intends to do about it.
 ''Right now, the executive budget seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the very large budget gap in 2007,'' said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the budget office. ''Based on our economic forecast, we're not going to grow our way out of the large budget gap, the way we did this year.''
 The mayor has acknowledged that the deficits estimated for 2007 and beyond are large and that the wave of tax revenue that has buoyed the city budget in the last two years will subside. But in presenting his 2006 budget proposal earlier this month, he admitted he had no plan yet for how to fill the gap.
 Yesterday, Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said the administration was focused on negotiating a 2006 budget with the City Council. He said the city had not relied solely on increased tax revenue in recent years, but had also cut billions in spending and taken other steps to balance the budget.
 ''The mayor has reduced city spending by nearly $4 billion, there are hundreds of millions of dollars in pay-as-you-go capital in the '06 budget and we are fighting for pension and Medicaid reform, which is the source of those out-year budget gaps,'' Mr. Barowitz said.
 In addition to a shortfall in 2007, the budget office is forecasting deficits of $4 billion in 2008 and $3.2 billion in 2009.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Arena Plan Calls For Many Subsidized Units

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRICK

 BODY:
Trying to build political support for his proposed $2.5 billion sports and housing complex at the Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn, Bruce C. Ratner, the developer, signed an agreement yesterday to reserve about half of the rental apartments for tenants who make less than $100,000 a year.
 The agreement, signed with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, publicly aligns Mr. Ratner with a group known for tenacious advocacy of the poor, and it publicly commits him to an unusually large allotment of subsidized housing for a private development project. It also serves to marginalize his remaining political opponents, residents of the area who say they will be displaced by his project. 
 At a news conference announcing the agreement at Brooklyn Borough Hall yesterday morning, a row of elected officials including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the borough president, Marty Markowitz, joined Mr. Ratner and Bertha Lewis, the executive director of Acorn, to praise one another in a celebration that included kisses, hugs and some dancing.
 ''Don't think of these as subsidies; this is an investment,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''I think it's the greatest example yet of Brooklyn's cultural and economic renaissance.''
 The agreement concerns 4,500 rental apartments, half of them studios and one-bedrooms and half of them two- and three-bedrooms, in the 13 residential buildings of the 17 proposed for the project. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, 30 percent of the apartments, 1,350 units, would be reserved for families with incomes from $37,680 to $100,480 for a four-person household paying 30 percent of its income in rent. An additional 20 percent of the apartments, 900 units, would be reserved for families making less than $31,400 a year. Of that group, 136 units would be reserved for families making less than $25,120 a year. The other half of the units could be rented at market rate.
 Tenants in the reserved units would have their rent payments subsidized by the New York City Housing Development Corporation, a state public-benefit corporation that has the authority to issue tax-exempt bonds. 
 The corporation plans to use a combination of bonds and reserves from investments to finance the subsidies, said Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The funds will not be committed until the developer closes on the project, Ms. Abrams said.
 Mr. Ratner's company, Forest City Ratner, is the development partner of The New York Times for its new headquarters on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan. The 21-acre project Mr. Ratner has proposed for Brooklyn, to which he intends to bring the Nets basketball team, faces condemnation proceedings and several reviews, including a lengthy environmental one. The city and state have each pledged $100 million to the project, contingent on the approvals.
 Mr. Ratner still needs to buy the land, which sits atop railyards at the intersection of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
 At the news conference yesterday, Mr. Ratner said each building in the project would have the so-called 50-30-20 mix. He said that he hoped to complete the first housing units by 2008.
 Letitia James, a city councilwoman who represents Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, tempered her praise for the agreement with Acorn with concerns that the project was too large to be placed ''in the middle of a low-rise, brownstone community.''
 Brad Lander, director of the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development, said the agreement was a shrewd political move for Mr. Ratner and a substantive accomplishment for Acorn.
 ''They're looking to build a broader base of support, in many ways, from a wider geographic area of Brooklyn, in part to counter opposition from other folks,'' Mr. Lander said. ''It's a fairly transparent strategy, but it's also something real. Acorn gets a significant amount of subsidized housing.''

HEADLINE: Hospital Administrator Fired After a Complaint by Spitzer

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, May 19 

 BODY:
A top administrator at Westchester Medical Center was fired this week after a civil complaint filed by Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer accused him of involvement in a fraudulent billing scheme at Staten Island University Hospital, the medical center announced on Thursday.
 Joseph Pisani, who was the executive vice president at the Staten Island hospital until 2000, was named in Mr. Spitzer's complaint as one of several hospital officials who fraudulently billed the state's Medicaid program. Mr. Spitzer said the officials perpetuated the billing practices in spite of repeated warnings from hospital lawyers that they were illegal. 
 To resolve the allegations, the hospital has agreed to pay the state $76.5 million.
 Mr. Pisani was fired on Wednesday, the day after Mr. Spitzer filed his complaint.
 On Thursday, Richard Berman, chairman of the Westchester County Health Care Corporation, which oversees the medical center, issued a brief statement announcing the firing and saying that there was no indication that Mr. Pisani had behaved improperly while associated with the medical center.
 ''We have no knowledge of any issues of concern during Mr. Pisani's tenure at Westchester Medical Center,'' the statement said. The firing was first reported on Thursday in The Journal News of Westchester.
 Mr. Pisani was hired by Westchester Medical Center in 2003 as senior vice president for financial planning and forecasting. He was promoted in January 2004 to senior executive vice president and chief administrative officer and given a 75 percent raise, to $480,000, from $275,000. 
 Employees and union representatives criticized the raise as inappropriate in the midst of a financial crisis at the medical center, but administrators said it was in line with the salaries of other top-level administrators in the region.
 ''To get out of this thing, you need good troops, and Joe is really C.E.O. material,'' Gene A. Capello, the former chairman of the Westchester County Health Care Corporation, said at the time. ''He has that kind of gravitas and can think outside the box and can think of creative solutions.''
 In the Staten Island scheme, according to Mr. Spitzer's complaint, the hospital billed Medicaid at premium rates reserved for part-time clinics, though the services were performed at clinics that were not truly part time. In addition, the complaint says, the hospital lied on financial reports filed with the state. Neither Mr. Pisani nor any other current or former administrator at the Staten Island hospital was named as a defendant in the complaint.
 Kara Bennorth, a medical center spokeswoman, said the hospital ''had no knowledge of any details of Mr. Pisani's involvement'' in the Staten Island scheme until Wednesday. A message left for Mr. Pisani on his home answering machine was not returned.

HEADLINE: A Divided Iraq

 BODY:
The Bush administration has finally awakened to the grave dangers Iraq's new government is courting by failing to reach out convincingly to credible representatives of the disaffected Sunni Arab minority. Washington's concern helped prompt Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's urgent mission to Baghdad earlier this week. Unless her pleas for greater inclusiveness are heeded, the new government will not be able to establish the nationwide legitimacy it needs to draw significant numbers of Sunnis away from the continuing insurgency. 
 The implications of that are clear. As senior American military commanders now acknowledge, Iraqi forces aren't militarily strong enough to prevail over the insurgency and will not be for a long time. If Baghdad continues to shun a serious political strategy to draw Sunni support away from the insurgents, large numbers of American troops will be stuck fighting a prolonged and bloody counterinsurgency war in much of northern and western Iraq. 
 Such a sorry comedown from the high hopes of January's election would be tragic for Iraq. It would also be very bad for the United States. The one country it would serve quite nicely is Iran. Tehran is not eager to see a successful, broadly based Shiite democracy, which might lead Iran's discontented millions to wonder why they put up with a corrupt, repressive and economically benighted Islamic dictatorship. Tehran is also understandably distrustful of Iraq's Sunni nationalists, having fought a long and costly war against Saddam Hussein's regime in the 1980's. And as the Iranian authorities test the world's patience with their nuclear programs, they can only be relieved to see the bulk of American ground forces tied down indefinitely in counterinsurgency operations in Iraq.
 Iran is already reinforcing its ties to Iraq's new Shiite leadership. Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, flew into Baghdad two days after Ms. Rice departed, and left yesterday brandishing a joint communique that blamed Saddam Hussein for that 1980's war. Moreover, the Iraqi party that has been most resistant to a more inclusive approach toward the Sunnis is the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, or Sciri, the Iraqi Shiite party with the closest ties to the Iranian ayatollahs. 
 Sciri is just one of several parties in the current government coalition. But none of the others, including the Dawa Shiite religious party and the two secular Kurdish parties, have done much to resist Sciri's exclusionary views and vetoes of prospective Sunni nominees. As a result, qualified and representative Sunnis have been kept out of key positions in the new security forces, the cabinet and now the constitution-drafting process. Shockingly, only two Sunni Arabs were chosen to sit on the 55-member parliamentary panel named to draft Iraq's new constitution. 
 It is understandable that Iraq's Shiites and Kurds, who suffered so much under Saddam Hussein, are uncomfortable about letting people who served his predominantly Sunni regime back into positions of power. But unless lower- and middle-echelon Baathists are allowed to serve, much of the Sunni professional class will remain excluded from government and sympathetic to the insurgents. 
 Millions of Shiites and Kurds risked their lives to vote in January because they wanted to help build a better, more democratic Iraq. The intervening months have been hugely disillusioning, with polls now showing a stunning 40-percentage-point drop in public confidence since January, as politicians have squabbled, insurgent attacks have soared and public services have further deteriorated. The dream of a new Iraq will ebb away unless leaders of the ruling Shiite and Kurdish coalition reach out boldly and bravely to their Sunni neighbors.

HEADLINE: An Architect Of Bush Plan On Retirement Urges Retreat

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM and EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
Robert C. Pozen, the business executive who developed the theory behind President Bush's plan to trim Social Security benefits in the future, urged the president on Thursday to drop his insistence on using part of workers' taxes to pay for individual investment accounts.
 This was one of two blows during the day to Mr. Bush's policies on Social Security and retirement saving. In the House, Representative Bill Thomas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, disregarded the methods favored by the president to encourage workers to save for retirement -- mostly tax incentives for the affluent -- and offered completely different proposals of his own. 
 The president's Social Security and retirement measures have faced trouble in Congress all year, and the developments on Thursday raised further doubt about their prospects.
 On the question of Mr. Pozen's new position, Trent Duffy, a White House spokesman, said, ''The president is committed to a voluntary personal account as part of a comprehensive Social Security modernization plan.''
 On Mr. Thomas's stance on retirement saving, Mr. Duffy said Mr. Bush ''understands and welcomes the chairman's ideas.''
 Mr. Pozen, a member of Mr. Bush's advisory commission on Social Security in 2001, said at a forum at the Treasury Department that the president's approach to investment accounts would destroy the chances for a Social Security bill in Congress and would make it more difficult to resolve the long-term financial problems facing the system.
 He developed the technique known as progressive indexing, which Mr. Bush embraced last month as a way to reduce the long-term cost of Social Security and get closer to the goal of permanent solvency for the system. 
 Under the technique, the promised retirement benefits of workers earning less than about $20,000 a year would be fully protected, but other workers' promised benefits would be cut on a sliding scale as income increased. In all cases, benefits would at least keep pace with inflation. 
 Unlike Democratic lawmakers who oppose as a matter of principle including investment accounts as part of Social Security, Mr. Pozen, himself a Democrat, says that some form of accounts could be useful. But, explaining his position in an interview after the forum at the Treasury, he said the president's plan to let workers divert up almost a third of their payroll taxes to accounts would reduce tax revenues and lower guaranteed retirement benefits too much.
 ''The accounts are just too large,'' Mr. Pozen said. He suggested that Mr. Bush consider a surcharge on payroll taxes for people who earn more than $90,000 a year, currently the ceiling on which Social Security taxes are paid, and the possibility of using some of that added revenue for private investment accounts.
 ''I believe some new revenue in the system is probably necessary for a legislative solution,'' Mr. Pozen said at the forum, called to generate enthusiasm for the administration's approach to Social Security.
 At the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Thomas, Republican of California, turned attention away from Social Security for the day and toward retirement savings. He offered several ideas that seemed to have bipartisan support, but Democrats were wary, suspecting that he was throwing up a smokescreen so he could later put private investment accounts into the legislation.
 ''We cannot be party to anything'' that might lead to private accounts under Social Security, said Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts.
 But Mr. Thomas, who has never maintained that personal accounts were an integral part of Social Security legislation, said he had no ulterior motive. ''The chair has no interest in playing gotcha,'' he said. 
 He argued that it made no sense to consider changes in Social Security without addressing the array of policies affecting retirement. 
 In a hearing on what the government could do to encourage people to save for retirement, neither he nor the other Republicans on the committee dealt with the president's proposals to let upper-income taxpayers put more money in retirement accounts, like 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts, in which the earnings would not be taxed.
 Mr. Thomas offered two general ideas that seemed to have bipartisan support. One would require employers that offered their workers 401(k) plans to enroll the workers automatically unless the workers specifically opted out. The other would encourage new forms of annuities that would be attractive investments for low-income workers.

HEADLINE: A Love Affair With S.U.V.'s Begins to Cool

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Jeremy Peters, in Toledo, Ohio, and Wendy Grossman, in Houston, contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 20 

 BODY:
To believe the commercials, sport utility vehicles can climb the most indomitable mountain, ford any stream and haul around the kids to boot. 
 But gas prices are a more unconquerable force of nature. With higher prices at the pump sinking in as something more than a blip on the radar, and with several new passenger car models winning back customers, America's love affair with S.U.V.'s is taking a breather.
 For the first time in 14 years, the passenger car is actually taking sales back at the expense of S.U.V.'s and other trucks, according to an analysis of auto sales data. The renewed interest in cars over the first four months of the year, while modest, is a pause in what has been the trend in auto sales for the last decade and a half: the soaring growth of the sport utility vehicle as America's preferred family vehicle. 
 Sales of medium and large sport utility vehicles -- like the Ford Explorer and Chevrolet Suburban -- have stalled, and the torrid sales growth of large pickups has cooled. 
 While much of the slack is being taken up by smaller and less bulky S.U.V.'s known as crossovers, overall sales of S.U.V.'s are down 1.7 percent while passenger car sales are up 3.1 percent, according to Wards Automotive, which tracks auto sales. 
 ''I just bought a Ford pickup truck and I wish I wouldn't have bought the darn thing,'' said Mark House, 45, who was shopping Friday at a Toyota dealership in the Toledo, Ohio, area with his daughter, Monika, 19, who said she wanted a car so she could keep the cost of fill-ups down. 
 ''If gas prices were cheaper, then I'd look into an S.U.V.,'' she said. ''It's the gas.'' 
 Mr. House, who owns and manages rental properties, said of his truck, ''It's $60 to fill it up, and I don't even want to drive it anymore.''
 But John Wodarski, a manager at the dealership who has sold cars for 23 years, said talk about gas prices did not always translate into action.
 ''People rank it up there as one of their biggest concerns, just like losing weight,'' he said, ''but no one ever does anything about it.''
 Weakness in big trucks is bad news for General Motors and Ford Motor, because they largely rely on big S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks for profits. Asian automakers like Toyota have had a stronger position in sales of cars and crossover vehicles. 
 G.M. executives say large S.U.V. sales, which are down 15 percent this year industrywide, are weak not because of gas prices but because G.M.'s models are nearing the end of a product cycle. G.M. will introduce redesigned versions of large S.U.V.'s like the Chevy Suburban and Cadillac Escalade next year. Ford executives, by contrast, have cited gas prices as a major factor in their diminished earnings projections. Phil Martens, Ford's vice president for product creation, said recently that ''fuel economy has gone from not being in the top 10,'' among buyer concerns, ''to being in the top 5.'' 
 Some analysts see a parade of newer car models as the predominant factor. 
 ''Gas prices are having a much more minor effect than they did in the 80's,'' said Tom Libby, the senior director of industry analysis at the Power information network, a unit of the research and consulting firm J.D. Power & Associates. In fact, gas prices, adjusted for inflation, are not nearly as high as they were in the early 1980's. Mr. Libby said a wave of new midsize luxury cars from brands like Acura, Lexus, BMW and Infiniti were increasing car sales.
 Hot sales of hybrid electric cars, like the Toyota Prius, have also helped, though Toyota's Lexus division and Ford are now also offering hybrid S.U.V.'s. Detroit's recent emphasis on making more credible passenger cars has been a major factor. Two notable cars with strong sales have been Ford's redesigned, Mustang and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler 300 sedan.
 ''I never wanted a car before -- never,'' said Tamika Cooks, a science teacher at Bellaire High School in Houston, in an interview Friday as she was signing the paperwork for her Chrysler 300C. ''But this car has captured my attention. It speaks to me. It calls my name.''
 Burly and sleek, the 300C has won diverse appeal and convinced many that Detroit can make compelling cars if it is motivated; the rapper Snoop Dogg drives a black 300C. Ms. Cooks preferred satin jade. 
 ''It's soft, it's feminine, it's classy,'' she said. ''When you see it passing by, you have to stop and look.''
 For Ms. Cooks, gas prices, which are $2.09 a gallon for regular at a Shell station nearby, were not part of her decision, and she said she came close to buying a Lexus S.U.V. The 300C, equipped with a gas guzzling Hemi engine, is hardly akin to a Toyota Prius. 
 ''Gas prices worry me with any vehicle,'' she said. ''One day they're up, the next day they're slightly down.''
 Cars now account for 46.3 percent of the nation's vehicle market, up from 45.4 percent in the first four months of 2004, according to Ward's. Before this year, cars had been in decline every year since 1991, when they accounted for 67.4 percent of the market. In 1980, cars made up about four-fifths of sales. The growth of light trucks, a regulatory category that includes minivans, S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks, has had broad effects on the nation's oil consumption. The fuel economy of the average new vehicle sold fell to 20.7 miles a gallon in 2003 models from 22.1 miles a gallon in 1988 models. Regulations permit light trucks to consume significantly more gas than cars; the most recent Congressional effort to tighten the regulatory system was defeated in the Senate this week. 
 Will the growth of cars be sustained? Not likely. Domestic automakers have laid out production plans focusing on more small S.U.V.'s, and Asian automakers are increasing their focus on the pickup truck market, with Toyota building a new pickup truck plant in San Antonio. 
 ''By the end of the decade, sales will be anywhere from two-thirds to three-fourths light trucks,'' said Haig Stoddard, the manager of industry analysis at Ward's. 
 Gas could be an X-factor. When prices went up in March, Yves Nau, a nightclub owner in Houston, traded in his GMC Yukon Denali for a Chrysler 300C sedan. 
 Between savings at the gas pump, lower car payments and insurance bills, he said he was saving $700 a month.
 ''I feel like I'm the smart guy,'' he said. ''You save money like that and you can't ignore it.''

HEADLINE: Up Against the Plastic Wall

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
EVER since Heather Hartman and her husband, Zach Hall, had to visit 20 car dealerships just to find one that would grant them a loan, she has been careful not to overspend and diligent about paying her bills on time. 
 But last fall, American Express rejected her credit card application, catching Ms. Hartman off guard. The reason was even more surprising: a little-known quirk in the reporting system had been holding her credit score down. 
 ''I found out later that Capital One was not reporting my credit limit, '' said Ms. Hartman, 24, a paralegal student at California State University, Turlock, who says her credit limit is $200. 
 Ratings for an estimated 9.2 million Americans, or about 4.3 percent of the 210 million who have a credit score, were lowered by more than 10 points when information on their credit limit was omitted, according to a national study of more than 250,000 people with credit scores that was published by three Federal Reserve economists last year. 
 Customers who use store-owned credit cards like those offered by Kay Jewelers and Target have also complained that their credit scores were impaired when their credit limit was not reported. Many consumers whose credit cards come from Citigroup, Discover Financial, American Express and HSBC's Household division have been affected, too, according to an independent analysis of more than 500 randomly selected credit reports produced from 2002 to late 2004 that was obtained by The New York Times. 
 There is no clear legal requirement to report the data; Capital One and Kay have said that the information is proprietary and providing it may encourage competitors to pick off their most profitable customers. Others, like Citigroup and American Express, say that the rules do not apply to some of their charge cards, which have no preset credit limits. Discover and HSBC maintain that they fully report all the time. A spokeswoman for Target did not respond to telephone calls. But the omissions can substantially lower a person's credit score -- the independent analysis showed the loss of as much as 50 points in some instances -- adding thousands of dollars to the cost of obtaining a mortgage or other types of financing. And for some consumers, especially those with a troubled credit record and younger ones without much credit history, it may prevent borrowing money at all. 
 ''It appears there are some real problems with credit scoring, and the thing that gets me is it appears to be a systematic problem, but nobody really cares,'' said Christopher Green, a lawyer in Seattle who has represented clients whose credit scores were impaired by the omission of credit limits. 
 To be sure, the problem has dwindled in recent years, and the overwhelming majority of credit card issuers do report consumer's credit limits. But for those who are affected, the blame game between credit card issuers and the credit report bureaus and scorers over full disclosure can be frustrating. 
 ''The creditors pass the buck on the credit bureau, and the credit bureaus pass the issue on to the creditors, and the consumer is just sitting in the middle waiting for it to be resolved,'' said Nathan Hower, a 36-year-old probation officer who lives near Gainesville, Fla. 
 Mr. Hower says his credit score dropped after Kay withheld the limit on a store-branded credit card loan he took out last fall to buy an engagement ring. ''It's like you are stuck in the middle of a blender, and it keeps going around and around, and you can't tell who is telling the truth,'' Mr. Hower said.
 The three major credit reporting bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- have said they would prefer that every lender report credit limit data. So would Fair Isaac & Company, whose formulas help compute the score, called the FICO score. Nonetheless, it is difficult for them to twist the arms of the issuing banks: in many cases, the companies that withhold that information are also their largest customers. Even though there is a ''very compelling story statistically and it makes a lot of sense,'' said Laura DeSoto, Experian's vice president for marketing, ''we know every company has the right to set their own policies.''
 Regulators said they addressed the problem in January 2000, when the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency sent a memorandum alerting all financial institutions to the ''still unresolved legal and reputation risks of not reporting.'' Credit limits were missing for about 14 percent of consumers with revolving accounts in 2003, down from 70 percent in 1999, according to the Federal Reserve study.
 ''We don't think it is a problem,'' said Daniel Pearson, the national bank examiner for the comptroller's office, which oversees 7 of the 10 largest banks that issue credit cards. But consumer groups and privacy rights advocates say it still is. Omissions in the reporting process can vastly overstate so-called utilization rates, or the percentage of credit that a person uses compared with the amount she has available, which help determine an individual's credit score. 
 When a creditor fails to report an individual's credit limit -- the maximum amount of credit extended -- the three major credit bureaus frequently substitute that consumer's highest balance level, meaning the largest amount ever owed on the account. That can make it appear that a consumer has used the credit account to its limit, even when only a small portion of the maximum amount has been borrowed. 
 The Federal Reserve study found that the substitution often results in a higher estimated credit utilization rate, which in turn, raises the perceived level of risk in the consumer. In other words, it lowers the credit score that is closely aligned with interest rates offered on loans.
 For about 4.3 percent of consumers, the study said, the substitution led to a decrease of 10 points or more in a credit score -- a drop that can significantly alter an individual's credit rating. With the average FICO score now about 705 on an 800-point scale, that small drop can raise a mortgage interest rate to 6.4 percent, from 5.8 percent, which translates into an additional $19,000 on a $150,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to a recent analysis by CreditXpert Inc., a company in Towson, Md., that provides analysis software to financial institutions and consumers.
 The problem grows worse, consumers say, when the solution involves taking out a large loan to correct the discrepancy. Ms. Hartman, for example, said that after her score reflected a substitution of a $49 high balance for a $200 credit limit, she borrowed $182 to raise her high balance. (In the absence of a report, that new high balance was then assumed to be her credit limit). Then, she paid back the money she had just borrowed, leaving her with a lower ratio of debt to credit. The resulting lower utilization rate helped to raise her credit score. 
 ''I think they are doing it on purpose,'' she said. ''They know what an accurate listing is and are aware of how they are reporting. They know people are charging up to the max to get it to report. People are going over the limit, incurring late fees, higher interest fees, and the penalty is another buck in Capital One's pocket.''
 Of course, for consumers who have credit scores in the mid or low 600's, the omission of credit limit data can have a big impact. Ms. Hartman, whose past financial troubles caused her score to dip into that range, intends to keep it higher in the future.
 ''I would like to buy a home and start a family in the next five years, and I don't want to get a higher interest rate,'' she said. ''And since more and more employers are doing credit checks these days, it will be more important in the future.''

HEADLINE: Silver Demands 'Marshall Plan' For Downtown

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Sheldon Silver, speaker of the State Assembly, called yesterday for a ''Marshall Plan'' to revitalize Lower Manhattan, demanding that the city and the state make it their top priority to restore its role as a thriving commercial and financial capital.
 In an impassioned speech at a breakfast meeting on Wall Street, Mr. Silver, whose district includes downtown, said governments at all levels had to take dramatic steps to redevelop Lower Manhattan. The Pataki administration and the Port Authority should pledge to lease an entire new building on the World Trade Center site, he said. State and city government, he said, should use billions of dollars in Liberty Bonds, tax breaks and rent incentives to lure businesses to ground zero and Lower Manhattan. 
 And they should do so, he said, at the expense of all other redevelopment projects, including Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's highest priority, the West Side, site of a proposed stadium for the Jets that would serve as a centerpiece of the city's bid for the 2012 Olympics.
 ''We need a comprehensive plan -- a vision -- for Lower Manhattan; not merely an economic strategy, but more of a Marshall Plan,'' Mr. Silver said. ''Above all else, I want downtown to regain its stature as a world class business center.''
 In a stinging rebuke of the city's plans to build the stadium and to develop a new office district on the West Side, Mr. Silver said that ''no other building project can take a higher priority'' and ''no public incentives for commercial development should be provided'' for the Hudson Yards, where the city is planning the stadium. 
 He said the city was a long shot to win the Olympics, but if it did, he would help assure that a stadium would be built somewhere in the city, possibly in Queens.
 Mr. Silver, whose approval would be required for the stadium project, plays a major role in Manhattan's redevelopment plans, and state and city officials have recently gone out of their way to court him with attention to downtown issues. His speech yesterday at a meeting of the Association for a Better New York came amid an escalating tug of war: the speaker and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, have misgivings about the stadium; state and city officials are pressing for its approval.
 Although the site of the proposed stadium and ground zero are roughly three miles apart, they have become deeply enmeshed. City officials have been talking about a downtown commercial incentive package in recent weeks, even as Mr. Silver has complained that state and city officials are overly focused on the West Side. 
 Some city and state officials viewed the speech yesterday as Mr. Silver's list of demands in return for stadium support, although Mr. Silver repeatedly insisted that the two projects were separate and that each must stand on its own.
 Earlier this week, Mr. Bruno asked a state panel to postpone consideration of the stadium project, citing a number of unanswered questions concerning legal and financial issues. Gov. George E. Pataki postponed the meeting until Wednesday, but he and the Bloomberg administration have worked to pressure the legislative leaders into supporting the stadium, saying that they could personally kill the city's chances of being the host for the Olympics.
 Mayor Bloomberg has said that the city would have no chance of winning the 2012 Olympic Games if the stadium was not approved before July 6, when the International Olympic Committee meets in Singapore to select a host. And in a May 5 letter to the state legislative leaders, reported yesterday in The Daily News, Peter V. Ueberroth, chairman of the United States Olympic Committee, said that failure to approve the stadium ''would grievously damage New York's Olympics bid.''
 Lynn Rasic, a spokeswoman for Governor Pataki, said that the administration was considering many of the items Mr. Silver raised yesterday, including eliminating the commercial rent tax downtown and expanding an existing incentive program to lure companies to the area. She said the governor had already committed to moving his Manhattan office to the trade center site. But, she said, the governor disagreed with Mr. Silver's views of the city's Olympic bid.
 ''Rebuilding Lower Manhattan is his top priority,'' Ms. Rasic said, ''but there's no need to pit one project against another. He believes that we have a great shot at achieving our Olympic dreams.'' Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bloomberg, said simply that the mayor ''looks forward to working with'' Mr. Silver on rebuilding Lower Manhattan.
 The politics surrounding Mr. Silver's speech at the breakfast meeting yesterday was apparent in the guests who attended: Jay L. Kriegel, executive director of the city's Olympic bid committee; labor leaders who are the stadium's most ardent supporters; and some of the project's most vehement opponents, including Patricia Lynch, a lobbyist for Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden and views the stadium as competition.
 Mr. Silver strode past Mr. Kriegel on his way out of the building, ignoring him.
 Later, Mr. Kriegel said that he was confident that New York would win its bid for the Olympics, which he said would generate $11 billion in economic activity for the city. 
 Mr. Silver's remarks seemed to leave little room for retreat and an eventual vote for the stadium, but asked later if he could ever find a way to endorse the stadium, he said, ''One of the great things about politics is that it's unpredictable.''

HEADLINE: Why Exactly Do We Want to Hold the Saudis' Hand?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

Secrets of the Kingdom
The Inside Story of the Saudi-U.S. Connection
By Gerald Posner
254 pages. Random House. $24.95.
 The uneasy nature of the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia was neatly captured on the front page of The New York Post in late April. A large photograph showed President Bush, at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., holding hands with Crown Prince Abdullah, Saudi Arabia's ruler. The headline read, ''High Price of Oil.'' 
 Just whom the United States is holding hands with, and why, is the subject of ''Secrets of the Kingdom,'' Gerald Posner's angry follow-up to ''Why America Slept: The Failure to Prevent 9/11.'' As Mr. Posner argues, concisely and forcefully, the thirst for Saudi oil and the greed of American companies eager to do business with Saudi Arabia have driven the United States into an unseemly alliance with a corrupt ruling family whose chief export, besides oil, is the fanatical brand of Islam that led to the 9/11 attacks.
 If this sounds familiar, it should. The same argument has been made, many times, by editorial writers, talking heads and think-tank pundits around the clock for several years. Despite his ''stop the presses'' title, Mr. Posner adds little to the debate. With one exception, there are no ''secrets,'' and a book that relies almost entirely on newspaper, television and radio sources can hardly be considered the inside story. 
 That one exception, though, is a doozy. Mr. Posner, through an Israeli intelligence officer, got the details of a Saudi plan that the United States National Security Agency has called Petroleum Scorched Earth. Petro SE, for short, is a system of explosives that would destroy Saudi Arabia's main wells, refineries, pipelines and storage depots in case of enemy attack. At the touch of a button, the entire system for extracting, transporting and refining oil would go up in smoke. 
 There's more. Intelligence analysts in Israel and at the security agency, which has been tracking the development of Petro SE ever since it intercepted Saudi telephone conversations on the plan in 1986, believe that the Saudis have spiced their explosive charges with dozens of radiation dispersal devices, or dirty bombs, that would contaminate the oil fields for a decade or more. Any country trying to seize Saudi Arabia's prime asset, as the United States hinted it might do after the oil embargo of the 1970's, would end up with millions of acres of radioactive sand. 
 The consequences for the world economy would be severe. ''The destruction of the several-hundred-acre facility at Abqaiq would instantly eliminate almost seven million barrels of crude oil a day from the market,'' Mr. Posner writes. ''That is double the amount removed from the world's supply during the Iran-Iraq war, and almost a quarter of all U.S. crude consumption.'' 
 Without Saudi oil, the United States would probably run through its strategic reserves in about six months. ''Once the strategic stocks proved inadequate, a nuclear environment in Saudi Arabia would create crippling oil price increases, political instability and economic recessions unrivaled since the 1930's and the Great Depression,'' Mr. Posner writes. No wonder Mr. Bush is holding on tight to the crown prince.
 Mr. Posner adds a cautionary note. Neither American nor Israeli analysts know for certain whether Petro SE is really as sophisticated as their intelligence intercepts suggest, or whether the Saudis exaggerated, aware that foreign ears were listening. Mr. Posner does not address the point, but it would seem logical that the Saudis knew they were being recorded. At some point, they must have wanted the world to know about Petro SE. What use is a deterrent if no one knows you have it? 
 That's it for the secret, inside information. The rest of ''Secrets of the Kingdom'' is a stern indictment of the Saudi royal family, which Mr. Posner, rehashing published reports, takes to task for its profligate ways, its mismanagement of the government and what he describes as its long history of double-dealing: pledging friendship to the United States while providing aid and succor to Islamic fundamentalists sworn to destroy it.
 Mr. Posner is equally incensed at the United States government and the craven American business leaders who have turned a blind eye to Saudi malfeasance while pursuing their immediate interests.
 Mr. Posner does not make much headway trying to follow the money trail that leads from the Saudi government, and Saudi charities, to terrorist organizations. It's a murky business, he finds. But a fog of ambiguity seems to envelop the Saudis and their international dealings wherever he turns. And the American government does not help.
 Take Abu Zubaydah, a leader of Al Qaeda captured in Pakistan, who, thinking his interrogators were Saudis, gave them the names of several Saudi princes as his sponsors. Strangely enough, Mr. Zubaydah's contacts began dying under mysterious circumstances soon after being named, yet the 9/11 commission never followed up on Mr. Zubaydah's claims. 
 Something's fishy here. Mr. Posner is sure of it, just as he was in ''Why America Slept.'' But that's as far as he gets. He's also stumped by the private jets filled with high-level Saudis that got special clearance to leave the United States for Saudi Arabia immediately after 9/11. Among the passengers was one of the princes named by Mr. Zubaydah. Again, Mr. Posner is mystified and outraged. But he does not shed any additional light. There may be an inside story to be told. But it's not here.

HEADLINE: Taking Luck Seriously

BYLINE: By MATT MILLER. 
E-mail: mattmiller@nytimes.com; Matt Miller is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author of ''The 2 Percent Solution.'' Maureen Dowd is on book leave.

 BODY:
Test your political philosophy with one simple question: which matters most in determining where people end up in life? 
 You've got two choices. The first is ''luck'' -- by which I mean the pre-birth lottery, that inherited package of wealth, health, genes, looks, brains, talents and family. ''Luck'' is all those gifts or curses for which we can neither take credit nor be blamed. 
 Choice No.2 is individual effort, hard work and personal character.
 Obviously this is a false choice; every life is a blend of both. We're born with certain endowments, and make the most of them (or don't) based on personal traits. But if you had to say which one matters most in shaping where people end up, how many of you would join me in answering ''luck''? 
 In a poll I commissioned a few years ago, people who call themselves liberals or Democrats overwhelmingly said luck; most conservatives or Republicans said individual effort. 
 But if you're hoping to shake up today's gridlocked politics, what's interesting is that independent voters -- now the nation's biggest bloc -- viewed luck the way Democrats do. 
 Luck isn't a bad proxy for what the current Times series labels ''class.'' It's a theme U.S. politics conspicuously avoids. Yet if we approached it right -- if we took luck seriously -- we'd be on the way to the commonsense consensus needed to make progress on our fixable injustices. 
 What should luck's influence mean for public policy? Conservatives, worried that an honest admission of luck's role would sanction economy-killing egalitarianism, always end up playing down luck. Liberals, while deeply concerned with luck, have often been unwilling to ease the burden of bad luck in ways that preserve the best of capitalist innovation and the virtues of individual responsibility.
 Try too hard to wipe out the inequities spawned by luck, and you banish luck's societal benefits and go down the road of communism. But harness a healthy awe for luck, and you expand the bounds of empathy in ways that make a living wage for poor workers and great schools for poor children national imperatives. What we're led to is the public agenda missing today, built around passionate commitments -- by both liberals and conservatives -- to (1) equal opportunity and (2) a minimally decent life, achieved in ways that harness market forces for public purposes. 
 Don't take my word for it. The surprising truth is that conservative icon Milton Friedman and liberal philosopher John Rawls agree that luck's ubiquity compels these commitments. Friedman once told me his concern for luck's reach had inspired his call for a decent minimum for the unlucky. He fathered what became the earned-income tax credit, which delivers $35 billion a year in wage subsidies to the working poor. Rawls, apostle of the just society, cheered this.
 Friedman added that there is no principled way to decide what the decent minimum should be; it's a political question that depends on what taxes we're willing to pay. Rawls basically said ''make it good'' -- but not so generous that taxes hurt growth. 
 But this debate isn't being framed explicitly today by either side. 
 So the conservative view of the decent minimum comes to this: ''You're lucky to be in America; you're lucky to have a job; you're lucky to have the emergency room.'' A better idea would be ''basic health coverage and $9 to $10 an hour, without putting the full burden of this on employers.'' Turns out we can have such a society for a penny on the national dollar (1% of G.D.P.), and still leave government smaller (21% of G.D.P.) than it was under President Ronald Reagan. 
 Can't we shake hands and call it a deal? 
 The anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist won't debate what luck means for policy; he says luck is irrelevant (though he seems like a lucky guy). 
 By contrast, most Hollywood stars don't gripe about taxes the way many wealthy Americans do. My theory is that these supertalents are more sensitive to the portion of their wealth that's attributable to luck. Yes, there's hard work and persistence and making your own breaks, but the voice, the presence, the body (well, minus certain modern upgrades) clearly come from God. 
 As polling shows, average Americans agree luck is central. And religious conservatives say that responding to luck's dominion is a way to honor the divine mystery that put us here. With a little luck, that means Democrats may find they can make America more just while grounding their agenda in values that can win.

HEADLINE: Property Taxes In New Jersey: Tough Talk, Tougher Reality

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 19 

 BODY:
Property taxes. Property taxes. Property taxes!
 With a mounting urgency, the seven men competing for the Republican nomination for governor of New Jersey have focused nonstop on the state's high property taxes, the issue that polls have consistently shown is the voters' top concern. And with the June 7 primary now in the home stretch, each candidate is claiming to have the best remedy to lower taxes, led by Douglas R. Forrester, the front-runner in a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University that was released this week, who has promised a 30 percent reduction over three years, and Bret D. Schundler, his main rival, who has vowed to change the state's constitution to restrict spending. 
 Ah, but if only it were so simple.
 While many tax experts and political scientists say that some of the candidates' ideas can help trim property taxes, none of the candidates have embraced the kind of sweeping measures that these experts say are truly required to overhaul the system for good. And it is easy to understand why, because all of these measures, the experts concur, would be a tough political sell for the next governor.
 For instance, try advocating a steep increase in the income or sales taxes to compensate for the revenues lost by lowering property taxes.
 Or pushing to overturn a court order that forces the state to finance schools in low-income areas at the same level as those in high-income areas.
 Or taking on the powerful unions that grow prickly when attempts are made to water down the state's pension system.
 Or convincing the state's 566 municipalities and 611 school districts to trim their staffs and economize by joining together, administratively, in marriages based on money, not love.
 ''When some politician says, 'I'm giving rebates to hard-pressed taxpayers,' he or she is describing a political shortcut that just won't work,'' said Alan Marcus, a veteran Trenton lobbyist. ''Property tax reform can't be a political sound bite. It requires structural change. Those changes include changing the way you reward the political faithful in terms of pensions, benefits and patronage. It means changing the culture of corruption.''
 To understand why New Jersey's property taxes, the highest per person in the nation, have been so frustrating to generations of voters and elected officials, a few basics are in order.
 Compared with other states, New Jersey leans more on its local governments to deliver services like education. In fact, the state supplies only about 40 percent of the costs of running schools, which is about 10 percent lower than the national average, said Henry A. Coleman, a professor of public policy at Rutgers, who is vice chairman of the New Jersey Coalition for the Public Good, a bipartisan group interested in property tax reform.
 At the same time, local costs in New Jersey are generally higher, too, because of the vaunted tradition of home rule, in which every town, no matter how small, feels entitled to its own police force, fire department, planning board lawyer and more. And counting on the state to increase aid to local governments may be difficult, given the state's scramble to come up with $2 billion to balance next year's budget because of rising pensions and other costs.
 And yet, local governments in New Jersey are constrained, legally, from tapping into resources other than property taxes unlike municipalities in at least 33 states, which have the option to raise their own money through sales taxes and other means, said Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 But if it is any guide, other states have also wrestled with the nettlesome issue of high property taxes, with varying degrees of success.
 In Michigan, legislators pledged to reduce property taxes several years ago by asking voters to choose either higher income taxes or higher sales taxes to compensate for the drop in revenue from property taxes. The voters chose the sales tax. And since then, property taxes have dropped, but not without criticism from some that the sales tax has been too regressive and has affected low-income people disproportionately.
 In Colorado, voters in 1992 approved a Taxpayer Bill of Rights, known as Tabor, which links spending growth to inflation and population increases, and requires the state to refund to taxpayers excess revenues. It was something that was hailed by many conservative Republicans, including Gov. Bill Owens, and praised on Tuesday night by Assemblyman Paul DiGaetano, a Bergen County Republican, during a debate among the candidates for governor.
 But in January, Mr. Owens said in his State of the State address that because of limits imposed by Tabor, the state could not ''keep pace with the demands of the budget.'' And to rectify that, he has supported a measure that would allow the state to spend $3 billion more in tax money than Tabor would permit.
 So the conundrum, then, for New Jersey's next governor is to reduce property taxes, now totaling more than $17 billion, either by cutting government expenses, raising other taxes or cooking up new revenue recipes. And so far in the Republican primary, at least, tax increases have been an anathema, while spending cuts and limits have been the preferred route.
 Even Senator Jon S. Corzine, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has indicated that he is loath to raise other taxes to solve the riddle of property taxes.
 But William E. Schluter, a former Republican state senator who ran for governor as an independent in 2001, found fault in all of the Republican proposals. Mr. Schundler's plan is problematic, he said, because restrictive spending caps could strangle the state in the same way that Proposition 13 hurt California. And with Mr. Forrester's plan, ''there's no method to keep our taxes from skyrocketing again.''
 ''It's really a sham,'' Mr. Schluter said.
 One candidate who did propose something different a few weeks ago was Todd R. Caliguire, a former Bergen County freeholder, who took on the sacred cow of home rule and suggested that sheriff's departments be eliminated to save money. So Mr. Caliguire, who is far behind in the polls, put out a press release with this headline: ''New Jersey Is Not Sherwood Forest, No Need for Sheriffs.''
 And what kind of reaction did he get? ''Silence,'' he said. ''It's like it went into the ether.''

HEADLINE: For Army Recruiters, a Day of Rules, and Little Else

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; David Cloud contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

 BODY:
Responding to reports of widespread cheating to enlist unqualified applicants, the Army suspended recruiting nationwide yesterday to retrain its ranks in ethics, but officials said they would not lift the monthly quotas that some recruiters see as a catalyst for abuse. 
 Maj. Gen. Michael D. Rochelle, the commander of all Army recruiting, said yesterday that ''the mission is the mission.''
 General Rochelle said recruiters would still be expected to sign up two recruits a month, as they have been for years, even though the war in Iraq, declining unemployment and a lack of support from parents have combined to make recruiting more difficult than at any point since the end of the draft in 1973. 
 The one-day suspension, he said, was an effort to emphasize that ''taking shortcuts'' to reach the Army's goal of 101,200 active-duty and Reserve recruits this year is unacceptable. 
 General Rochelle said the Army was responding to several incidents that had recently come to light, including the case of a man in Colorado who recorded a recruiter's guiding him on creating a fake diploma. 
 He said the Army could persuade people to join only if recruiters personify the military's core values, including honesty and integrity.
 ''There is no relativism there,'' he said of the Army's approach to recruiting tactics. ''It's either right, or it's wrong.'' 
 The suspension, called a ''values stand-down,'' was mandatory for every member of the recruiting command. Recruiters said they were required to sign a document saying that they would not commit an impropriety and would report soldiers who did. General Rochelle said it included sessions on recruiting rules, a re-affirmation of the Army's oath, and the viewing of an eight-minute video. 
 The video, which was released to reporters in Washington, was watched by recruiters and other members of the command at various locations, including bases near where they recruit. It shows General Rochelle explaining the suspension. ''Recent events might suggest that mission takes precedence over integrity,'' he said in the video. ''It does not. We are capable of achieving both.''
 Stand-downs are usually used to emphasize safety precautions. General Rochelle said the recruiting command has had two stand-downs since October. But spending a full day on recruiting ethics has not occurred in decades, said David Segal, a military sociologist at the University of Maryland.
 ''It's a sign that the Army isn't only unhappy with the improprieties; it's also very serious about getting it fixed,'' Mr. Segal said. ''Stand-downs are very, very rare.''
 Recruiters, however, said they doubted much would change. As of April 25, the Army had recruited 35,926 active-duty soldiers, far short of its goal of 80,000 for the fiscal year that began in October. 
 As long as the war continues to scare people from serving, recruiters said yesterday in interviews, the 80-hour weeks would continue, along with the unyielding pressure to find recruits, which they say has already bred depression, broken marriages and rule-breaking among the ranks.
 A recruiter in New York, who insisted on anonymity because the Army had ordered all recruiters not to speak to reporters, said the stand-down would probably scare some recruiters away from what the Army considers the most serious kinds of improprieties, like falsifying diplomas. Infractions viewed as easier to get away with, he said, like hiding drug use or depression, would probably continue.
 Other recruiters were more skeptical. Another New York recruiter who also requested anonymity for the same reason, added that the suspension was simply a public relations stunt. ''They can say whatever they want,'' he said, ''but they didn't do anything about the recruiters who were doing this before it came out in the news.''
 The improprieties are also drawing attention from Congress. Army statistics show there were 325 substantiated allegations in 2004, up from 213 in 2002. During the same period, punishment declined: last year 3 of every 10 recruiters who were found to have committed improprieties intentionally or through gross negligence were relieved of duty; in 2002, 5 of 10 were relieved. 
 Several lawmakers have begun to demand an independent inquiry. 
 Last week, Senator Wayne Allard, Republican of Colorado, sent a letter to the Army secretary, Francis J. Harvey, requesting a nationwide inquiry into improprieties. Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, sent letters to Army officials requesting a full-scale investigation. And yesterday, 11 other House Democrats signed a letter to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, which asked him to appoint a special counsel that would investigate recruitment. 
 ''The Army takes allegations against recruiters seriously,'' said Paul Boyce, an Army spokesman at the Pentagon, ''and will continue to address these in a thorough and fair manner for all parties involved.''

HEADLINE: China to Raise Tariffs on Textile and Apparel Exports

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and KEITH BRADSHER; David Barboza reported from Beijing for this article and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 20 

 BODY:
China said Friday that it would raise its tariffs on many textile and apparel exports, in the hope of easing trade frictions with the United States and Europe.
 The move, which is not expected to stop United States plans to impose quotas, comes as the Chinese government is under increasing international pressure to allow its currency to strengthen to damp the surge of textile and apparel products into the United States and Europe that occurred in the first half of this year.
 The Ministry of Finance said that beginning June 1 the government would impose substantially higher tariffs on 74 textile and apparel products, with tariffs quintupling on average. But many of the tariffs are so low now that manufacturers elsewhere were quick to question whether the move would do much to blunt China's surging apparel shipments. And manufacturers in China said they did not expect the higher costs to be passed on to consumers. 
 The products include everything from blouses and underwear to shirts and knitted suits, and the tariffs will generally rise to the equivalent of 12 cents a piece from about 2.5 cents now.
 Growing trade surpluses with the West continue to drive economic growth here, but the widening trade gap is also worrying economists who see signs of troubling imbalances emerging in the global economy.
 Much of the focus has turned to China and its textile and apparel exports, which have soared since the elimination of the global system of trade quotas on Jan. 1.
 Those gains have alarmed textile and apparel makers in the United States and Europe, who are rapidly losing market share and jobs in what they often consider an unfair fight with China, which can produce the goods for significantly less.
 Now, with Chinese clothing exports to the United States and Europe up over 1,000 percent in some categories in the first months of this year, American and European Union officials have been investigating China's textile trade and weighing new trade restrictions on Chinese goods.
 On Wednesday, the United States said it would impose quotas on certain Chinese clothing imports to limit growth to 7.5 percent a year.
 On Friday, after the Chinese announcement, the Commerce Department said the United States still planned to go ahead with its plan to impose the quotas.
 The European Union is also weighing new restrictions on Chinese textile and apparel goods.
 Chinese government officials this week called the new American trade restrictions unfair and have regularly lashed out at the idea of imposing any trade restrictions on Chinese goods, saying such action violates global trade agreements.
 Beijing officials have also steadfastly insisted that despite international pressure that will wait until the appropriate time to make any move to revalue or appreciate their currency, the yuan or renminbi, which has long been pegged at about 8.26 to the dollar. 
 But on Friday, China decided to move on the trade front.
 The government did not issue a statement explaining the decision. Chinese textile officials said the government moved to ease trade tensions, but, as a result, Chinese textile makers would be hurt.
 ''The readjustment will have a significant impact on China's textile industry, and exports will decrease significantly,'' Yang Donghui, vice chairman of the China National Textile and Apparel Council, said in a telephone interview. ''In order to fulfill this international responsibility, China's textile industry will suffer. Right now, the profit margins are between 2 or 3 percent. And foreign buyers like Wal-Mart are lowering the prices again and again.''
 Some textile and apparel companies with factories in China, however, reacted cautiously to the government's decision. Willy Lin, the managing director of Milo's Knitwear International Ltd., a large apparel company based in Hong Kong, said that the increased export taxes would clearly hurt the volume of Chinese exports, but would be worthwhile if they persuaded American and European politicians and trade negotiators to drop plans for limits on Chinese apparel shipments.
 Mr. Lin said that manufacturers, to remain competitive, would probably bear the entire cost of the taxes in industrialized countries. 
 ''The trade will bear the full brunt, and I'm sure the customer will not be so generous as to share the cost,'' said Mr. Lin, who is also the vice chairman of the Hong Kong Textile Council, a trade association whose members own much of the Chinese textile and apparel industry.
 If the United States and the European Union proceed with limits on Chinese shipments, then manufacturers will ask Beijing to repeal the tax and fight the trade restrictions before the World Trade Organization in Geneva, Mr. Lin said.
 ''That would mean they do not treasure the trade relationship with China, so what is the point of hurting yourself'' by collecting the tax, he explained.
 Manufacturers in other Asian countries have also been urging limits on Chinese exports. Annisul Huq, the chairman of the Mohammadi Group, a big garment manufacturer in Bangladesh, said that the export tariffs imposed by China were still too small to make a difference.
 Mr. Huq said that the United States and the European Union should proceed with plans to limit Chinese apparel exports to make sure that even poorer countries like Bangladesh did not suffer severe harm to their garment industries. ''I think there should be restrictions, quantitative restrictions,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Is Concerned About 'Froth' In Housing

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested on Friday that the red-hot housing market is becoming a little too exuberant for its own good.
 ''Without calling the overall national issue a bubble, it's pretty clear that it's an unsustainable underlying pattern,'' Mr. Greenspan told the Economic Club of New York at the Hilton New York hotel in Midtown.
 Mr. Greenspan emphasized that he sees no sign of a nationwide housing bubble, but he acknowledged concerns over ''froth'' in the market and pointed to a big increase in speculation in homes -- particularly in second homes. As a result, he said, there are ''a lot of local bubbles'' around the country. 
 The comments of the Fed chairman were the closest he has come to acknowledging the possibility that housing prices may be poised for a fall in some parts of the country.
 The issue is sensitive for the Federal Reserve, because its policy of keeping interest rates low has helped propel housing prices upward even when the rest of the economy was dragging.
 But the housing issue highlights an unusual quandary for the central bank: even though it has raised short-term interest rates eight times since last June, long-term interest rates and mortgage rates are actually lower than they were one year ago.
 The unexpected persistence of low mortgage rates has kept alive the housing boom -- in new-home construction as well as in prices of existing homes -- much longer than most analysts had expected.
 Mr. Greenspan has tried to avoid second-guessing the markets. In 1996, he suggested that the stock prices had been pumped up by ''irrational exuberance.''
 But after a brief spasm of anxiety, investors drove prices higher for three more years. Mr. Greenspan has been criticized by some for failing to pre-emptively puncture the stock market bubble, which burst in March 2000, and some analysts criticize the Federal Reserve now for creating a housing bubble.
 Fed officials contend that their primary job is not to influence the price of assets, whether stocks or real estate, but rather to focus on inflation and growth. Trying to puncture a bubble, they say, would cause more problems than it would prevent.
 Mr. Greenspan repeated many of his past reassurances about the housing market: that any bubbles were local, not national; and that people do not speculate as much on houses as they do on stocks, because they generally live in the houses they buy.
 Residential real estate prices have jumped at double-digit rates for the last several years in many cities, especially along the East and West Coasts. 
 Prices for existing homes on the West Coast jumped 18.9 percent for the 12 months through March and 14.7 percent on the East Coast, according to the National Association of Realtors. 
 Nationwide, prices of existing homes have risen by 20 percent over the last two years and 29 percent for the last three years, according to Gus Faucher, a senior economist at Economy.com, a research group.
 ''We do not see a nationwide housing bubble,'' Mr. Faucher said, ''but there are certainly instances where prices are way ahead of fundamentals.''
 Many analysts have argued for months that evidence of speculative activity has increased over the last year. Much of the evidence is anecdotal, including people buying and reselling houses at developments before construction is even completed.
 But there has been solid data as well pointing to rapid price increases in second-home markets, reports of many more individuals buying houses and condominiums as investments rather than as places to live, and to the heavy use of interest-only loans and adjustable-rate mortgages that allow purchasers to buy considerably more expensive properties than would otherwise be possible.
 Mr. Greenspan acknowledged on Friday that many people were ''reaching'' to finance their purchases. 
 But he predicted that housing prices were unlikely to decline much, if at all.
 ''Even if there are declines in prices,'' he said, ''the significant run-up to date has so increased equity in homes that only those who have purchased very recently, purchased before prices actually literally go down, are going to have problems.''

HEADLINE: The Yuan Diversion

 BODY:
The get-tough-on-China talk got tougher this week when Treasury Secretary John Snow announced that China risks being branded a currency manipulator -- and thus subject to sanctions -- unless it acts soon to increase the fixed exchange rate between its currency, the yuan, and the United States dollar. Mr. Snow was echoing American manufacturers and some members of Congress who complain that China is undervaluing the yuan to artificially depress its export prices. But his aim is only partly to prod China. By demanding action, he is also trying to defuse growing anti-Chinese sentiment, as evidenced by the Senate's threat last month to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese goods unless the yuan is revalued. 
 Given America's difficult trade issues with China -- patent and copyright violations, barriers to American goods and services -- why are Congress and the administration fixating on the yuan? The Chinese currency is undervalued and that situation must be remedied, both in order for China to gain more control over its own economy and to improve international trade relations. But even a sharp upward revaluation wouldn't do much to reduce the United States' immense trade imbalances because China accounts for just a fraction of America's overall trade, and American consumers are unlikely to shun Chinese products even if their prices rise. 
 One reason for the fuss is that it's easier to exploit the yuan than to remedy the loss of American manufacturing jobs. For years, the United States has pursued global trade without adopting programs to fix its negative side effects, chief among them the lost jobs in generally low-skilled industries, like textiles. Nor are there policies to prepare displaced workers for better employment, like tax credits for companies to provide more training. 
 Focusing on the yuan also deflects the blame for America's role in promoting global imbalances. Mr. Snow has acknowledged that the United States' federal budget deficit distorts global trade and investment. But, incredibly, he has also said that the United States is ''aggressively tackling'' its deficit with ''appropriate fiscal policy.'' That statement might be valid if President Bush and his Congressional allies gave up their drive to extend Mr. Bush's first-term tax cuts permanently or if Mr. Bush abandoned his plan to borrow trillions of dollars to privatize Social Security. But there are no such reversals in sight. Contrary to Mr. Snow's assertion, then, the United States is not ''doing its part'' to address global imbalances.
 Washington relies greatly on China for the funds to finance its deficits. Rather than positioning ourselves as China's adversary, it would be wise to cooperate, starting with honest discussion.

HEADLINE: Off the Hill, and Leading the Charge on Trade

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20 

 BODY:
What most surprises Rob Portman, who served in Congress for six terms, is how much time he still spends dealing with politics on Capitol Hill as the new United States trade representative.
 His days have been filled with long conversations, trying to sway lawmakers to approve a trade pact with Central America. He is figuring out a strategy with Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, on how to neutralize the sugar lobby.
 He adjusted a section on textiles in the pact to satisfy Senator Elizabeth Dole, Republican of North Carolina. And he is negotiating over labor issues with Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, in hopes of bringing his vote into the administration's column. 
 ''I knew the trade representative was close to the Hill, but I didn't know how much,'' he said in his first extensive interview in his office across the street from the White House. ''This level of consultation with Congress isn't shared by any other cabinet member.''
 Mr. Portman has had to hit the ground running.
 He has inherited the worst trade deficit in history -- $617 billion last year -- and that has made many lawmakers suspicious of any further trade agreements. The teetering round of global trade talks, if they are to have any hope of succeeding, will require reducing agricultural subsidies in rich nations, including the United States. Talk about a tough political task.
 At least he has a little time on that front. But within weeks, Mr. Portman has to resolve the Boeing-Airbus dispute with Europe over government subsidies -- or it will go to the World Trade Organization and become the most expensive trade dispute ever put before that body.
 Mr. Portman, still on a honeymoon in the job, has a narrow path to tread. Many developing countries question the rich nations' commitments to open and fair trade. At home, lawmakers worry that rapid globalization is responsible for the loss of some of their constituents' jobs.
 Democrats have said that they do not want to approve any trade deal until the Bush administration presents a workable vision of how to reduce the trade deficit. One of Mr. Portman's ideas is to create a position dedicated solely to enforcing trade laws more stringently.
 ''If we're going to maintain our standard of living,'' he said, ''then we need to be more aggressive in enforcing trade laws.''
 One major issue for Mr. Portman is trade with China. He said he had already ordered his lawyers to collect enough evidence from American industry to file a case at the W.T.O. against China if he did not see ''dramatic progress'' in protecting intellectual property rights from rampant pirating and copying.
 ''We cannot expect the United States to continue to rely on promises of enforcement when we are not seeing results,'' he said.
 Mr. Portman, a boyish-looking 49-year-old Ohioan who exudes a Midwestern probity without the arrogance that often accompanies a long stint in the House, not only takes all this in stride, he is invigorated by the debate. ''I've really loved the job so far,'' he said.
 He is unique not only for being the first member of Congress to hold the trade position but for the political pedigree he brings to the job. Known for his hard work and modesty, he has unusually close friendships with Democrats as well as Republicans. He is so close to the president and his inner circle that he acted as a bridge between the House and the White House while still in Congress.
 The son of a self-made Cincinnati business executive, Mr. Portman was drawn to foreign travel early, studying in Sweden as a high school student, then in the Loire Valley of France while in college. After earning his law degree, he worked in Washington firms practicing international trade law, traveling to Europe and South America, but also jumping into Republican politics.
 He served in the White House of the first President Bush and in the first campaign of the current president. He is credited with helping to ensure that Ohio backed the president in the last election.
 His first triumph came overseas, in Paris, within 48 hours of his confirmation. Mr. Portman played the middleman in global trade discussions on a technical point of European agriculture policy.
 He worked with Peter Mandelson, the European Union's senior trade official. If the senior officials of the world's two biggest economies cannot agree, global trade talks usually fail. The two worked well together.
 ''He came across more as a seasoned negotiator than a congressman,'' Mr. Mandelson said. ''He was on the top of his brief, but he also had a good feel for people. There is no question his close relationship with the president gives him an uncommon confidence.''
 Mr. Portman's predecessor, Robert B. Zoellick , now deputy secretary of state, was known for his strong sense of strategy and for wearing his intellectualism on his sleeve. By contrast, Mr. Portman has won points for his unassuming mastery of the fine points of trade esoterica. 
 Representative Sherrod Brown, a Democrat and fellow Ohioan, said that Mr. Portman was popular on the Hill but still had to defend an unpopular trade policy. 
 ''He has to answer the question, How did the trade deficit grow to $617 billion under President Bush and why does that mean we should continue with the President's trade agenda?'' Mr. Brown said. ''Many Americans will say it hasn't benefited them at all.'' 
 Mr. Portman, his coat jacket draped across a chair, sipped lemonade and thought about that. He said the problem was not that simple. 
 ''It's a reality in Ohio that there is a lot of concern about trade, but it is not practical to pull up the ladder,'' he said. ''My role is to expand exports, and then I can make a difference.''

HEADLINE: Freud and Schwarzenegger Can't Both Be Wrong

BYLINE: By Harry Hurt III

 BODY:
SOMETIMES a cigar is just a cigar, but not if one is a connoisseur like James E. Cayne, chairman and chief executive of Bear Stearns, and David G. Bronner, chief executive of the Retirement Systems of Alabama. For them, a cigar serves as ''protection and a weapon in the combat of life,'' as Sigmund Freud, who smoked up to 20 fat trabucos a day, once said.
 That was demonstrated with Freudian ritualism last December when Mr. Cayne flew from New York to Montgomery, Ala., to discuss a lawsuit brought by Dr. Bronner's pension system against Bear Stearns over losses in WorldCom securities investments. Upon arriving in Dr. Bronner's office, Mr. Cayne sat down in a cushy armchair and lighted up. ''He had some kind of fancy cigar,'' Dr. Bronner recalled. ''He wouldn't even tell me the name of it.'' 
 Unfazed, Dr. Bronner started puffing his own favorite, a Montecristo No.2. Then he and Mr. Cayne proceeded to hash out a $15 million partial settlement of the WorldCom lawsuit. The identity of the fancy cigar remains a mystery. Mr. Cayne is not talking. But Dr. Bronner says the smoke-a-thon helped facilitate a meeting of the minds. ''A cigar relaxes you, and gives you a different feeling,'' he said.
 It has been more than four decades since the United States surgeon general warned about the health hazards of tobacco. One might think that smoking cigars in the executive suite had gone the way of smoking in the rest of the workplace, in restaurants and in most other indoor public venues. But as the pale blue plume wafting through Dr. Bronner's inner sanctum unequivocally attests, one would be wrong.
 Indeed, cigar smoking -- specifically, the smoking of premium cigars retailing for more than $3 apiece -- is enjoying a Hemingwayesque moveable feast after several years of famine, according to Gordon Mott, executive editor of Cigar Aficionado.
 Most premium cigars that can be legally imported are made in South America, Central America or the Dominican Republic. From 1992 to 1997, cigar imports surged to nearly 500 million units a year from 100 million units. Then the bottom dropped out of the market because of oversupply and poor quality control.
 Last year, cigar imports exceeded 300 million units for the first time in half a decade. Mr. Mott recently declared the new wave of imports to be higher in quality than ever before. ''As supply and demand have come back into equilibrium, cigar makers have found the best places to grow tobacco, and the best workers,'' he noted. ''They are now able to age their cigars longer, which leads to a better product.''
 I, for one, could not be more tickled. I have smoked cigars for more than 30 years. I have no plans to quit, and I make no apologies for what some misguided souls may consider yet another of my nasty habits. As the writer George Sand observed, ''A cigar is the perfect complement to the elegant lifestyle.'' And as her lover, Alfred de Musset, hastened to add, ''Any cigar smoker is a friend, because I know how he feels.'' 
 By that definition, my fellow cigar smokers and I can count among our friends corporate and political luminaries like Mr. Cayne; Dr. Bronner; Robert A. Lutz, the vice chairman of General Motors; Jurgen E. Schrempp, the chief executive of DaimlerChrysler; Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of Time Warner; A.W. Jones III, the scion of Sea Island, Ga.; Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City; the Rev. Al Sharpton; Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California; and Madonna.
 Along with sharing an uncommonly pleasurable pastime, we aficionados share a common paranoia that transcends class, creed, race, gender or the national origin of one's cigars. We fear that if past is prelude, the antismoking infidels will keep waging their jihad until they snuff us out forever. So in the spirit of sustaining the current cigar renaissance, I took it upon myself to seek sage advice for smoking safely through these perilous times.
 The following rules of cigar etiquette are based on hundreds of hours of firsthand investigative smoking and extensive interviews with authorities like Dr. Bronner, Mr. Mott and Barnaby Conrad III, author of ''The Cigar'' (Chronicle Books, 1996), which details the history of old stogies since Christopher Columbus, the first European explorer to discover them.

RULE 1: SMOKE IN CIGAR PARLORS -- The best way to avoid being busted by the antismoking police or a nonsmoking significant other is to confine one's indoor smoking to designated cigar parlors. As Mr. Mott noted, these bastions of civility are becoming ever fewer and farther between. Apart from lounges in local tobacco shops, New York's remaining upscale cigar parlors include the Grand Havana Room (which is private) and Club Macanudo, Hudson Bar and Books and Lexington Bar and Books (which are open to the public). But one can almost always get away with smoking outdoors on the links, especially the courses of the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail in Alabama, which are owned by Dr. Bronner's cigar-friendly pension fund.

RULE 2: NEVER CHAIN-SMOKE CIGARS -- Along with being inordinately expensive, chain-smoking cigars deprives one of savoring the aroma and taste of fine tobacco and the camaraderie traditionally associated with the ''cigar smoking as campfire'' experience. ''A cigar is not to be lit up like a cigarette and smoked for 45 seconds and then thrown away,'' Dr. Bronner reminded. ''It's to be smoked during a long, relaxing conversation over an hour or two.'' On this point, Mr. Conrad cited the Cuban-born novelist G. Cabrera Infante, who said, ''Cigarettes are of the instant, cigars are for eternity.''

RULE 3: THE BEST DEFENSE IS TO AVOID OFFENSE -- Remember that nonsmokers seldom appreciate the smell of cigars on one's breath or clothes. One is therefore well advised to take another tip from Dr. Bronner, and put a little more money where one's mouth is after smoking. ''I brush my teeth and gargle four times a day,'' he said. ''That way I won't offend my retirees.'' Mr. Conrad suggested that the fashion-conscious consider investing in a 19th-century-style silk smoking jacket, the forerunner of the modern tuxedo, which allows both gentlemen and ladies ''to bask in smoke and ash without stinking up their fine clothes.''

RULE 4: DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL IF IT'S CUBAN -- One should never talk with a cigar in one's mouth, particularly if the word Habana is on the band. Cuban cigars are embargoed in the United States. Americans who buy them -- even in foreign countries where they are legal -- can be prosecuted for violating the economic sanctions against Cuba. One can still smoke a Cuban cigar that is offered as a gift. But why run the risk? Eight of the top 10 cigars of the year as ranked by Cigar Aficionado, including the top-rated Padron Serie 1926 40th Anniversary from Nicaragua, are non-Cuban. After all, the last place one would ever want to light up one's last cigar is in jail.

AGAINST DEPRESSION
By Peter D. Kramer.
353 pp. Viking. $25.95.
 PETER D. KRAMER, author of the phenomenally successful ''Listening to Prozac,'' may be thought of as America's Dr. Depression, and he may have done more than anybody else to illuminate the clawing, scabrous, catastrophic monotony that is depressive illness. But he has never suffered from the mental disorder himself. Not that he's a chipper bon vivant. 
 ''I am easily upset,'' he writes in ''Against Depression.'' ''I brood over failures. I require solitude. . . . In medieval or Renaissance terms, I am melancholic as regards my preponderant humor.'' Still, he has never qualified for a diagnosis of even low-level depression. My first reaction to that biographical detail was to question Kramer's authority on the subject. How can you really understand what pain is, I wondered, if you've never felt the Cuisinart inside?
 I quickly dropped my objections, however, when I realized I was doing for depression precisely what Kramer warns against in this eloquent, absorbing and largely persuasive book. I was lifting it to the status of the metaphysical, or at least the meta-medical. I was granting to its specific pain the presumed reimbursement of revelation, the power to ennoble, instruct and certify the sufferer. By contrast, I'd never insist that my endocrinologist suffer my autoimmune disorder before treating me or talking publicly about autoimmunity; or that my endodontist, before extracting my infected dental pulp, first be ''enlightened'' with a few root canals of his own.
 That Kramer has not been depressed may in fact allow him to resist doing what depressives, and those who love them, too readily do, which is romanticize and totemize and finally trivialize the illness. Instead, Kramer, who is a clinical professor of psychiatry at Brown University, sees depression for what it is. ''It is fragility, brittleness, lack of resilience, a failure to heal,'' he writes. It is sadness, hopelessness, chronic exhaustion allied with corrosive anxiety, a loss of any emotion but guilt, of any desire but to stop, please stop, and to stay stopped, forever. ''Depression is a disease of extraordinary magnitude,'' he says, and ''the major scourge of humankind.'' 
 Found by the World Health Organization to be the single most disabling disease, depression afflicts people of every age, class, race, creed and calling: as many as 25 percent of us will be caught in its vise at least once in our lives. The disease blights careers, shatters families and costs billions of dollars in lost workdays a year. Kramer cites studies putting the annual workplace cost in this country alone at $40 billion -- the+equivalent of 3 percent of the gross national product. 
 Depression also kills, through suicide, heart disease, pneumonia, accidents. Forget the persistent myth of depression as a source of artistry, soulfulness and rebellion. Depression doesn't fan creative flames. It is photophobic and anhedonic and would rather just drool in the dark.
 Kramer wrote ''Against Depression'' to dispel what he sees as the lingering charisma of the disease. And yes, people talk about it now as a biological disease rather than a moral or spiritual failing. The stigma of mental illness has mainly faded, and antidepressants are among the most widely prescribed of all medications. Nevertheless, in the dozen years since the publication of ''Listening to Prozac,'' Kramer has seen plenty of resistance to the idea that depression, like cancer, AIDS or malaria, is a disease without redeeming value, best annihilated entirely. He has read stacks of depression memoirs, and though most have parroted the party line that depression is a disease like any other, ''hints of pride almost invariably showed through, as if affliction with depression might after all be more enriching than, say . . . kidney failure.'' The writers couldn't help conveying the message: ''Depression gave me my soul.'' 
 Moreover, whenever Kramer gives a talk, sooner or later an audience member invariably asks The Question. So, Dr. Kramer, what would have happened if van Gogh had taken Prozac? Or Kierkegaard? Or Virginia Woolf? The implication of the question is obvious. Throw out the depression bath water and, whoops, there go ''Starry Night'' and ''Mrs. Dalloway'' with it.
 Kramer presents a sustained case that depression, far from enhancing cognitive or emotional powers, essentially pokes holes in the brain, killing neurons and causing key regions of the prefrontal cortex -- the advanced part of the brain, located just behind the forehead -- to shrink measurably in size. He lucidly explains a wealth of recent research on the disease, citing work in genetics, biochemistry, brain imaging, the biology of stress, studies of identical twins. He compares the brain damage from depression with that caused by strokes. As a result of diminished blood flow to the brain, he says, many elderly stroke patients suffer crippling depressions. Is stroke-induced depression a form of ''heroic melancholy''? If not, then why pin merit badges on any expression of the disease? 
 Rallying his extensive familiarity with art and literature, Kramer argues that history's depressive luminaries were creative not because of but despite their struggles with mental illness -- as a result of their underlying resilience, a quality he admires. Kramer envisions a utopian future in which neuro-resilience and neuro-regeneration may be easily induced with drugs or gene therapy. How much more intellectually and emotionally courageous might we be, he asks, how much more readily might we venture out on limbs and high wires, if we knew a private trampoline would always break our fall?
 KRAMER'S narrative is not seamless. He argues that depression has long been very much among us, and he rightly discounts pat evolutionary hypotheses about the disease's ''adaptive value,'' but he doesn't offer much of an explanation himself for how a condition so devastating+has come to be so common. Kramer can also sound defensive and willfully dour. To counter possible charges of superficiality or a fondness for smiley-face fixes, he presents his ''bona fides as a person who can appreciate alienation, both the social and existential varieties,'' among them being a New York-born German Jew who lost many relatives in the Holocaust. He rejects our habitual conflation of tragedy with depth and joy with shallowness, yet when A. L. Kennedy, author of the memoir ''On Bullfighting,'' struggles to find some lightness by recalling how her suicidal fantasies clashed with her fear of public embarrassment, Kramer dismisses her attempts as an author's version of ''meeting cute.'' 
 Ah, but self-mockery can be a small source of joy, even redemption, which is why, whenever I lapse into hand-wringing, I recall Ezra Pound's ode to misery, a parody of A. E. Housman: ''O woe, woe, / People are born and die, / We also shall be dead pretty soon / Therefore let us act as if we were dead already.''
 Now that's what I call cute.

HEADLINE: Banya Fever

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BLEYER

 BODY:
GREGORY ZASLAVSKY, a Russian entrepreneur with black hair, fine skin and a gravelly voice, describes his 28 years of achievement in New York with no small amount of pride: the Brighton Beach restaurant, the supermarkets. But the venture of which Mr. Zaslavsky is proudest, and the only one in which he still has a hand, is the Russian bathhouse on Gravesend Neck Road.
 ''I was first,'' he said the other day, sitting in his clammy office at the bathhouse. ''Nobody else.'' 
 The idea for the bathhouse, Russian Bath, was born in 1980, when a friend told him about an apartment building in Sheepshead Bay that had an unused swimming pool in the basement. As far as Mr. Zaslavsky knew, south Brooklyn had no Russian baths, or banyas, as they are called, despite the fact that the area was home to a growing number of immigrants from the former Soviet republics. He leased the space, cleaned out the pool, and added the steam rooms and saunas that transformed the facility into a traditional banya, complete with fiery rocks over which water is poured to create steam.
 Some days, not a single person came. ''Everybody was so poor then,'' Mr. Zaslavsky recalled. But gradually, the local economy improved, and the bath won a devoted following. It now gets about 100 daily visitors, many of whom have been coming once a week for years and pay a basic fee of $25.
 They are, for the most part, bearish men who plod around in plastic slippers, their stomachs spilling over the top of their swimming trunks, and their skin broiled pink by the heat. They eat briny vegetables and smoked fish in a cafe near the pool, where Mr. Zaslavsky has hung photographs of famous Russian hockey and boxing stars. (''Sergei Kobozev,'' he said mournfully, pointing at one picture. ''Killed by the gangsters.'') 
 For more than two decades, Mr. Zaslavsky's only competition was two other baths that opened in the Brooklyn communities of Sea Gate and Kensington. But in the past few years, as the number of immigrants from the former Soviet republics in New York has swelled to more than 160,000, other entrepreneurs have been watching the Russian bath market, and a small bathhouse war is brewing. 
 One new entrant into the fray is Alex Israel, an Azerbaijani who last year opened Sandoony USA, an 11,000-square-foot bath on McDonald Avenue near Avenue J in Midwood, and sees the bathhouse market as rich with untapped opportunities.
 ''I used to go to Neck Road when it opened years ago,'' Mr. Israel said. ''You see the place? It smells.''
 For 20 years, he added, ''when people talked about these kinds of places, they said: 'Oh, they smell. They don't change the water in the pool.'''
 ''I decided there should be something newer, where everything is safe and clean.'' (The management of Mr. Zaslavsky's bath countered that, in accordance with its license from the health department, it maintained high levels of cleanliness.)
 Sandoony, which is named after a famous Moscow bath, has all the accouterments Russian bathers expect to find. Its steam rooms and pools promote the salubrious effects of alternating the body between hot and cold temperatures. Big men in small Speedos lounge about in garden chairs drinking Baltika beer, oblivious to the roar of the elevated F train.
 But Sandoony also has a skylight, sleek granite tile and television screens that show Russian music videos. Young women wander about in bikinis, and Mr. Israel boasts that by advertising in local movie theaters, he has attracted a more youthful crowd.
 ''This kind of place used to be just for older people,'' he said. ''I want the kids to know it's O.K. here. We have 5,000 towels. I have 15 people cleaning. Everything is perfect.''
 Soon, however, Mr. Israel will have his own competition. Over on Sheepshead Bay Road, off Neptune Avenue in Brighton Beach, a construction crew navigated the steel beams they had already installed for Kings Spa, a 50,000-square-foot Russian bath slated to open this year. The bath is the brainchild of two husky Uzbeks, Boris Rozenguaz and his nephew Alex, and its size alone will trump its rivals.
 ''I had banyas in Kazakhstan and Moscow before I come to America,'' Boris Rozenguaz said recently as he sat in a trailer near the site. ''I know this business.'' In between pouring glasses of tea, his nephew displayed an illustrated rendering of the new facility, encased in smoky glass and topped with a United Nations-like row of international flags. 
 ''I see customers who want this,'' said Moty Movtady, an Iranian developer who is working on the project with the Rozenguaz family. ''Russians spend half a day of leisure at a bath, kind of like golf to the Americans. We will be more advanced than the other baths in every respect. Newer, nicer, more expensive.''
 Like Sandoony, the $6 million Kings Spa hopes to entice a new generation of Russian bathgoers. It will offer services unfamiliar to older Russians, but ones their Americanized children have come to expect: tanning beds, skin care, massage. A fitness center will occupy the entire second floor. 
 ''The American gym is geared toward younger people,'' Alex Rozenguaz said. Among the older generation, he noted, simply sitting and sweating is seen as exercise enough.
 ALTHOUGH the operators of all three bathhouse are presumably keeping an eye on the competition, Alex Rozenguaz predicts that there will be enough business to go around.
 ''We have 400 Russian restaurants in Brooklyn and only three bathhouses,'' he said. ''Today, if another 10 opened, they'd have enough business to survive. At one, there's an hourlong line to get in on weekends. The market is large enough for everyone.''
 The other evening, Mr. Zaslavsky's modest basement bath on Gravesend Neck Road was nearly full. Inside the scorching Russian dry room, people sat shoulder to shoulder on wooden benches, breathing heavily and wearing felt caps to protect their heads from the heat.
 Jack Bord, a Yalta-born limousine driver who lives in Midwood, explained, unblinkingly, that one must stay in the dry room ''until you feel your skin is on fire or you have a heart attack.'' He had heard rumors about Kings Spa, and had actually visited Sandoony a few times out of curiosity. Still, he preferred the old Russian bath that he has visited every Thursday for a decade.
 ''Maybe the new banyas opening are more famous, have a little bit extra service,'' Mr. Bord said, ladling water over the scorching rocks until the room was shrouded in steam. ''But you feel there like a stranger. I feel here at home. Why should I look for something else if I'm happy here?''

HEADLINE: Hoping the Good News Holds, El Paso Prepares for Major Growth at Fort Bliss

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

DATELINE: EL PASO, May 17 

 BODY:
''It's a great day to be a soldier,'' proclaims the big sign at El Paso International Airport. 
 It is a great day, too, for struggling El Paso, or it will be if the Army follows through with plans for a huge buildup at Fort Bliss, the neighboring Army post and air defense center, which is set for the greatest increase in the number of troops under Pentagon recommendations announced on May 13.
 ''It's so significant, it's hard to put into words, an economic impact of maybe $2.5 billion a year,'' said Richard E. Dayoub, president of the Greater El Paso Chamber of Commerce, who spent May 14 at a Soldier Appreciation Picnic dishing out so much barbecued brisket that he was nursing a cramp in his hand. 
 If the expansion plans survive a coming round of hearings by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, Fort Bliss -- larger than Rhode Island and the only installation where every weapon in the Army arsenal can be fired -- would see its military strength, now about 18,000 soldiers and civilians, grow by more than 50 percent. Its net gain, over the next six years or so, would be 11,354 troops. 
 That would prove a welcome boost for El Paso, a sun-baked city of 563,000 that was known as the blue jeans capital of the world until the garment industry took flight in the 1990's.
 Until then, many agree, El Paso -- sprawled at the feet of the jagged Franklin Mountains across the Rio Grande from Juarez, Mexico, and closer to Los Angeles than to Beaumont in East Texas -- took its military neighbor largely for granted. City officials barely noticed when an earlier round of base changes moved the 4,600 soldiers of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment to Fort Carson, Colo., from Fort Bliss in 1995. Only when restaurants and shops around the post started closing did the loss become evident. 
 ''I think we were a little naive in the process,'' said Mayor Joe Wardy, who was not in office then. 
 What a difference a decade makes.
 With the factories that once turned out two million pairs of jeans a week shuttered and with unemployment soaring, El Paso's military and political establishment joined forces three years ago to begin lobbying the Pentagon to keep and to expand Fort Bliss. Foremost in their minds, city officials say, was the $1.7 billion a year the post pumped into the local economy.
 Magnifying the regional effect is Fort Bliss's integration with two contiguous bases, White Sands Missile Range and Holloman Air Force Base, both in New Mexico. The three installations, with a combined footprint as big as Connecticut, account for about one-quarter of the Army's land in the United States and contribute more than $2.5 billion into regional economies. 
 ''Never has the El Paso region been so well organized to tell decision makers that this is a military user-friendly place, never,'' said Maj. Gen. James P. Maloney, retired, who was commander of Fort Bliss from 1982 to 1985 and is the West Texas representative on the Texas Military Preparedness Commission. The panel was named by Gov. Rick Perry to promote the state's vast military interests. The 18 major military installations in Texas are home to 190,000 service members, who represent nearly 11 percent of the nation's armed forces and 27 percent of all active-duty combat ground forces. 
 Fort Bliss's rosy prospects are in marked contrast to those of 33 other major installations around the country recommended for closings and hundreds more proposed for reductions. Texas would lose almost 8,000 military and civilian slots through three base closings in Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Texarkana, and even Fort Bliss would lose 4,564 soldiers from an air defense artillery unit transferred to Fort Sill, Okla. 
 But those losses would be offset by more than 16,000 arriving troops and civilians from the proposed realignment, including 3,800 troops of the First Cavalry Division due in from various places this summer. 
 Fort Bliss, named for a lieutenant colonel in the Mexican War, was established in 1848 with six rifle companies to chase Indians. It was a cavalry post until World War II, when it became an anti-aircraft training center and eventually grew into the military's leading air defense training center. It also includes a sergeant major training school, and is home to the German air force's own air defense school, established in the United States in part to offset the costs of keeping American troops in Germany. 
 It is also the proud home, the command says, of the Army's largest bowling complex (52 lanes); its largest banquet hall, the Centennial Club (60,000 square feet, with a 14,000-square-foot banquet area); and a PX the size of a Wal-Mart.
 Now, with the proposed addition of the armored troops from Europe, Fort Bliss is also poised to grow as a combat deployment center along the lines of Fort Hood, in Killeen, Tex., a major staging post for Army operations in Iraq. 
 With more than a million acres, Fort Bliss is ''a natural for significant expansion,'' General Maloney said, as home bases have yet to be designated for the rest of the 70,000 troops coming home. 
 Such speculation thrills local boosters like Mr. Dayoub, the chamber of commerce president, who said the city was rushing ahead with plans to accommodate the newcomers. ''We've been inundated with calls and meetings about the school districts and housing,'' he said. Fort Bliss and El Paso's public water utility are about to begin construction on what they say is the world's largest inland desalinization plant, capable of filtering 27.5 million gallons of brackish aquifer water a day. 
 ''In the medium-term, we don't see anything else emerging as a growth industry,'' said Dennis L. Soden, executive director of the Institute for Policy and Economic Development at the University of Texas at El Paso.
 Over the last 10 years, Dr. Soden said, Fort Bliss has generated about 11 percent of the local economic activity. ''Every ninth person in line at the store is there because of Fort Bliss,'' he said. 
 Military dollars are especially welcome in El Paso, where the unemployment rate in March stood at 7.7 percent, more than two percentage points above the Texas and national figures. Data from the Commerce Department show the city with a per capita income of $20,129 in 2002, ranking it 312th of 318 nationwide statistical metropolitan areas, said Tom Fullerton, an economics professor at UTEP. A greater military payroll, he said, would raise the area's average earnings, because the average annual pay for civilian jobs in El Paso, $33,970, is far below the military figure, $55,634. 
 So it seems hardly surprising that El Paso just started a monthlong Freedom Fiesta to honor the troops with parties, sports outings and discount-shopping expeditions, under the slogan ''We don't need a war to thank a soldier.''
 The opening picnic at a park on the post drew 8,000 service personnel and family members, and was followed by a golf tournament on the grounds of the posh Coronado Country Club on Monday. 
 ''Can't beat this,'' said Capt. Andy Haskell, assigned to a Patriot missile brigade, as he did battle with the 14th hole.

HEADLINE: Two Belgians Win Top Prize At Cannes for Second Time

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS and A.O. SCOTT

DATELINE: CANNES, France, May 21 

 BODY:
''The Child,'' a Belgian film directed by Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne, won the Palme d'Or as best film at the 58th Cannes Film Festival on Saturday night.
 The film, which follows a young petty thief as he struggles with the moral dilemmas of fatherhood, was inspired by Dostoyevsky's ''Crime and Punishment'' and influenced by the classic French film ''Pickpocket,'' by Robert Bresson.
 This is the second time the Dardenne brothers have won the festival's top prize; ''Rosetta,'' their harsh look at work and unemployment in Belgium, took the award in 1999. 
 Paternity was a theme of more than one of this year's winning films, and of many that did not win. The jury, which included the Nobel Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison and the actors Javier Bardem and Salma Hayek, gave its Grand Prix, the festival's second-highest award, to Jim Jarmusch for ''Broken Flowers,'' a comically poignant portrait of a middle-aged Lothario (Bill Murray) searching for a son he did not know he had. 
 Mr. Jarmusch, in his acceptance speech, called the jury ''strange'' and acknowledged a number of other directors in the competition, including Gus Van Sant, Atom Egoyan and Hou Hsiao-hsien, whom Mr. Jarmusch called his teacher.
 The Jury Prize, a kind of honorable mention, was given to ''Shanghai Dreams,'' Wang Xiaoshuai's tale of proletarian unhappiness in provincial China in the early 1980's. 
 The prize for best male performance, in a year of strong contenders (including Mr. Murray, Viggo Mortensen in David Cronenberg's ''History of Violence,'' Kevin Bacon in Mr. Egoyan's ''Where the Truth Lies'' and Jeremie Renier in ''The Child''), went to Tommy Lee Jones for ''The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,'' which he also directed.
 In addition, that film earned Guillermo Arriaga the screenwriting award. ''The Three Burials'' is about a modern Texas cowboy (Mr. Jones, speaking both Spanish and English) on a mission to bury and avenge his murdered friend, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. 
 America was clearly on the minds of many filmmakers in the competition, including the Danish director Lars von Trier, who has never set foot on American soil, and the German director Wim Wenders, who has lived in the United States for many years.
 Neither Mr. von Trier's entry, ''Manderlay,'' his follow-up to ''Dogville,'' nor Mr. Wenders's ''Don't Come Knocking,'' which revisits some of the themes he explored in ''Paris, Texas,'' won any prizes, though both directors have won Palmes in the past. 
 The jury selected Hanna Laslo as the festival's best actress for her role in the Israeli director Amos Gitai's ''Free Zone.'' Ms. Laslo, who plays a brusque Israeli taxi driver in the film (which also stars Natalie Portman), shared her prize with her mother, a Holocaust survivor, and with the victims from ''both sides'' in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
 ''Free Zone'' was one of many films in the festival that engaged contemporary issues directly rather than through allegory. Similarly, Mr. Jones's film, in spite of poetic and symbolic flourishes, concerns itself with problems on the border of the United States and Mexico. And ''The Child,'' in spite of its literary pedigree, is grounded in the brutal conditions of poor and disenfranchised citizens of modern Europe. 
 Contemporary European social issues were as much a theme at Cannes this year as American policy and politics. The Director's Prize went to the Austrian director Michael Haneke (who now works mainly in France) for ''Hidden,'' which touches on France's long, painful involvement in Algeria.
 The film, which stars Juliette Binoche and Daniel Auteuil, was a critical favorite. It was acquired for North American distribution by Sony Pictures Classics.
 The Camera d'Or, for the best first feature, went to two films: ''The Forsaken Land,'' directed by Vimukthi Jayasundara, about a small group of people living in a desolate part of Sri Lanka; and Miranda July's ''Me, You and Everyone We Know,'' a quirky look at life in Los Angeles, where everyone seems to be lonely as well as odd.

HEADLINE: Solution Has Become Problem for Braves

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
THE Atlanta Braves, Dan Kolb has learned, are not the Milwaukee Brewers. The Braves may have once played in Milwaukee, but we're not in Milwaukee anymore, Toto.
 Kolb was a seemingly clever answer to one of the Braves' off-season problems.
 If the Braves had one consistent shortcoming in the first 10 years of their unparalleled 13-year first-place run, it was the lack of a reliable closer. Then they solved the problem by taking John Smoltz out of the starting rotation and making him their closer. He quickly became one of the best, dominating ninth innings of games and gaining 144 saves in three seasons. 
 Then the Braves developed another problem: a shortage of starting pitchers. Instead of signing or trading for two starters, they acquired one, Tim Hudson, and made another trade that enabled them to restore Smoltz to the rotation. They obtained Kolb, who had 60 saves for Milwaukee the past two seasons. 
 After a shaky start in his new job, though, Kolb is on hiatus. 
 ''Dan Kolb pitched effectively last year,'' said John Schuerholz, the Braves' general manager. ''He came to us with high expectations and has to get accustomed to pitching in this high-expectation environment. That has varying degrees of acclimation. Some guys do it faster than others. He's not the 11th pitcher or a utility infielder. He's a key guy. He's struggling. He's not doing well. No question about that.''
 As a closer for the Brewers, Kolb failed to preserve a victory 7 times in 67 opportunities. In 13 chances with the Braves, he has squandered the save three times, including twice in his last three chances, both times depriving Smoltz of a victory. When he gave up two ninth-inning runs last Tuesday night for a 3-2 San Diego victory, Manager Bobby Cox gave Kolb a timeout.
 ''Bobby is saying we'll mix it up for a bit,'' Schuerholz said. ''We'll put Dan in situations where he can throw his stuff and feel comfortable. Bobby will try to match up his pitchers with the lineup we're facing, with hope that Dan will right himself and get back in the role we got him for.''
 Without an effective closer, the Braves would have trouble finishing first for the 14th successive time. Could the Kolb development be the first crack in the Braves' solid front?
 ''It's the right move right now,'' Schuerholz said. ''It doesn't mean anything other than the fact that this isn't working. We can't allow it to continue. We have to make adjustments.''
 Throughout their streak, the Braves have brought in new players every winter, and Cox has adeptly fit them into the team. Some of those newcomers have said it's easy to fit in and play for the Braves because they are a winning team.
 ''I don't know how you quantify it, but it's clearly different,'' Schuerholz said when asked about the Braves' environment. ''We're fully conscious of that. It's one of the factors you weigh in the equation when you consider a person.''
 It was considered in Kolb's case.
 ''It's a factor we talked about,'' Schuerholz said. ''It was something we were cognizant of. Obviously, doing it in Milwaukee carries with it less expectation than doing it for Atlanta. I think that's part of it. He has to get comfortable with it. He has 10 saves, but it's the five or six games we let get away from us.''
 Schuerholz is not ready to give up on Kolb or the Braves' chances with him as their closer. ''This is a team that was structured with good intent, with a good plan,'' he said. ''I think it will still work.''

A Rivalry Is on the Horizon
 Had the Montreal Expos been moved to Washington earlier, they would most likely be playing in Baltimore this weekend instead of in Toronto. That's just one more problem created by the extended time it took Major League Baseball to make the D.C. decision.
 Katy Feeney, the senior vice president in charge of baseball's scheduling, said: ''By the time the Expos actually moved, the schedule was done, so we left the Nationals in Toronto for one last year. If we had tried to change it, it would have meant a lot of other changes, not a simple flip-flop with Philadelphia.''
 Even though they played in the 1983 World Series, Philadelphia and Baltimore never looked like rivals except for their geographic proximity. Feeney said she expected the Orioles and the Nationals to play at least one series next season.
 Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, single-handedly helped create a rivalry by trying to keep the Expos out of Washington, threatening to sue baseball, then holding relocation hostage until baseball agreed to the financial terms he wanted in a deal that protected his team's economic base.
 The only potential problem with an Orioles-Nationals series: If it's played in Washington, will Angelos insist that he is entitled to the revenue? On the other hand, before it gets to that point, if the teams were to play only one series, Angelos would probably demand it be played in Baltimore because he knows the games would sell out, the way the Orioles used to sell out all of their games before he destroyed their status as a contender.

Don't Look for a Free Pass
 Carlos Guillen, Mark Teixeira and Lyle Overbay probably don't know it, but they are linked in one of the most remarkable feats of the season. Garret Anderson and David Dellucci are linked in a similarly remarkable feat.
 Guillen and Teixeira were the only two batters Minnesota's Brad Radke had walked in 63 innings before he walked Overbay last night in going six innings and taking the loss in the Twins' 6-0 defeat to the Brewers. Anderson and Dellucci are the only two batters Radke's teammate Carlos Silva has walked in 52 innings. Making Silva's feat even more eye-opening, the walk to Anderson was intentional.
 Radke and Silva are the best at not walking batters on a pitching staff that doesn't walk many. The Twins have walked 57. The team with the next best control, Cleveland, has walked 102.
 Rick Anderson, the Twins' pitching coach, doesn't get the attention that some other pitching coaches do, but he certainly has his pitchers throwing strikes, the goal of all pitching coaches.
 ''Radke can throw any pitch over at any time,'' Manager Ron Gardenhire said. ''He commands more pitches in the strike zone -- fastball, curve, slider, change -- and he can throw them at any time. Silva is mainly a sinker-slider pitcher. He attacks the outer half of the plate and gives up some ground-ball base hits.'' 
 Johan Santana, the Twins' Cy Young award winner last season, is a wild man compared with Radke and Silva. He has walked seven in 611/3. innings.

Have Bat, Will Travel
 For the first time in seven seasons, Reggie Sanders is playing for a team for the second successive season. He is the St. Louis Cardinals' primary left fielder, and he can finally send out his laundry.
 Sanders, 37, is a prototypical player in the free-agent era, not the highly sought star who signs a lucrative multiyear contract, but the journeyman who temporarily fills a hole for a team, then moves on to the next team that has a hole.
 Sanders, who played for Cincinnati in his first seven seasons in the major leagues, made his first two moves in trades, the Reds sending him to San Diego in February 1999 and the Padres moving him to Atlanta 10 months later. Then came free agency and visits to Arizona, San Francisco and Pittsburgh. 
 In his fourth time as a free agent, Sanders signed a two-year, $6 million contract with the Cardinals. This is the second year of that contract, meaning he can be a free agent again in November.
 In virtually every stop on his journey, Sanders has made his presence felt. Four of his last five teams have reached the playoffs, and three of the last four have played in the World Series. He won a ring with the Diamondbacks in 2001, batting .304 against the Yankees.

Selig Surrenders
 Bud Selig likes to get credit for creating interleague play and the wild cards in the playoffs. Now he gets credit for another distinction. He is believed to be the first commissioner to invite Congress into Major League Baseball instead of telling it to mind its own business and let baseball run its business.
 Selig, speaking about steroids testing, told a Congressional hearing last week, ''I would not resist federal legislation if Congress continues to believe that a uniform standard for all sports is necessary.''
 This was Selig's official act of surrender to Congress. No mas, he cried, throwing up his hands and demonstrating that he didn't like the public beatings he had taken. In the two months between hearings, the commissioner found religion, and he wanted everyone to hear him declare: ''I believe. I believe.''
 Selig resembled the Paul Newman character in the movie ''Cool Hand Luke,'' who after a series of beatings for his escapes from a chain gang eagerly obeyed orders. ''Yes, boss. Yes, boss,'' he said repeatedly with a smile. Only Luke was faking it. Selig is sincere.
 In his born-again ecstasy, perhaps Selig would have even gone before the House Un-American Activities Committee in the early 1950's and revealed as many names as Joe McCarthy, his infamous home-state senator, wanted. 
 Representative Tom Davis, Republican of Virginia, and his colleagues treated Selig roughly at their March 17 hearing, and he has demonstrated obeisance ever since. He has yet another chance to enhance his position with Congress. Yet another House committee is conducting a ''legislative inquiry'' into steroid use in sports, and it will surely lead to another hearing. Selig can't wait.


CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 2005

 CORRECTION:
A Spotlight Baseball column on Sunday about Congressional testimony by Bud Selig, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, referred incorrectly in some copies to the movie in which the character played by Paul Newman is beaten after repeated escape attempts -- a plot line to which the commissioner's experience was compared. The film is ''Cool Hand Luke,'' not ''Hud.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally as Oil Prices and Inflation Recede

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Despite a dip on Friday, stocks rallied last week and the three major market gauges rose as oil prices fell and government reports suggested inflation was dormant.
 The Labor Department reported that core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, were unchanged in April. 
And both the Conference Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia issued reports indicating that economic growth was slowing, fueling hopes that the Fed would be restrained in raising interest rates.
 Shares of Home Depot rose 9.2 percent and were among the best performers in the Dow Jones industrials. The company's first-quarter profit beat expectations and sales of big-ticket appliances soared. Lowe's, the main competitor of Home Depot, also reported a jump in earnings, and its shares gained 8.7 percent for the week. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 331.79 points, or 3.3 percent, to close at 10,471.91. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 35.23 points, or 3.1 percent, to close at 1,189.28. The Nasdaq composite index rose 69.64 points, or 3.5 percent, to close at 2,046.42. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond, at 4.12 percent, remained unchanged from the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Charter for the European Union Meets Resistance

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: AMSTERDAM, May 19 

 BODY:
For a quarter of a century, it has been pretty much assumed in the half-dozen founding countries of the now 25-member European Union that popular support for an ever bigger and more unified Europe would be virtually automatic. 
 Not anymore. At least not if large segments of public opinion in the founding states of France and the Netherlands matter. 
 In both countries, referendums are planned soon on whether to ratify the painstakingly written, 450-page draft of the new European constitution that, its sponsors say, is the indispensable blueprint for the next stage of growth and unification of what is called the European project.
 But ratification has run into a surprisingly vigorous grass-roots opposition in these countries, representing a revolt among sizable numbers of the project's supposed core constituency. 
 ''It surprised me,'' Bernard Bot, the Dutch foreign minister, said of the surge in opposition to the constitution, which he helped negotiate.
 ''I was out canvassing the other day, and I met a woman who said there was no point in trying to convince her, she was going to vote no. I asked her why, and she said, 'I just feel good saying no for once.'''
 ''There's a lot of irrational reaction that has to do with the general economic situation in the country, European enlargement and immigration,'' Mr. Bot continued in an interview in his office in The Hague. ''You can take any issue that has come up in the last few years, and it's a reason to vote no.''
 Or, as Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the former student radical who is now a German member of the European Parliament, put it, ''The feeling of the people is that we want to say no to what exists to prove that we exist.''
 The draft constitution itself is a four-part document that does many things, among them establishing power-sharing among European Union members and detailing, in some 50 articles, a list of basic rights. The draft also determines in painstaking detail what functions -- like issuing visas or establishing rules on immigration -- will go to the European Union headquarters in Brussels and what others -- like taxation, foreign policy and defense -- will remain with member states. 
 All 25 current members of the European Union must ratify the draft for it to take effect; nine countries already have, Austria, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. All ratified it by parliamentary vote. Spain, however, had a nonbinding referendum, followed by parliamentary ratification. 
 But France and the Netherlands have chosen ratification by referendum. (In the Netherlands, results can be overturned by the Parliament.) The French vote is set for May 29 and the Dutch for June 1. No votes could doom the current draft and, with many states probably not willing to go through the long, politically fraught process of rewriting the text, the European Union would run under the existing rules indefinitely. The referendum campaigns have unleashed powerful emotions in France and the Netherlands that are often only loosely connected, if at all, to the actual constitutional text. The fears seem almost as varied as the people expressing them: from the worry among the Dutch that their liberal practices regarding private drug use and gay marriage will be eroded, to anxieties that uncontrolled immigration is destroying the Dutch quality of life, to an almost aesthetic distaste for the draft constitution's establishment of a European anthem, based on Beethoven's ''Ode to Joy,'' and a European national holiday.
 ''How can you create a constitution for a nonentity?'' said Leon de Winter, a Dutch filmmaker and political commentator who is a leading opponent of ratification. He was expressing a sentiment common in the Netherlands -- that a Europe stretching from Portugal to Ukraine and likely to include Muslim Turkey is a kind of illusion, a figment of the bureaucratic imagination with very little in the way of a unifying purpose or a unifying vision. 
 ''I don't want Europe to be a unified power,'' Mr. de Winter said. ''I don't want Europe to have a foreign minister, or to be a competitor for power with the United States.'' 
 To a great extent in France and the Netherlands, the possibility of a no vote is closely linked to the unpopularity of the governments in power -- that of President Jacques Chirac in France and an unwieldy three-party coalition in the Netherlands whose approval rating is a dismal 20 percent or so. 
 In France, in addition, the constitution has provoked a powerful fear that the European project is a sort of back door for what is called ''liberalism,'' or ''ultraliberalism,'' meaning liberalism in the European sense of Anglo-American style free-market economics, which, many people contend, would strip away social protections and raise already high levels of unemployment.
 ''The no camp has linked the constitution to the idea that Europe is unsocial and liberal,'' Mr. Cohn-Bendit said. ''So they think, if you smash the constitution, you smash liberalism, and this emotion runs very deep in the French population.''
 A few weeks ago, Mr. Chirac held a widely watched televised discussion about the constitution with a group of 18-to 30-year-olds, in which he seemed taken aback by the conviction, as one of the young people put it, that ''the text follows a liberal logic.'' Mr. Chirac did his best to convince his young fellow citizens that a no vote would usher in the very savage capitalism they feared, but the latest polls in France, published in Le Monde a week before the referendum, showed the no camp holding 53 percent of the vote, though the high percentage of undecideds made a firm prediction of the outcome impossible. 
 In the Netherlands, an old trading nation, there is little of the fear of ''ultraliberalism'' that predominates in the no camp in France, but more a sense that the rapid expansion of Europe well beyond its original core will contribute to what is widely perceived as a deterioration of the quality of life. The greatest fear seems to be that Dutch immigration policy will be controlled by unelected European Union bureaucrats in Brussels, rather than by local leaders who can be held to account. The prospect of Turkish membership in this sense is a big issue in the Netherlands, which was shocked deeply over the murder last year of the filmmaker Theo van Gogh by an Islamic fanatic. Now, public figures move around with teams of bodyguards. 
 ''The political elites told us that the multicultural thing would be an enrichment, but most people have seen the reality -- unemployment, ethnic ghettos, high criminality and the rise of radical Islam,'' Mr. de Winter said. ''So there's a basic feeling that we don't believe what our politicians tell us.'' 
 Meanwhile, in the past couple of weeks the pro-constitution camp has been jolted by revelations in the Dutch news media that a decade ago when the Netherlands switched to the euro, the common European currency, the Dutch guilder was undervalued by about 10 percent. This has produced a movement, led by a group's Internet campaign, to sue the government for damages. The group says it has received 6,000 pledges of about $65 each in its first few days of existence. 
 Anticonstitution campaigners, like Geert Wilders, a maverick populist member of Parliament and a leading anti-immigration campaigner, have toured the country to warn that the Dutch will lose control of their own borders. Mr. Wilders's campaign slogan is ''The Netherlands Must Stay,'' meaning that in an ever larger, ever more bureaucratic Europe, it will disappear.
 But proponents of the constitution like Mr. Bot make the opposite point, namely that a small country like the Netherlands is more vulnerable to uncontrolled immigration under the present system than under a future one.
 ''I have to remind people that if you say no, the E.U. doesn't cease to exist,'' he said. And under the present system, any country can admit any number of immigrants, as Spain recently did when it accepted some 700,000 previously illegal immigrants, and those immigrants can then move freely to any of the 25 member states. The new constitution would in essence, Mr. Bot contends, prevent Spain or any other country from determining the immigration risks of every other country. 
 ''The Netherlands is one of the founding fathers and a country with a very open economy and a very vulnerable one,'' Mr. Bot said. ''We cannot afford to say no. So I say to people: 'If you vote no in order to ventilate, you'll bring harm to yourself. You have to be seen as a team player in Europe and to understand the nature of the times in which you live.'''

BYLINE: By ERICA REX. 
Erica Rex received a National Magazine Award for fiction for ''The Novitiate,'' a short story published in The North American Review.

 BODY:
THEIR voices wake me from sleep. Although it is the middle of the night, light from the street has bathed my room in hazy half dawn, so at first I am disoriented, unclear of where I am, or who or what is causing the racket. For a moment, I think I'm still in North Fork, the town in the Sierra Nevada foothills in California I left three months before with both my 10-year marriage and my writing career in shambles. But at this moment I am unsure of where I am. I imagine a clear night under a full moon, and there's a raccoon in the yellow pine outside the window snarling at some foe. Maybe a bear has come down from the high country in search of food. It has been a dry year, and forage is scarce. Then the voices from outside the window jolt me awake.
 Male voices are cussing in high decibels. Profanities roll off their tongues as easily as nursery rhymes lilt from the mouths of preschoolers. Their conversation would have earned any child in North Fork a long trip to the woodshed. 
 Laughter. Hawking, spitting. Cigarette smoke wafts into my room. It is night, late spring, and the air in Brooklyn already feels hot and still, foreign and oppressive. I am actually sleeping naked, which ordinarily I never do. In the heat and humidity, I can't tolerate the feeling of a nightgown against my skin. Music from a bar across the street twaddles out plaintively like a lost child. I live on the ground floor of a prewar brick building in Bay Ridge. A group of teenage boys are leaning against the wall of my building beside my window, smoking and shooting the breeze. I turn on the light beside my bed, thinking that perhaps if they know I'm here, awake, and listening, they will go away. They don't budge.
 The clock beside my bed reads 2:30. There are more exclamations; someone begins recounting a tall tale about scoring. I'm not sure whether he means drugs, sex or basketball.
 I have lived in this apartment in Brooklyn only a few months. Since I didn't know better when I rented it from a long distance away, while I was still in California, I had no idea of how far Bay Ridge was from Manhattan, at least as far as public transportation was concerned. ''It's on the R train,'' the young woman I rented it from said cheerfully over the phone. ''The R is only three blocks from the apartment. Very convenient.''
 The R train, I quickly learned, is anything but convenient. The station is close enough, but the subway has a life of its own. The R train, which takes over an hour to actually deliver me to any Manhattan destination, if it comes at all, has become one of the major preoccupations of my new life. Subways in general, I discovered, are a kind of force of nature in the city. They are to New York what the weather was back home. People here discuss trains and the vicissitudes of trains more than any other topic, including politics and unemployment.
 Will the train be on time? How much time should I allow to get someplace I haven't been before? Will I be able to transfer to the express at Atlantic Avenue without having to wait another hour?
 Then there are the unexpected stoppages. And to make public transportation really challenging, there are night and weekend schedules involving route switches and track changes, the likes of which only a select few with special powers of divination can interpret.
 As a result, living in Bay Ridge does me about as much good in terms of engaging myself with the cultural life of the city as living in North Fork, which is an entire continent away. At this moment, however, the train is not my problem. I get out of bed, put on my robe, and walk toward the window. I clear my throat a few times to signify my approach, then pull open the blind. In the woods, nights are silent except for the occasional owl's hoot, or coyotes barking and yipping to one another across the ridge. In the woods, a small amount of noise and light will generally drive away loitering wildlife. In Bay Ridge, this is not the case: New Yorkers are so accustomed to noise and light, I wonder sometimes how they would function without it.
 A group of young men, perhaps five or six, dressed in baggy pants slung so low over their hips I can see a pierced navel or two, are standing nearby. Some are leaning against the building, some against street lamps. Their heads are covered with what looks like knotted ends of black pantyhose. Their lips and noses are decorated with multiple piercings. They wear high-top tennis shoes and socks; T-shirts embossed with logos and emblems denoting mysterious alliances, although I can't begin to guess what they might be. One of the boys notices me, and their voices gradually quaver into silence. One spits into the gutter and looks the other way, down the street toward the water.
 ''UM,'' I say, ''boys, would you, um, mind moving across the street? You see, my bedroom is right here, and I'm trying to sleep.'' One of them starts to say something; another cuts him off. 
 ''We didn't realize you were there, ma'am,'' the second one says. He is a tall, dark, heavyset youth of about 16. His black stocking cap is knotted at the crown like a little nylon beanie. ''We'll be going. Sorry to disturb you.''
 Casually, the others begin to move as well. They pull themselves away from the wall slowly, as though they were made of taffy and the heat was gluing their backs to the brick. They move off down the street toward Shore Road, lumbering slowly, casually, like bears in the high country, confident in the knowledge that no matter what they do, or what incursions into their territory they might tolerate, they still own the place. They may cede ground now and then, but me, I'm just renting.

HEADLINE: Laura Bush Backs Women In Mideast

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH

DATELINE: SOUTH SHUNA, Jordan, May 21 

 BODY:
Laura Bush called for increased attention to women's rights in the Middle East on Saturday, the second day of a good-will mission to the region. 
 The first lady, speaking to business and political leaders at the World Economic Forum in this town on the Dead Sea, highlighted education and women's rights as central to fostering democracy in the Middle East, a major theme of the Bush administration. 
 Women have enjoyed ''extraordinary progress'' in recent months, she said, especially in Kuwait, where they won the right to vote earlier this month, and Lebanon, where they protested the Syrian presence there alongside men. 
 ''Women who have not won these rights are watching,'' she said. ''They are calling on the conscience of their countrymen, making it clear that if the right to vote is to have any meaning, it cannot be limited only to men.'' 
 Mrs. Bush is on a five-day tour of the Middle East. 
 Her comments on Saturday coincided with the release of a comparative assessment of women's rights in the Middle East by the American-based group Freedom House, which describes itself as a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization working for the expansion of democracy. 
 The organization's assessment sought to explain the causes and consequences of sex-based discrimination in the region. The organization says its study, paid for by the Department of State's Middle East Partnership Initiative, is the most comprehensive look at women's rights in 17 Arab countries. The study ranks countries on the rights and freedoms they offer women. 
 Of the 17 countries studied, all but Saudi Arabia have constitutions mandating the equality of women, but basic criminal, family and labor laws are consistently skewed against women, researchers found. None of the countries has a law declaring domestic violence a crime, and there are no efforts to inform women of the laws that do exist to protect them, said Sameena Nazir, director of the survey and a senior research coordinator at Freedom House. 
 ''We took care to make this a useful tool for women,'' Ms. Nazir said. ''It's not just another study to put on the shelf.''

HEADLINE: For a Frail Old Tenement, A Fortifying Dose of Goop

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
A year ago, owners of condominium apartments at 241 Eldridge Street heard dire news. Cavities were forming within the brick walls of their century-old tenement, so much so that the place was held up largely by inertia. 
 Scott Henson, an architect whose Manhattan firm is restoring the building, offered residents two options. They could spend $1.4 million dismantling and rebuilding the decrepit walls, while protecting their apartments temporarily with wallboard and tarpaulins, or they could try a less invasive and less costly stabilization technique that had never before been used in the United States. 
 After examining sheaves of test reports and letters from scientists and engineers, residents voted unanimously to go with the avant-garde solution, even though it called for pumping the walls full of gray goop.
 ''We investigated enough to put our faith in it,'' said Robin Schanzenbach, president of the condo board. ''We've felt we're totally on the cutting edge.''
 The milky chemical, whose official name is micro injection grout, is manufactured by a German company called Jahn International, and its formula is secret. From Feb. 9 to April 22, construction crews drilled 1,435 holes into the building and pumped in 1,280 gallons of the mixture. Final price tag: $106,000. 
 The grout filled crannies between bricks, where mortar had been crumbling into dust, and it set in half an hour. It also sometimes made a mess. A dozen times it spilled onto apartment window sills or floors, but, as David Bergman, an architect who has lived in the building since 1995, pointed out, ''It cleans up very easily, with paper towels and 409 or Fantastik.'' 
 The Jahn product, which has been commonplace in Europe for 30 years, has been imported into the United States since the 1980's for small repair jobs, said Dennis Rude, chief executive of the distributor, Cathedral Stone Products. But Mr. Henson is the first customer to apply it to an entire building. 
 ''It's a drastic solution,'' said Norman Weiss, a professor of historic preservation at Columbia University. ''It's also a very exciting project. The idea could be applied to hundreds, maybe thousands of buildings that have problems the owners don't know about yet, or problems that have been covered with superficial repairs -- that's like putting makeup on what turns out to be melanoma.''
 The Eldridge Street building, a neo-Renaissance style structure, was built in 1904, but although the masons apparently lavished care on the facade, which is trimmed in terra-cotta scrollwork, they skimped elsewhere. By the 1970's the structure was abandoned, condemned and used as a drug den. A gallery owner, Nicholas Logsdail, bought the blackened shell from the city, and a veterinarian, Mary Finger, moved in and rebuilt it as condominiums. Her own 1,000-square-foot loft is listed for sale at $859,000. 
 Next door, at 245 Eldridge Street, stands a rental building that is a twin of No. 241. Its rear and side walls are coated with gray weatherproof stucco, and show signs of cracking and sagging. Catherine Economakis, a managing agent for the building with Granite International Management, did not return calls seeking comment on the condition of the brickwork. Mr. Henson said: ''We don't want to scare anybody, but we assume conditions in those walls are the same as here.'' EVE M. KAHN

HEADLINE: Kaifeng's Warning for America.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: KAIFENG, China 

 BODY:
As this millennium dawns, New York City is the most important city in the world, the unofficial capital of planet Earth. But before we New Yorkers become too full of ourselves, it might be worthwhile to glance at dilapidated Kaifeng in central China.
 Kaifeng, an ancient city along the mud-clogged Yellow River, was by far the most important place in the world in 1000. And if you've never heard of it, that's a useful warning for Americans -- as the Chinese headline above puts it, in a language of the future that many more Americans should start learning, ''glory is as ephemeral as smoke and clouds.'' 
 As the world's only superpower, America may look today as if global domination is an entitlement. But if you look back at the sweep of history, it's striking how fleeting supremacy is, particularly for individual cities.
 My vote for most important city in the world in the period leading up to 2000 B.C. would be Ur, Iraq. In 1500 B.C., perhaps Thebes, Egypt. There was no dominant player in 1000 B.C., though one could make a case for Sidon, Lebanon. In 500 B.C., it would be Persepolis, Persia; in the year 1, Rome; around A.D. 500, maybe Changan, China; in 1000, Kaifeng, China; in 1500, probably Florence, Italy; in 2000, New York City; and in 2500, probably none of the above.
 Today Kaifeng is grimy and poor, not even the provincial capital and so minor it lacks even an airport. Its sad state only underscores how fortunes change. In the 11th century, when it was the capital of Song Dynasty China, its population was more than one million. In contrast, London's population then was about 15,000.
 An ancient 17-foot painted scroll, now in the Palace Museum in Beijing, shows the bustle and prosperity of ancient Kaifeng. Hundreds of pedestrians jostle each other on the streets, camels carry merchandise in from the Silk Road, and teahouses and restaurants do a thriving business.
 Kaifeng's stature attracted people from all over the world, including hundreds of Jews. Even today, there are some people in Kaifeng who look like other Chinese but who consider themselves Jewish and do not eat pork.
 As I roamed the Kaifeng area, asking local people why such an international center had sunk so low, I encountered plenty of envy of New York. One man said he was arranging to be smuggled into the U.S. illegally, by paying a gang $25,000, but many local people insisted that China is on course to bounce back and recover its historic role as world leader.
 ''China is booming now,'' said Wang Ruina, a young peasant woman on the outskirts of town. ''Give us a few decades and we'll catch up with the U.S., even pass it.''
 She's right. The U.S. has had the biggest economy in the world for more than a century, but most projections show that China will surpass us in about 15 years, as measured by purchasing power parity. 
 So what can New York learn from a city like Kaifeng?
 One lesson is the importance of sustaining a technological edge and sound economic policies. Ancient China flourished partly because of pro-growth, pro-trade policies and technological innovations like curved iron plows, printing and paper money. But then China came to scorn trade and commerce, and per capita income stagnated for 600 years.
 A second lesson is the danger of hubris, for China concluded it had nothing to learn from the rest of the world -- and that was the beginning of the end.
 I worry about the U.S. in both regards. Our economic management is so lax that we can't confront farm subsidies or long-term budget deficits. Our technology is strong, but American public schools are second-rate in math and science. And Americans' lack of interest in the world contrasts with the restlessness, drive and determination that are again pushing China to the forefront. 
 Beside the Yellow River I met a 70-year-old peasant named Hao Wang, who had never gone to a day of school. He couldn't even write his name -- and yet his progeny were different.
 ''Two of my grandsons are now in university,'' he boasted, and then he started talking about the computer in his home. 
 Thinking of Kaifeng should stimulate us to struggle to improve our high-tech edge, educational strengths and pro-growth policies. For if we rest on our laurels, even a city as great as New York may end up as Kaifeng-on-the-Hudson.

HEADLINE: Off Base

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE KORB. 
Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense, is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a senior adviser to the Center for Defense Information.

 BODY:
THE residents of eastern Long Island and their elected representatives are understandably pleased that Francis S. Gabreski Airport, home to New York's Air National Guard's 106th Rescue Wing, was not on the list of bases that the Pentagon would like to close. After all, the base in Westhampton Beach employs a little more than 1,200 people and contributes about $100 million to the Long Island economy. 
 The decision to save Gabreski -- which was the subject of a $3 million lobbying effort led by Gov. George E. Pataki -- may be good for Suffolk County's economy in the short run. But the Pentagon's decision -- and I say this as someone who grew up in the region -- is not in the best interests of the country or the state, or even Long Island. Here's why. 
 The Base Realignment and Closure Commission was instituted two decades ago because the Pentagon was wasting about $20 billion annually maintaining more than 200 major bases that were no longer relevant to the military. From 1988 to 1995, the Pentagon was able to close 97 major bases and restructure 55 others for an annual savings of $7.3 billion. 
 But going into this latest round of base closings, the Pentagon still had at least 100 major bases that it no longer needed, but that were costing it around $10 billion a year. 
 The list prepared this month calls for closing only 33 major bases and cutting back another 29. The Pentagon claims this will eventually result in annual savings of $5.5 billion, and $48.8 billion over 20 years. But although many analysts think that this estimate is exaggerated, even if it is correct there are still at least 60 bases that are no longer needed and cost the taxpayer about $5 billion a year. Gabreski alone costs at least $50 million a year. 
 In deciding which bases to keep open, the Pentagon was supposed to give priority to bases that house more than one unit. Gabreski is home to a single unit, the 106th Rescue Wing, an elite search-and-rescue team that was depicted in ''The Perfect Storm.'' The Pentagon, meanwhile, is recommending the closing of the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, one of the other four bases in New York that house Air National Guard units, which is home to two units, the 914th Air Lift Wing and the 107th Air Refueling Wing. 
 Moreover, the Pentagon will need to spend a lot just to bring Gabreski up to minimum standards. For example, Gabreski has only 28 percent of the space it's supposed to have for its parachute rescue operations. Paradoxically, Congress allotted Niagara more than $14 million last year for upgrades. 
 Finally, had Gabreski been closed, its operations could easily have been moved to the Stewart Air Base in Newburgh, N.Y., thus keeping jobs from going out of state. The operations in Niagara, however, will be dispersed to places like Arkansas, Maine and Virginia. 
 While military value rather than economic impact is supposed to be the main criterion, the decision to close a base is supposed to take economic impact into account. While Gabreski generates about $100 million for Long Island's economy, Niagara generates more than $150 million. 
 Moreover, Suffolk County is better positioned than Niagara to absorb the cutbacks. The unemployment rate in Niagara is one-third higher than Suffolk and the poverty rate is almost twice as high. The median household income and average cost of housing in Niagara, on the other hand, are only about half those of Suffolk. 
 While keeping Gabreski open will no doubt have short-term benefits for the Long Island economy, in the long run, it would be better for its economy if that land were in the hands of the private sector. For example, Lowry Air Force Base in Denver, which was closed in 1994, has generated about $4 billion in economic activity, including $1.1 billion from housing and commercial property construction. 
 Similarly, in Charleston, S.C., the 1,400-acre shipyard along the Copper River that closed in 1993 has turned into a beehive of commercial and residential activities. Unlike Niagara, Westhampton Beach could easily emulate Denver and Charleston. 
 The list submitted by the Pentagon is only the first step in the base closing and realignment process. The nonpartisan commission will analyze the list and add or subtract as appropriate. In the previous four rounds, the commission has accepted 85 percent of the Pentagon's recommendations, but has added as well as subtracted bases from the list. It should take a close look at Niagara and Gabreski.

WHAT LINCOLN BELIEVED
The Values and Convictions of
America's Greatest President.
By Michael Lind.
358 pp. Doubleday.
$27.95.
 ''IN 1863,'' Michael Lind begins, ''the democratic republic as a form of government was rare -- and in danger of extinction.'' He then looks around the world at the governmental forms prevalent in that year. This seems an odd way to start a study of Abraham Lincoln, but such indirection is Lind's way of saying: if you want to read my book, you're going to have to do it my way. Happily, Lind is not just demanding; he is intellectually bold and an enthusiastic researcher. In large doses, ''What Lincoln Believed'' can get claustrophobic. But taken a little at a time and in a generous spirit, it will almost certainly change the way you think about America and one of its greatest presidents.
 Among the world's ruling classes, Lind shows, opinion was running against democracy in 1863. Republics had been coming and going since the French Revolution, but mostly they had been going, and it looked possible that the form might soon be gone. For Lincoln, ''government of the people, by the people, for the people,'' as he put it in his speech at Gettysburg, was the essential promise of the American Revolution and of the United States. If the Union could be pulled through this civil war, democracy might endure. If the Union fell, democracy might fall with it.
 This zeal to secure democratic government as a covenant for future generations, against the political tide of the times, is what Lind finds most worth celebrating in Lincoln. He calls him the Great Democrat. This picture is set against three previously prevalent images: the Great Commoner, the Savior of the Union and the Great Emancipator. 
 The first of these was part of Lincoln's own electoral mythology: the rail-splitter, studying by firelight, pressing ever forward with Midwestern grit. The Savior of the Union was, of course, a wartime image, but one grandly reasserted later in the 19th century as part of the effort to reconcile white Americans north and south. Lincoln the Great Emancipator, having been born in the last days of the war, went into a long hibernation as white Southern tribalism achieved its partial victory in the decades of racial segregation. This Lincoln re-emerged with the civil rights movement.
 Each of these stereotypes provides something like an anvil on which Lind hammers out his own ideas. Most of the pounding is at the expense of the Great Commoner and the Great Emancipator. Lincoln was a ''Henry Clay Whig,'' Lind explains: ''Henry Clay's plan for the American nation-state combined an industrial economy created by Hamiltonian methods'' -- that is, using protectionist tariffs and government spending to promote manufacturing and shrink the economic role of raw-material producers, mainly farmers -- ''with a white-only society created by Jeffersonian racial policies. His disciple Abraham Lincoln adopted Clay's entire nation-building program as his own.'' This was a democracy of aspiration, not mundane contentment; part of what made the commoner deserving of social honor was his desire to be uncommon. 
 Such a democracy had to grow, as its work was never done -- and this thrilling, nerve-racking growth came with the glow of destiny. ''But for the difference in habit of observation,'' Lincoln once wondered aloud, ''why did Yankees, almost instantly, discover gold in California, which had been trodden upon, and overlooked, by Indians and Mexican greasers, for centuries?'' As his language suggests, Lincoln saw American destiny as white. 
 For most readers today, Lincoln's protectionism and his promotion of cities will probably be more surprising than his casual (not theoretical) racism, or his belief that whites and blacks should be forever kept apart. After all, Lind is building on the ample work of W. E. B. Du Bois, Eugene H. Berwanger and Lerone Bennett Jr. -- and many others, although Lind's footnotes could have been more thorough than they are. By now it is, or should be, reasonably common knowledge that Lincoln, like Clay and a number of other leading antebellum American statesmen, believed sincerely in the mad project of resettling blacks, and in particular freemen, in warmer, more distant climes to create a white America.
 As Lind notes, the Free Soil movement so crucial to Lincoln's achieving the presidency was closely related to the colonization movement that preceded it. Both were concerned with sparing white workers from having to compete with black ones, initially in the newer states of the Midwest and then as far as California. A decisive portion of the population that settled these places came from the white lower classes of the South, people whose route upward was blocked by slave-owning Bourbons and whose route downward looked very like a descent, by degrees, into blackness. 
 Such were the Lincoln forebears who moved into Illinois. In 1856, according to one source cited by Lind, about half the number of people who had left the South had settled in Illinois and Indiana. As Lincoln said in the 1850's, ''Is it not rather our duty to make labor more respectable by preventing all black competition, especially in the territories?'' He went on to warn that if slavery were allowed to spread, ''Negro equality will be abundant, as every white laborer will have occasion to regret when he is elbowed from his plow or his anvil by slave niggers.''
 What might have been seen as separate questions -- the extension of black slavery and the existence of black people in America -- were rendered as one, because free black laborers, not just black slaves, were also expected to ''degrade'' white labor. Lind amply demonstrates Lincoln's acceptance of this view, though he fails to ask the obvious question: Was wage competition from blacks a reality, or likely to become one? 
 This failure seems odd, especially since the periodic fanning of white lower-class fears of degradation would be a feature of postbellum political life. Besides, a sizable prewar Southern literature argued that racial slavery for blacks was the only alternative to eventual wage slavery, under industrialization, for a great many whites. The tormented relationship of racial and economic bondage both predated the war and continued well beyond it.
 Lind argues that while Lincoln did preserve the Union, his deep wish to advance democracy went unrealized. ''The amount of the earth's territory controlled by Western empires,'' he writes, ''expanded from 35 percent in 1800 to 67 percent in 1878 and then to 85 percent in 1914.'' Lincoln's hopes of defending the best of the 18th century against the worst of the 19th were borne out only ''in the middle of the 20th century in a way he could not have expected. The principles of the post-1945 world order enshrined in the U.N. Charter, the U.N. organization and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are those of the 18th-century American and French tradition of liberal republicanism.''
 By looking at Lincoln from many angles, Lind makes an already somewhat mysterious president still more puzzling and more interesting. But the Great Democrat image that closes his book doesn't really bring it all together. Lind evidently hoped to do an end run around Lincoln's detractors by erecting a previously unnoticed new Lincoln, one ruled by a passion for republicanism. This puts the emphasis on Lincoln's character rather than on what he did with his life. It's an approach that may serve our need for heroes. But Lincoln's legacy to us is in what he did, not who he was, a distinction Lincoln himself seemed to appreciate -- which was and is part of his continuing fascination.

HEADLINE: Flight to Quality Cuts Yields

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
WHILE there are several explanations for the surprising drop in Treasury yields in the last two weeks, the one cited most often has been what fixed-income traders call a flight to quality.
 That happens when investors want protection from some negative event that has occurred or one that may be around the corner. Concerns about some unexpected, significant losses in the hedge fund world have been bubbling up since Standard & Poor's cut the credit rating of General Motors and Ford Motor to junk bond, or high-yield, status on May 5. 
 The ''quality'' in the Treasury market is centered in Treasury bills and the two-year note. That is because shorter-term Treasury securities have smaller losses when interest rates rise. 
 The yield on the Treasury's six-month bill was 3.17 percent on Friday, down from 3.19 percent on Friday, May 6. The yield is also just above the 3.16 on May 2, the day before Federal Reserve policy makers announced their most recent quarter-point increase in their short-term interest rate benchmark, the fed funds rate, which they raised to 3 percent.
 Another way to look at this is using the spread, or difference, between the fed funds rate and, in this example, the two-year note. On May 2, the spread was 88 basis points. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
 Now that spread has narrowed to 66 basis points, which means that the two-year note has held its own, although the fed funds rate has risen 25 basis points.
 This rush to safety has also benefited the Treasury's 10-year note, whose yield was down to 4.12 percent on Friday, from 4.26 percent on May 6. But there is much less safety in holding these securities because the loss in principal from a sudden reversal in interest rates would be much larger.
 ''This is not a risk-averse trade; it is risk-seeking trade,'' said Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP.
 So why is money flowing into the 10-year note? Mr. Crandall said it was because the fall in shorter-term rates would trigger a ''sympathetic'' drop in the yield of the 10-year note. And traders care mostly about direction, rather than fundamentals.
 ''Traders know this is the way the 10-year note behaves,'' Mr. Crandall said. ''So short-term money goes into it.''

FED SPEAK -- On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve will release the minutes from the May 3 meeting of Fed policy makers. Investors, as usual, will troll for nuances in language and tone that could clarify how worried policy makers are about inflation and when they might drop their promise to raise rates at a measured pace.
 But it is not clear if anything at all will be said about the surprising mistake Fed officials made in the statement they released after that May 3 meeting -- leaving out a sentence that said ''longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.''
 The amending of the statement, which came about an hour and 40 minutes after the original 2:15 p.m. release, could turn up in an addendum to the minutes if there was an official communication among policy makers about the mistake. But some Fed watchers think it is more likely that the affair will not be mentioned.
 The absence of the sentence had investors thinking that the central bank was suddenly more worried about price pressures, sending interest rates higher. The correction revised that thinking.
 When the original statement was released, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell immediately but modestly. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.21 percent from 4.19 percent. 
 After the announcement of the correction, the yield fell quickly to 4.15 percent and the price jumped. That sudden swing, though not large, cost big-time traders real money.

DATA WATCH -- The report on orders for durable goods, which is due Wednesday, is expected to show a rise of 1.3 percent in April, after a drop of 2.3 percent in March, according to Bloomberg News. New home sales are forecast to have fallen 6.9 percent to an annual rate of 1.33 million.
 But economists expect that the better-than-expected trade data for March, which reflected stronger exports and weaker imports, will lead to an upward revision in overall economic growth in the first quarter. The new forecast is for 3.6 percent growth at an annual rate, up from the 3.1 percent reported when the first reading was issued in April.

HEADLINE: Coming Soon: A Theater Near You 

BYLINE: By STEPHEN WELLS

 BODY:
THE arts are often a study in paradox.
 It was only two years ago that arts institutions in New Jersey were in crisis, with state financing radically stripped by Gov. James E. McGreevey, only to be largely restored after public outcry. 
 At the same time this drama was playing itself out, various sources -- some of them public -- were committing tens of millions of dollars to build and renovate performing arts sites around the state.
 As a result, a steady stream of theaters and arts centers are opening, or are still being built at a rate that becomes difficult to count on two hands. Gleaming new structures and detailed blueprints illustrate the trend. 
 They include the $16 million, 350-seat Two River Theater in Red Bank, which opened this month, the $11.5 million, 431-seat Concert Hall at Drew University in Madison, which opened in February, and the $15 million South Orange Performing Arts Center, expected to open by next summer. 
 Several factors have prompted the renovation and creation of new spaces, even as the state has weathered an economic downturn and even though statistics indicate that over the last three years, theater attendance has dipped 12 percent. 
 Many of these projects have been fueled by donors, even as individual and corporate contributions for annual operating expenses at many institutions have remained level or in a few cases declined. Ralph Fylstra, a partner in Fylstra Wright and Company, an accounting firm based in Hawthorne whose clients include several professional theaters across the state, said he believed that there is one simple reason people often prefer to donate to a physical structure than to an organization's general expenses.
 ''It's tangible,'' he said. ''People like to see their money.''
 For Robert Rechnitz, it goes deeper than that. Mr. Rechnitz, who was a professor of American literature at Monmouth College in West Long Branch for 35 years, amassed considerable wealth through an investment he made early in his career, he said. By the time he retired in 1996, he had the means to freely pursue his love of the arts. 
 He founded the Two River Theater Company in the mid-1990's and became its executive producer, hiring a staff that transformed it into one of the state's more respected nonprofit theater companies. All that was missing was a theater they could call their own. Mr. Rechnitz recalls that as he and his wife, Joan, considered building one, he thought: ''Hey, man, you're running out of time. Take the shot or forget about it.'' 
 He decided to take the shot, financing much of the $16 million project himself. Very little expense was spared, or detail overlooked. 
 For example, the mechanical units for the theater's heating and air-conditioning systems are housed in a separate structure, connected to the theater building by pipes with rubber gaskets to prevent any undesirable noise from filtering in, said the principal architect, Stewart Jones, a Maplewood resident who is currently a partner in Meyer/Gifford/Jones, based in Manhattan.
 Similar highly sophisticated considerations have gone into the design of the Concert Hall at Drew University, which had sizable donations as well. 
 Thomas H. Kean, the former New Jersey governor who has been the school's president for 15 years, a post he will be relinquishing this summer, is generally acknowledged to be the driving force behind the complex that houses the concert hall, the 83,000-square-foot Dorothy Young Center for the Arts. The first two-thirds of the center, which includes theater arts and fine arts, opened in early 2003, but more financing was needed for the music wing. Mr. Kean secured a $5 million grant for the concert hall from the state's Economic Development Authority. Contributions to cover the rest of the cost then began falling into place.
 Though the concert hall is on the campus of a private university, the state's contribution ensures that it will be home to many non-student events and will serve as a showplace for professional artists. The New Jersey Symphony Orchestra has already played there, and according to its general manager, Susan Stucker, found the space ideal.
 Two other construction projects that benefited from individual aid were the Berlind Theater, which opened at the McCarter Theater Center in 2003, and the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University, which opened in October. Roger Berlind, a Princeton graduate and Broadway producer, shared the $14.1 million cost for the 360-seat theater equally with the university and McCarter itself, which raised its share from 1,560 individual contributors. The $27 million construction cost of the 499-seat Kasser Theater was covered by a combination of university bonds and private donations.
 Many of the current rebuilding and construction projects have gained favor -- and financial backing -- because they are expected to provide an economic boost to their towns. Karen Francini, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, described arts construction as ''critical to helping revitalize our downtowns.'' She added that the arts are a key factor in attracting private investment. 
 The $3.2 million renovation of the Brook Arts Center, scheduled for completion by the end of the year, is seen as one of the catalysts for revitalization. The center first opened in 1927 as a vaudeville house, and was operating as a single-screen movie theater when Hurricane Floyd ravaged it, and much of downtown Bound Brook, in September 1999.
 Local officials drew up plans for a $3.2 million renovation of the Brook after a Federal Emergency Management Agency report on the disaster mentioned that an ''arts incubator'' would benefit the area. The United States Economic Development Administration committed 80 percent of the cost, and the remainder came from local and state funds. 
 Downtown South Orange's redevelopment is what spurred a federal contribution to the South Orange Performing Arts Center, which has been in the planning stages since 1995. The federal government is contributing an annual $250,000 Community Development Block Grant, which the village president, William Calabrese, says is enough to meet the principal and interest payments on the bond taken out to cover the cost of construction.
 The South Orange center not only will have a 415-seat space for live performances, but it will also have five movie theaters and a large ballroom. Mr. Calabrese said the goal was for the movie theaters and ballroom to produce enough income for the operation to be self-sustaining after it opens next summer.
 The State Theater in New Brunswick drew on a entirely different form of public financing for its interior restoration, completed last fall; the state's historical preservation fund paid the entire $3 million needed to return the structure to its original vaudeville-house glory. Even where a downtown revitalization is not needed, a thriving arts entity significantly benefits local and regional businesses. A 2003 economic impact study conducted by the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey indicates that the theater generated $2.7 million a year for the economy in and around Madison. 
 In addition to the potential benefits that a new structure will have for the community, many organizers of such projects hope that it will attract more patrons, and thus more than offset any increased operational expenses. If history is any indicator, there is substance to this line of reasoning. When the Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey in Madison opened its fully renovated F.M. Kirby Shakespeare Theater in 1998, the number of subscribers doubled, its gross box office receipts rose by more than 50 percent and its total attendance grew by more than 40 percent. 
 Despite all the benefits a new facility can generate, the supply of capital is not endless, and it is not unusual for high-profile projects to still be scrambling to raise the final piece of the capital cost during the advanced stages of construction or even after their completion. 
 At Drew, one of the key figures involved in pursuing sources for the final $1.5 million still needed is Ron Ross, the university's vice president for development. Garyth Nair, a music professor at Drew and conductor of its orchestra and chorale, recalled a conversation with Mr. Ross a while back in which Mr. Ross suggested that the university would name the concert hall for the donor who contributes the final $1.5 million. 
 ''As long as it isn't Chuck E. Cheese,'' Mr. Nair responded.
 ''Look, if Chuck E. Cheese wants to give us one and a half million dollars,'' Mr. Ross shot back, ''we'll call it the Charles Fromage.''

HEADLINE: Living in a Retirement Village, Back Home With Mom and Dad

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

DATELINE: PLYMOUTH, Mass. 

 BODY:
When Elizabeth Sheeran arrived for an aerobics class here one recent morning, the jokes quickly started flying.
 ''Did you use Joan Rivers's plastic surgeon?'' asked Miriam Williams, a 64-year-old publishing consultant.
 ''Some guy really got lucky, right?'' interjected Marion Mitchell, a 67-year-old retired church office assistant.
 In a roomful of women in their 60's huffing through a Richard Simmons ''Sweatin' to the Oldies'' videotape, Ms. Sheeran, a 29-year-old graduate student, stood out as she bounced and kicked, her blonde ponytail bobbing. 
 She was not the instructor, however. Ms. Sheeran is a bona fide resident of Great Island, a retirement development near Cape Cod. In January, she moved in with her parents, Elaine and Jim Sheeran, under rules that allow younger occupants as long as at least one member of the household is 55 or older.
 Many adult children moved back into the nest in the 1990's, after being hit by layoffs and the bursting of the dot-com bubble. But in a twist on the phenomenon of extended adolescence, some sons and daughters are now sampling the leisurely lifestyles of their aging parents. Driven by skyrocketing house prices, uncertain job prospects and extended stays in higher education, some young adults figure they can save money while enjoying golf lessons, fancy clubhouses and clay tennis courts.
 ''It used to be pretty much clear when you made a transition to adulthood,'' said Stephanie Coontz, a professor of history at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., and director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families. ''You got a job, moved out of your parents' house and got married all within a period of two to three years. That has stretched out over a period of 15 years, and there is a change in that order and some backsliding.''
 Only a sliver of young adults live in retirement communities. But with the growth of age-restricted developments, it is more likely that homeward-bound adult children will land in one of them. There were 1,274 such ''active adult'' communities in 2004, six times greater than the 204 in 1995, said Bill Parks, a consultant to homebuilders who works in Scottsdale, Ariz. Many have sprung up near Boston, Chicago and New York, making it easier for the offspring of baby boomers to come home again and still keep their big-city jobs.
 Many empty-nesters bought homes with spacious lofts, extra bedrooms far removed from master suites and even free-standing guest houses, intended for friends and family reunions. But now some of those visitors are staying far beyond the weekend.
 At Great Island, a manicured subdivision about an hour's drive from Boston, the activities director, Karen Boyle, said she knew of at least 9 out of 200 families with grown children living at home. Sima Parisi, the vice president of sales at the Kokes Organization, a builder of 55-and-over communities in New Jersey, said that about 5 percent of buyers moved in with their grown children, something she rarely saw five years ago.
 The fragile economy has made it harder for young people to get lucrative jobs, while soaring house prices have made it difficult for young adults to afford to live independently. Over the past decade, housing costs have risen faster than incomes for adults younger than 25, according to Economy.com, a research company. Housing costs increased 39 percent in the United States from 1993 to 2003 for 18-to-25-year-olds, but incomes for that age group increased by only 29 percent, Economy.com said.
 A one-bedroom apartment in Boston now rents for an average of $1,834 a month, according to Northeast Apartment Advisors. In Manhattan, a one-bedroom rental averages $2,500.
 Against that economic backdrop, living with parents can look pretty attractive. Ms. Sheeran, who is training to be an elementary school teacher, paid $700 a month to share a two-bedroom apartment in Boston before she moved into a small bedroom in her parents' home in Great Island, a community developed by Del Webb, a unit of Pulte Homes, one of the country's largest builders of 55-and-over communities.
 In the decade that Ms. Sheeran lived on her own, she never had central air-conditioning, a dishwasher or a washing machine, much less the Jacuzzi bathtub she now enjoys.
 But what she has gained in amenities, she has given up in freedom. 
 ''It is frustrating, after being so independent for 10 years, to come back to 'Where are you going tonight? What time are you going to be home?''' said Ms. Sheeran, who recently spent one night at a friend's house and failed to tell her parents. She awoke to 12 missed calls from them on her cellphone.
 Mr. and Mrs. Sheeran, too, have given up the independence of empty-nesters. Because his daughter complained about the explosive whine of the coffee grinder at 5 a.m., Mr. Sheeran now grinds his beans at night. For similar noise-related reasons, Mrs. Sheeran has stopped doing laundry early in the morning or late at night.
 Still, some grown children find that they have a surprising amount in common with their parents and neighbors in the resortlike atmosphere of the retirement world. Mrs. Sheeran and her mother have gone out together for pedicures and regularly attend aerobics class together on Saturdays.
 Like her own parents, Melissa Dyl, 29, who moved with them to a retirement community developed by K. Hovnanian in Jackson, N.J., so she could work and finish college, appreciates the fact that no children younger than 19 reside there.
 ''It's kind of peaceful here,'' said Ms. Dyl, who is one of about 40 grown children living with parents in the development. ''I feel like a grouchy old woman just saying that.''
 But living in a retirement community with parents can put a crimp in one's romantic life. Brian Anderson, a 32-year-old assistant manager of a car wash, lives with his parents in Pebble Creek, a 55-and-over community near Phoenix. ''It would be kind of hard to bring a girlfriend home to Mom and Dad's house, not to mention that I'm in a gated retirement community,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''It might be a bit embarrassing.''
 The sacrifice of personal relationships can be worth it, however. Nicole Taylor, a 35-year-old technology consultant, has paid off $15,000 in student loans and credit card debt and saved $8,000 since she decided to move in with her parents in Great Island 18 months ago. Because she travels so much for her job, she barely ever saw the Boston apartment she paid $1,000 a month to share.
 ''I couldn't enjoy coming home because there was so much upkeep of the apartment and my life,'' Ms. Taylor said over a diet cola at the clubhouse on the golf course where she occasionally goes for lunch.
 Since moving in with her parents, Catherine and Edward Taylor, Ms. Taylor said she had not been dating much, but ''that has not been my focus.''
 Her father jokes that she should ''find herself a sugar daddy'' in Great Island.
 Ms. Taylor said she often found herself fighting the stigma of living with her parents. 
 ''Whenever I meet someone and tell them I live with my parents I preface it with 'Oh, but I am a consultant and I travel a lot,''' she said.
 The move has brought unexpected rewards. Ms. Taylor said she had never seen her parents so active -- her father on the golf course, her mother taking tap dancing classes and playing bridge once a week.
 ''Spending time seeing what makes them happy and sad has given me the opportunity to know them in a way that I couldn't when I was living in the city,'' she said.
 On the other hand, grown children living at home prevent some parents from enjoying their retirement. Mr. Anderson's mother still cannot help but make his bed and do his laundry. 
 ''At this point in our life, we kind of wish that we were retired in the purest sense of the word in that our children are out and about doing their own thing,'' said Bruce Anderson, his father. ''It's not terrible, just not what we were expecting to do when we retired.''
 Mr. Sheeran, Elizabeth's father, said he was ready for his daughter, who will be looking for a job when she graduates, to move out ''in a New York minute.''
 But Dorothy Williamson is in no hurry to empty out the nest. She and her husband, Alan, raised eight children between them, six from former marriages and two from their own. Kevin Forgione, Mrs. Williamson's 30-year-old son from a previous marriage, moved with the couple to Great Island last year.
 Mr. Forgione, who says he often finds himself spending nights at a bar alone in downtown Plymouth, is now planning to move to Las Vegas this fall, where his father lives. His mother is not looking forward to his departure.
 ''I think it will be quiet and sad,'' she said. ''Maybe too quiet.''

HEADLINE: It's Now Official: Florida's Fruit Is the Orange

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SARASOTA, Fla., May 21 

 BODY:
It is a safe assumption that the orange is Florida's official state fruit, right?
 After all, Florida orange juice is sold worldwide, the annual Orange Bowl brings thousands of people to the state and the fruit's image is on the state's license plates. 
And if the Legislature had time to name the zebra longwing the state's official butterfly, surely it took a moment to put King Orange on his throne.
 In fact, it took Janet Shapiro's students at Southside Elementary School here to get state officials to recognize the orange. A bill was passed this spring, and Gov. Jeb Bush signed it at the school on Friday.
 Mr. Bush said he was ''completely surprised'' that while the orange blossom is the state flower and orange juice is Florida's official beverage, the role of official fruit was vacant. Citrus generates an estimated $9.1 billion in economic activity in Florida and employs nearly 90,000 people.
 ''It's really part of our heritage,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It's more than appropriate.''
 Ms. Shapiro's class discovered the orange omission a year ago when they were fourth graders reading about school children in New Jersey who made blueberries that state's official fruit.
 The group of 17 social studies students put together a petition to give the orange its due, sent letters to lawmakers, and even wrote a song extolling the health benefits and tastiness of the fruit. Its chorus urges, ''Vote Orange!''
 Their project came too late in the 2004 legislative session to be introduced, but they persuaded lawmakers to act this spring.

 BODY:

IDEAS OF HEAVEN: A Ring of Stories, by Joan Silber. (Norton, $13.95.) These elegantly connected narratives are set in Renaissance Italy, 19th-century China and modern-day America and France, and explore love, faith and sex. A minor element in one story becomes central in another. Alice, the flighty, lonely American in ''My Shape,'' aspires to be a dancer but struggles with her body and the cruel men in her life. In ''Gaspara Stampa,'' the 16th-century Italian poet reflects on her agonizing love affairs and the art she makes of them. In the title story, a missionary's wife describes life in China in the years before the Boxer Rebellion. Silber's collection was a National Book Award finalist last year.

A CONTINENT FOR THE TAKING: The Tragedy and Hope of Africa, by Howard W. French. (Vintage, $15.) This riveting memoir recalls the upheaval in Central and West Africa in the 1990's that followed the end of apartheid in South Africa and the genocide in Rwanda. French, a senior writer and former bureau chief for The New York Times, tells compelling firsthand stories -- from the fall of Zaire's dictator Mobutu Sese Seko to Charles Taylor's arrival in Liberia -- and blames the West for much of the chaos.

BIRTH OF THE CHESS QUEEN: A History, by Marilyn Yalom. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $14.95.) Yalom, a senior scholar at Stanford's Institute for Women and Gender, has written a wide-ranging exploration of the origins of chess and of its most powerful piece, tracing the rise of female power and prestige in the Middle Ages.

DON QUIXOTE, by Miguel de Cervantes. Translated by Edith Grossman. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $16.95.) Grossman has translated much of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa, and she renders Cervantes's 400-year-old epic hero and his plain-spoken companion, Sancho Panza, in contemporary English.

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH KANSAS? How Conservatives Won the Heart of America, by Thomas Frank. (Owl/Holt, $14.) Why are there so many red states in America's heartland? Using his native Kansas as the exemplar, Frank assesses why culturally alienated blue-collar voters embrace the Republican Party, whose economic policies, he argues, do them harm. ''By all rights the people in Wichita and Shawnee and Garden City should today be flocking to the party of Roosevelt, not deserting it,'' he writes.

SOMETHING FROM THE OVEN: Reinventing Dinner in 1950s America, by Laura Shapiro. (Penguin, $15.) Shapiro revisits a dark decade in culinary history, when the food industry elbowed its way into the kitchen promoting Nescafe, Bisquick and Jell-O. This history, which our reviewer, Paul Levy, called ''deliciously readable,'' is at its best when profiling the women -- Julia Child and Poppy Cannon, among others -- whose instructive authority eventually improved home cooking.

FROM CHIVALRY TO TERRORISM: War and the Changing Nature of Masculinity, by Leo Braudy. (Vintage, $17.) Drawing on military and cultural history, Braudy outlines ''the intertwined ideas of war and masculinity since the Middle Ages.'' He argues that new conceptions of men's and women's natures have diminished the link between war and masculinity, and he sees Al Qaeda as a dying, warrior-oriented order. Our reviewer, Michael Sherry, said the book ''displays Braudy's loving immersion in his subject, fine grasp of historical complexity and aversion to glib or dogmatic judgments.''

THE BODY OF JONAH BOYD, by David Leavitt. (Bloomsbury, $13.95.) Leavitt's charmingly acerbic novel involves a psychology professor's family and his versatile secretary, a sharp-eyed narrator who provides a backstage view of domestic discord. The family's vortex of a house attracts inexplicable affection and mystery, including the disappearance of a precious manuscript in 1969.

A YEAR AT THE RACES: Reflections on Horses, Humans, Love, Money, and Luck, by Jane Smiley. (Anchor, $13.95.) Smiley, author of ''A Thousand Acres,'' has flung herself headlong into horse racing as a breeder and owner. She explores the nature of the animals' lives with emotionally candid stories about her horses and their fortunes at the track. John Jeremiah Sullivan's BLOOD HORSES: Notes of a Sportswriter's Son (Picador, $14) traces horse racing's history -- particularly that of the Kentucky Derby -- while offering a bittersweet elegy for his father.

HEADLINE: The Mazzone Touch Is More Than Just Perception

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ. 
E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The cardinal precept of statisticians, at least within the foul lines of baseball, is that one must not accept any declaration on simple faith. Never let anything breathe the air of blithe acceptance when it can be smothered in ream upon ream of data-driven analysis.
 Numbers buffs strive to examine any part of the game in which the traditionalists show unflanked confidence, even if it's just some pitching coach. Then again, this isn't just some pitching coach. This is Leo Mazzone, baseball's pitching Midas, who year after year keeps the Atlanta Braves' ever-changing pitching staff the class of the National League. 
 J.C. Bradbury, an assistant professor of economics at the University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn., has spent much of his life tuned into Braves games, watching Mazzone consistently thrive with staffs annually reworked like a map of Eastern Europe. It's happening again this year. After yet another round of major turnover, Atlanta entered the weekend with a 3.45 team earned run average, second best in the National League.
 More strikingly, Mazzone has turned so many struggling starters (Jaret Wright and John Burkett, for example) and relievers (Mike Remlinger and Chris Hammond) into coveted commodities who didn't continue their success elsewhere that Bradbury decided to peer inside the numbers.
 ''Maybe we're just remembering the success stories,'' Bradbury said, noting that he began his study suspecting that Mazzone was overrated. ''I needed to know.''
 Mazzone has had 98 Braves pitch at least 30 innings in a season during his 15 years in Atlanta. Bradbury examined the performance of each before, during and after his time with the Braves, always compensating for league, home park, age and defense so those factors did not cloud the data.
 Using multiple regression techniques, he isolated the effect of pitching under Mazzone and not. The change turned out to be even more than Bradbury expected: a decrease of 0.62 in E.R.A., essentially turning a mediocre pitcher with a 4.10 E.R.A. into a quite valuable one at 3.48. Or, as Bradbury put it, ''about the same as the Coors Field effect in the opposite direction.''
 A perfect illustration of the Mazzone Effect is Remlinger, a middle reliever with a 4.63 career E.R.A. before he pitched for the Braves from 1999 to 2002. He posted a 2.65 E.R.A. in his four Atlanta seasons, and with the Cubs it has since risen to 3.73. Even after Bradbury considered factors like Remlinger's ages as a Brave (33 to 36) and how he left a park that favors pitchers (Turner Field) for the opposite (Wrigley Field), his adjusted E.R.A. was 3.82 before Mazzone, 3.35 during and 4.23 after.
 Starters generally benefited, too. After adjusting for the fact that they spent their prime years under Mazzone, Denny Neagle, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux still pitched considerably better with him than without him.
 Mazzone, a self-deprecating West Virginian who likes to say, ''I may get stupid real fast,'' is known for having his pitchers throw twice between starts, rather than the now conventional once. He also preaches working the outside of the plate, preferably with a changeup and a controlled fastball. The left-hander Mike Hampton, one of Mazzone's current success stories, said, ''Everyone knows it: Leo's the best.''
 That brings up the next question: How does Mazzone compare with other pitching coaches? Two students in a Tufts University experimental American studies course, the Analysis of Baseball: Statistics and Sabermetrics, pursued that matter last fall. (Such classes, usually in the applied mathematics vein, have recently cropped up at several colleges.) For their final paper, the students analyzed Mazzone's record much as Bradbury had -- with similar results -- but did not stop there.
 Peter Bendix, a freshman from Cleveland, and Matt Gallagher, a sophomore from Winchester, Mass., also examined the Yankees' Mel Stottlemyre, whose effectiveness was questioned this season by the team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner. Stottlemyre has coached for the Mets, the Astros and the Yankees since 1984. All together, Bendix and Gallagher estimated, pitchers posted E.R.A.'s 0.30 lower under Stottlemyre; with the Yankees it was 0.19.
 ''I wanted to look at pitchers' injury rates,'' Gallagher said with a sigh, ''but I had five other classes in the spring semester that weren't about baseball, unfortunately.''
 All three researchers agree that separating Mazzone's skill from that of General Manager John Schuerholz and Manager Bobby Cox is difficult; the three have formed Atlanta's brain trust since 1990. Schuerholz is surely good at identifying pitchers who will succeed under Mazzone's system, and Cox deploys them deftly during games. But given how Schuerholz and Cox defer to Mazzone on many pitching matters and credit his system with their persistent mound dominance, his impact is undeniable.
 And not unquantifiable, thanks to the number crunchers.
 ''We already knew Leo was a good pitching coach,'' Bradbury said. ''But now we really know it.''

HEADLINE: The Underground Economy: Subway Retailing

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

 BODY:
MILLIONS of people pass through the city's subway stations every day, crossing paths with small businesses selling everything from women's handbags to chewing gum. But the typical subway retail space is dark and unappealing, and serves a minimally functional purpose. 
 With the recent rehabilitation of several major subway stations, however, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is trying to create a better environment for stores and contribute to the revitalization of nearby neighborhoods. 
 The newly rehabbed Coney Island station will add 75,000 square feet of ground-level retail space that the M.T.A. will soon begin marketing to restaurants and other retailers. In Queens, 8,600 square feet of retail space is being constructed at the Jackson Heights Roosevelt Avenue stop. The M.T.A. also worked with a private developer to turn Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn into an attractive mall with almost 400,000 square feet of retail space. 
 But the most ambitious rebuilding plan centers on the Fulton Street Transit Center in Lower Manhattan. Announced a year ago -- and still undergoing design revisions that the M.T.A. will unveil within the next few weeks -- the new $750 million station has been quietly moving forward even as progress has been slow on the nearby World Trade Center site. Construction of the new subway station is expected to begin by the end of this year. 
 ''The Fulton station is one of the few things that can happen downtown without a lot of controversy,'' said Robert K. Futterman, president of Robert K. Futterman & Associates, a retail brokerage firm, who has conducted business in Lower Manhattan for 20 years. And because the station is financed through Sept. 11 funds, it is untouched by budget problems that have forced the M.T.A. to postpone other station rehabilitations. 
 Not only will the new transit center untangle the mess of nine subway lines, but planners and developers alike are counting on the glass building with a domed roof and upscale retailing to become the impetus for redevelopment all along the Fulton Street corridor, described as Lower Manhattan's most important commercial strip until the 1950's.
 With 20,000 square feet of retail space planned for the new station, which is expected to command on average $150 a square foot annually, it is hoped that the transit hub will become more than just aesthetically pleasing and easier to navigate. ''It'll be a place that people want to come to,'' said Beverly Dolinsky, executive director of the permanent citizen's advisory committee to the M.T.A. ''There will be restaurants and shops above ground, not just a hodgepodge of stuff below. And the dome on it will bring light into the station.'' 
 Any successful retail venture starts with foot traffic, which the Fulton station has plenty of: 65,000 people pass through the station daily, making it the second busiest, although just a fraction of Times Square. That number is expected to increase to 300,000 by 2008, when the building is scheduled to be completed and more people are expected to be working in the area. 
 According to a study recently released by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Fulton Street has the largest concentration of street-level storefront space downtown, but it is shabby and lacks diversity. Mr. Futterman says that retail business on Fulton has begun to rebound in the past year, commanding about $120 a square foot annually, and that he expects the trend to continue. ''Without the rehabbed station, the Fulton corridor will continue to improve,'' he said. ''With it, demand will be even greater.''
 While 20,000 square feet of new retailing inside the Fulton station is fairly modest, most urban planners believe the impact will be greater than the sum of its parts.
 ''Generally, you have retail in transit centers that serves people passing through quickly,'' said Petra Todorvich, associate planner at the Regional Plan Association. ''But if the transit hub has street level retail, that integrates the street experience with the transit experience. What's more, an updated, modern, attractive station encourages tourists to use public transportation. It's a better experience for workers and residents. And when companies make decisions on where they want to locate, the condition of the subway station is an important factor.'' 
 The station is being designed by Grimshaw Architects, which recently presented a modified version to a group of planners and architects assembled by the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects. People who have seen the latest plans declined to comment on the record because it hasn't yet been publicly released, but indicate that the roof has been scaled back to keep the station on budget. Still, people familiar with the project say it has remained largely intact and it is still widely regard as the M.T.A.'s most ambitious effort to date. 
 ''The Fulton station is more than a rehab,'' said William Wheeler, director of special project development and planning for the M.T.A. ''One of the goals we have is to provide for continued activity that contributes to street life.'' 
 Not everyone is a fan of the proposed Fulton Street station, however.
 Frank Sanchis, senior vice president of the Municipal Art Society, has been critical of the station design for failing to integrate the surrounding historic buildings into the plans.
 But he is also skeptical about the power of the new station to revitalize the area. ''I don't think it will have much of an impact on the area,'' he said. ''The people who use it will be happier because they won't have to use this tortured transit station, and that's certainly a good thing. But I don't know that the above-ground part is even necessary. They've got a major transit statement in the Calatrava PATH building two blocks away,'' alluding to the World Trade Center station being designed by Santiago Calatrava.
 Others have made similar criticisms that two expensive and somewhat redundant transit buildings will be so close to each other and connected underground. 
 But in fact, it might be the Fulton station, and not the PATH station, that has the bigger impact. ''So much attention has been lavished on the PATH station,'' said Alex Marshall, who writes a transportation column for Governing magazine and is the author of the book ''How Cities Work: Suburbs, Sprawl and the Roads Not Taken.'' 
 ''It's symbolically important, but not functionally very important. The Fulton Street station is a real hub and could be a great place because commerce naturally likes to center around hubs.'' 
 Of course, establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between rehabbed transit stations and vibrant retail corridors can be tricky, although there appears to be a relationship, at least judging from the changes in Union Square. As Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, pointed out, the rehabbed Union Square subway station preceded a flourishing in retailing there. 
 ''It's hard to say if the subway was a catalyst for transforming Union Square,'' he said. ''But since the station was rehabbed, Union Square has become one of the most important retail centers in the city. So it certainly played a part in that remarkable transformation.'' 
 He predicted that similar changes will happen along Fulton Street. ''I have no doubt the Fulton corridor will also be transformed as a retail district,'' he said. ''And it could happen pretty quickly.''

HEADLINE: Stem Cell Researchers Feel The Pull of the Golden State

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
Up and down the East Coast, stem cell researchers are feeling the tug of a powerful, invisible force. It is a wave of recruiting calls from institutions in California seeking to expand their research programs with help from Proposition 71, the state's $3 billion stem cell initiative.
 Money from the initiative, which voters approved in November, has not even started flowing. But the mere promise of it has already proved an enticement, particularly for those in states like Massachusetts, where restrictions are being debated. 
 ''Prop. 71 and the discussion going on in Massachusetts made me think about where would be the best place for doing this research in the U.S.,'' said Dr. Stefan Heller, who studies the stem cells of the inner ear. Dr. Heller is about to move to Stanford University from Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Mass.
 Recruiters in California say they are finding unaccustomed ease in persuading recruits to overlook California's sky-high real estate costs.
 ''Right now we do seem to have a leg up,'' said Dr. Arnold Kriegstein, director of stem cell research at the University of California, San Francisco. He is looking to hire six to eight stem cell biologists for his campus.
 No one knows how many jobs will be created by the initiative. But efforts like Dr. Kriegstein's are sending chills down the spines of laboratory directors in the East. ''I'm scared to death that some of my people will go,'' said Dr. John D. Gearhart, co-director of stem cell biology at Johns Hopkins University. 
 Scientists have been known to threaten to move to friendlier jurisdictions when their freedom of research has been curtailed. Four years ago, Dr. Roger Pedersen left U.C.S.F. to pursue stem cell research at the University of Cambridge in England. 
 But while there were predictions that more would follow him, no brain drain materialized. The other Cambridge, stuck out in England's wind-swept fens, is even more bone-chilling than its Boston derivative. 
 Similarly, when Gov. Mitt Romney sought to persuade the Massachusetts Legislature to ban therapeutic cloning, Harvard researchers let it be known that they might have to move to New Jersey, a threat the governor seems to have toughed out without blinking. And because of the language barrier, no one expects a permanent exodus of American researchers to South Korea, where scientists last week reported a set of substantial technical advances in human therapeutic cloning.
 But the lure of California is real. It is not confined to human embryonic stem cell research -- a proposed treatment for many degenerative diseases -- but includes work with adult stem cell research and related fields like embryogenesis.
 Another new recruit to Stanford is Dr. Michael Clarke, a specialist at the University of Michigan in the relationship between adult stem cells and cancer. The California initiative was one of Dr. Clarke's reasons for moving, he said. 
 The academic talent-spotters in California see the chance to make their institutions a center of gravity in fields of biomedical research for which stem cells hold insights.
 ''When I think about recruitment in stem cell research, it will impact each of the major thrust areas in the school of medicine,'' said Dr. Philip A. Pizzo, the dean of medicine at Stanford, citing programs in neuroscience, cardiovascular research and immunology. 
 Some scientists say that it will take years for California to build a significant advantage, and that states in the East are unlikely to sit by while their positions are eroded. 
 ''Clearly, Boston is one of the places to do stem cell research, so it would be a shame and waste of time if we lose impetus,'' said Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch, a biologist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass. ''I think research should be done on both coasts.'' 
 Competition between the states, should it emerge, would open up a rich new source of biomedical research financing, an area that was dominated by the National Institutes of Health until California's initiative.
 But though scientists are never averse to new sources of support, state legislatures could prove less enlightened patrons in the long run than the federal agency. ''Is it good if states take the N.I.H. out of the obligation to fund the most important research?'' Dr. Jaenisch said.
 For many years, human embryonic stem cell research was an unwanted stepchild. Conservative evangelical groups opposed it; Congress gave it a mixed report. Presidents shunned it or supported it halfheartedly. But suddenly a glass slipper seems to be fitting this Cinderella, and California may be just the first in a line of rich suitors.

HEADLINE: Measuring C.E.O.'s On the Hubris Index

BYLINE: By Mark Hulbert. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
EXCESSIVE pride has been bringing men down at least since ancient Greece. Only recently, however, have researchers begun to study whether hubris explains the otherwise mysterious behavior of corporate chief executives.
 Why, for example, are some corporate leaders more likely than others to pursue mergers and acquisitions? This question has long puzzled financial theorists, since the nearly universal conclusion of past research is that mergers and acquisitions have poor odds of success. When M.&A. activity does create value, most previous studies have shown, it accrues almost completely to shareholders of the target company rather than to those of the acquiring firm. 
 If we assume that chief executives act rationally, as most theorists up until now have done, it is difficult to explain why so many mergers and acquisitions nevertheless take place.
 But what if at least some chief executives act irrationally? That was the question posed by a recent study, which looked to see whether mergers and acquisitions are being disproportionately pursued by corporate leaders with the arrogance to believe that they can beat the odds. 
 The study's authors are Ulrike M. Malmendier, an assistant professor of finance at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, and Geoffrey A. Tate, an assistant professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Their study, which has circulated since last fall as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, is available at http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/malmendier/personal--page/Ulrike--Malmendier's--Research.html. 
 Answering this question was not easy, since overconfidence -- like most psychological attitudes -- can't be directly measured. The professors had to find observable behavior that was unambiguous evidence of this psychological trait. They settled on the timing of a chief executive's decision to cash in his stock options. 
 The typical stock option that a company grants its chief executive does not expire for many years, and once it vests he can exercise it at any time. He could do so immediately after the option moves significantly ''into the money,'' for example; once the underlying stock moves well above the option's exercise price. If he exercises then and immediately sells the acquired shares, he will lock in a sizable profit. At the other extreme, he could hold the option until it nears expiration, in hopes that the stock price will go even higher. But then he takes the risk that the stock price will fall.
 The professors categorize a chief executive as overconfident if he holds on to his options even after they have moved significantly into the money and exercises them only when there are 12 or fewer months left before expiration. They reason that in such a case he must be supremely confident in his ability to cause the price of his company's stock to go higher.
 Waiting so long to exercise options, the professors said, is also a sign that a chief executive is probably not very concerned about risk. That's because his portfolio will probably be too concentrated once his options move significantly into the money. Even if his company's stock continues to rise in price, according to modern portfolio theory, the risk-reward trade-off of holding on to his options will most likely be inferior to that of exercising the options and investing the proceeds in a diversified basket of stocks.
 To test whether chief executive overconfidence helps to explain merger and acquisition activity, the professors studied a database of 400 of the largest publicly traded corporations from 1980 to 1994. They focused on this database because it contained reliable information on when the companies' chief executives exercised their options.
 The researchers divided the companies in this database into two groups according to the timing of those option exercises. The first group contained companies whose chief executives on at least one occasion waited to exercise in-the-money options until there were fewer than 12 months left until expiration -- a sign that the chief executives were overconfident. The second, a control group, contained the remaining companies.
 They found a big difference. The group containing companies led by overconfident chief executives was 1.65 times more likely than the control group to merge with or acquire another company.
 This in itself would be compelling evidence that chief executive overconfidence is a major cause of mergers and acquisitions, but they found more. A particularly telling result emerged when the professors focused on what is referred to as diversifying mergers or acquisitions. These occur when the target firm is in a different industry than the acquiring firm. Diversifying mergers and acquisitions have an especially poor track record, and investors usually react negatively to them -- a reaction that previous researchers have dubbed the diversification discount.
 The professors suspected that it takes a chief executive with a lot of hubris to proceed in the face of the poor odds. Sure enough, they found that chief executives who satisfied their definition of overconfidence were 2.54 times more likely to pursue a diversifying merger or acquisition than those in the control group. That's more than 50 percent higher than the frequency with which overconfident chief executives pursued mergers and acquisitions generally.
 THE professors interpret their findings as providing strong empirical confirmation of a comment that Warren E. Buffett made in the 1981 annual report for Berkshire Hathaway.
 ''Many managements apparently were overexposed in impressionable childhood years to the story in which the imprisoned handsome prince is released from a toad's body by a kiss from a beautiful princess,'' Mr. Buffett wrote. ''Consequently, they are certain their managerial kiss will do wonders for the profitability'' of the companies they intend to acquire. But, Mr. Buffett added: ''We've observed many kisses but very few miracles. Nevertheless, many managerial princesses remain serenely confident about the future potency of their kisses -- even after their corporate backyards are knee-deep in unresponsive toads.''

HEADLINE: So You Want to Be a Venture Capitalist

BYLINE: By GARY RIVLIN

DATELINE: MENLO PARK, CALIF. 

 BODY:
BY all rights Stewart Alsop should have been a terrific venture capitalist. So why did Mr. Alsop, long considered a cyber-prophet among technology leaders, wash out in a profession in which he seemed predestined to succeed? 
 In recent months, as venture capital firms have announced the formation of new investment funds, a hot topic among the Silicon Valley cognoscenti has been the exodus of ''tourist V.C.'s,'' as people from nonfinancial backgrounds are known here. Some have left the field because they did not pick enough winners; others have gone on to pursue different projects. Whatever the reason, there are hundreds fewer venture capitalists around today than just two years ago. 
 The business of financing start-ups, it turns out, may not be as easy as it seems. ''There are Darwinian characteristics to venture capital,'' said C. Richard Kramlich, a founding partner at New Enterprise Associates, a top Valley firm that hired Mr. Alsop in 1996. ''Below the surface there's a huge amount of turnover.'' 
 At first Mr. Alsop seemed destined for venture capital greatness. But for him and others who made the leap into venture capital in the second half of the 1990's, the experience proved humbling.
 A technology journalist dating back to 1983, Mr. Alsop was the founder of Agenda, an invitation-only computer industry conference that drew the likes of Microsoft's Bill Gates. Part of the appeal was that Mr. Alsop had a talent for spotting promising technologies and undiscovered start-ups before others.
 But Mr. Alsop and New Enterprise Associates parted ways in December. Mr. Alsop said he left because he felt most comfortable working with nascent technology companies, and, increasingly, N.E.A. has been broadening its focus well beyond investing in very small start-ups. He described his own track record over eight years as good but not great.
 But Mr. Kramlich, who has worked as a venture capitalist since 1969, put it more harshly. The firm, it seemed, had simply run out of patience with Mr. Alsop, as it did with others who were not seen as pulling their weight. N.E.A. has raised a pair of billion-dollar-plus funds over the last five years, sums high enough to have raised the stakes of the game. 
 ''We can't really have people learning on the job anymore,'' Mr. Kramlich said. Two-thirds of the partners who were at N.E.A. in 1997 are no longer at the firm, he said, and then cited an internal study that went a long way in explaining why: the surviving third accounted for 85 percent of the firm's profit.
 Turnover is the story at many well-known venture firms. Consider Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, widely viewed as one of the two premier venture outfits in Silicon Valley.
 In February 2004, Kleiner began a $400 million fund, but it isn't managed by any of the half dozen or so of the partners who worked for the firm in the late 90's; they had either left the firm or been relegated to secondary roles. Kleiner has hired three new managing partners since the start of the year. 
 And when Benchmark Capital closed its own $400 million fund last June, the firm announced that David Beirne, who had helped found Benchmark in 1995, was no longer a full partner. ''Sometimes it's true that a partner left a firm over strategic differences or whatever they say, but that's the exception rather than the rule,'' said Steve Dow, a venture capitalist with Sevin Rosen. More typically, he said, it's ''because they didn't have a good enough sense of smell about a deal.''
 Mr. Alsop and Mr. Beirne follow many other illustrious names out of major venture firms. Mitchell D. Kapor, the founder of Lotus Development, whose 1-2-3 spreadsheet software made Lotus one of the early giants of software, should have been a natural as a venture capitalist.
 Mr. Kapor had enormous success investing for himself in barely-formed start-ups like RealNetworks and UUNet Technologies, both of which provided him with staggering payouts. 
 Yet he did not prove to be a star the years he worked as a professional venture capitalist. 
 ''The fact that it's someone else's money you're investing, and that you're investing as part of a partnership, that was more different than I thought it would be,'' said Mr. Kapor, who went to work in 1999 for Accel Partners, another top venture house in Silicon Valley. ''I later found out that everybody who makes the transition like I did says that.''
 Mr. Kapor failed to choose a single company that made him, his partners and their investors any money. He confesses he was 0-for-5 in the investments he made during his three years at Accel. ''Most of us learned the hard way that venture investing is best left to the professionals,'' said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape Communications. 
 Shortly after America Online paid $4 billion to buy Netscape, Mr. Andreessen helped bankroll a venture firm called 12 Entrepreneuring, a short-lived partnership forged in early 2000 by Benchmark and a pair of successful Internet entrepreneurs, Halsey M. Minor and Eric Greenberg. But 12 Entrepreneuring ceased operations only 18 months after it started, and the partners, including Mr. Andreessen, lost nearly two-thirds of the money they had invested.
 ''I think what a lot of these guys learned, some the hard way, is that you're a natural athlete or you're not,'' said Sanford Robertson, the co-founder and former chairman of the investment bank Robertson, Stephens & Company, who has been investing in venture funds for more than 20 years. ''Some can do it, and some can't, and like with athletes there's no way of telling until they take the field.''
 At the end of the 90's, it seemed everyone in Silicon Valley wanted to become a venture capitalist (except those who wanted to be entrepreneurs funded by venture capitalists). As the ranks of venture capitalists more than doubled, according to the National Venture Capital Association, from less than 5,000 in 1995 to nearly 10,000 by 2001, firms started hiring people from outside traditional fields like finance or operations. 
 Suddenly many lawyers, entrepreneurs, journalists and executive recruiters were trying their hand at playing venture capitalist -- just as today any number of investment bankers, financial analysts and others seem to be starting their own hedge funds. 
 IT'S easy to understand why so many joined the swelling ranks of venture capitalists. A general partner at a top-tier firm typically earns at least $1 million in salary. But the real payoff is what venture capitalists call ''the carry'' -- the 20 to 30 percent of the profits they share among themselves before disbursing the rest to investors. 
 An informal survey of venture capitalists suggested that a partner working at a top-tier firm in the 90's could pocket roughly $50 million over the life of a single fund -- with venture firms typically raising a new fund every few years.
 Beyond the vast financial rewards, there are the thrills. A venture capitalist is not unlike a movie producer auditioning tomorrow's stars. ''Being a venture capitalist was viewed as a very exciting, top of the feeding chain sort of thing,'' said Scott Dettmer, a founding partner at the Silicon Valley law firm Gunderson Dettmer, who has been providing legal advice to venture capitalists since the 1980's. ''But what I think a lot of people learned is that it's not as much fun or as easy as it might have looked from the outside.''
 Certainly, the early years are often painful. One of the industry's more legendary investors, John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins (his hits include Google, Amazon, Netscape and Sun Microsystems), used to say that training a new venture capitalist was not unlike preparing a fighter pilot for battle: it takes ''probably six to eight years and you should be prepared for losses of about $20 million.
 ''Of course, while we take risk, we work like hell to avoid crashes,'' Mr. Doerr said.
 By that standard, Mr. Alsop was successful at N.E.A. He didn't lose money in his eight years, and, by his calculations, earned the partnership a 100 percent return on the investments he oversaw. Shortly after his arrival, he persuaded his partners to pay $1.7 million for an ownership stake in a software start-up called Connectify, which was purchased by Kana Communications. That earned the partnership 22 times its money. 
 He could also take some credit for the success of TiVo, the digital video recorder company that went public in September 1999. Mr. Alsop didn't bring that deal to N.E.A., but he worked closely with the company founders as a member of TiVo's board of directors. He said that the TiVo deal had earned N.E.A. and its investors 11 times their investment. 
 ''I think I've done very well as a venture capitalist, but I'm not in the god category,'' Mr. Alsop said. He defines a venture god as someone who has made $100 million to $500 million on a single investment. His list of industry deities includes Mr. Doerr, Mr. Kramlich and Michael Moritz at Sequoia Capital, who was an early investor in Google and Yahoo.
 Mr. Moritz seems to prove the point that there is no obvious resume for the perfect venture capitalist. Prior to joining Sequoia in 1986, Mr. Moritz was a business journalist and a writer for Time magazine, though one with an M.B.A. 
 Mr. Kramlich, who has a background in finance, said: ''Venture capital doesn't necessarily take a lot of technical talent. ''I mean, it doesn't hurt, but it's more about people skills and the ability to assess whether there's a market for something.'' 
 Certainly Mr. Beirne, formerly of Benchmark, has people skills. Before joining Benchmark in 1995, he had a stellar reputation as an executive recruiter able to persuade the most reluctant candidate to switch jobs. Yet how he performed in his nine years as a general partner at Benchmark depends on whom one asks. 
 MR. BEIRNE acknowledged that many in the clubby V.C. world may think he left because of a mediocre track record, but he disputes that perception. 
 ''I have been personally responsible for returning a billion dollars'' to investors, he wrote in an e-mail message. He decided to leave the partnership for a ''personal reason related to one of my children'' and ''no other reason.'' Yet apparently for some, once a venture capitalist, always a venture capitalist. Mr. Alsop is exploring the possibility of raising a fund for new start-ups.
 ''I feel at this point I'm very good at this,'' he said. It's only a matter of time, he said, before he scores what he describes as a ''godlike hit.''

HEADLINE: Is It a Savings Crisis Or a Math Error?

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the "Moneybox" column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to consuming, Americans are the equivalent of the New York Yankees -- perennial contenders and frequent champions. When it comes to saving, however, they are more like the Chicago Cubs -- a storied franchise whose history is riddled with futility and disappointment.
 In 2004, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis at the Commerce Department, personal savings -- which is computed by subtracting consumption from disposable personal income -- were $102 billion. That's less than 1 percent of gross domestic product, and far lower than it was in the late 1990's. 
 Virtually all economists argue that Americans could stand to consume less and save more. But some say that a flaw may exist not in our national character but in the way the government calculates savings: because the bureau's method of tallying income and consumption doesn't take into account structural changes in the finances of Americans, it may systematically understate income and overstate consumption. 
 For example, income includes wages and salaries, interest on bonds, and stock dividends. But it doesn't include capital gains on stocks, profits from selling a house, or withdrawals from 401(k) plans. Nearly 70 percent of families own homes, nearly half of all households own stocks and mutual funds, and an increasing number of baby boomers are turning to 401(k)'s for income. Those trends, some say, can make a big difference. ''The structure of the household portfolio has changed over time,'' said David Malpass, chief economist at Bear Stearns. 
 Convinced that Americans aren't frittering away all their income, Mr. Malpass plumbed the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds data, a trove of information on Americans' spending and saving habits. In 2004, he found that the net worth of all households -- their assets minus their liabilities -- stood at $48.525 trillion, up 9.6 percent from 2003. Sure, rising home prices helped. ''But even if you take out houses completely, it still shows huge savings,'' he said. 
 Last year, financial assets rose to $36.8 trillion from $34.1 trillion. Time deposits and savings accounts -- money sitting in the bank -- rose 10.6 percent in 2004, to $4.29 trillion. Because asset building has grown faster than debt, the improvement in households' balance sheets has been substantial in the last few years.
 A big chunk of the rise in assets since 2002 can be ascribed to the stock market's performance in 2003 and the booming housing market. Mr. Malpass laments that given the way the Bureau of Economic Analysis calculates savings, the changing asset values haven't affected the national savings rate. But James Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, ''It's not clear that they should.'' 
 Why? Rising prices of assets held by lots of people means that things become more expensive for everybody. Consider a typical homeowner in the New York region. The price of the home may have doubled since 1999. But if the homeowner sells and buys an equivalent house in the region, whose price has also doubled, the homeowner won't have added materially to savings. If the homeowner is planning to take the gain and move to where homes are cheaper, like Mexico or Indiana, he or she will realize a big gain in savings. But households, in aggregate, don't have the ability to sell their assets and move en masse to lower-cost locales. 
 What's more, adds Peter Orszag, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, based in Washington, rising asset prices -- in the form of houses or stocks -- can be double-edged swords. Sure, they represent gains to owners. But those wishing to acquire those assets have to use more of their savings to do so. ''If increases in home prices and stocks are regarded as capital gains for owners, should they also be regarded as capital losses for potential buyers?'' he asks. 
 On the subject of the personal finances of American consumers -- call it the Money magazine approach -- it's clearly useful to understand the impact of changing asset prices on savings. But from a global macroeconomic perspective -- the Economist approach -- it may be less so. 
 The national savings figure, as tallied by the bureau, is designed to measure whether the United States, as a nation, is stowing away enough cash to prepare for the aging of the baby boomers and to ensure that there will be sufficient capital to fuel future economic growth. But households represent only one part of the national savings story. Corporations and the government can also add or subtract from national savings. 
 WHILE the revived corporate sector has been adding to national savings by increasing profits, the government has been a drain on savings by running huge deficits. And the rise in asset prices has done nothing to dampen a mammoth deficit in the current account, which is the amount of imported capital the country needs to make up for chronic savings shortfalls. 
 Finally, American consumers shouldn't congratulate themselves too much on bolstering their collective net worth. As stock investors know from bitter experience, asset values can change rather quickly. And as Mr. Malpass notes, ''just because the savings rate may be better than we think, it doesn't mean people are prepared for retirement.''

HEADLINE: If There's a Wall, Art Can Find a Home

BYLINE: By CARIN RUBENSTEIN

DATELINE: GREENBURGH 

 BODY:
AT least 56 galleries in Westchester show visual art, and the county's arts council puts the artist population at or above 2,500. 
 O.K., so it's not Manhattan. But that doesn't mean it is without surprises -- one of which is the downright astonishing places and spaces where art is sometimes displayed. 
 In addition to commercial galleries, there are rotating art shows at more than half of Westchester's 38 libraries. Local art is also displayed in restaurants, cafes and tearooms across the county, from the Peekskill Coffee House to Zen Tango in New Rochelle to Steam in Pelham. 
 Then there are the unlikeliest galleries of all.
 There is, for example, a tiny but vibrant art gallery in the back corner of Gillard's, a tobacco and gift shop in Bronxville. Several churches, including the South Presbyterian Church in Dobbs Ferry and the Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, feature active galleries, complete with curators and price lists. The Town of Greenburgh sponsors four galleries, including one in Town Hall and another in Town Court. And a beauty salon in White Plains has just begun displaying art along an 80-foot-long wall.
 Wherever there is art, apparently, there is also a yearning to display it. 
 ''There is not enough gallery space in Westchester for the greatly burgeoning artist population,'' said Janet T. Langsam, executive director of the Westchester Arts Council. ''There is a growing population of Westchester artists and a growing interest and need for space to show their work.''
 Michael Botwinick, director of the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, agreed. ''In any interesting community, the level of artwork bubbles up in quirky places,'' he said. ''Art is irrepressible, and people love to make art and they love to have it seen.''
 That is why you can find different artwork every two weeks at Gillard's in Bronxville, a 2,300-square-foot store that reserves a 128-square-foot corner for the display of paintings, photographs and collages, or whatever Robert F. Abele, the owner's son, decides to show.
 ''Being discouraged about the gallery scene, I decided to make my own,'' said Mr. Abele, a landscape painter. ''I got sick of saying Westchester is devoid of culture. White Plains is in a huge economic boom, but the whole city is designed around shopping. It has no culture. People are starving to see a jazz band or sculpture.'' 
 Mr. Abele's minuscule space is booked through November.
 At the Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, a large gallery features rotating exhibitions of African-American art, according to the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, the senior pastor. ''I have a love for art, and I have always felt there is a connection between faith and art,'' he said. The space houses about 20 works, which change three times a year.
 The Town of Greenburgh has its own executive director of arts and culture. Sarah Bracey White, who holds that part-time position, places artworks at four official Greenburgh sites, including the Town Court, Town Hall, Anthony F. Veteran Park and the Theodore D. Young Community Center. 
 Town Hall, for instance, has a display of nature photographs, priced at $50 to $175, just across the hallway from the tax office and the assessor's office. Paintings, from $200 to $600, hang along a carpeted hallway, just across from the restrooms. In the Town Court, there are 16 framed oil paintings, one hanging just above the jury box, suspended by metal poles over the gloomy brick walls. Because of a judicial ruling by New York State on the propriety of selling artwork in a courtroom, Ms. White is not permitted to post prices there. But defendants and their lawyers are encouraged to call the artist if they are interested in buying a still life on display, she said.
 ''I'm not a painter,'' said Ms. White, as she walked through her informal gallery, straightening frames and adjusting price tags. ''But I love art because it can change people's lives.'' 
 The owners of Static, a beauty salon occupying 4,000 square feet on a second floor in downtown White Plains, a few months ago began to rent out the space for parties, corporate events and theatrical productions. One owner, George Bartko, says he and his partners have also begun reviewing the work of local artists, to consider whose work will be next on the salon's extra wall space. 
 ''They would have to fit in with the vibe of Static,'' Mr. Bartko said. The artist being featured for the next three months or so is Chin Yee of Dobbs Ferry. 
 Larry D'Amico, a landscape painter who curates art shows at the Chappaqua Library, says Westchester's art scene used to be frustrating to him, because there weren't enough quality spaces to show in. 
 Now, he said, ''compared to the 1970's, it's a cultural hotbed.''
 ''Back in the 70's, all of the air was sucked out of Westchester into New York City,'' he said. ''But not anymore.''

HEADLINE: Battle in the Sound

 BODY:
The chorus of local opposition to a floating, Queen-Mary-size natural gas operation in the middle of Long Island Sound grew even louder last week, when the Suffolk County Legislature voted overwhelmingly to oppose the project and hire lawyers to fight it.
 The strength and unanimity of Long Island's opposition to the project's developers, Broadwater Energy, have been impressive; there is nothing like a huge, scary energy project in our own backyard to get our protective instincts up. But Long Islanders opposed to Broadwater might want to guard their ammunition and use it wisely -- this could be a long struggle. Here's why: 
 First, Broadwater is no small-bore enemy. It is a partnership of the TransCanada Corporation and Shell, two of North America's largest energy companies. Huge global concerns like these have invested heavily in the supply side of the booming natural gas industry overseas, and are looking to assure their profits by expanding their ability to sell in the United States. The Broadwater proposal -- a $700 million floating platform to take shipments of gas from all over the world and pump them into the hungry Northeast energy market -- is only one of dozens seeking approval around the country.
 Second, it seems clear that this country will be importing ever greater quantities of liquefied natural gas in coming years. Demand is soaring as gas supplies in North America have leveled off; the potential profits to gas importers are enormous. As a recent Harvard study pointed out, liquefied natural gas is cheap -- roughly $2.50 to $3.50 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $7 for pipeline gas -- and costs could go even lower as technology improves. With numbers like that, it seems unlikely that an outfit like Broadwater will be easily turned away.
 But Broadwater's opponents need not panic just yet. Some people fear that the Bush administration wants eventually to change the law to give federal regulators power to overrule state and local objections in choosing sites for operations like Broadwater. But such worries seem premature. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has only begun considering the Broadwater proposal, and the administration is not presently seeking to deprive New York State -- or any other state for that matter -- of the powers it has under existing federal laws (the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the Coastal Zone Management Act among them) to veto plans like Broadwater's. 
 And while Long Islanders seem overwhelmingly set on saving their Sound, other communities, like Everett, Mass., near Boston, have lived with liquefied natural gas plants for years, more or less peaceably. The odds are good that companies will succeed in building or expanding liquefied natural gas operations in receptive communities, particularly on the Gulf Coast, thus taking the pressure off places like Long Island.
 Finally, Broadwater's opponents can take comfort in knowing that the company's efforts to win local support have so far been stunningly clumsy and ineffective. Its offer of $15 million a year as ''payment in lieu of taxes'' to the Town of Riverhead if the project went through was soundly rejected; the town supervisor called it ''hush money.'' It tried to sway the Suffolk Legislature by calling local residents who supposedly supported the plan and patching their calls through to legislators; the Legislature's presiding officer, Joseph T. Caracappa of Selden, informed a Broadwater representative that such boneheaded lobbying was ''not appreciated.''
 In this ever-more-heated debate, moments like those are entertaining. But such satisfaction is not what Broadwater's opponents should be looking for. This proposal is one element of a broader array of energy issues. The country wants power, and it has to come from somewhere. The sky may not be falling, but it certainly is warming. Natural gas is cleaner than oil and coal, but its cost has recently tripled. Fight and defeat too many projects like Broadwater, and the economics of nastier forms of energy may suddenly become more enticing. 
 The Broadwater struggle, at its heart, is simply about where to place the various parts of the national gas distribution system. In heavily industrial, heavily populated areas that don't mind them? In the widest part of our precious Long Island Sound? In Canada? In the Gulf of Mexico? These decisions should be the product of an honest and transparent debate, one that Long Islanders are more than capable of leading.

HEADLINE: Cadillac Slips Into Something A Bit Racy

BYLINE: By NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
TELEVISION tells us what housewives do when they are desperate, or at least what happens when the spouses of Wisteria Lane feel neglected. Car companies that find themselves in a similar fix -- hungry for attention and unable to arouse interest on the home front -- are obliged to take a different approach. 
 Increasingly, automakers are tarting up standard models with upgrades to their style or performance -- or both. Spurred by the success of special high-performance models from German companies -- cars like the BMW M3 and various AMG-label cars from Mercedes-Benz -- automakers from Detroit, Japan and Britain are setting up their own in-house ''tuner'' operations to turn out limited-edition, premium-price cars with performance enhancements.
 But few of these imitators are counting as heavily on tuner models as the Cadillac division of General Motors. While Cadillac's recovery from its product coma of the 1990's has been built on a total overhaul of its lineup, the task of changing public perceptions of the brand -- particularly its ability to compete with Europeans in the market for high-performance luxury cars -- began in earnest with the CTS-V. 
 A special edition of the midsize CTS sedan, this car was re-engineered by the company's Performance division, the in-house tuner division that develops alternatives to the autobahn alphas from BMW's M group and the Mercedes-Benz AMG operation.
 The CTS-V, introduced in late 2003, has been heavily promoted in advertising -- far out of proportion to its sales volume -- and with a factory-supported effort in Sports Car Club of America racing. Reviews of the CTS-V made favorable comparisons with more expensive supersedans like the BMW M5 and Mercedes E55 AMG.
 For its performance to be mentioned in the same breath with such cars is flattering enough, but the CTS-V's $50,185 base price also looks like a steal against the $81,520 E55 or the $71,095 M5 (last sold as a 2003 model). Of course, the CTS-V's comparable numbers on the test track don't tell the whole story, as both the BMW and the Mercedes are lavishly equipped and more refined.
 Looking in the other direction -- down to lesser versions of the CTS -- is a different story. The base version, with a 210-horsepower 2.8-liter V-6, starts at $31,390; a model with a 255-horsepower 3.6-liter V-6 is $33,640. For their extra thousands, CTS-V buyers get a 400-horsepower V-8, giant Brembo disc brakes, a thoroughly upgraded suspension and cosmetic nips and tucks.
 So more than a year since this hot-rod Cadillac arrived, one question hangs heavily: Has the CTS-V moved the needle? Has it prompted Americans -- the car is not sold in Europe -- to abandon their old overstuffed stereotypes of Cadillac?
 G.M. says they have. Speaking in New York in January, Mark Reuss, executive director of the G.M. Performance division, said that 38 percent of CTS-V buyers had previously owned German cars and that 40 percent said they would change nothing about their Cadillacs. 
 The car has certainly changed my view of a brand I thought best suited to retirees and hearses. In driving the CTS-V for several extended periods over the course of a year, I found the car to be as impressive, and as enjoyable, as it was on our first meeting. The affair has been more durable than the weekly flings on Wisteria Lane.
 It doesn't hurt that Cadillac dressed up the standard CTS -- a crisply handsome shape rendered in the company's sharply creased design language -- with understated jewelry in the form of a wire mesh grille, spidery 18-inch alloy wheels and tasteful V-Series badges on the trunk and fenders. Departing from the usual trimmings of cars in the $50,000 class, the CTS-V has no wood inside, instead taking a plastic-intensive high-tech look that echoes an exterior with as many facets as a gemstone. 
 To no small extent, the rambunctious V-8 accounts for the appeal. The engine is not an offspring of Cadillac's sophisticated Northstar family, but a derivative of the engine used in last year's Corvette Z06. It has old-fashioned pushrods instead of overhead camshafts, and just two valves per cylinder instead of the four valves common today. 
 While the 5.7-liter V-8 might not seem technically brilliant, it is the perfect complement to the personality of this well-dressed ruffian. In the heyday of Detroit muscle, I was among those freshly licensed know-it-alls who insisted that almost any car could be improved with a Chevy engine under the hood. In this case, we were right. 
 The CTS-V comes only with a manual transmission. G.M. said that it wanted to produce a true enthusiast's car and that the six-speed gearbox (similar to the Corvette's) was the only way to do that. Never mind that competitors like the BMW M3, with its clutchless Sequential Manual Gearbox, and the Audi S4, with a six-speed automatic, offer automatic-shift options. (The Mercedes AMG's have automatics only.)
 While I am susceptible to being corrupted by horsepower, there is more to this car's appeal than its ability to reach 60 m.p.h. in 5 seconds. The drivetrain merits praise for being free of lurches and gear rattle.
 Built on G.M.'s rear-drive Sigma architecture and developed at the revered Nurburgring racetrack in Germany, the CTS-V displays remarkable poise on the road, combining a tenacious grip of the asphalt with a buckled-down ride that is firm but rarely harsh. Even the high-performance Goodyear Eagle F1 tires are well behaved, never raising their voice above a whisper.
 Cadillac engineers also did an excellent job of relaying the car's sporting intentions: when I went looking for the switch to turn off the traction control (I wanted to allow a little wheelspin, purely in the interest of research) it was right at my fingertip, on the steering wheel. Toggling through its settings offers four choices of traction control and stability control activation, including -- it says so right on the G.P.S. screen -- a ''competitive'' mode, which backs down the level of intervention imposed by the system, in case you race your Cadillac on weekends.
 Another none-too-subtle clue is the G-meter on the instrument panel, which reads lateral acceleration in turns (expressed as a fraction of the force of gravity). When I returned the car, it displayed 1.0 -- a reading that would be no big deal on a banked racetrack, but is a more significant achievement on a highway off-ramp in New Jersey. 
 Still, at least one sport sedan attribute is missing. I would prefer a hand-operated parking brake, especially in a standard shift car, in lieu of the foot-activated brake. 
 The CTS-V delivers unusually well on one quality that separates good cars from memorable ones: feedback. How well a car communicates with the driver, especially when pressed hard, is a critical factor in a performance machine. The Cadillac tells all: a firm brake pedal let me know when I had reached the limit beyond which the antilock control would step in. 
 The steering is particularly fine-tuned, especially for a luxury car, and is the best execution yet of G.M.'s Magnasteer technology, which provides variable effort at the wheel. The gearshift action is not the world's best, but it is quite good, and the clutch pedal (like so much else in this well-tuned car) balances a high level of feel with admirable isolation from vibration and harshness. That one word -- balance -- sums up the CTS-V well, something that other V-8 powered performance cars (the Audi S4 comes to mind) sometimes lack.
 Among my disappointments was learning that the 2005 model has become a gas guzzler, adding a $1,300 tax to the sticker. The revised mileage rating does not result from any mechanical changes, but stems from a recalculation forced by federal fuel-economy rules. The 2004 mileage took into consideration the use of the same LS6 engine in the Corvette, a much lighter car; because there is no Z06 Corvette this year, the consumption of the 3,850-pound CTS-V was not averaged upward. Its rating, 15 m.p.g. in town, 23 on the highway (down from 16/25 in 2004) must now stand alone. 
 After driving the car off and on over a year, one question remains: Is the CTS-V really a Cadillac? Some details say no: the interior plastic, much of it embossed with the pattern of a plastic foam coffee cup, does not belong in this class, and the firm seats, which fit me to a T, are not the sofas normally sampled in a Cadillac showroom.
 It would be particularly easy to make the case that a pushrod V-8 of Chevrolet parentage, despite its deliciously throaty roar under acceleration, has no business in any Caddy, even a sporty one. But a recent drive in an XLR convinced me that Cadillac's Northstar V-8 would have been a bad match for the CTS-V's slightly bad-boy attitude; while the more modern Northstar can be made powerful enough (a supercharged 440-horsepower version will power the coming STS-V and XLR-V), its polite manners and polished behavior would make the CTS-V feel more civilized -- and less fun. 
 So the answer, then, is no, the CTS-V is not a Cadillac in the traditional sense. To that I say, thank goodness.

HEADLINE: Communists as Creditors: China and the U.S. Worker

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN. 
Roger Cohen writes the Globalist column for The International Herald Tribune.

 BODY:
PERHAPS the only working class that China's Communist president is still assisting is the American.
 The issue is not the flood of cheap Chinese products that are keeping prices down, although this helps the average household. It is President Hu Jintao's policy of using what is widely regarded as an undervalued Chinese yuan to buy United States Treasury securities and so help keep American interest rates down.
 The United States is awash in debt. Median household debt has risen to more than $100,000 from less than $60,000 in 1990, even as median incomes have increased only slightly. Much of the debt is held by workers who are ramping up their loans on one credit card after another, or obtaining dubious mortgages in a bid to secure some fraction of the lifestyle of an upper class that keeps getting richer. 
 This increase in debt, as The Wall Street Journal pointed out in a recent article, has occurred as the gap between rich and poor has continued to widen and the visibility of coveted luxury goods on television and the Internet has continued to grow.
 Some laud the democratization of credit, seeing its availability to wider swaths of the American population as broadening opportunity; some criticize it as the ruthless seduction by financial institutions of working people who will one day face bankruptcy because they will be unable to pay credit card bills and mortgages.
 But this much is clear: The spread of debt is one of the more significant social phenomena in the United States today, allowing the less well off to spend more than they have. As long as interest rates do not rise steeply, this will continue to happen. Hence Mr. Hu's heft on Main Street.
 But what are the politics of debt? The Democratic Party has traditionally represented the have-nots, but these days a great many working-class and middle-class Americans with constant or declining incomes identify more with God, the armed forces and the Republican Party than with the Democrats.
 They have tended, with the conspicuous exception of African-Americans, to be less moved by the strain on their finances than by three other ''F's'' -- faith, family and freedom -- as promoted by Republicans.
 Thomas Frank, the left-leaning author and political analyst, calls these average working people who seem to be voting against economic logic ''backlash conservatives.'' In an article in The New York Review of Books, he noted that they refuse to support liberals portrayed by Republicans as ''either high-born weaklings or eggheads.'' In this vision of things, America today is a country with wide swaths of its citizens drifting economically, using ever-increasing debt as a means to cushion the blow, but convinced that the Democratic Party has parted company with them by embracing values -- same-sex marriage, abortion, secularism -- that are unacceptable, not only in their eyes, but also in God's. 
 And in this portrait, it does not matter that President Bush wants to tighten bankruptcy laws in a way that will favor the very credit card companies that are offering loans that may prove unpayable. It matters that Mr. Bush is seen as rooted, patriotic, a real man, and, for some, a divine agent in the White House.
 The Republicans' success in purveying this message is striking. Which brings us back to Mr. Hu. Could the Chinese leader do what the Democrats have failed to do -- get more ordinary Americans to focus squarely on the perils of their economic situation and conclude that it may be better to vote Democratic? 
 The United States Treasury, alarmed at those spiraling Chinese imports, and under growing protectionist pressure, has now urged Mr. Hu to revalue the yuan. If Mr. Hu obliges, those Treasury securities might well look less attractive because, measured in a stronger yuan, their value would decline.
 If China then reduces its purchases of Treasury bills, and other Asian central banks follow suit, one thing is certain: Interest rates will rise and Joe Six-Pack will be hurting a lot more when credit card bills arrive. If the pain is sharp enough, will a political alternative -- the Democrats -- look more attractive?
 We live in a wondrous world. It could just be that a Chinese Communist, leading a society hellbent on capitalism and prodded by a Republican administration, ends up helping what still passes for the left in America by driving the economic reality of personal debt home to the point where ''values'' issues become secondary.

HEADLINE: Decoding Health Insurance

BYLINE: By Robin Cook. 
Robin Cook is a medical doctor and the author, most recently, of the novel ''Marker.''

DATELINE: Boston 

 BODY:
NEARLY five years ago, President Bill Clinton had an all-star gathering at the White House to announce the completion of the first draft of the human genome's approximately 3.2 billion base pairs. Speaking to an audience that included eminent scientists like Dr. James Watson, who helped discover DNA, Mr. Clinton pronounced that ''today we are learning the language in which God created life.'' Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain chimed in via satellite, ''For most of us, today's developments are too awesome to comprehend.'' 
 Turns out that Mr. Blair was right, although not quite in the way that he intended. Despite the high-flying talk and the abundant news media coverage of the announcement, the public greeted the event with vague interest, a touch of bewilderment, varying degrees of ennui -- and then quickly forgot about it. This general indifference to one of science's landmark achievements has persisted even as the science and technology involved have yielded some remarkable discoveries. We now know, for example, that a vast majority of our genome is composed of repetitive nonsense sequences, and that instead of humans having the 100,000-plus genes previously predicted, we have somewhere in the neighborhood of 25,000, many of which we share with all other living things, a fact that anchors us firmly in the process of evolution (whether a creative intelligence was involved or not). 
 Of course, people can perhaps be forgiven for not wanting to recognize that they don't have many more genes than round worms or fruit flies -- a blow to humanity's ego that's about as powerful as Copernicus's discovery that the earth revolved around the sun instead of vice versa. 
 As a doctor schooled to some degree in science, I believed (and still do) that decoding the human genome might be the most important milestone in the history of medical science. To borrow Mr. Clinton's metaphor, the full genome offers researchers the sequence of all the letters of the human book of life, a monumental resource despite our imperfect understanding of the book's overarching, mind-boggling complexity. As decoding gathers speed, it promises to change just about everything we know about medicine in the form of understanding, prediction, prevention, diagnosis and the treatment of disease. And in so doing, it also offers us a remarkable opportunity to solve the huge and nettlesome problem of paying for health care in the United States. 
 Public skepticism of such grandiose statements is understandable. After all, you might say: ''Where are all the touted breakthroughs, the miracle drugs and diagnostic tests, predicted five years ago? Finding out that humans have about the same number and some of the same genes as a worm may be interesting to somebody, but it's hardly a health care revolution, much less worth the more than $3 billion that have so far been spent on decoding.'' 
 Well, the drugs are not here yet, although they are on the horizon. But that doesn't diminish the broader fact that the rapidly developing fields of genomics and bioinformatics hold enormous promise. In simple terms, genomics is the study of the flow of information in a cell orchestrated by the genome, while bioinformatics is the application of computers to make sense of the enormous amount of data coming from genomics. 
 Knowledge of the genome has greatly improved our ability to predict an individual's predilection for a host of diseases. Thousands upon thousands of markers have been identified throughout the genome and linked to particular mutated, deleterious genes associated with specific medical problems. The presence of these markers can be determined by placing a single drop of blood onto a particular type of slide called a microarray. Microarrays, in turn, are read automatically by laser scanners and the results, thanks to bioinformatics, can be analyzed instantly by computers armed with appropriate software and statistical data.
 The importance of a rapid increase in prognostic ability is underlined by the growing understanding that every disease has a greater or lesser genetic component. Patients can now avail themselves of preventive measures or treatment even before symptoms occur. But there is a down side. First of all, we can predict more and more diseases that are associated with progressive disability and death and which have, as of yet, no treatment. Finding a marker linked to such an illness is thus the cruel equivalent of an extended death sentence. Understandably many people would not want such a test and would hardly classify having one as a positive health care breakthrough.
 Another, and possibly more important, negative consequence of this new ability to predict illness is the potential for discrimination in one form or another if confidential health information is released. Unfortunately the chances of such a breach of privacy occurring, despite lip service by politicians to prevent it legislatively, are probably inevitable. Not only is microarray technology easily accessible, but for-profit private insurance companies have strong incentives to use it to protect their bottom lines by denying service, claims or even coverage.
 It is precisely this danger, however, that may lead to a great breakthrough: the inevitable movement to universal health care. In this dawning era of genomic medicine, the result may be that the concept of private health insurance, which is based on actuarially pooling risk within specified, fragmented groups, will become obsolete since risk cannot be pooled if it can be determined for individual policyholders. Genetically determined predilection for disease will become the modern equivalent of the ''pre-existing condition'' that private insurers have stringently avoided. 
 As a doctor I have always been against health insurance except for catastrophic care and for the very poor. It has been my experience that the doctor-patient relationship is the most personal and rewarding for both the patient and the doctor when a clear, direct fiduciary relationship exists. In such a circumstance, both individuals value the encounter more, which invariably leads to more time, more attention to potentially important details, and a higher level of patient compliance and satisfaction -- all of which invariably result in a better outcome. 
 But with the end of pooling risk within defined groups, there is only one solution to the problem of paying for health care in the United States: to pool risk for the entire nation. (Under the rubric of health care I mean a comprehensive package that includes preventive care, acute care and catastrophic care.) Although I never thought I'd advocate a government-sponsored, obviously non-profit, tax-supported, universal access, single-payer plan, I've changed my mind: the sooner we move to such a system, the better off we will be. Only with universal health care will we be able to pool risk for the entire country and share what nature has dealt us; only then will there be no motivation for anyone or any organization to ferret out an individual's confidential, genetic makeup.
 There are plenty of compelling arguments for a national, single-payer, universal access plan -- like every developed industrialized country has one. But those arguments have so far seemed insufficient. And none of them is nearly as cogent and persuasive as the growing impact of genomics and bioinformatics. Of course, far too many wealthy stakeholders in the current system (thanks to 15 percent of our gross domestic product being thrown at health care) are eager to lobby members of Congress to keep things as they are. The basic challenge is to blast the public and their elected representatives out of their shared apathy toward what the decipherment of the human genome has brought.
 The day after the White House ceremony in 2000, one letter-writer to this newspaper expressed the wish that the United States would devote the same amount of enthusiasm and resources that it had expended on the human genome project toward the goal of ''assuring access to basic medical care for all Americans.'' If the money spent on the genome ends up achieving that health care goal, that wish may yet come true.

HEADLINE: Mr. Chairman, You Can't Control China. So Just Relax.

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist.; E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com.

 BODY:

To: Alan Greenspan
Chairman, Federal Reserve Board
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Greenspan:
 You have always been a great friend to the little Stein family. You invited us to your viewing of the Fourth of July fireworks for many years. You spoke warmly and kindly of my father on his 80th birthday and after his death. My father, an economist like you, often said that you were the best Fed chairman ever. And I am sad that you will soon retire.
 In the same spirit of friendship that you have shown to my family and to the nation and world, I hereby offer you some possible mental and emotional relief on two perplexing economic and monetary policy issues.
 First, you recently pronounced that you were puzzled by what you called the ''conundrum'' of why long-term interest rates were so low, as the economy gathered steadily more strength and as inflation heated up, albeit to a lukewarm temperature.
 May I suggest a reason for the low long-term rates? It has to do with a certain circularity in the world flows of capital. American consumers and businesses buy far more from the Japanese and the Chinese than the United States sells to them. The difference is in the hundreds of billions of dollars annually. The Asians do not respend this money in America by buying Big Macs. Instead, they use a large chunk of it -- again, hundreds of billions -- to buy Treasury bonds.
 That creates a floor under the dollar, keeps their own currencies low and makes their products very competitive. But this voracious buying of Treasury bonds -- at varying lengths of maturity -- keeps a high floor under bond prices as well. That, in turn, keeps the interest rate low, because interest rates move inversely to bond prices.
 In other words, interest rates are suppressed at very low levels by the recycling of the trade deficit into Treasury bonds. It may be just that simple.
 In turn, this keeps the mortgage rates low, props up the amazing housing boom and starts to affect commercial real estate in a big way, too.
 Maybe I am missing something here, but this is at least a possible answer to your conundrum.
 Second, there has been much speculation in the financial press and in the groves of academe to the effect that the inflation, such as it is, is caused by the rise in oil prices in recent months and years. At my local gas station in Beverly Hills, self-service -- yes, self-service -- high test is now $3.22 a gallon, so I believe that the concern is real. But why will raising interest rates to slow down American growth affect those oil prices?
 As we both know, much of the increased demand for oil in recent years has come from the soaring Chinese economy. If Chinese demand is setting oil prices at the margin, why bother curbing the already-slowing American economy to lower oil demand? It can't be so that slower demand here will slow the Chinese economy, too. American interest rate changes will have a tiny effect on China, because slower demand would have to work through many layers of currencies, exports and lack of replacements.
 So maybe we have had enough effort at curbing the United States' economy, and we should just let the slow processes of price elasticity work their magic and find substitutes for oil.
 To put it another way, why cut down growth in America if that growth has nothing or little to do with the causes of inflation? It may be that this is a case beyond the control of monetary policy in the United States. It is probably not even remotely beyond the reach of Chinese monetary policy.
 But why punish the small-business owner in Canton, Ohio, because a large business in Canton, China, is demanding more oil and can pay for it? Why put us even remotely at risk of recession over a cause for inflation that is, like the computer on which I am writing this letter, made in China?
 IT may be better to keep a close eye on the housing situation. In Florida, buyers are lining up at new developments to buy three houses or condominiums at a time -- and I was told while I was at a conference on finance in Key Biscayne two weeks ago that some developers are demanding that the buyers kick back a share of any gains made on flipping the homes within a year.
 This has the distinct look of something that should not be happening. Good, solid homes for people to live in: that's fine. Their prices should go up. Limo drivers in Key Biscayne speculating in property on no money down? That does not look like a good harbinger.
 By any chance, are your interest rate increases aimed at this issue? If so, I don't think they'll work as long as China and Japan are distorting interest rates downward. Maybe the bubble in resorts has to burst all by its bad self.
 Anyway, these are my humble thoughts. They may well be wrong.
 And wherever you go after leaving the Fed, we shall miss your sensible hand at the tiller. And the fireworks.

Respectfully submitted,
Ben Stein

HEADLINE: Where Car Is King, Garages Rule

BYLINE: By VIV BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: MOORESVILLE, N.C., May 18 

 BODY:
Roger Penske could park a 747 in the race shop of his new team headquarters in North Carolina's Nascar hub. The garage area alone is longer than a football field. 
 Of course, a jet might crack the Italian floor tiles -- one million pounds of them -- that have been carefully laid in these opulent, immaculate new digs. And that wouldn't do. 
 The Penske Palace is big and stylish and yet another example of the latest trend in Nascar: sprawling, shiny race shops that awe fans and help inspire sponsors to keep writing those multimillion-dollar checks.
 ''We all end up having to compete at all these different levels,'' Roush Racing's president, Geoff Smith, said in a phone interview this week. ''So part of that competition for marketing interest has led to pretty buildings and prettier presentations than are necessary for the actual function.''
 Penske is not alone. Nascar race teams, most based in small towns just north of Charlotte, N.C., are in the midst of an intensive expansion of shops. Hendrick Motorsports just opened a building to house the Kyle Busch and Brian Vickers race teams, adding 86,000 square feet to a complex that now totals 600,000. Roush Racing, a five-team operation with the drivers Kurt Busch, Matt Kenseth, Mark Martin, Greg Biffle and Carl Edwards, is in the process of completing an expansion of its multibuilding facility. It will cost $20 million to $25 million when it is finished.
 Joe Gibbs Racing, with the drivers Tony Stewart, Bobby Labonte and Jason Leffler, just added 100,000 square feet to its race shop, nearly doubling its space. Evernham Motorsports, Richard Childress Racing, Robert Yates Racing, Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates, Wood Brothers Racing -- have all moved into new shops or expanded existing facilities in the last two years, spending millions along the way.
 This kind of expansion was inevitable, Ganassi said. He moved his team, including the Cup drivers Sterling Marlin, Jamie McMurray and Casey Mears, into a 180,000-square-foot facility down the street from Roush Racing in July 2004.
 ''From a facility standpoint, the industry has been in an infancy stage,'' Ganassi said. ''Most of the teams didn't have the plush facilities. Only relatively few teams had real facilities up until 10 years ago or so.''
 As the Nextel Cup continues to be dominated by Roush Racing and its five-car operation as well as Hendrick Motorsports and its four teams, including Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson, the competition is looking to expand as well. 
 Joe Gibbs Racing went from two to three teams this year, adding the Leffler racecar. That was part of the reason for its shop expansion. Ganassi has three racecars now. Robert Yates Racing, which moved into an 80,000-square-foot facility in Mooresville in 2003, is a two-car operation with the drivers Dale Jarrett and Elliott Sadler, but it is planning a 50,000-square-foot expansion and may add a third driver.
 Beyond that trend, there is an increasing concentration of race teams and competition among towns to lure teams in an industry with an estimated $5 billion impact on North Carolina's economy. Town officials in Mooresville offered tax incentives for Penske to buy the abandoned air compressor plant that became his new race shop. Ganassi said officials in Concord, N.C., provided incentives to move there from Mooresville and build a new shop.
 North Carolina has withstood competition from Virginia and South Carolina to lure race teams. Few would leave at this point, though. The employee base, including top engineers and mechanics, is in North Carolina. That is why Wood Brothers Racing moved from Stuart, Va., to Mooresville this year. 
 Although the glittering Dale Earnhardt Inc. headquarters in Mooresville still carries the nickname Garage Majal, Penske might have topped them all with his new facility.
 Start with the size -- the two buildings purchased for $7 million total 424,697 square feet. It was so big that both Yates and Ganassi passed on it when they decided to move their teams.
 Penske is using 210,666 square feet for the race shop and another 30,115 for administrative offices. The rest of the space is unused -- for now.
 There are buildings constructed within the building, including offices and workshops. There are 8,763 square feet of space for the engineering department alone, including 16 staff engineers. They have a chassis shop, fabrication shop, chassis shop, model shop, machine shop and a shock absorber laboratory. There are even three separate autograph rooms for drivers to sign all of the merchandise that comes in from fans or is given away to sponsors.
 The facility consolidates the race teams, which occupied separate buildings in another area of Mooresville in a setup that frustrated Penske. Now everything is under one roof. After the building was gutted, Penske spent $9 million to turn it into a race shop. 
 ''It's the business,'' said the Penske president, Don Miller. ''This is a very well-laid-out, well-thought-out, well-engineered structure that has a lot of rhythm to it, so not only is it pretty but it's productive. And you know, you could have made it just as productive and spent 15 percent less money. But if you're going to do a facility that is this big and going to be this productive, you want it to be presentable for your sponsors.''
 The new facility, which includes conference rooms, an amphitheater, gift shop and catering rooms, often plays host to sponsor meetings. And there is a 4,986-square-foot gift shop as well as a 330-foot fan walk above the shop area.
 Miller said as many as 200,000 could visit the shop each year.
 ''It'll become a destination address,'' Miller said. ''People will come to Mooresville, and they will stay in the hotels and will eat in the restaurants.''
 As long as it's a destination address for the sponsors, the Penske Palace will be worth it.

HEADLINE: Schoolwork 

BYLINE: By Deborah Solomon

 BODY:
Q: Should I call you Secretary? 
 I've been called worse, as we say in Texas. 
 Are you concerned about the rebellion against No Child Left Behind, the federal act that tries to improve school accountability by requiring states to test kids every year? Utah just announced that it doesn't want your money -- it wants to be left alone. 
 That's their prerogative. But if I were a Hispanic mom in Utah, I sure would want an explanation as to why we left $76 million on the table and my kid is not being well served. 
 What I find odd is that in 1980, President Reagan famously promised to abolish the Department of Education, and now Republicans are taking the opposite stance, reinventing the department to police education at the local level. 
 I think that in those two decades the American people and the political leadership have come to an understanding that if we don't close this achievement gap, it's going to be very detrimental to our democracy and our economic development and so on and so forth. 
 That's all true, but what do assessment tests really measure, other than an ability to memorize for tests? 
 You hear about that kind of thing. With respect to my own children, I do think people have to have a fluency with facts. You need to know what four times four is. 
 Time for a pop quiz. Can you tell us the capital of Illinois? 
 Uh. Springfield? 
 Correct. 
 Phew. That was a close one. 
 What's the capital of Wyoming? 
 Cheyenne or Cody. (Long pause.) Cheyenne. 
 Yes, it's Cheyenne, which I know because I watch ''Jeopardy!'' 
 Me, too. I'm a big ''Jeopardy!'' fan. Love it! In fact I was so annoyed when Christie Todd Whitman and Ari Fleischer got to go on ''Jeopardy!'' 
 I'm sure you could get on, if you tried. 
 Maybe so. I worry that the category will be sports, and I'll get them all wrong. 
 I think it's admirable not to know about sports, although how did you rise so high in the world of Republican politics without knowing about football? 
 Well, you have to learn enough to get by. But it's not something I love to do or watch. 
 What do you make of the current controversy in Kansas over whether creationism should be taught along with evolution? 
 I can tell you that in Texas we did go through this issue, when Bush was governor and I was working for him. We ended up -- the curriculum says basically that both points of view are taught from a factual basis. 
 How can creationism be taught from a factual basis? Are you implying that events in the Bible should be taught in the public schools as literal history? 
 I'm not implying anything. I'm just saying that my recollection from my Texas days is that both points of view were presented. 
 You've been called an earth-mother Republican. 
 I'm from Austin, Tex. There are a lot more earth mothers per capita in Austin, Tex., than there are in Washington, D.C., or Alexandria, Va. 
 How would you define an earth mother? 
 Oh, I nursed my daughters for a year and nine months -- one for a year and one for nine months. And I used cloth diapers and made my own baby food, and I didn't put my kids on a bunch of antibiotics. 
 Do you think children should be allowed to watch television during the week?
 You mean at school?
 No, at home.
 The president says, and I completely agree, to read as much as you watch TV. If you watch TV for an hour, then you read for an hour. 
 Does the president have a nickname for you? 
 Yes. It's Margarita. 
 Is that something you like to drink? 
 I do. 
 With salt? 
 Frozen, no salt. Although my own self, I'm a little salty, as you can tell. Deborah Solomon

HEADLINE: The Legacy Project

BYLINE: By Jeff Shesol. 
Jeff Shesol is the author of ''Mutual Contempt: Lyndon Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and the Feud That Defined a Decade,'' and was a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton.

 BODY:
Just about one year ago, as millions of television viewers watched the sun set in Simi Valley, Calif. -- the terminus of Ronald Reagan's cross-country funeral procession -- the late president's advance men called an end to Operation Serenade, their code name for this national farewell. In a manner that recalled Reagan's time in the White House, every move had been carefully choreographed. This was no ordinary funeral. ''This,'' as one former advance man said, ''is a legacy-building event.''
 That work goes on, with Reagan's acolytes still building and burnishing. The Reagan Legacy Project, started in 1997 by the conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist, seeks to name something -- a stadium, a stretch of turnpike, anything -- after Reagan in every state in the union. 
 The chain bookstores, for their part, now feature a virtual Reagan wing, their shelves stuffed full of character studies, coffee-table confections, speech anthologies, hagiographies and mash notes. Beyond a basic hunger for heroes, this great cascade of Reagan lit reflects a mounting effort to retool the Reagan narrative. 
 What could be wrong with the old story line? Few modern presidents could boast a better one: Reagan, it is said, was a great communicator, made America proud again, ended the cold war. ''All in all, not bad,'' as Reagan said in his farewell address. ''Not bad at all.''
 No, not bad. But for some, still not good enough. ''Great communicator'' sticks in their throats. They detect condescension in the term, a backhandedness, as when one politician calls another a ''great politician.'' 
 A communicator, however great he may be, is not necessarily a thinker. And so a growing number of conservatives are at work on a correction. They do not deny Reagan's persuasiveness, but argue that it was indicative of, and secondary to, a powerful intellect.
 The revised story line runs something like this:
 Leftish elites, the news media and disgruntled former aides dismissed Reagan as an ''amiable dunce'' (in a well-known epithet of the 1980's). But recently released documents show the clarity, originality and depth of his thinking. Reagan, by this telling, was not simply his party's pitchman, he was its idea man: the Jefferson of modern conservatism, writing its founding documents by hand.
 Reagan's intellectual stock has indeed been climbing since the publication, in 2001, of ''Reagan, in His Own Hand,'' a collection of handwritten radio scripts from the mid-to-late 1970's, when Reagan, mostly unaided by speechwriters, tested his arguments on a national audience.
 The impressive assortment of subjects in these audio essays (from Namibia to the United States Postal Service to Lee Harvey Oswald), along with their detail, wit and remarkable concision, has, in the view of the biographer Lou Cannon, made ''mincemeat of the idea that Reagan was a dunce, amiable or otherwise.''
 ''In His Own Hand'' was just an opening salvo. Its editors have issued two follow-up books: first, a compendium of letters (''Reagan: A Life in Letters''), and second, another batch of radio scripts (''Reagan's Path to Victory''). 
 The basic contention of these volumes -- that Ronald Reagan was brighter than most believed -- is being amplified by a new group of revisionist historians. In ''Ronald Reagan and His Quest to Abolish Nuclear Weapons,'' Paul Lettow deems it ''demonstrably incorrect to argue that Reagan did not, or could not, think for himself, or that he was a mere cipher through which his advisers enacted their own agendas.'' Lettow portrays the president as a shrewd, hands-on manager, a principal architect of key policies like the Strategic Defense Initiative.
 Another recent book, ''Reagan's Revolution: The Untold Story of the Campaign That Started It All,'' by Craig Shirley, takes a similar view. Shirley, a Republican political consultant, recounts Reagan's effort to unseat President Gerald Ford in 1976 -- a failed attempt, but a smart and spirited one. An appearance at the National Press Club finds Reagan in top form, a candidate who ''deftly fielded one question after another and bested the Washington media at their own game.'' Taken together, these books make a powerful argument that Reagan's brain looked nothing like the ''bleak, ravaged landscape'' that Garry Trudeau envisaged in ''Doonesbury'' in the 1980's.
 Still, Reagan's intellectual rehabilitation can go only so far. It's true that he displays none of the ostentatious anti-intellectualism so prevalent in his party, from Spiro Agnew to George W. Bush. Yet he shows no great passion for ideas, either, beyond their utility. There is no sense of struggle in his writings, no careful weighing of views, no perceptible self-doubt -- none of the typical markers of a searching mind. Reagan does not ruminate so much as proselytize. In a letter from 1977, replying to a woman who has accused him of having a ''closed mind,'' Reagan offers charm, statistics and a predictable swipe at ''projects by bureaucrats which will further erode our freedom.''
 His brilliance -- as Garry Wills observed nearly two decades ago in ''Reagan's America'' -- was in his presentation of evidence and his near-perfect pitch. He understood America's hopes and fears -- and played to both. Which makes him less a great intellect than, well, a great communicator. 
 In any event, was Reagan's wattage ever really the issue? His critics -- and many of his closest advisers -- were less concerned about Reagan's intellectual capacity than about his lack of intellectual engagement in the Oval Office. Shirley is right: Reagan snapped and crackled in the 1970's. His radio addresses of that period show a sharpness of tongue and focus that seemed to abandon him in the White House, where -- as numerous accounts have suggested -- he seemed to go a bit fuzzy, tuning out and even falling asleep in meetings. This is the Reagan whose pose at press conferences -- head cocked, eyes unfocused, lips pursed in puzzlement -- launched a thousand parodies. This is the Reagan whose inattention engendered budget chicanery, vicious staff squalls and Iran-contra. Showing him to be smarter than we thought does not explain this away.
 Still, with the impending publication of Reagan's White House diaries, the legacy-building is likely to intensify -- if only because his followers are banking everything on him. In the pantheon of modern presidents, the Democrats claim Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy and Johnson. The Republicans have only Reagan. Neither Ford nor Nixon commands his party's devotion, and Eisenhower, who resisted McCarthyism, has little to offer the cultural and religious conservatives who dominate the party today.
 Reagan has become the Great Touchstone. Yet to be truly useful to his present-day heirs, his record has to be retouched. As president, he cut deals with Democrats; boosted taxes, public spending and the size of government; sought arms reductions with the Soviet Union; and did less than promised to regulate private behavior. Within the Reagan administration, the true believers, more often than not, lost badly at the hands of moderates.
 Badly, and bitterly. When the ideologues lashed back at Reagan -- which they did frequently -- they went not for his jugular but for his frontal lobe. Reagan's arms control initiatives led Howard Phillips, the chairman of the Conservative Caucus, to call the president ''a useful idiot for Soviet propaganda'' and ''little more than the speech reader in chief.'' Reagan's departures from economic orthodoxy prompted accusations of weakness, laziness and outright ignorance. The right, now ascendant, has absolved Reagan of these sins. His legacy, too, is being corrected. His pragmatism is being written out of the picture, replaced by ideological purity. His detachment is shrugged off as a left-wing myth.
 Nonbelievers may be tempted to dismiss all this as hero worship, but the legacy-building project is more than that. It is a strenuous act of self-promotion. Reagan's heirs attribute to him what they wish to see in themselves, or wish others to see in them. His redemption is their redemption. He is, as he must be, everything now -- at once the Great Oz and the man behind the curtain.

HEADLINE: The Believer

BYLINE: By Michael Sokolove. 
Michael Sokolove, author of ''The Ticket Out: Darryl Strawberry and the Boys of Crenshaw,'' is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Rick Santorum, the boyish-looking 47-year-old senator from Pennsylvania, could not, in more decorous political times, have risen to a position of much power in Congress. He has been impatient and sometimes impertinent -- the political equivalent of the too-rough kid on the playground who either doesn't know the rules of the game or just doesn't care to follow them. In the House in the early 1990's, he fell in with a band of junior Republicans (nicknamed the Gang of Seven) who pushed aggressive investigations of both Democrats and Republicans. Elected to the more mannered Senate in 1994, Santorum took to the floor just months into his tenure displaying a sign for several days that read ''Where's Bill?'' to spotlight what he perceived as President Clinton's lack of leadership on balancing the federal budget. (Senator Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, commented that the young senator's style seemed more appropriate for ''an alehouse or beer tavern.'') In a much-publicized interview in 2003, he argued that the Supreme Court should not overturn state sodomy laws that ban homosexual sex and suggested that such a ruling would create a justification for bigamy, polygamy and incest. At one point, he even raised the specter of bestiality, using the phrase ''man on dog.'' 
 Santorum has not so much accommodated himself to Washington as the city, stylistically and politically, has moved in his direction. He became chairman of the Senate Republican Conference in 2000, his party's third-ranking leadership position. If he wins a third Senate term in 2006, he will most likely move up to Republican whip, the No. 2 spot. His influence already exceeds his rank. At a time when overt expressions of religiosity are increasingly a part of politics, Santorum is, with the exception of President Bush, the nation's pre-eminent faith-based politician -- a devout Catholic so valued by religious conservatives of all faiths that Time magazine recently included him on its list of America's ''25 Most Influential Evangelicals.'' Santorum told me that the recognition surprised him, but it also clearly pleased him. ''What that tells you,'' he said, ''is that I'm out front on a lot of issues that matter to people of faith.''
 Sean Reilly, a former aide to Santorum in the Senate and now a political consultant in Philadelphia, said that he has come to view his former boss in other than political terms. ''Rick Santorum is a Catholic missionary,'' he said. ''That's what he is. He's a Catholic missionary who happens to be in the Senate.''
 Santorum's energy, intelligence and self-confidence -- he is a man of convictions, not doubts -- all serve to enhance his power. His leadership position puts him in charge of ''message.'' Lately he has been talking about issues of poverty, and the initiatives he put forward in March, bundled in the Senate Republican Poverty Alleviation Agenda (tax breaks to increase giving to faith-based and community charities; a ''level playing field'' for faith-based groups; programs to promote fatherhood, strengthen families and mentor children of inmates), were consistent with his conservative values. 
 Few doubt that these ideas come from a place of feeling. But they are also politically potent, a compass for where the Republican Party wants to go: right at ''values'' voters in the heart of what has long been considered safe Democratic territory. And Santorum has been something of a trailblazer in this regard, despite his reputation as one of Congress's most partisan and polarizing figures. When he last ran in 2000, he was endorsed by The Philadelphia Tribune, the city's largest black newspaper, and also by the Black Clergy of Philadelphia and Vicinity. The support did not translate into many votes, but in a ''light blue'' state like Pennsylvania, it is enough for a Republican just to chip away, to cut into the huge plurality that a Democrat must take away from a city like Philadelphia -- much as President Bush did in November in the decisive state of Ohio, where his narrow victory was partly attributed to winning 16 percent of the black vote, better than the 9 percent he won in 2000.
 ''The president worked at this same game among African-Americans and even more so among Hispanics in November,'' says Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat who has worked with Santorum on faith-based initiatives. ''Small changes can make a big difference in national and state elections.''
 Santorum will need to search for votes in every niche and subsegment of the electorate, because even as he grows in stature nationally, he is endangered in his own state. Pennsylvania has voted for a Democrat in four consecutive presidential elections. It has a Democratic governor, and its other senator, Arlen Specter, is a pro-choice moderate Republican. Santorum's race is likely to be the featured national political event next year in terms of attention, money and passion -- largely because the Democrats would so dearly love to vanquish him. They would, in fact, consider his defeat a kind of trophy. ''He has become to many people the apotheosis of the uncompromising, hard-right senator,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told me. ''When I go to places in any part of the country, people ask me: Can we beat Santorum?''
 Even his Democratic challenger signifies Santorum's influence. The national party and Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania have chosen Robert Casey Jr., an abortion opponent, a Catholic and the son of the late Gov. Robert Casey Sr., who was barred from speaking at the 1992 Democratic National Convention because of his antiabortion views. (Casey Sr. was the defendant in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the landmark case in which the Supreme Court upheld the right to abortion it initially found in Roe v. Wade.) Santorum trails Casey in early polls, but in one sense he has already won: no matter who wins the election, his position on abortion, Santorum's central issue, will be represented in Washington.
Santorum is about 6-foot-2 and fit-looking from regular games of tennis. He has an approachable, often wisecracking manner, nearly the opposite of the stereotypically imperious senator. Staff members address him as Boss, or sometimes just Rick. He is quick-witted and tart enough to be a favored guest on Don Imus's morning radio show. When he speaks in public, he often stands with his hands stuffed in the trouser pockets of his suit, as if he is still growing accustomed to business attire. He projects a kinetic rather than a contemplative aura, and his hectic schedule -- rapid-fire meetings in his Senate offices, some lasting no longer than five minutes; phone calls and photo ops between meetings; power walks through the corridors of Congress to cast votes -- seems to invigorate rather than fatigue him.
 Even when he talks to visitors in his private office, he is not entirely still; he sits on a rocker just in front of his desk and gently sways. ''What are you guys here for?'' I heard him ask a small group waiting to speak to him at his Capitol Hill office. They were from a dental association, wanting to lobby him about proposed legislation that would allow nondentists to do extractions on indigenous populations in Alaska. (They were worried that it might start a trend that would migrate down to the Lower 48.) Santorum listened for a short time, then got right to the point: ''So you want me to make sure this doesn't pass?''
 Santorum has never entirely shed his image as someone not quite fit for polite political company -- he is the senator as hyperactive political pugilist, quick to engage in combat, slow to yield the floor, a little too eager to crush opponents. His instinct runs more toward total victory than to meeting somewhere in the middle. He has become important, a man for the political times, partly because he understands the Senate's courtly veneer as just that -- a fiction. He likes to fight from the extremes and disdains political moderation as wishy-washiness. He respects Democrats like Representative Henry Waxman of California; Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin; and the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota -- determined, passionate liberals. ''They're out there because they really believe this,'' he said. ''This is from their core. They're true believers, God bless them. That's what political discourse is all about. You bring in your moral code, or worldview, and I bring in mine.''
 Santorum said he believes he has forged better relations with Senate Democrats, and Lieberman had kind words. ''People associate him just with these issues,'' he said, referring to Santorum's right-wing positions. ''But he is more complex than that. He has a faith-based concern about poverty, and he's prepared to fight for more money than the administration wants to allot.'' But a Democratic senator who would talk only on the condition his name not be used said: ''I'm shocked to see him in leadership, because of his comportment and general disdain for everybody else. There have to be moments of compromise, but with him, it's his way or no way. He really is doctrinaire and sanctimonious.''
 A long list of Democratic senators declined to talk, in most cases, I was told by staff members, out of a sense of senatorial civility; if they had nothing good to say, they preferred not to be quoted. But there is another reason, perhaps, for their timidity: Santorum is associated, above all, with faith, an issue the Democrats are struggling to put words to. Taking him on would require talking about faith as forthrightly as he does; it would mean defining its place in public life without seeming to oppose religion itself. (The Democrats' difficulty with this very issue was on display in the Terri Schiavo case, when they were notably silent, and compliant, even as Republicans took positions opposed by most Americans, according to polls.)
 In the summer of 1999, Santorum gave a lecture at the Heritage Foundation in Washington titled ''The Necessity of Truth.'' It can be read as a distillation of his philosophy. He began by identifying what he considers an oddity of American culture, the ''paradox,'' he called it, ''of a people that strive to be both religious and nonjudgmental.'' He then moved on to his central theme -- that Americans of faith feel constrained from expressing their views in ''the public square,'' where legislation and public policy are debated.
 ''How is it possible, I wonder, to believe in the existence of God yet refuse to express outrage when his moral code is flouted?'' he asked that day. ''To have faith in God, but to reject moral absolutes? How is it possible that there exists so little space in the public square for expressions of faith and the standards that follow from belief in a transcendent God?''
 The United States has a higher percentage of churchgoers than any industrialized nation, a higher percentage of professed believers and a vast diversity of religious communities -- all implying a widespread freedom to worship. But a key to understanding Santorum (and many other religious conservatives) is to recognize his sincere belief that he is playing defense. As a person of faith, he feels under attack, even victimized. He has stepped forward as a defender of the unborn, of religious Americans whose voices have been stifled and of cherished institutions that he considers not only under assault but also breakable.
 Marriage -- defined as the union between one man and one woman -- falls into the fragile category. Santorum supports a Constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriage, which he equates to ''messing with the basic family unit.'' He says he does not believe that a right to privacy -- the basis of court decisions legalizing abortion and overturning sodomy laws -- can truly be found in the Constitution, and he says he fears that the same legal reasoning could be employed to legalize gay marriage. Returning in 2003 to the Heritage Foundation to speak on ''The Necessity of Marriage,'' he said: ''The notion of a right to privacy is not about the common good, but about 'me.' Starting during the sexual revolution with contraception, it quickly evolved to abortion, and now it has found its way into today's marriage debate.''
 To Santorum, who is married and the father of six children (as well as one who died shortly after birth), marriage is primarily about procreation and child rearing, and a union without at least that possibility need not be legally sanctioned. ''Society's interest in marriage is the future,'' he told me. ''It is the next generation. It is in providing a stable environment for the raising of children. That's why we give marriage a special status, not because people like to hang out together and have fun.''
 Santorum rarely argues from a purely religious viewpoint. His line of reasoning usually goes like this: The founding fathers were men of faith. They believed in a nation based on traditional, religiously derived values, the same ''moral absolutes'' that he finds in his faith, and to diverge from them is to undermine the health of American society. The same reasoning, taken to its extreme, edges toward treating the Constitution as a kind of Christian document, but Santorum doesn't go quite that far.
 When I asked him if he viewed gay marriage as a threat to his own marriage, he answered quickly. ''Yes, absolutely,'' he said. ''It threatens my marriage. It threatens all marriages. It threatens the traditional values of this country.''
 Santorum is not cautious in the positions he takes or the language he uses, and to his credit, he rarely backs off statements that, upon seeing print, can seem somewhat bizarre. He is more likely to expand on them. In 2002, in a little-noticed interview that took place in Rome, Santorum told National Catholic Reporter, a U.S.-based weekly, that he considered George W. Bush, a Methodist, to be ''the first Catholic president of the United States.'' (His remark was reminiscent of the novelist Toni Morrison's saying that Bill Clinton was the nation's first black president, although an obvious difference is that there actually has been a Catholic president.) Santorum explained his claim to me: ''What I meant was if you look at the two major issues of the church, it's sanctity of life, sanctity of marriage and the family -- and third is care for the poor. And you have a president who is consistent with Catholic social teaching on all of these issues.''
 And what about John F. Kennedy? Santorum says he believes that in a political sense, Kennedy shed his Catholicism. (Kennedy's most famous statement on church and state was: ''I do not speak for my church on public matters -- and the church does not speak for me.'') ''I can understand and even defend him in some respects for doing so,'' Santorum said. ''There was still a very anti-Catholic bias, certainly among Southerners.'' Other Catholic politicians, he continued, ''have sort of adopted that same line, that they are going to hold that part of themselves off to the side, which has led to people who want to completely separate moral views from public life, which is a dangerous thing.''
 Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, is far from Santorum on most social issues but close to him personally. A Catholic, she has attended the catechism classes he holds in the Capitol. She wasn't familiar with his statement in National Catholic Reporter and let out a little chortle upon hearing it. ''That is so vintage Rick,'' she said. ''One of the things I like best about him is he is completely authentic. I would draw the line differently than where he does. But he believes there should be more of an intertwining of government and religion, and he believes it passionately.''
I talked to Santorum several times over the course of a month in Washington, and I also traveled with him one day to Allentown, a struggling, midsize city about an hour north of Philadelphia. The core of the city has become largely Hispanic, mainly Puerto Rican. The people he encountered spoke to him, at times, as if he were a visiting holy man. ''You're a man of Christian principles and values, and our people will embrace you because your values are our values,'' Wanda Mercado-Arroyo, a Republican and community activist, told him as they rode in a car between events. Santorum just sort of nodded and smiled.
 Santorum is considered a keen strategist, someone who knows voting patterns across his state down to the precinct level. He likes to tell the story of how he initiated a major revitalization effort in Chester, an impoverished city south of Philadelphia, during his first term, then actually pulled fewer votes from there in the next election. So he does not assume that coming to a place like this will instantly yield votes. ''You hear 'public servant,' and everyone just sort of blows over the 'servant' part,'' he said when I asked about the political motivations of his antipoverty initiatives. ''But I really do take it seriously. I want to make a difference in people's lives and serve others.'' Later he noted another motivation: ''I want to see if what I believe in works.''
 Part of politics, though, is persuading, and a politician persuades over time. He seeds an area so that he, or even some other candidate of the same party, will reap the bounty, if not in the next election then perhaps in the one after that. The main event in Allentown was on a Monday morning at the Church of God, a congregation of Hispanic Pentecostals. It was not a big gathering, just a couple of dozen people. Santorum spoke in front of the pulpit, with a stained-glass window and a portrait of Jesus behind him. He seemed to want to talk about economic development and President Bush's plan to partly privatize Social Security, which he enthusiastically supports, but many of the questions were on social issues.
 To a woman who wanted to know how soon Roe v. Wade could be overturned, he said it was ''not imminent'' and called for ''support for women with unintended pregnancies'' and for ''love for all God's children.'' Several times he used the phrase ''culture of life,'' which for religious conservatives generally encompasses opposition to abortion, embryonic stem-cell research and euthanasia (but not always opposition to the death penalty, which Santorum supports). Someone else in the audience complained that the local schools were substandard, and Santorum used that as an opportunity to touch a broader theme. ''What's needed,'' he replied, ''is to give parents real control, as opposed to what we have today, the control in the hands of the bureaucrats and the experts.''
 His answer was an echo of Republican attacks on federal judges, the news media and perceived elites of all kinds, and I asked him about it later. Why would the parents in this struggling community, or any community, be better at running a school district than professionals trained to do just that? I began to say that in my own children's schools, the curriculum is designed by -- 
 ''Experts!'' he interjected. ''The curriculums are designed by experts. But even though they may be experts, they are narrow experts.''
 At the Church of God that day, I met Sandra Vazquez-Zawistowski, a 41-year-old mother of two and the secretary of the local Latino Republican Committee. I asked about the party affiliation of the Hispanic voters in her area, and she replied, in a tone of serene confidence, that most of them were not currently Republicans -- but they would be just as soon as they received the correct information. ''They tend to vote for Democrats, but we're explaining to them that they are actually Republicans,'' she said. ''They are pro-life, pro-marriage between a man and a woman, which is what Republicans believe, so eventually they will vote that way.''
Santorum's parents were employees of the Veterans Administration -- his father was a psychologist, his mother a nurse -- and for most of his childhood he lived in a small house on the grounds of a V. A. hospital near Pittsburgh. Prayers were said at dinner and bedtime, and the family attended church every Sunday, no excuses accepted. ''You had to basically be dead not to go,'' Santorum told me. ''If you could watch television, if you could get up and walk, you could go. You went unless you were to the point of coughing constantly and you would infect the whole church.''
 Even so, Santorum recalls the Catholicism he grew up with to have been more dutiful than intense, part of how the family defined itself but not at the center of its daily life. Nor were the Santorums particularly political. His younger brother, Dan (he also has an older sister), describes them as ''the ultimate sports family.'' ''That's what we did; whatever was on, we all got together and watched. I didn't even know if my parents were Republicans or Democrats, and I don't know if Rick knew either.''
 Santorum went to Penn State and majored in political science, and then for five years after college and during law school, he worked for Doyle Corman, a moderate Republican state senator in central Pennsylvania. ''My husband and I are both pro-choice,'' Becky Corman says. ''One of the interesting things about Rick is, the whole time he worked for us, we didn't know what his views were on that issue.''
 Becky Corman was among several people who told me they assumed Santorum came to a deeper Catholic faith and some of his more conservative views through the influence of his wife, Karen Garver Santorum, who grew up in a family of 12 children. Santorum, though, said that was not accurate and that his wife's family had been similar to his own -- churchgoing Catholics but not intense in their faith. ''I met her after I moved to Pittsburgh. I had gone through a time when I wasn't even particularly dutiful, during college and after college,'' he said. ''I was sort of a single guy, just trying to get what I thought I needed for whatever career I thought I wanted to pursue. Karen was going through a similar experience. So we sort of went through all of this together.''
 Through his 20's and early 30's, Santorum earned an M.B.A. and a law degree, started a job at a Pittsburgh law firm (where he briefly lobbied for the World Wrestling Federation), then twice won election to the U.S. House of Representatives. After winning his first six-year term in the Senate, he said: ''I finally had time to think about: What am I going to do here? What kind of senator am I going to be? What kind of father, husband?''
 Dan Santorum, who is C.E.O. of the Professional Tennis Registry, an organization of teaching pros, said he considered his brother's deepening involvement in religion to be a function of his personality -- specifically, of his almost congenital inability to do anything halfheartedly. ''Rick has always been that way, in anything he has ever done,'' he said. ''Card games. Board games. Grades. Whatever it is he's doing, he's completely caught up in it. We were, for the time, good practicing Catholics, but Rick took it further.''
 Santorum attends Mass most weekday mornings at St. Joseph's church, a couple of blocks from the Capitol. On Sundays, he worships at St. Catherine of Siena in Great Falls, Va., which Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, among other prominent Washington Catholics, also attends and where Mass is celebrated in Latin by priests who face the cross, their backs to the congregation. He helped convert a fellow senator, Sam Brownback of Kansas, to Catholicism, and he also recently organized a study group for fellow Catholics in Congress, which is led by a local priest. (Only Republicans, however, have been invited.)
 In college and during much of Santorum's tenure with Doyle Corman, his main interest in politics was tactical; now the tactics have been put in service to his beliefs. Not surprisingly, he was one of the lead senators urging federal intervention in the Terri Schiavo case. He told me that at one point he informed Bill Frist, the majority leader, that he would keep the Senate in session through its Easter break if lawmakers tried to adjourn without first stepping in.
 ''I said to the leader: 'We're not leaving here until we pass this,' '' he told me. I've got a hundred budget amendments that I'm willing to file, and we'll vote for days because I'll just keep filing. Let the folks know we'll be here for a long time.' ''
Rick and Karen Santorum, a former nurse and a nonpracticing attorney, have six children between the ages of 2 and 14, and live in Leesburg, Va., about an hour from Washington and as close to Washington as they could afford a home big enough for their family. (Karen Santorum would not be interviewed for this article.) Santorum drives himself to and from Capitol Hill in a 2001 Chevy TrailBlazer. He will not work Sundays, except in extraordinary circumstances, and he rarely stays overnight when traveling because he does not like to be away from his family. He tends a large vegetable garden and several fruit trees, cuts his own grass and does home repairs. Santorum says he does not want his home-state voters to think he feels impoverished on his $162,100 Senate salary, but it is clear that money is a concern and that he is almost certainly one of the least well-off among the 100 senators.
 ''We live paycheck to paycheck, absolutely,'' he says. Does he have money set aside for college? ''No. None. I always tell my kids: 'Work hard. We'll take out loans. Whatever.' '' He volunteers that his parents help out financially. ''They're by no means wealthy -- they're two retired V. A. employees -- but they'll send a check every now and then. They realize things are a little tighter for us.''
 Santorum is far too competitive to want to lose his Senate seat, but he operates in Washington like a man who is not afraid of defeat and, on some level, would welcome its benefits. More than once in our conversations, he mentioned that losing would not be without a financial upside. ''Everyone says, 'Senator, the worst thing that could happen to you is you could lose and spend more time with your kids and help pay for college,' '' he told me. On the other hand, the advantage of winning yet again when you're not supposed to -- Santorum won election to the House in 1990 by beating a seven-term Democratic incumbent, and he views several of his other races as longshot victories -- is that ''it gives you the freedom to do what you truly believe is right,'' he said. A Senate aide who refused to go on the record about a fellow Republican said to me, ''He's pretty vulnerable, right?'' marveling that Santorum has been out front on Bush's plan to partly privatize Social Security, which polls indicate is unpopular in Pennsylvania and most of the rest of the nation.
 The Santorum children are home-schooled by Karen Santorum, but the family benefited from more than $70,000 provided by the state and the Penn Hills School District, outside of Pittsburgh, for several years of tuition to the Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School. State law requires school districts to pay 80 percent of tuition for students in their district enrolled in cyberschools, but Penn Hills and the state are looking into whether the Santorums must repay the money, since the Santorums, despite owning a home there, live in Virginia full time. Santorum told me that he considered this squabble politically inspired, and that because he owns a house in Penn Hills and paid real-estate taxes there, he was entitled to the charter-school tuition.
 In 1999, the family received a malpractice award after Karen Santorum sued a chiropractor in Virginia. She testified that she sought treatment for back pain after childbirth in 1996 and suffered a ruptured disk from an improperly administered spinal manipulation. Santorum has been a vocal critic of large malpractice awards and has backed measures to limit damages. Karen Santorum asked for $500,000 and was awarded $350,000 by a jury. A judge finally reduced the award to $175,000, of which Santorum said they received about $75,000 after their lawyer took his share. ''I'm not against all lawsuits,'' Santorum said. ''I think they're appropriate where the case warrants it, and this one did. It was not frivolous.''
 The childbirth in 1996 was a source of terrible heartbreak -- the couple were told by doctors early in the pregnancy that the baby Karen was carrying had a fatal defect and would survive only for a short time outside the womb. According to Karen Santorum's book, ''Letters to Gabriel: The True Story of Gabriel Michael Santorum,'' she later developed a life-threatening intrauterine infection and a fever that reached nearly 105 degrees. She went into labor when she was 20 weeks pregnant. After resisting at first, she allowed doctors to give her the drug Pitocin to speed the birth. Gabriel lived just two hours.
 What happened after the death is a kind of snapshot of a cultural divide. Some would find it discomforting, strange, even ghoulish -- others brave and deeply spiritual. Rick and Karen Santorum would not let the morgue take the corpse of their newborn; they slept that night in the hospital with their lifeless baby between them. The next day, they took him home. ''Your siblings could not have been more excited about you!'' Karen writes in the book, which takes the form of letters to Gabriel, mostly while he is in utero. ''Elizabeth and Johnny held you with so much love and tenderness. Elizabeth proudly announced to everyone as she cuddled you, 'This is my baby brother, Gabriel; he is an angel.' ''
John F. Kennedy wrote in 1959: ''It is my firm belief that there should be separation of church and state as we understand it in the United States -- that is, that both church and state should be free to operate, without interference from each other in their respective areas of jurisdiction. We live in a liberal, democratic society which embraces wide varieties of belief and disbelief.''
 It is fair to say that Santorum believes in a more complementary relationship between church and state -- respective jurisdictions, yes, but with many more bridges and emissaries connecting them. Aside from his opposition to abortion and his strong views on other ''culture of life'' questions, the concept of government giving to religious charities -- faith-based help -- is the issue closest to his heart. He says that his faith taught him never to equate poverty or lack of achievement with character, so it is a given, to Santorum, that some people will always need help. ''We always did things for the poor,'' he said. ''I remember my dad always saying, 'If you have extra money, put it in the poor box at the back of the church.' ''
 He has a different way of giving now and, he says, a more powerful means to help. One afternoon in Philadelphia, the Rev. Herb Lusk, a friend and ally of Santorum's who was known as the praying tailback when he played for the Philadelphia Eagles, showed me around his church and nonprofit social-service agency, called People for People, which takes up all eight floors of the city's former traffic-court building. The enterprise is impressive in its scale. Lusk provides job training, child care, G.E.D. tutoring and mentoring to children of inmates. He also oversees a day-care program, a 700-student charter school and a credit union. The top floor of his building, a catering hall called the View, affords a panorama of Philadelphia and is rented out for weddings and parties. Lusk said his nonprofit is acquiring hundreds of parcels of land in the area, and under what has been dubbed the Triangle Plan, it plans to build a mix of housing and retail stores. In all, Lusk employs more than 200 people.
 ''What you're looking at is a faith-based nonprofit empire,'' Lusk said. ''I don't say that to be braggadocious. That's just a fact.''
 Much of what People for People does amounts to work that has essentially been outsourced from government, just as it has been, for years, to Catholic Social Services, Jewish Family Service and other large nonprofit agencies. Lusk has caseworkers, just like the state welfare department. He told me that his organization receives about $10 million a year in public money; Santorum has also helped seed the People for People Community Development Credit Union by depositing $250,000 in campaign funds, for which he asked no interest.
 ''Rick is my friend,'' said Lusk, who is black, adding that his support of Santorum and other Republicans has caused him to be called an Uncle Tom, and worse. ''Oh, it was taboo. I was out of touch with my people and so forth. But Rick's support, it doesn't go away, so you have to pay attention to it. Why is this man continuing to be here, to spend time here, even as he gets killed in Philadelphia? I'm sure he would like to win Philadelphia if he could, but that's not realistic.''
 Government giving to religious charities is not new, but the Bush administration's focus on it, and intense efforts by Santorum and others to expand the programs, are new. Also, Santorum, Bush and other Republican advocates for faith-based giving have worked to expand the base of those who receive money, beyond the traditional big charities that know how to write grant applications and have established relationships with government agencies. Depending on how you look at it, this is either good social policy, good politics, a dangerous blurring of church and state, an expansion of political patronage -- or some combination of all these things. ''They've leveled the playing field for the mom-and-pop shop to compete for the resources,'' Lusk said, although he has grown well beyond that.
 Lusk went on to say that he and Santorum ''agree on matters of faith,'' and that social issues were part of what bound them. When I asked which ones, he said: ''Gay marriage, mainly. That's nonnegotiable.''
 Lusk showed me several classrooms with new computers lined up side by side, hundreds of them altogether. They are used for training in the welfare-to-work program and are ''state of the art,'' he said, which he insists on because he does not believe anyone will hire people trained on inferior equipment. But as Lusk was leading me through his complex, almost all of the computers were sitting idle. It occurred to me that if this were a government agency, someone could very well view these empty, computer-filled classrooms, fairly or unfairly, as an example of government waste.
 Lusk explained that he must ''put up a firewall'' between the work he does for his taxpayer-financed nonprofit and his role as the spiritual leader of the Greater Exodus Baptist Church. ''You're not allowed to proselytize,'' Lusk said. ''However, ultimately, I am a church man. I'm not trying to win people over to the Philadelphia Eagles, or George W., or Rick Santorum. I'm trying to win people for the Lord.''
 His solution is to feed the clients of his nonprofit agency a free lunch every day at his church. ''And there will always be someone at that lunch giving their testimony about their relationship with the Lord,'' he said. ''That's the way we do it. Jesus always operated around food, banquets and so forth. It's always been a nice attraction.''
In Santorum's ideal world, ministers who receive federal money for social-service programs and who feel constrained by regulations against proselytizing -- who must ''take off one hat and put on another,'' as Lusk put it -- would be liberated to be men of God no matter whose dime is financing their good works. Catholic Charities, which Santorum says he believes has become ''basically just another social-service agency, because they've sort of lost their identity,'' would regain its Catholic character.
 Santorum's view is that government programs to help people in need are almost destined to fail, and that a social worker, a substance-abuse counselor or a nurse receiving a paycheck from a faith-based group, rather than from government, will be more caring and more likely to get results. This seems like a stereotype -- a government-employed social worker may, after all, have the same training as the one working for a charity and the same urgent calling to help others -- but Santorum nonetheless sees the secular world as intrinsically cold and unfeeling. Filled with experts.
 ''The whole idea of funding people of faith is not just to provide good human services,'' he told me. ''It's also to provide good human services with that additional touch, if you will, with that aspect of healing that comes through that spiritual interaction. If you talk to folks who are out there on the front lines fighting these battles in the neighborhoods, this is an intricate part of turning lives around, particularly in people who have really hit the bottom. You find very few who rise back up without some element of something bigger that's helping them. You can't ignore the importance of the spiritual part of someone's life and say you're going to solve their problems. You're throwing good money after bad.''
 All of this is a matter of sharp debate between people who believe the founding fathers intended a strict division between church and state, a distanced neutrality, and those who, like Santorum, argue that they actually had a preference for faith in public life but simply did not want to establish an official state church. At ground level, these questions play out as more than abstract philosophical debates. One area of conflict is whether religious organizations receiving federal money should be allowed to hire according to their ''belief systems'' -- to discriminate, for example, against job seekers who are non-Christians, nonbelievers, gay or even divorced.
 This is not considered a matter of settled law; a Supreme Court ruling allows religious groups to consider faith in hiring, but future rulings may have to determine whether they can do so when using federal funds. The Bush administration issued an executive order that allows religious organizations in receipt of taxpayer money to ''take their faith into account when making employment decisions'' -- an edict that Senator Edward M. Kennedy has characterized as ''permitting federally funded discrimination.''
 Santorum told me that no organization, even one using tax dollars, should have to employ someone ''who is at cross purposes with the mission of what the charity is.'' He would go a step further in loosening the reins on charities by letting them read from Bibles and speak of their faith. He said he did not see the difference between a Bible and ''the teachings of Aristotle -- that's a philosophy of life.'' He added: ''Here you have a book that's been pretty well tested over time. So to say, here are some passages from the Bible that may help you, I don't necessarily see that as a negative.''
We were in Allentown, eating breakfast at a diner, when I relayed to Santorum his former aide's observation that he is like a Catholic missionary in the Senate. He winced. ''I don't know about that,'' he said.
 But Santorum does seem increasingly comfortable putting his personal faith out front. He not only pushed the Senate to intervene in the Terri Schiavo case, but he also traveled to Florida and prayed with her parents. (News reports noted that he attended fund-raisers for his Senate campaign while he was in Florida.) Just a few hours after Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was elected as the 265th pope of the Roman Catholic Church, Santorum's Senate office released a statement of congratulations that went well beyond the routine offering of prayers and best wishes. It read, in part, ''I pray for Pope Benedict XVI as he begins his new role as the most reverent disciple of our Lord here on earth.''
 In an interview that same day on CNN, Santorum aligned himself not so much with American Catholics as with more traditional-minded ones in the third world. With evident approval of Ratzinger, he said: ''What you saw is an affirmation by the cardinals that the church is not going to change, even though maybe Europe and North America want it to. It is going to stay the way it has been for 2,000 years.''
 There is one issue, the death penalty, on which Santorum would seem to be out of step with the Vatican. Pope John Paul II declared in 1995 that ''the direct and voluntary killing of an innocent human being is always gravely immoral.'' (He also opposed the Iraq war.) In March, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops made a renewed call to end the death penalty. Santorum has focused on the word ''innocent'' in Pope John Paul's statement, in line with some conservative Catholic theologians who have written that the pope's statement was ''prudential,'' as opposed to a change in the doctrine of the church -- and therefore not a moral proposition that must be followed.
 ''I would argue that my position is not inconsistent,'' Santorum told me. ''One is innocent life and one is not. One has done harm, has committed crimes, and a person has to pay for the injustice they have caused. I have said publicly that I think in the 80's and early 90's we probably got a little carried away with the death penalty. To me, it should be used only in the most heinous situations.''
 Santorum is not a reader of Scripture -- ''I've never read the Bible cover to cover; maybe I should have'' -- and has no passages he clings to when seeking spiritual guidance. ''I'm a Catholic, so I'm not a biblical scholar. I'm not someone who has verses he can pop out. That's not how I interact with the faith.''
 He reads magazines and journals offering commentary on religion, among them First Things, which is edited by the theologian Richard John Neuhaus, a former Lutheran minister and a convert to Catholicism. In that and other publications, Santorum can find ample intellectual support not only for his beliefs but also for his duty to take them public. After Santorum's controversial remarks about homosexuality in the Associated Press interview in 2003, Neuhaus, writing in First Things (which is written and read by Catholics as well as evangelicals), defended Santorum's statements as an example of ''Catholic witness in the public square.''
 Neuhaus argues, as Santorum and many other social conservatives do, that more forthright expressions of faith in political life do not represent a departure from traditional civic culture but a return to it. ''The idea that religion is an intrusion on public life is a relatively recent idea,'' Neuhaus told me. ''This is a return to normality. This is all moral vocabulary.''
 But what some hear as moral vocabulary is received, by others, as an inundation of religious-tinged policies, legislation and political rhetoric -- and in some cases, as an infringement on privacy and the right to live by your own moral code. Barry Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, was almost apoplectic in talking about Santorum. ''He is a very, very radical individual,'' he said, ''who wants to impose his religious dogma through law and legislation on everybody in America.''
 Some of Santorum's supporters, however, say they believe that his faith leads him into terrain that has been abandoned by other social conservatives. David Kuo, the former deputy director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, says he has come to believe that, on social issues, the hard right of the Republican party is concerned too much with behavior, primarily abortion and homosexuality, and too little with poverty. He considered Santorum the exception. ''He was a singular voice in Republican leadership fighting for antipoverty legislation,'' Kuo said. ''He kept pushing it. I was in meetings when people would start rolling their eyes when he started talking about it. It is very much at odds with the public perception of him. He fought behind the scenes where nobody could see it. His compassion is genuine.''
 Bob Kerrey, the former senator from Nebraska and now president of New School University, had some bitter clashes with Santorum when they served together. He says now: ''I've come to believe that he is sincerely and impressively a man of faith. He is driven by his personal desire to do good. But at some point, money matters. We're not even close to spending enough to solve social problems. I don't know what he can do with his own party, but maybe he'll shame the liberals into doing more.''
 But it is no easy thing to be a low-tax, small-government Republican and an antipoverty crusader. Santorum has fought for more money for the community-development-block-grant program, a traditional source of grants to nonprofit groups in cities, which the Bush administration has cut. The package of faith-based legislation Santorum has sponsored with Lieberman, beginning in 2002, has yet to become law. President Bush, by executive order, has moved some of it forward, but the Charity Aid, Recovery and Empowerment Act -- which would provide tax incentives designed to spur giving to faith-based and community groups -- remains stalled.
 To this point, Santorum's impact has been much more in the realm of politics than lawmaking. ''When you have a budget crunch, everything gets squeezed,'' he said. ''I respect that. You just have to scrap and claw for whatever little money you can for the programs you believe are the most important.''
 He has sometimes cast votes -- as nearly every lawmaker in Washington does amid an atmosphere of gamesmanship and misdirection -- that seem inconsistent with his stated principles. Earlier this year, Santorum voted against a Democratic amendment to a bankruptcy bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $7.25, which would seemingly be one of the more efficient ways to get money to poor people. He offered his own amendment to hike it to $6.25 as part of a package that included tax cuts for small businesses and exemptions on overtime pay for some workers currently eligible for it.
 Both Santorum's plan and one offered by Senator Edward Kennedy failed, and the minimum wage remains at $5.15 -- where it has stood since 1997. Neither proposal was offered with much serious hope it would pass. Santorum voted for his own bill, but told reporters, ''I would hope candidly that we didn't pass either of these at this time.''
In February, the presidential adviser and Republican strategist Karl Rove made a plea for Santorum to a couple of thousand people gathered for a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington. ''If you're in a state that doesn't have a complicated election picture next year,'' he said, and if ''you might have a little time on your hands in 2006 come Election Day to do something good for the country, my recommendation is to make your reservation right now for a Motel 6 or Holiday Inn someplace in Pennsylvania to be helping this good guy get re-elected. Because he is going to be a target.''
 Republicans are desperate to save Santorum; Democrats are so burning to bring him down that party leaders quickly rallied around the socially conservative Bob Casey Jr. as his opponent. When their preference became known, another strong candidate, Barbara Hafer -- a onetime state treasurer and pro-choice former Republican who had recently become a Democrat -- stepped aside.
 The Casey name is something like a brand in Pennsylvania, so much so that politically unknown Caseys, unrelated to the ''real'' Caseys, have won office. So Santorum is in the unusual position of being a two-term U.S. senator who enjoys no name-recognition advantage over his opponent. A statewide poll taken in April showed Casey with a 14-point lead and also indicated that two factors -- Santorum's positions on Bush's Social Security proposal and his prominence in the Terri Schiavo case -- had driven his numbers down. (Santorum's races tend to turn nasty quickly, in no small part because of the vitriol he inspires in opponents. Casey's campaign manager recently blasted him for being ''the only member of Congress to intrude on Terri Schiavo's hospice.'')
 A poll taken more than a year and a half before an election may not be particularly meaningful except to confirm what was already known: Santorum will have no easy time staying in office. 
 I asked Santorum what he thought the race would be about. ''In terms of issues, it's too early to say,'' he answered. ''But I'm the incumbent, so basically, it'll be about me.''
 We were in the car in Allentown, and one of his children had called him on his cellphone, looking for guidance on how to prepare the garden. ''Just clear weeds, honey,'' he said, ''and when I get home we'll talk about what we're going to plant.''
 When he hung up, he turned his attention back to his Senate race. ''I'm O.K. with it being about me,'' he continued. ''I didn't come to Washington just to come back here. That's never been what I'm about. I've got other things I can do. As a U.S. senator, I've been given a gift of being able to make a difference in people's lives, a trust. I'm O.K. with the people deciding how I've done with that trust.''

HEADLINE: For American Jews, a Home in Exile

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
It was not the sort of welcome that would typically inspire commemoration. Twenty-three men, women and children, exiled from their homes, arrive in the port of New Amsterdam. The ship's skipper demands his payment. But the travelers had been robbed by pirates on the high seas on an earlier part of their journey and stripped of most belongings. 
 The courts authorize an auction in which their remaining goods are sold. The principal debtors are imprisoned. And Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch director general of New Netherland, also appeals to his employers at the Dutch West India Company to deny them permanent residence. He did not want Jews coming into New Amsterdam, and the human cargo that had made its way from Brazil consisted of Jews. 
 But however inauspicious this greeting was in September 1654, it has now become the spur for a season of commemoration, including at least three new museum exhibitions -- one at the Museum of the City of New York (''Tolerance & Identity: Jews in Early New York, 1654-1825'') and two at the Center for Jewish History (''Greetings From Home: 350 Years of American Jewish Life,'' presented by the American Jewish Historical Society, and ''Starting Over: The Experience of German Jews in America, 1830-1945,'' presented by the Leo Baeck Institute). 
 Partly this is because the date of that ship's arrival offers a numerically satisfying 350th anniversary, but it also marked the first community of Jews coming to settle in what was to become the United States.
 A bit forced, perhaps, as anniversaries go -- but there is still something unusual and subtle in what transpired during this initial encounter, something easy to miss amid the celebrations of what Jews later made of themselves in the United States and what the United States made of them. 
 Ultimately, it is a tale of successful immigrations. The exhibition ''Tolerance & Identity,'' in its portraits and displays, in its accounts of first synagogues and its samples of early correspondence, shows how dynasties of Jewish families took root. Some of these family trees lost branches through assimilation, some through tragedy. But over time they flourished at the center of New York's cultural, political and religious life of the 18th and early 19th centuries: writing, engaging in commerce and politics, donating books to the first public library, joining the first New York Chamber of Commerce. 
 More ambitiously, ''Greetings From Home'' tries to encompass 350 years of such interaction in two exhibition rooms. Attention is given to such figures as the Jewish philanthropist Adolphus S. Solomons (1826-1910) who founded what is now Mount Sinai Hospital and worked with Clara Barton to create the American Red Cross. Here, too, is a photograph showing the primal origins of the city's department stores among Jewish immigrants (Abraham & Straus, Macy's, Gimbel's) and rare items like an 1891 Yiddish-English phrase book for prospective immigrants, which teaches the aspirant phrases like ''I never saw such a handsome head as yours'' or ''My hand is tired with working.'' 
 There is almost too much in this exhibition, and much of it is familiar in general character if not in detail. But it also says something about the tensions of the American Jewish experience to see a 1913 passport application in which the Hungarian-born Eric Weiss, using sleight of mind if not of hand, announces himself as Harry Houdini, a native of Wisconsin. And surely, too, not all was smooth going. A young woman's college rejection letter from 1947 reads, ''It is with regret that we are obliged to return your application, but our Jewish quota has been filled for some time.''
 Nonetheless, the interaction of Jews with the United States was more profound, more wide-ranging and more successful than with any other country in recent history. And that success does indeed have a subtle connection to that first, inauspicious landing in New Amsterdam. 
 Peter Stuyvesant, after all, did not just oppose the Jewish settlement; he found Jews' very identity damning. He argued that they were ''deceitful,'' ''very repugnant'' and ''blasphemous.'' He believed that if they stayed, New Amsterdam would start down a slippery slope: let the Jews in, he wrote to his employers, and then ''we cannot refuse the Lutherans and Papists.'' 
 But the Dutch West India Company (which included Jews on its board) understood something the haughty overseer did not. Running New Amsterdam was not a matter of plundering colonial assets and shipping them back home; the Dutch had different ambitions. 
 As the historian Jonathan D. Sarna points out in his recent book, ''American Judaism,'' they had also learned how active Jews could be in industry and trade. New Amsterdam was a destination for Jews who had fled Spain and Portugal but who spoke their languages and remained in contact with citizens of their empires. 
 These were the Jews who, in a short time, helped turn the Dutch-run Brazilian city of Recife into an important center for Jewish life and a flourishing center of trade -- at least until it was captured by the Portuguese in 1654, which led to the escape of those 23 Jews to New Amsterdam. 
 Colonization, the Dutch West India Company seemed to suggest, is not a matter of exploitation. It requires certain kinds of relationships. Tradecraft is more than barter; it presumes a rational system of exchange, in which the particular individual's identity matters less than issues of trust and communication across cultural differences.
 The company was explicit about this, suggesting to Stuyvesant that he should ''allow every one to have his own belief, as long as he behaves quietly and legally, gives no offense to his neighbor and does not oppose the government.''
 The notion that economic life was related to a form of political freedom, that opportunity and responsibility were intertwined, created what we now call modernity. It gave the Jews their first home in exile. And for all the flaws and failings, something similar was offered to other immigrant groups over the course of 350 years -- which is why this anniversary is more important than it might seem.

HEADLINE: A Social Concern Turns Economic for Best Buy

BYLINE: By SARA IVRY

 BODY:
Youngsters who want to buy adult video games may have run up against a higher authority. Last week, Best Buy agreed to strengthen and publicize its efforts to keep minors from buying violent or sexually explicit video games after the company was pressured by the Christian Brothers Investment Services, which manages assets for Roman Catholic organizations. 
 The store's policy threatens disciplinary action against clerks who fail to check the ages of shoppers who look as if they may be under 21. It also permits the use of mystery shoppers -- spies, in other words -- to check whether clerks are observing the rules. 
 Best Buy agreed to post its policy on its Web site and on store signs after being threatened with a shareholder resolution asking for a report on how Best Buy complied with efforts to restrict the sale of explicit material. Also last week, the Illinois Senate approved the levying of fines against store owners who sell explicit games to minors. 
 Sue Busch, Best Buy's directory of public relations, rejected the suggestion that the disclosure action was simply to appease a bloc of investors. ''We wanted to make sure we were as open as possible so people could see how seriously we take their concerns,'' she said. 
 Cathy Rowan, who co-filed the proposed shareholder resolution on behalf of Trinity Health, a Catholic health care provider, said that she was particularly concerned over the games Halo, Manhunt, Hitman and Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto where players are rewarded if they kill cops or rape prostitutes, she said. ''Kids are going to play video games but are they being sold games that are really age inappropriate?'' 
 Nell Minnow, the editor of the Corporate Library, an independent research firm, said . ''There's not a bright line distinction between what used to be social policy issues and straight shareholder-value concerns.'' SARA IVRY

HEADLINE: America Wants Security

BYLINE: By Paul Krugman. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It was a carefully staged Norman Rockwell scene. The street was lined with American flags; a high school band played ''God Bless America.''
 Then, under the watchful gaze of Wal-Mart's chief operating officer, Maryland's governor vetoed a bill that would have obliged large businesses to spend more on employee health care.
 The news here isn't that some politicians wrap their deference to corporate interests in the flag. The news, instead, is that Maryland's State Legislature passed a pro-worker bill in the first place. In fact, the bill passed by a veto-proof majority in the Maryland Senate, and fell just short of that margin in the House. 
 After November's election, the victors claimed a mandate to unravel the welfare state. But the national election was about who would best defend us from gay married terrorists. At the state level, where elections were fought on bread-and-butter issues, voters sent a message that they wanted a stronger, not weaker, social safety net.
 I'm not just talking about the shift in partisan alignment, in which Democrats made modest gains in state legislatures, and achieved a few startling successes. I'm also talking about specific issues, like the lopsided votes in both Florida and Nevada for constitutional amendments raising the minimum wage.
 Since the election, high-profile right-wing initiatives, at both the federal and state level, have run into a stone wall of public disapproval. President Bush's privatization road show seems increasingly pathetic. In California, the conservative agenda of Arnold Schwarzenegger, including an attempt to partially privatize state pensions, has led to demonstrations by nurses, teachers, police officers and firefighters -- and to a crash in his approval ratings. 
 There's a very good reason voters, when given a chance to make a clear choice, increasingly support a stronger, not a weaker, social safety net: they need that net more than ever. Over the past 25 years the lives of working Americans have become ever less secure. Jobs come without health insurance; 401(k)'s vanish; corporations default on their pension obligations; workers lose their jobs more often, and unemployment lasts much longer than it used to. 
 The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC poll showed what the pollsters called an ''angry electorate.'' By huge margins, voters think that politicians are paying too little attention to their concerns, especially health care, jobs and gas prices.
 At the state level, many, though by no means all, politicians are responding to those concerns. The push to raise the minimum wage is a useful political barometer: seven states have raised the minimum in just the last two years.
 True, there are limits on what state governments can do: they fear that if they do too much for workers, they'll drive business and jobs away. I'd argue that the fear is often exaggerated. For example, Wal-Mart may avoid states that force it to provide health insurance, but given the hidden subsidies the company receives -- one way or another, taxpayers end up paying a lot for uninsured workers -- this may not be such a bad thing. Still, any major strengthening of the safety net will have to come at the federal level. 
 Why, then, is Washington so out of touch?
 At a gala dinner in his honor, Tom DeLay cited his party's recent achievements: ''bankruptcy reform, class-action reform, energy, border security, repealing the death tax.'' All of these measures are either irrelevant to or actively hostile to the economic security of working Americans. 
 Yet as Mr. DeLay boasted, many Democratic members of Congress also voted in support of these measures. In so doing, they undermined their party's ability to claim that it stands for something different. 
 So where will change come from?
 Everyone loves historical analogies. Here's my thought: maybe 2004 was 1928. During the 1920's, the national government followed doctrinaire conservative policies, but reformist policies that presaged the New Deal were already bubbling up in the states, especially in New York. 
 In 1928 Al Smith, the governor of New York, was defeated in an ugly presidential campaign in which Protestant preachers warned their flocks that a vote for the Catholic Smith was a vote for the devil. But four years later F.D.R. took office, and the New Deal began.
 Of course, the coming of the New Deal was hastened by a severe national depression. Strange to say, we may be working on that, too.

HEADLINE: Protesters, Both Jewish and Arab, Rail at the First Lady

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 22 

 BODY:
Laura Bush found herself immersed in the passions of the Middle East on Sunday, as her carefully devised trip to places holy to both Muslims and Jews attracted small numbers of vocal protesters.
 Mrs. Bush, on the third day of a five-day trip to the region, faced demonstrators at the Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall in Jerusalem. ''You are not welcome here!'' shouted a woman near the Dome of the Rock. ''Why are you hassling our Muslims?'' She apparently referred to the mistreatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in Afghanistan. Another woman said loudly: ''Koran! Koran!'' 
 Later in Jericho Mrs. Bush spoke of ''what an emotional place this is as we go from each one of these very, very holy sites to the next.'' After meeting separate groups of Israeli and Palestinian women, she said: ''What we all want is peace, and the chance that we have right now to have peace. To have a Palestinian state living by a secure state of Israel, both living in democracy, is as close as we've been in a really long time.'' The process would take ''a lot of baby steps, and I'm sure it will be a few steps backward on the way.'' 
 The United States would help, she said. But ''it also requires the work of the people here, of the Palestinians and the Israelis, to come to the table, obviously, and we'll see.''
 The main purpose of Mrs. Bush's visit to the region was to attend the World Economic Forum meeting on Saturday in Jordan, where she highlighted education and women's rights as central to democracy in the Middle East, a major theme of the Bush administration. But President Bush had encouraged her to visit Israel at the same time, and her schedule was carefully planned to provide parallel gestures to both Palestinians and Israelis.
 The Noble Sanctuary is known to Jews as the Temple Mount, and it is a potentially explosive spot of earth. It is the place where the first two ancient Jewish temples stood, the last destroyed by the Romans, and the Dome of the Rock is built over the place where the Prophet Muhammad is believed to have ascended to heaven.
 By the time Mrs. Bush, dressed in a black pantsuit with a black shawl over her hair, left the Muslim shrine, where about 20 protesters had gathered, the small crowd of onlookers seemed to better understand who this visitor was and pressed closer. 
 Mrs. Bush was surrounded by American security personnel and Israeli police officers who pushed back the crowd as she walked to her motorcade. She was never in danger, but the large presence of armed Israeli police officers, some in riot gear, angered the demonstrators.
 Israeli security officials fear right-wing Israelis may attack the sacred Islamic structures here, either to try to rebuild the temple or to cause a new conflict between Palestinians and Israelis that could derail the plan to pull Israeli settlers out of Gaza. So tensions were high, and Mrs. Bush's visit, a rare one by an American dignitary, drew a larger police presence than usual.
 The ancient man-made plateau also overlooks the Western Wall, the last surviving retaining wall of the Second Temple and a holy site for Jews, which Mrs. Bush also walked through protesters to visit.
 She leaned against the massive stones, hot with the bright sun, trying to ignore the crush of photographers, shutting her eyes and praying, then putting a private note -- another prayer -- into a crack in the wall. Her aides said she wrote the note on the flight on Sunday morning from Jordan, but wanted to keep the contents to herself.
 At the Western Wall another small crowd of protesters shouted for the release of Jonathan Pollard, an American Jew who was convicted of spying for Israel, and who was recently visited in prison by the Israeli ambassador to Washington, Danny Ayalon. 
 Mrs. Bush spent an important part of her day Sunday in conversation with a group of well-known Palestinian women, including the legislator Hanan Ashrawi; the Palestinian minister for Jerusalem Affairs, Hind Khoury; Jihad Abu Zneid of the Shufat refugee camp's women's center; and Terry Boullata, an educator from East Jerusalem.
 The women spoke to Mrs. Bush of the difficulties of the Israeli occupation for their daily lives, including numerous checkpoints and the separation barrier Israel is building to protect itself from suicide bombers, aides to the first lady said. Ms. Boullata, for example, according to the aides, spoke of how the barrier meant that a 2-minute trip to her school for many children now took 30 minutes. Also on Sunday, the Israeli Army said it intercepted at a checkpoint a Palestinian teenager trying to smuggle two explosive belts into Israel.
 Mrs. Bush also spent nearly an hour touring the new Holocaust History Museum at Yad Vashem, where she laid a wreath to the dead and wrote in the visitors' book: ''Each life is precious,'' adding: ''We commit ourselves to reject hatred and to teach tolerance and live in peace.''
 She said the visit to the region had been ''very emotional for me and very moving to be here and to see these sites that are very important to me as a Christian, that are in the Old Testament,'' and also important to Muslims and Jews, that represent ''the cradle of what we think of in our country and around the world as religious thought.'' She heads to Egypt on Monday. 
 The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, flew to the United States on Sunday to try to explain his Gaza withdrawal to American Jewish organizations. On the plane, he denied reports that he was contemplating more delays in the pullout, and said it would start on Aug. 16 or 17.
 In Jordan, at the World Economic Forum meeting Mrs. Bush had attended, the Egyptian foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said Egypt was talking with Israel about deploying up to 2,000 troops along the border between Egypt and Israel, in addition to 750 policemen to be deployed along Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip, to ensure strict border control to guarantee an orderly Israeli withdrawal, Reuters reported. Israel is nervous about arms smuggling into Gaza, but also about Egypt's remilitarizing the Sinai; Egypt is worried about a Gaza where Hamas, the radical Islamic group, has too much influence.

HEADLINE: Wages Lag Inflation, Again

 BODY:
The Labor Department's recent inflation report was good news if you don't eat, drive, or belong to the 80 percent of the work force whose pay has failed to keep up with price increases over the past year. 
 In April, consumer prices rose 0.5 percent over all, driven mainly by increases in food and oil. But ''core'' prices -- everything except food and oil -- didn't budge. Since a low and stable core rate signals economic growth without overheating, April's number was widely taken to mean the Federal Reserve would continue to raise interest rates gradually. Predictably, stock and bond markets rallied. 
 Families, on the other hand, have little reason to cheer. The core rate is meaningful for financial markets, but real people buy food and gas. Moreover, the smaller a paycheck is, the bigger the percentage of pay that is consumed by essentials. Poor families, for instance, spend at least four times as much of their pay on energy as rich families do. 
 To make matters worse, the paycheck itself is shrinking. For non-managers in both white- and blue-collar jobs, hourly wage gains have failed to beat inflation in every month for the past year. When that happens, the only way to get ahead is to work more. Earlier this month the government reported that the average workweek lengthened in April, raising hopes that weekly earnings would at last begin to outpace price increases. But inflation has eaten up all of the income from the additional work -- and more: over the past year, average weekly earnings have fallen by 0.3 percent after inflation. 
 So far, easy credit, like home equity loans and credit cards, has papered over the steady falloff in workers' purchasing power. But debt levels can quickly turn onerous. The latest inflation numbers are as much a cause for concern as for celebration.

HEADLINE: 3 City Institutions to Get $50 Million for Stem Cell Research

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
As debates over embryonic stem cell research flare anew worldwide, a private foundation says it will give $50 million for such work to three Upper East Side medical institutions, a gift they say will position New York City as a player in an increasingly competitive field.
 The Starr Foundation plans to give the money over three years to Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Rockefeller University and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which will collaborate on research projects. The recipients say it is among the 10 biggest gifts -- and the second largest dedicated to research -- ever received by any of the three institutions.
 ''We face a very serious threat of losing economically, losing our scientific leadership, and even losing our top scientists, as other countries and California race ahead in this crucial field,'' said Dr. Antonio M. Gotto, dean of Weill Cornell. ''A gift like this helps keep New York and the United States competitive.'' 
 The three institutions each have scientists doing stem cell work in fields like the origins of leukemia or the development of skin, blood and nerve tissue, but they have very different approaches to medicine.
 Rockefeller concentrates more on research into fundamental questions of biology and disease than on treating patients. Sloan-Kettering has the most specific focus, on cancer, in both research and clinical treatment. Weill, as a major medical school attached to a large teaching hospital, has the broadest focus, and it has one of the world's largest fertility clinics, ensuring a ready supply of frozen embryos that can yield stem cells.
 ''Joining forces allows us to do things that we wouldn't be able to do working alone,'' said Sir Paul Nurse, president of Rockefeller University, and it ''helps increase the critical mass of researchers'' to attract still more scientists and money.
 There is no formula on how the $50 million will be divided; officials say the foundation favor projects that cross institutional boundaries.
 In 2001, President Bush prohibited federal funding of research on embryonic stem cells, except work on the limited number of cell lines developed before his decision. But that did not settle the debate, which has only grown more heated.
 Other nations have increased their support for embryonic stem cell research, and members of Congress have debated ways to ease the president's ban. Scientists have announced ethical boundaries. Californians voted to devote $3 billion in state money to the field -- though that remains stalled -- and New York and a few states have considered following California's lead, while still other states have outlawed all embryonic stem cell research.
 Private groups like the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and philanthropic foundations have also devoted increasing sums of money to stem cell research. With the Starr Foundation's $50 million gift, ''New York institutions have attracted something in the range of $100 million in philanthropy in the last year for stem cell research,'' said Harold E. Varmus, president of Sloan-Kettering. ''But I don't think it can fully take the place of federal funding.''
 Last Thursday, South Korean scientists -- some of whom had trained in New York -- said they had cloned human cells for the purpose of growing embryonic stem cells for research. And on Friday, the president cautioned Congress that he would veto any legislation to loosen the restrictions he placed on the field.
 But unlike many private groups, the Starr Foundation is not trying to make a political statement about stem cells or compensate for the federal ban, according to its chairman, Maurice R. Greenberg. ''We weren't even thinking about that,'' he said. The foundation has long been concerned about maintaining New York City as a center of medical science, he said, and ''stem cell research seemed the next logical step.''
 Embryonic stem cells, created in the earliest days of fetal development, can develop into any part of the body, which scientists believe gives them unique potential in repairing devastating injuries and curing diseases like cancer, multiple sclerosis and juvenile diabetes. The cells are usually taken from unused fertilized embryos from fertility clinics, and cell cultures, or lines, are grown in the laboratory.
 Abortion opponents object to the practice, which destroys the embryo, saying it is equivalent to abortion and a destruction of human life. Supporters of the research note that the embryos would eventually be destroyed anyway.
 There are also stem cells in umbilical cord blood and in animal and human bodies, and there is much research into those, too, though many scientists think they will prove less versatile than embryonic cells.
 The Starr Foundation, one of the nation's largest philanthropies, concentrates on grants to education, medicine, culture and services for the poor. (Over the years. it has made donations to New York Times Company Foundation projects.) 
 It has a particular focus on giving in New York City, and says that with the stem cell grant, it has surpassed $1 billion in donations to institutions based in the city. The foundation was created by Cornelius Vander Starr, founder of what became American International Group, the giant insurance company, where Mr. Greenberg was recently ousted after decades as chief executive.
 Most of the foundation's $3.5 billion in assets are in A.I.G. stock, which has declined sharply in value recently, as the New York State attorney general's office has investigated the company and Mr. Greenberg, saying that its financial reports were doctored.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Nuclear Power

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re '''No Nukes,' No More,'' by John Tierney (column, May 17):
 The only sector that reaps economic benefits from nuclear power is the nuclear industry. Entergy, the owner-operator of the Indian Point nuclear plant, 24 miles north of New York City, hauls in more than $10 billion in annual revenue.
 Over the last 50 years, some $145 billion in federal research and development subsidies has gone to the nuclear industry; only $5 billion has gone to renewable energy sources.
 Meanwhile, a substantial portion of the costs of operating a nuclear plant are imposed on communities. Indian Point kills over a billion Hudson River fish, eggs and larvae annually; local taxpayers cover most of the emergency planning costs.
 Entergy recently went on record opposing backup power to emergency sirens, yet it seems to have ample funds for advertising campaigns designed to lull the public into a false sense of security. Providing increased safety and prosperity for American families is patriotic. Providing more welfare checks to the nuclear industry is not.

To the Editor:
 Re ''A Marriage of Unequals'' (''Class Matters'' series, front page, May 19):
 I was raised in a working-class home and taught to treat all people with respect. Having gone to Yale and Stanford, I have ''jumped class,'' so to speak.
 My favorite class story happened in business school when small groups of three were asked to guess one another's least-known attribute. When we stymied each other, I confessed that my parents were factory workers. To my amazement, the second person burst into a smile and said, ''My dad is a garbage man.'' 
 The two of us thought it was very amusing, but not our third member. She, obviously of higher class, looked at us strangely and said, ''Aren't you ashamed?''
 To this day I wish I had shot back that at least we knew that where we were was based on our own talents and not on our parents' money and social standing. Rich people, poor people, sometimes they forget they are all humans and not labels.

 My parents recently celebrated their 54th wedding anniversary. My mother has a doctorate in social work; my father had to drop out of high school during the Depression. My mother came from a wealthy family of doctors; my father's parents were poor Russian immigrants.
 What has kept their marriage strong is a deep commitment to the same political ideals that transcends their class differences. And for us, their children, it has been a very interesting household to grow up in.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Letting Nukes Happen'' (editorial, May 16):
 Your presumption that the United States can buy North Korea's fidelity not to remain a nuclear weapons state is a chimera. 
 Because regime change is unlikely any time soon, the United States and North Korea's neighbors will confront the risk that North Korea could launch a nuclear strike because of intelligence failure, a delegation of nuclear initiation to field commanders, and poor command and control. 
 The interlocutors with North Korea can reduce these risks by providing Pyongyang with such nuclear confidence measures as a hot line, satellite intelligence and economic engagement. 
 Consider the Bush administration's alternative and its consequences: a further isolated North Korea, increasingly paranoid, with poor intelligence placing its nuclear forces on hair-trigger alert. This is not an outcome the international community can abet.

HEADLINE: Bolivia Epitomizes Fight for Natural Resources

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, May 22 

 BODY:
The struggle over globalization and who controls natural resources is being waged across Latin America, but the battle lines are no sharper anywhere than here in Bolivia, where a potent confederation of protesters plans a march on Monday to demand more state control of energy resources. 
 Political analysts say the march -- combined with a work stoppage and an Indian-style town hall meeting in a La Paz plaza -- could further weaken the already debilitated government of President Carlos Mesa. It was just such a protest over energy policy that forced President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada from office in October 2003.
 Now, with Mr. Mesa politically incapacitated and Congress thoroughly discredited because it is seen as corrupt, protesters have become emboldened, with some calling for the outright expropriation of private gas installations operated by such energy giants as British Gas, Repsol-YPF of Spain and Petrobras of Brazil. 
 Such demands have been gathering force, and they underscore the increasingly deep divisions in this Andean country, which despite its isolation has been at the forefront of a powerful backlash against market overhaul in Latin America.
 ''I think it's the most polarized the country has been in a long time,'' said Jim Shultz, director of the Democracy Center in Cochabamba, which studies the effects of globalization on Bolivia. ''In October 2003, the issue was more volatile, but it was more volatile because it was basically everybody against the government. This isn't everybody against the government. This is a situation where Bolivia is split three or four different ways.''
 On one side, there are Bolivians like Carlos Alberto Lopez, a former vice minister of energy who was educated at Harvard and the London School of Economics. 
 Mr. Lopez, now a consultant for energy companies, contends that nationalizing the oil industry would be a disaster for the country. He said Bolivia should instead be taking advantage of the fact that it has Latin America's second largest gas reserves by attracting foreign investors with favorable terms and then selling the gas to energy-hungry giants like Brazil or the United States.
 ''This was our last best hope for Bolivia's economy to grow,'' Mr. Lopez, 45, said in an interview.
 Across this capital, in a small office decorated with posters of the revolutionary icon Che Guevara, another protagonist expresses a sharply opposed viewpoint. 
 ''The people have a right to nationalize and expropriate,'' said Jaime Solares, 53, who started working at age 13, has a 10th grade education and heads the Bolivian Workers Central, the country's largest labor confederation. ''The people no longer believe in neo-liberalism.''
 The movement against market reforms appears to be gaining ground.
 Last week, Bolivia's Congress, under pressure from protesters, signed into law a new tax-and-royalty scheme so tough that energy experts say oil and gas multinationals will curtail investments.
 But groups like Mr. Solares's, with hundreds of thousands of members, say the law is too soft and want more restrictions. At the same time, a conservative, pro-globalization movement in the relatively prosperous eastern part of Bolivia is calling for a referendum on whether the region should have more autonomy, including control of its gas fields. 
 Political analysts say the divisive crisis could lead to violence or, in time, the disintegration of a country whose state has little presence or control over its far-flung provinces.
 The discovery of large gas deposits in the late 1990's was supposed to have brought Bolivia more stability and wealth as the country's leaders tried to position Bolivia as a regional energy power.
 But the masses of poor indigenous people have never forgotten how the Spanish and a series of corrupt governments plundered the country's silver, tin and gold, leaving them more poverty-stricken than before. Flexing their political muscle, they have carried out protests that resulted in the departure of two foreign water companies and wreaked havoc with the government's energy plans.
 ''Those companies always come in with big promises, but all they do is rob,'' said Rafael Condori, 18, an Aymara Indian who plans to take part in the protest on Monday. 
 Such words could not be more troubling to Juan Carlos Iturri, an economist who said that many protesters are driven by slogans and do not take into account Bolivia's economic realities.
 ''Nationalization is not real and it cannot be sustained in time,'' he said. ''They want a horse and a battle and nothing sounds better than saying, 'Die, transnationals.'''
 But Bolivia's history seems to signal that the protests are not likely to fade away. A major revolution in 1952 led to nationalization of the largest tin mines, and charismatic leaders have revived the movement in recent years. 
 Eduardo Gamarra, the Bolivian-born director of Latin American studies at Florida International University in Miami, referred to that history, saying in an interview, ''Bolivia is one of the few places in the world where you have a firm belief that nationalizing key industries is the way to go.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 2, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on May 23 about a struggle between the Bolivian government and protesters opposed to privatization of the country's energy resources incompletely described an economist who was quoted criticizing the protesters. The economist, Juan Carlos Iturri, was until recently the coordinator of a Bolivian government trade negotiation team.

HEADLINE: A Video Match: The Nintendogs vs. Gangs, Thugs and Wars 

BYLINE: By ROBERT LEVINE

 BODY:
At the Electronics Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles last week, the demonstration booth for Nintendo seemed like an island of innocence amid the retorts of digitized gunfire.
 While most game publishers showed sequels, sports simulations and shooting games based on grim tropes such as gang violence and World War II, Nintendo was promoting, among other games, Nintendogs. It lets players raise and train virtual pets on the Nintendo DS, the dual-screen hand-held game machine released last year. 
 Developed by Shigeru Miyamoto, who created the Mario Brothers and Legend of Zelda franchises, Nintendogs is exactly the kind of game the company is known for: addictive, odd and more than a little cute. Nintendo's Game Boy and DS systems dominate the market for hand-held games, and it just announced that it would introduce Game Boy Micro, a sleek, pocket-size machine, this fall. 
 But the focus at the expo was on the console business, where Nintendo lags. In part because of its image as a console for children, Nintendo's GameCube has only 20 percent of the market in the United States, trailing the PlayStation 2 from Sony by a large margin and the Xbox from Microsoft by a smaller one, according to the NPD group, a market research firm.
 ''It is not sufficient when it comes to market share,'' said Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo, speaking through a translator in an interview. ''But market share is not everything; think about profitability.''
 For the last two fiscal years, Nintendo's operating margin has been about 25 percent, according to the company. Sony's games business is profitable, but Microsoft's has lost money.
 Last week, Sony unveiled its PlayStation 3 and Microsoft showed off its Xbox 360, both of which will feature high-definition video and impressive processing power. 
 When Nintendo introduced its next console, the Revolution, it avoided talking about specifications, but implicitly conceded that the machine might be less technically impressive than its competitors. 
 ''It has the power of a Ferrari, and they are talking about Saturn rockets,'' said Mr. Iwata, referring to the three consoles. ''But we are traveling on earth.'' 
 Instead of superior technology, he said, Nintendo would set itself apart as it has in the past, with imaginative games. The company is the second-largest game seller in the United States, behind Electronic Arts. But that advantage could be hard to maintain as consumer tastes change. Over the last five years, Mario has lost market share to the thugs of Grand Theft Auto as the audience for video games has gotten older and the games themselves have moved into the mainstream of pop culture. 
 The Revolution will move Nintendo even farther away from the other two console makers. Both the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 represent components of a parent company's master media plan. Sony's console, for example, will use the proprietary Blu-ray DVD format. 
 Nintendo is interested only in selling games, and the Revolution will need an extra attachment even to play regular DVD's. However, Revolution will play classic Nintendo games from the 80's and 90's that will be available for downloading, including Super Mario Brothers and Metroid. 
 ''They're bobbing while everyone else is weaving,'' said Scott Steinberg, a vice president of Sega America, which makes games for all consoles. ''They've always been about family entertainment, not just technology.''
 But even with its own popular titles, Nintendo will need support from such outside game makers. It will have to convince them that it can maintain enough market share to make their products viable. Some games, such as the 2K Sports series, are made only for PlayStation and Xbox. 
 ''For a company like Activision, it's less about the market share and more about the economic model,'' said Kathy Vrabeck, president of Activision Publishing. The question, she said, was whether it made sense to release titles on a third console. ''To date, on our older skewing titles for hardcore gamers, the answer is: yes, it is.''
 Hit games are crucial to console sales. ''This is an industry where younger consumers aspire up,'' said Reggie Fils-Aime, executive vice president of sales and marketing at Nintendo of America, and any machine seen as a mere toy could be shunned. He pointed out that releases like ''The Legend of Zelda'' appealed to hardcore gamers in their 20's and 30's, some of whom played the early games when they were children. 
 ''I think we were unfairly pigeonholed as a child's system, and I don't think we successfully challenged that,'' he said. He wants to expand Nintendo's market share by drawing in people who aren't traditional gamers with products that are not traditional games. One recent GameCube title, ''Donkey Konga,'' came with a set of bongo drums that players had to hit in time to music and cues on-screen.
 ''They're really pushing innovation in game play,'' said J Allard, who oversees the Xbox business for Microsoft. ''But they didn't reveal enough about Revolution for me to have an opinion.''
 In effect, Nintendo is betting that the games of the future will not demand more power than the Revolution delivers, according to Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Morgan Securities. ''But I think they're wrong. It's a macho business.'' Even so, he said, he was impressed with the creativity of Nintendogs, which he described as brilliant.
 It would seem that Nintendo's products are aimed at the child in all of us. At the end of the interview, Mr. Iwata took out a Nintendo DS running a product in development, in which math equations ran up the screen and players had to solve them quickly. The software will be able to track players' scores over the course of a day, week or month. 
 ''My mother is playing with this now,'' Mr. Iwata said. ''I think Nintendo is the only publisher in the world that is willing to make this kind of application.''

HEADLINE: Big News Media Join in Push to Limit Use of Unidentified Sources 

BYLINE: By LORNE MANLY

 BODY:
Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, added a new role to his portfolio last week: journalism professor. 
 After singling out Newsweek for its article, now retracted, on reports that interrogators at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had flushed a Koran down the toilet, Mr. McClellan broadened his critique of the magazine's journalistic practices to apply to those at the rest of the mainstream news media. 
 There is ''a credibility problem in the media regarding the use of anonymous sources,'' Mr. McClellan said on Tuesday during a regular White House press briefing. 
 ''That's one of the issues that concerns the American people when they look at the media,'' he added, ''and I think sometimes the media does have difficulty going back and kind of critiquing itself.''
 Criticism of the media by the White House press spokesman is nothing new. What is different is how many national news organizations seem to agree with him. 
 Concerned that they may have become too free in granting anonymity to sources, news organizations including USA Today, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, NBC News and The New York Times are trying to throttle back their use. 
 But some journalists worry that these efforts could hamper them from doing their jobs -- coming in a hothouse atmosphere where mistrust of the news media is rampant, hordes of newly minted media critics attack every misstep on the Web, and legal cases jeopardize their ability to keep unnamed news sources confidential.
 ''Right now, the pendulum is swinging too far in the wrong direction,'' said Stephen Engelberg, managing editor for enterprise at The Oregonian in Portland. ''Most newspapers, if they're honest,'' he declared, ''would say that all of this taken together has probably created a climate that is not encouraging for the type of reporting we need to be doing.''
 The use of anonymous sources in news articles has long been part of journalism, as have the periodic attempts to restrict them. After Watergate, when a source who became known as Deep Throat helped Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein expose a White House cover-up, the practice grew from being mainly a useful tool to coax reluctant sources fearful for their livelihoods to being a condition that sources increasingly demanded, according to Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, an institute affiliated with the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. 
 ''Regardless of what journalists may think of the utility of sources,'' Mr. Rosenstiel said, ''it's a source of friction in restoring trust with readers.''
 The practice became almost reflexive, whether it was a matter of covering Washington, Hollywood or sports. ''It's like this bad seed that grew into an ugly animal,'' said Sandy Johnson, Washington bureau chief of The Associated Press.
 A series of journalistic scandals in the last two years, including the revelation that Jayson Blair, a reporter for The New York Times, had fabricated or plagiarized more than three dozen articles, has shocked news organizations into reviewing their existing journalism guidelines, particularly on matters of sources. 
 Last year, The New York Times adopted a more stringent approach to its treatment of confidential sources, including a provision that the identity of every unidentified source must be known to at least one editor. A committee of the paper's journalists recently recommended that the top editors put in place new editing mechanisms to ensure that current policies are enforced more fully and energetically. 
 The Washington Post now pushes its reporters to be more assertive with news sources to get them on the record. When it does grant anonymity, an editor has to know the source's identity and the paper tries to explain more fully to the reader the reasoning behind that decision. 
 At NBC News, which is reviewing its guidelines, reporters and producers are, more than in the past, encouraged to provide the viewer with as much information as possible about the source's location and motivation (a liberal Democratic Congressman rather than a Congressman, for example), said Bill Wheatley, executive vice president of NBC News. ''We discourage hiding behind anonymity to carry out an attack,'' he said. 
 CBS News, which earlier this year acknowledged that it could not authenticate the documents on which it based a ''60 Minutes'' Wednesday report on President Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, is also reviewing its reporting standards.
 One of the more stringent policies was adopted at USA Today last year by Kenneth A. Paulson, who became editor in April 2004, in the wake of revelations that Jack Kelley, one of its star reporters, had fabricated parts of at least 20 articles. All anonymous sources must now be identified to a managing editor, who considers whether the paper should trust the source and whether the news value of the article warrants the practice, Mr. Paulson said. 
 As a result, the newspaper, through last Thursday, has used 63 anonymous sources this year, a little more than three a week, primarily in national and business articles. Mr. Paulson estimates that the paper has reduced its use of anonymous sources by 75 percent. 
 Still, the outright banning of anonymous sources is decidedly a minority view. There is no executive at a big news organization pushing through such a policy as Allen H. Neuharth did when he founded USA Today in 1982. Although theoretically the top editor was allowed to bless the use of anonymous sources, ''I told the editor in chief if he approved any, he'd be fired,'' Mr. Neuharth said. (The de facto ban against unidentified sources was relaxed in the years after Mr. Neuharth's retirement in 1989.) 
 His reasoning came from his time as a working journalist before his move into the executive suite. ''My experiences as a reporter,'' he said, ''convinced me there are sources who are cowards who tell more than they know.''
 While many top editors plan to use confidential sources, if more judiciously, the tacking back could have repercussions. ''In my view, there is clearly a risk that as we tighten policies, there's the potential organizations will go too far,'' Ms. Johnson of The Associated Press said. 
 Some editors and reporters who cover beats like national security, politics, mergers and acquisitions, even Hollywood, worry that strict compliance would put them at a disadvantage if their competitors did not work according to the same rules. 
 ''I can't see how any reporter can handle a sensitive beat, particularly one involving classified information, if he's not willing to rely on trusted sources,'' said Bob Zelnick, an ABC news correspondent for 21 years who is now chairman of the journalism department at Boston University. 
 Editors and executives at a cross-section of news organizations said stricter guidelines regarding confidential sources had not hurt their news-gathering efforts. ''I know of no problems in our reporting because of that,'' said Leonard Downie Jr., executive editor of The Washington Post. Mr. Paulson of USA Today said the new policy had kept some secondary elements out of the paper, but had not cost it any scoops. 
 Several other developments, though, complicate the journalistic issue at stake. Some news outlets, print and television, are facing severe economic pressures. That and the increased partisanship in the nation's political and cultural battles could further inhibit the work of mainstream journalists, some of whom are themselves starting to feel like targets. 
 The uproar over Newsweek's short article played right into this state of affairs. This administration, said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker, ''is particularly intense in the way it plays on what it sees as the public's distrust of much of the media in terms of accuracy and ideological biases." 
 Mr. McClellan was traveling and was not available for comment. 
 David Frum, a fellow at the American Research Institute, a columnist for National Review Online and a former speech writer for President Bush, said about the administration: ''They rightly feel that the American press has become infatuated with stories that do harm to the country's war efforts. Abu Ghraib is a story, but it's not the only story.''
 The debate over the use of anonymous sources is also inextricably linked to continuing legal battles over whether journalists have a right to keep their promises to confidential sources. In one case, Judith Miller of The New York Times and Matthew Cooper of Time magazine face 18 months in jail for refusing to testify about conversations they may have had with government officials about an undercover C.I.A. agent whose name was disclosed by the syndicated columnist Robert Novak. 
 The lack of a federal shield law, many journalists say, could keep prospective sources from coming forward, and important news stories may never see the light of day. ''Its effect on journalism is direct and potentially chilling,'' said Steve Coll, an associate editor of The Washington Post. 
 But in the recent campaign against the overuse of anonymous sources, some headway is being made, and in an unlikely place: Washington. The Washington bureau chiefs for seven major news organizations met late last month with Mr. McClellan to discuss the ubiquitous background briefings held regularly by officials, on the condition that they not be identified. The news organizations say that too often, the information is not diplomatically sensitive but just spin for the administration or fill-in-the-blanks detail. 
 ''Since then, the White House has been pretty responsive,'' said Susan Page, Washington bureau chief of USA Today. The briefing before President Bush's recent trip to Russia, Georgia and Latvia (with a brief stop in the Netherlands) was on the record, as were briefings during the trip. ''That's just a great step,'' said Ms. Page, adding that the ''White House sets the tone around town.''

HEADLINE: No More Same-Old

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
BBDO Worldwide in New York, General Electric's longtime advertising agency, was not getting the message.
 The agency had been offering G.E. its panoply of traditional marketing ideas, leaning heavily on the standard 30-second television spot. But Judy Hu, general manager for global advertising and branding at G.E., demanded something daring. What she eventually got fit the bill: an online campaign with a virtual sprouting seed that computer users can tend and send to people they know by e-mail.
 ''They kept bringing us what they thought we wanted,'' said Ms. Hu of her exchange with BBDO a couple years ago. ''It took a while to make them believe we wanted something different.'' 
 The world of advertising turns upside down when the advertisers -- not the agencies -- are the ones pushing the envelope. But that is what has been happening.
 The advertising business is undergoing an upheaval, forcing executives to radically change how they do business. Marketers are trying desperately to stay ahead of the technological innovations that are changing how consumers view their messages -- and are putting pressure on their agencies to adapt. 
 The ad firms are more eager to please than ever. The major public agencies face shrinking profit margins and sagging stock prices, leading to a shakeout and a frenzied effort to cut costs. 
 It's unclear if the traditional agencies will be nimble enough to halt a slow decline. Already, many famous names are vanishing: N.W. Ayer; Bates; Bozell; D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles; Earle Palmer Brown; Lintas; Warwick Baker O'Neill.
 The big agencies also face a throng of hip new rivals, which have pounced on the opportunity and are looking to steal business. Those boutiques use their oddball names -- like 180, Amalgamated, Mother, Nitro, Soul, StrawberryFrog, Taxi and Zig -- as branding devices to signal they are not about business as usual.
 ''Clients are looking at the results they're getting and they're not happy,'' said Miles S. Nadal, chairman and chief executive of MDC Partners in Toronto, the parent of innovative, creatively focused agencies like Crispin Porter & Bogusky and Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners.
 ''Historically, agencies pushed clients,'' Mr. Nadal said. ''Today, clients are pushing the agencies. The same-old, same-old is not being accepted.''
 But some agencies may be moving too slowly.
 ''There's an incredible ability to cling to what's been done because there's a comfort in that,'' said Ian B. Rowden, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for the Wendy's brand at Wendy's International in Dublin, Ohio.
 ''There's a lot of talk but less action,'' said Mr. Rowden, who has also held senior marketing posts at Coca-Cola and Callaway Golf. ''The old model still drives a lot of things.''
 The origins of the industry's current problems are many: the dot-com bust, the fallout from 9/11 and the explosive growth of technologies that help consumers avoid ads -- like digital video recorders, iPods and satellite radio. Madison Avenue is still trying to regain its footing. Industry employment, which peaked at 496,500 in 2000, fell 14.4 percent, to 424,900, last year, according to the Labor Department. 
 ''The onus is on the agencies to make sure they have the right creative talent,'' said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst who follows the ad industry for Merrill Lynch, but ''I suspect that's more difficult than ever,'' she added, after the ''massive layoffs of the last few years.''
 Ad spending in the United States, which once grew reliably year after year, declined in 2001 for the first time in four decades -- and by the largest percentage since the Depression year of 1938. While ad spending has rebounded since then, the growth rate is slower than during its heyday of the 1990's. 
 ''I used to think the agencies were capable of double-digit revenue growth'' each year, Ms. Fine said, but ''now I look at them as mid-to-high single digits.''
 Worse yet for agencies, profit margins have been shrinking significantly as clients, facing relentless competition and consolidation in categories like automobiles, fast food and telecommunications, are anxiously squeezing every nickel of waste from their ad budgets.
 ''In the 80's, we used to fight with clients over creative. In the 90's, it was about strategy. Now, it's only about money,'' said Jonathan Bond, co-chairman of Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York.
 So in a trend-conscious industry, economizing is the new black. For instance, when Kirshenbaum Bond recently filmed a commercial for the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, retelling the tale of the Trojan horse, ''instead of building a massive set, we used miniatures,'' said Rob Feakins, vice chairman and executive creative director.
 That saved about $150,000, or about 10 percent of the budget for the commercial, he estimated.
 Also, when planning a campaign that calls for several commercials, ''we try to 'gang up the shoots.' Do two a day,'' Mr. Feakins said. ''And we always think of shooting them on one location with a minimum of crew moves, because the crew moves kill you.''
 Some cost-conscious marketers are even turning over responsibility for agency relationships to procurement departments. ''The corporate world, reacting to recessions and Wall Street pressures, is challenging the agencies,'' said Alan Krinsky, principal at Alan Krinsky Associates in New York, which advises agencies and advertisers on issues like procurement. ''Accountability is still a gray area.''
 The stock prices of the giant holding companies that own almost all the big agencies have been weak. The shares of the world's largest agency company in revenue, the Omnicom Group in New York, parent of BBDO, are down 8.1 percent from their 52-week high and 13.8 percent from their five-year peak. For the WPP Group, which owns agencies like Young & Rubicam and is the No. 2 agency company behind Omnicom, the share price is down 11.7 percent and 29.1 percent, respectively. 
 The third-largest agency company, the Interpublic Group of Companies, which owns agencies like Deutsch and McCann Erickson, has suffered accounting problems that have led to an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the loss of large clients for creative and media-buying assignments. The company's shares are down 15.7 percent from their 52-week high and 73.7 percent from their five-year peak. 
 ''It's almost accepted that the model is broken and it's time for a new approach,'' said Carl Johnson, a longtime executive at traditional advertising agencies like TBWA Worldwide. He and four other high-profile refugees from mainstream agencies are now partners in a creatively focused New York boutique named Anomaly.
 ''No one comes to us for more of the same,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Our last resort is an ad, if we can't think of anything else.''
 Anomaly works with the wireless licensing group of ESPN, part of the Walt Disney Company, on not only marketing but also ''some product and content development,'' Mr. Johnson said. The agency shares in the revenue by keeping an equity stake in whatever is produced.
 ''This way, we get paid for the quality of our output,'' he added, ''not the quantity of our input.''
 Anomaly is among a rash of boutiques that have started up to capitalize on the desire among marketers to do things differently -- and the inability of many bigger agencies to accomplish that. 
 In some instances, traditional agencies are diversifying, forming units to specialize in nontraditional tasks. The Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, for instance, opened a division called KTG Buzz to focus on, well, marketing that generates buzz.
 ''Creativity used to be, 'Think inside the box.' Then it was, 'Think outside the box.' Now, there's no box,'' said Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive of Kaplan Thaler, part of the Publicis Groupe.
 BBDO responded to G.E.'s pressure by devoting more attention and resources to units like Atmosphere, specializing in interactive campaigns, playing down its decades-long concentration on producing big-budget television commercials.
 Under a new chief executive, Andrew Robertson, the agency even dismissed its most senior creative leader, replacing him with an executive from another agency known for a slick, successful series of long commercials on the Web, known as BMW Films, which won much acclaim -- and revved up BMW sales. 
 Ms. Hu of G.E. is pleased with BBDO's response. ''I feel they're stepping up to the plate,'' she said, adding that Mr. Robertson ''is trying very hard to change the direction of that agency.'' For instance, she said, a top BBDO New York executive, Brett Shevack, now plays host to regular brainstorming sessions known as Project Inspire, where people from the agency, G.E. corporate and G.E. business units meet ''to brainstorm a particular problem.'' 
 The meetings ''can sometime lead to wild and wacky ideas that might have not been considered before,'' Ms. Hu said. ''And that's a good thing.'' 
 Online marketing at G.E. is by far the fastest-growing part of the ad budget, scheduled to increase 97 percent this year from 2004, Ms. Hu said. She declined to provide dollar amounts, citing company policy.
 And in research last fall to gauge response to a previous viral campaign, she added, 80 percent of respondents said the G.E. ads they saw online made them think of the company as ''innovative,'' and 94 percent agreed the online ads made G.E. seem ''more appealing.'' 
 So besides the virtual seed, which is being tested this week by G.E. employees, there will be more unconventional campaigns to come, Ms. Hu said, including ads made available on cellphones and an online game, played with virtual windmills, to encourage energy conservation.
 Mr. Robertson said the changes he is making at BBDO for G.E. and other clients like FedEx, PepsiCo and Visa are wrenching but necessary.
 ''It's getting easier and easier for consumers to switch from things that aren't engaging them to those that will,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''And they are.''
 ''You can look at that and say, 'Oh, my God! The sky is falling,''' he added, ''or you can look at it as a huge opportunity to create content for your clients that does engage.''

HEADLINE: On Visit to U.S., Afghan Leader Defends Opium Fight

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22 

 BODY:
President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan on Sunday rejected criticism of his efforts against opium poppy growers, saying the government had worked hard to eradicate poppy fields. He blamed Western countries for a lack of support. 
 The criticism of him came in a State Department memorandum reported in The New York Times on Sunday. The memorandum attributed the lagging poppy eradication effort to a reluctance on the part of Mr. Karzai and others in the Kabul government to take on powerful warlords in Kandahar Province and elsewhere. 
 But Mr. Karzai said the criticism was part of an effort to shift blame from the United States, Britain and other countries that have failed to deliver economic aid.
 ''We are going to have probably all over the country at least 30 percent poppies reduced,'' Mr. Karzai said from Boston, in an interview on ''Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer'' on CNN. ''So we have done our job. The Afghan people have done their job. Now the international community must come and provide alternative livelihood to the Afghan people, which they have not done so far.''
 ''Let us stop this blame game,'' he added.
 The Afghan leader spoke on the first day of his visit in the United States for a meeting with President Bush on Monday and talks with Congressional leaders later this week.
 In general, the Bush administration has proclaimed Afghanistan a success story, while also acknowledging that warfare persists in some parts of the country.
 The State Department memorandum, which was sent by the American Embassy in Kabul, said Mr. Karzai had failed to exercise ''strong leadership'' by taking on local leaders involved in opium poppy production. 
 Afghanistan is the world's biggest source of heroin and opium, drug experts say.
 Many analysts say that the problem of opium production in uncontrolled parts of Afghanistan reflects the larger problems faced by Mr. Karzai's government in extending its power beyond Kabul. Parliamentary elections, due this year, have been postponed several times because of violence and lack of preparations.
 The Taliban, the Islamic fundamentalist party that controlled Afghanistan and was allied with Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, was ousted by the United States three and a half years ago. But the group is still considered a major player in large parts of the country, particularly in the mountainous eastern region that borders Pakistan.
 On a separate matter, relating to articles in The Times that have detailed the deaths of two Afghan men in a United States military prison in Bagram in late 2002, Mr. Karzai said the reports had reinforced Afghanistan's determination to take over the detention of Afghan citizens. 
 Mr. Karzai had made similar statements before leaving Kabul, and he is expected to raise the matter in his meeting with Mr. Bush. A State Department official, who did not want to be identified because he said he did not want to get into a dispute with Mr. Karzai on the eve of his visit, said that, in fact, Afghanistan had begun slowly taking over custody of Afghan prisoners in Afghanistan.
 Mr. Karzai said he would press the United States not only to turn over Afghan prisoners but also to do more to consult with Afghan authorities before raiding homes and villages to look for insurgents.
 It made sense, he said, for the United States to be in charge of prisoners and military actions after the ouster of the Taliban. ''Now we are in a different phase of this struggle,'' Mr. Karzai added. ''The Afghan people now feel that they own that country, Afghanistan, that we are owners of that country.''
 Going into people's homes by the military, he said, ''must not be done without the permission of the Afghan government.''
 Mr. Karzai also used television appearances on Sunday to criticize Newsweek magazine for its article published earlier this month, which was retracted, that said a military inquiry would report that a copy of the Koran had been flushed down a toilet at the American prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. But Mr. Karzai said the riots that ensued in Afghanistan, in which at least 17 people were killed, were caused by protesters with a longstanding anti-American agenda.
 ''Some of the incidents, the looting of the buildings, the burning of buildings that was done by people who were protesting the documents -- that was done by gangs who were against Afghanistan,'' Mr. Karzai said in an interview on Fox News. On CNN, he said the rioters were people who wanted to split the Afghan-American alliance.

Jail Term for Soldier in Abuse Case
 EL PASO, May 22 (AP) -- An Army policeman has been sentenced to three months in prison after pleading guilty to assault and two counts of making a false statement in the 2002 beating death of a prisoner in Afghanistan. 
 The soldier, Specialist Brian E. Cammack, a member of the Army Reserve's 377th Military Police Company in Cincinnati, agreed to testify in other cases related to the deaths of two detainees at the United States military prison in Bagram, Afghanistan, part of an Army inquiry that suggested a wider pattern of abuse and has resulted in criminal charges against seven soldiers. In return, Army prosecutors agreed not to pursue a charge of maltreatment against Specialist Cammack. 
 In addition to the prison term, Specialist Cammack will be demoted to private, fined more than $3,200 and given a bad-conduct discharge. The case involved a detainee named Mullah Habibullah, who died after being beaten for several days.

HEADLINE: With More Private Giving, Bloomberg Forges Ties

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
As a self-made billionaire, Michael R. Bloomberg was one of the nation's leading philanthropists well before he ran for mayor of New York in 2001. He has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to a wide variety of causes -- mostly to educational institutions and medical research -- from his own personal fortune, through family foundations and through his financial information services corporation, Bloomberg L.P. 
 But in the four years since his first mayoral race, the breadth of his philanthropy has expanded starkly. Now, many more community and cultural groups and social-service organizations in New York City are as likely to be beneficiaries as are medical centers in Baltimore or professorships at Harvard. And as Mr. Bloomberg gears up for a re-election campaign, the vast impact of his charitable contributions -- a total of about $140 million in donations last year alone to more than 800 institutions and groups, a growing number of them local -- is emerging as a potentially formidable weapon as he cultivates alliances in all five boroughs.
 All incumbents dispense favors. But Mr. Bloomberg's personal wealth has made him a modern-day Medici -- a role that, some critics say, can also stifle dissent from institutions that have quietly absorbed city budget cuts because they worry that what the mayor gives he can also stop giving. 
 ''It's an unusual picture: a mayor whose generosity we sincerely appreciate as a person, countered by cuts,'' said Tom Finkelpearl, executive director of the Queens Museum of Art, which received $100,000 last year through Mr. Bloomberg's ostensibly anonymous gift to the Carnegie Corporation of New York. ''There's no question there's a different dynamic.'' 
 Through a spokesman, Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment for this article. His generosity as mayor has been consistent with a lifelong belief in philanthropy; he has said that his parents gave what they could, typically $25 or $50, to causes like the local parent-teacher association, their synagogue and the N.A.A.C.P. Mr. Bloomberg has established trusts for his two daughters, but has said he hopes to give much of his money away before he dies. One of his favorite sayings is that the best measure of a successful philanthropist is that his check to the undertaker bounces.
 The mayor's aides insist his philanthropy is not driven by politics. Moreover, most of Mr. Bloomberg's donations are delivered without fanfare and many are made anonymously -- though the source often seems to be an open secret. 
 ''He's not looking for attention,'' said Edward Skyler, his communications director. Yet through the last few years, the mayor's pool of beneficiaries has grown, expanding geographically and ethnically throughout the city, in a pattern that suggests a greater sensitivity to the needs of smaller, lesser-known institutions -- a pattern that, however motivated, cannot help but redound politically to Mr. Bloomberg.
 ''Privately or as the mayor, he's come into contact with different issues that influence his philanthropy,'' Mr. Skyler said. 
 In some cases, the mayor's gifts have helped soften the blow of his administration's own cutbacks to cultural groups and social-service providers, earning him good will at a time of fiscal austerity. Other donations seem to have helped him win the respect of leaders whose organizations might not have gravitated to his candidacy.
 From 1997 to 2000, the number of groups that got donations from Mr. Bloomberg and had Harlem in their names grew from 2 to 6, then to 13 in 2003. The number whose names include Staten Island went from 2 in 1999 to 8 in 2003; the Bronx, from 0 in 1997 to 6 in 2003; and Brooklyn, from 3 in 1997 to 13 in 2003. 
 Among the more recent beneficiaries of the mayor's largess are the Asian American Arts Alliance; the Ballet Hispanico; the Bronx Council on the Arts; the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation; One Hundred Black Men Inc., a civic group; the Haitian Centers Council; and the Staten Island Symphony.
 Another relative newcomer was the Abyssinian Development Corporation, founded by the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, a politically influential Harlem minister who all but endorsed Mr. Bloomberg for re-election in February, calling him ''a fairly generous man where poor people are concerned.'' Dr. Butts, who backed Mark Green in 2001, said last week that he was referring to Mr. Bloomberg's international giving and that the donations to his church's economic-development corporation were ''not a whole lot'' -- about $30,000 over three years.
 Asked whether the mayor's generosity was a political asset, he replied: ''It doesn't hurt. It really doesn't hurt. But if we disagree on some major issue, I'm not for sale.''
 In December, the Dance Theater of Harlem was able to reopen its landmark school after raising $1.6 million -- $500,000 of which came, officially anonymously, from Mr. Bloomberg. Dr. Butts is on the theater's board. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has also given $30 million, again, ostensibly anonymously, since he took office in 2002, to be distributed through the Carnegie Corporation, headed by his friend Vartan Gregorian, including $75,000 to the Alianza Dominicana and $50,000 to Aspira of New York, a Hispanic education and advocacy group. He has personally contributed millions of dollars more through the Mayor's Fund to Advance New York. 
 That pattern of giving has impressed, among others, former Mayor David N. Dinkins, a Harlem Democrat, who supports several charities the mayor has helped. ''The point I would make,'' Mr. Dinkins said, ''is that he was doing stuff like this before he ran for mayor.'' 
 Some groups say they learned only belatedly that Mr. Bloomberg was their benefactor. 
 Arnold S. Cohen, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for the Homeless, which has been critical of the administration's policies, said he did not know that a $50,000 gift was from Mr. Bloomberg until he read in a news article that the mayor was the source of scores of anonymous donations funneled through Carnegie. ''I'm the first one to suggest there's something untoward,'' he said, ''but in this case, I don't think so. You have to look at the philanthropic Mike and the political Mike.''
 Verdery Roosevelt, the executive director of the Ballet Hispanico, said $100,000 that came from Mr. Bloomberg through Carnegie, while city financing remained flat, was crucial. ''That money made it possible for us to keep our doors open,'' she said. Asked whether politics might play a role, since the mayor is wooing Hispanic voters, Ms. Roosevelt said: ''Does one need to assess that? Whatever his motivation might be, it's a positive impact on us.'' 
 The Asian American Arts Alliance received two $25,000 grants, more than enough to compensate for city budget cuts. ''He knows exactly what he's doing about where he puts his money,'' said NaRhee Ahn, the interim executive director. ''He's doing the right thing for himself and for the Chinatown community.'' 
 The right thing, many beneficiaries said, can be just as much about muting criticism as about building political support. 
 Not long before Mr. Bloomberg reduced the city's subsidy to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among other institutions, he personally donated more than $2 million to endow the museum's arms and armor collection. 
 The Bloomberg administration has generally shrunk city subsidies for major cultural institutions, though some cuts were later restored by the City Council. Janet Schneider, executive director of the Cultural Institutions Group, whose members regularly receive city financing, estimates that the annual allocation has declined from a peak of about $80 million, before Mr. Bloomberg took office, to about $59 million, although the city says the reduction was much less. 
 Some leaders of nonprofit groups say their fears of retribution were stoked early in Mr. Bloomberg's mayoralty when, after a professor in the education school at New York University publicly criticized Bloomberg L.P., company officials informed N.Y.U. that two journalism fellowships were in jeopardy. Catherine R. Stimpson, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, said that Bloomberg company officials made it clear that the criticism was the reason for the warning. 
 ''I suppose in the best of all possible worlds we could have applied again, but I did feel that would not have been very helpful,'' Ms. Stimpson said. She added: ''I don't know if the mayor himself knew anything about it. Bloomberg has been very generous to N.Y.U., and quite frankly, this one incident, though I wish it hadn't happened, shouldn't be viewed as symptomatic of the whole relationship.''
 While some arts advocates argue that the mayor's philanthropy falls short of compensating for the city budget cuts, Mr. Skyler, the mayor's spokesman, said Mr. Bloomberg ''hasn't tried to use his pocketbook to reverse any decisions he's had to make as mayor.'' Mr. Skyler said the mayor does not personally choose each of the Carnegie recipients.
 Shortly after Mr. Bloomberg became mayor, he invited Diane Ravitch, the educational historian, to become a paid adviser, but unofficially and not on the city payroll. She declined, preferring not to jeopardize her independence. Would she serve, she was asked, if the mayor gave to her favorite charity? She agreed, and she said that Mr. Bloomberg sent a school that she supports a personal check for $25,000. ''When he stopped taking my advice, I stopped giving it,'' Dr. Ravitch recalled, ''but at least I didn't feel he was purchasing me.'' 
 But a threat of retribution, implied, inferred or imagined, can affect his political rivals, too.
 Last year, a number of cultural leaders, including at least one board member of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said they received calls from Patricia E. Harris, a deputy mayor who has also been the unofficial chief guardian of Mr. Bloomberg's gift-giving, chiding them for buying $100 tickets to a party for Gifford Miller, the Council speaker, who is seeking the Democratic mayoral nomination.
 ''Like anybody else, the mayor expects to have the support of his friends,'' said Mr. Skyler. ''But the mayor never holds his personal philanthropy over their heads.''

HEADLINE: First Jobs Come Easily for Many but After That ...

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Rebecca Palmer, who just graduated from Wichita State University, did not have to look for a job. The job found her.
 Last March, the Cessna Finance Corporation called her to offer a position as a sales administrator in its international division. ''It was very easy,'' said Ms. Palmer, 23. ''They had three positions that opened up at the same time.'' 
 Just two years ago, even the best prospects coming out of college were accepting second-best job offers, if they were receiving any offers at all. But as tens of thousands of new graduates enter the labor market this month and next, corporate recruiters are snapping them up at a clip not seen since 2001 -- before the cooling economy took a heavy toll on campus hiring.
 Companies expect to hire 13 percent more graduates than last year, according to a poll by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. And 85 percent of employers are offering higher initial salaries than last year.
 Two years ago, seniors were suffering through grueling rounds of interviews to land even a mediocre job. This year, students across a range of majors, from computer science to liberal arts, are hearing employers knocking on their doors.
 ''There's a level of competitiveness we hadn't seen in four years,'' said John Campagnino, global head of recruiting for Accenture, a consulting firm. ''All of our competitors are out there going after the same students. It's rare if a student we make an offer to doesn't already have an offer from somewhere else.''
 The job market is not quite back to the free-wheeling days of the late 1990's, when fierce competition for talent from the dot-com economy spawned urban legends about brand new BMW's as sign-up bonuses. But 65 percent of employers plan to offer sign-up bonuses to their most promising recruits, up from 42 percent last year.
 For Tom Dharte, 22, who received his diploma from the University of Dayton on May 8, the challenging part about the job hunt was choosing among competing offers.
 ''I had interviews in New York, Chicago, Detroit and Cincinnati,'' Mr. Dharte said. ''By December I had an offer in each of those cities.'' In the end, he took a job as an analyst at Merrill Lynch's private equity unit in Princeton, N.J., where he did an internship last year.
 The job market was dreary for everybody in the last few years. But young college graduates, who benefited most from the hiring frenzy among online firms in the late 1990's, were hit particularly hard when the dot-com bubble burst, investment in technology collapsed and dozens of online ventures went under.
 By the end of last year, only 85.2 percent of 25- to 35-year-old college graduates had a job, down from 87.4 percent in 2000, according to an analysis of census data by Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute. Whereas average earnings of young people without a college degree declined by 0.8 percent from 2000 to 2004, to $13.38 an hour, wages of young college graduates fell 2.8 percent, to $22.41.
 Now, as the job market starts warming up across the country, demand for new college graduates is picking up, too. At Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., the number of employers visiting campus has increased 12 percent to 15 percent this year, said Timothy B. Luzader, director of the center for career opportunities. 
 At the University of Dayton in Ohio, Greg Hayes, the executive director of career services, expects a 7 percent increase in the hiring of graduates this year. Marcia B. Harris, director of career services at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said that this year about 35 percent of graduating seniors had jobs awaiting them, up from 30 percent last year and about 15 percent in 2003.
 The Department of Labor does not break out statistics on the job status of young college graduates. But it does show that the unemployment rate of workers ages 20 to 24, the typical age at graduation, dropped 1.2 percentage points over the last two years, to 8.9 percent even as the total unemployment rate declined 0.8 percentage point, to 5.2 percent.
 Some professions are hotter than others. Accounting majors are benefiting after the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which forced corporate executives to take responsibility for the accuracy of their accounting. Mr. Hayes added that majors in fields related to national security, from computer science to engineering, are also having a good year.
 Even manufacturing companies, which for years have done nothing but shed workers, are picking up graduates. At Wichita State, where job prospects depend heavily on the aerospace companies nearby, Jill M. Pletcher, director of career services, said she was ''guardedly optimistic.''
 Prospects are improving noticeably all the way down to graduates with liberal arts degrees, who typically have the most difficult time finding a job. Starting salaries for liberal arts majors are expected to increase by 4 percent, after a decline of 1.4 percent last year, according to a survey by the college and employer association.
 Companies are even hiring some of the graduates they shunned in the lean years. 
 Jonathan Narveson, 24, was lucky to have a job offer when he graduated from the University of North Carolina in 2003. It just was not the computer industry job he really wanted. He did about 25 interviews with 15 companies and ended up as a salesman for Newell Rubbermaid in Charlotte, N.C.
 But last year, with the labor market tauter, Mr. Narveson was able to align his career with his aspirations, taking a job as a consultant in the financial services operating unit of Accenture. These days, he happily wields the appropriate consulting firm lingo. ''From a career acceleration standpoint, this is a great steppingstone,'' he said.
 After three high-strung years, Mr. Luzader at Purdue said, ''There seems to be less anxiety on the student grapevine about opportunities.'' 
 Interest in graduate study, a typical indicator of graduates' concerns over getting a job, has declined in some areas. For instance, the Law School Admission Council expects there will be 4.8 percent fewer applicants to law schools this year.
 Some graduates seem to be starting to feel comfortable again about navigating the job market, and life, at their own pace. 
 Dennis A. DiTullio, who will graduate in June from Ohio State University, plans to work a couple of years at his fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta, teaching leadership courses at chapters around the country, before plunging into the job market. 
 ''I want to move around a little bit; see the world before I plop down in my cube,'' Mr. DiTullio said. ''I still get to be around college campuses. I don't have to wake up one day and suddenly mature a lot.''

HEADLINE: Death by a Thousand Blogs

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
The Chinese Communist Party survived a brutal civil war with the Nationalists, battles with American forces in Korea and massive pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square. But now it may finally have met its match -- the Internet. 
 The collision between the Internet and Chinese authorities is one of the grand wrestling matches of history, visible in part at www.yuluncn.com.
 That's the Web site of a self-appointed journalist named Li Xinde. He made a modest fortune selling Chinese medicine around the country, and now he's started the Chinese Public Opinion Surveillance Net -- one of four million blogs in China.
 Mr. Li travels around China with an I.B.M. laptop and a digital camera, investigating cases of official wrongdoing. Then he writes about them on his Web site and skips town before the local authorities can arrest him.
 His biggest case so far involved a deputy mayor of Jining who is accused of stealing more than $400,000 and operating like a warlord. One of the deputy mayor's victims was a businesswoman whom he allegedly harassed and tried to kidnap.
 Mr. Li's Web site published an investigative report, including a series of photos showing the deputy mayor kneeling and crying, apparently begging not to be reported to the police. The photos caused a sensation, and the deputy mayor was soon arrested.
 Another of Mr. Li's campaigns involved a young peasant woman who was kidnapped by family planning officials, imprisoned and forcibly fitted with an IUD. Embarrassed by the reports, the authorities sent the officials responsible to jail for a year.
 When I caught up with Mr. Li, he was investigating the mysterious death of a businessman who got in a financial dispute with a policeman and ended up arrested and then dead.
 All this underscores how the Internet is beginning to play the watchdog role in China that the press plays in the West. The Internet is also eroding the leadership's monopoly on information and is complicating the traditional policy of ''nei jin wai song'' -- cracking down at home while pretending to foreigners to be wide open.
 My old friends in the Chinese news media and the Communist Party are mostly aghast at President Hu Jintao's revival of ideological slogans, praise for North Korea's political system and crackdown on the media. The former leaders Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji are also said to be appalled. 
 Yet China, fortunately, is bigger than its emperor. Some 100 million Chinese now surf the Web, and e-mail and Web chat rooms are ubiquitous.
 The authorities have arrested a growing number of Web dissidents. But there just aren't enough police to control the Internet, and when sites are banned, Chinese get around them with proxy servers.
 One of the leaders of the Tiananmen democracy movement, Chen Ziming, is now out of prison and regularly posts essays on an Internet site. Jiao Guobiao, a scholar, is officially blacklisted but writes scathing essays that circulate by e-mail all around China. One senior government official told me that he doesn't bother to read Communist Party documents any more, but he never misses a Jiao Guobiao essay.
 I tried my own experiment, posting comments on Internet chat rooms. In a Chinese-language chat room on Sohu.com, I called for multiparty elections and said, ''If Chinese on the other side of the Taiwan Strait can choose their leaders, why can't we choose our leaders?'' That went on the site automatically, like all other messages. But after 10 minutes, the censor spotted it and removed it.
 Then I toned it down: ''Under the Communist Party's great leadership, China has changed tremendously. I wonder if in 20 years the party will introduce competing parties, because that could benefit us greatly.'' That stayed up for all to see, even though any Chinese would read it as an implicit call for a multiparty system.
 So where is China going? I think the Internet is hastening China along the same path that South Korea, Chile and especially Taiwan pioneered. In each place, a booming economy nurtured a middle class, rising education, increased international contact and a growing squeamishness about torturing dissidents.
 President Hu has fulminated in private speeches that foreign ''hostile forces'' are trying to change China. Yup, count me in -- anybody who loves China as I do would be hostile to an empty Mao suit like Mr. Hu. But it's the Chinese leadership itself that is digging the Communist Party's grave, by giving the Chinese people broadband.

HEADLINE: To Save Its Canal, Panama Fights for Its Forests

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

DATELINE: MIRAFLORES, Panama 

 BODY:
A freighter slides slowly into the first of the Miraflores Locks, red, orange and white cargo containers stacked six or seven high on its deck. Gates swing shut and the lock begins to drain, water flowing into the lock below. 
 A few minutes later, when the water levels are equal, gates at the other end of the lock swing open, and the ship moves into the next chamber. Once again, water drains, gates open and the ship and its tons of cargo head out to the Pacific Ocean.
 Something else is moving, too -- about 26 million gallons of water, the amount that drains from the Pedro Miguel and Miraflores Locks each time a ship goes through them to or from the Pacific. The same amount drains into the Atlantic when ships pass through the Gatun Locks on the other side of the isthmus. So each trip through the canal, or lockage, means 52 million gallons of water. On a busy day, there may be as many as 40 lockages. 
 The water comes from Gatun Lake, one of the largest artificial lakes in the world, created during construction of the canal.
 The canal depends on the lake and its water, and they in turn depend on the health of the surrounding watershed forest. But in the last few decades, half of it has been lost to logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. 
 Panamanians know what will happen if they cannot maintain an adequate supply of water for the canal. In the drought winter of 1990-91, lack of water forced canal operators to curtail lockages to fewer than 30 a day, something no one here is eager to repeat.
 Although Panama City is a major financial center now, by some estimates the canal and its associated businesses still contribute 40 percent or more of the nation's economy.
 And if Panamanians vote to upgrade or expand the canal, an issue they are expected to confront in a referendum this fall, the reliability of Gatun Lake's water supply will be even more crucial.
 ''We need the water for the functioning of the canal,'' Reyna Carrillo, a guide at Miraflores, recently told a group of visitors. ''Without the water, we would be the biggest ditch in the whole world.'' 
 The Panama Canal Authority and an array of scientists are working together to study Gatun Lake's hydrology, to restore its watershed and to teach the people who live there the importance of preserving it.
 Gatun Lake is fed chiefly by the Chagres River, which was dammed during the construction of the canal. It straddles the isthmus at the canal's highest elevation, and part of the canal runs through it. 
 Water per se is not its problem. The Chagres drains a tropical jungle where it rains 10 feet or more each year -- about three times as much as it rains in Seattle or New York, and in theory more than enough to keep the locks operating at capacity.
 But the rain does not fall steadily year-round. Most of it comes from May to December, in brief but intense downpours. An inch in an hour is ordinary, and six inches in a day is hardly unheard of. Rain falls so heavily in Panama that early canal builders described storms as turning the air to water. 
 On forested slopes, much of this water soaks into the ground and feeds slowly into watershed streams and then into Gatun Lake.
 But deforested slopes cannot absorb heavy rains.
 Floods of water run off into the lake, overflow Gatun Dam and run out to sea -- useless for lockage. Meanwhile, eroded sediment ends up on the lake bottom, reducing its storage capacity.
 One consequence is apparent to those who traverse the Gatun Lake portion of the canal. 
 Between the town of Gamboa and Barro Colorado Island, a dredge anchored offshore drills into the lake bottom, sucking up excess sediment and pumping it through long pipes to shore.
 The resulting turbulence fills the lake with so much silt that people nearby who rely on it for drinking water have to filter it or use bottled water instead. But the dredging helps maintain the lake's capacity to store water.
 Columbus and his men were the first Europeans to see the towering forests of the Chagres River basin, with their 1,500 species of trees, some of them growing more than 100 feet tall, and the howler monkeys and toucans and other creatures that inhabit them. Another Spanish seafarer, Juan Corzo Serna, wrote about them in 1524, according to Stanley Heckadon Moreno, a sociologist and research associate at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. 
 ''He is our first witness to the land,'' Dr. Heckadon said. ''He describes it as a monumental forest.''
 Despite the building of a railroad across the isthmus in the 19th century, the completion of the canal in 1914 and the military buildups of World Wars I and II, the watershed forest was more or less intact until about 1950, Dr. Heckadon said in an interview.
 But by then the United States had built a highway across the isthmus, from Panama City north to Colon. 
 ''Pretty soon we ended up with 3,000 kilometers of trails built by loggers and followed by cattlemen and slash-and-burn farmers,'' Dr. Heckadon said. In the Chagres basin and in the watershed on the other side of the canal, thousands of acres fell to their machetes and chain saws.
 When the treaty turning the canal over to Panama was negotiated in the Carter administration, ''there was a belief 'now this area is ours, we can go in there,''' said Luis A. Alvarado Kinkey, a hydrologist who is environmental division manager for the canal authority, known as A.C.P., its initials in Spanish. ''There was a lot of influx from the interior. They started cutting down forest to build pasture at an alarming rate.'' 
 Panamanians were such assiduous practitioners of slash-and-burn agriculture that some here began to joke bitterly that they must be born with machetes in their hands.
 Deforestation peaked in the 1980's, said Dr. Robert F. Stallard, a geologist at the Smithsonian research institute in Panama who studies the hydrology of the watershed. By 2000, when Dr. Heckadon and his colleagues completed a study using satellite imagery and ground surveys, they found 53 percent of the watershed forest had been lost. 
 Today travelers who fly over the isthmus see a patchwork of forest and pasture.
 The Panamanian government first recruited Dr. Heckadon to examine the issue in the 1980's, when he formed a study group of scientists and technical experts to evaluate the health and future of the watershed. ''One of the main conclusions was the absolute national imperative to protect the surviving forests,'' Dr. Heckadon said in an interview. At the urging of the study group, Eric Arturo Delvalle, then the country's president, established Chagres National Park, which covers about 250,000 acres or about a third of the canal watershed. ''I think on that day he bought the insurance policy on the Panama Canal,'' Dr. Heckadon said.
 But things did not go well. Much of the 1980's was ''a lost time,'' Dr. Heckadon said, when Panama was under the de facto control of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and deforestation continued. Even after the United States arrested General Noriega in 1990, conditions were initially unsettled and Chagres and smaller watershed parks were not adequately protected. 
 But then things began to change. Dr. Heckadon, who became the nation's first environment minister, said one important step came when leading Panamanian bankers decided to stop financing cattle ranchers who cut down forest for pasture. ''That withdrew the oxygen of the fire of slash and burn,'' he said. And with the canal turnover in 1999, government agencies acted again to expand protected watershed areas. 
 Now, Mr. Alvarado says that only negligible amounts of watershed are lost each year to deforestation. But others say that official agencies do not have enough money or staff to patrol the parks as closely as they wish and that, as a result, logging and burning is continuing, even if on a smaller scale.
 ''With the chain saw these guys can do anything,'' Dr. Heckadon said. ''They look at a mahogany tree and they cut it on the weekend, saw it in slabs, get it on someone's pickup. It's a problem.''
 Dr. Stallard said: ''There are constant threats on the park boundaries. There is always chipping at some border.''
 So the canal authority and other agencies have also begun community efforts to educate rural Panamanians about the importance of preserving the forest landscape. ''We now employ people the old canal would never imagine it would -- social workers for example,'' Mr. Alvarado said. ''We work with the communities. We work with the schools.''
 Meanwhile, efforts are also under way to restore damaged landscapes. A.C.P. has begun a program called the Native Species Reforestation Project -- a cooperative arrangement with the Smithsonian, the Yale University School of Forestry, the International Development Center at the Kennedy School at Harvard and other universities and agencies to study ways to protect the canal watershed and restore its native vegetation.
 The scientists are learning as they go, because little is known about reforesting tropical rain forests, said Dr. Mark S. Ashton, a professor of forest ecology at Yale. Dr. Ashton said in an e-mail message that scientists hoped to restore the landscape in ways that protected the watershed, enhanced biodiversity and identified trees and other plants that could be grown and harvested sustainably, replacing slash-and-burn farming as a source of income.
 But the effort, known by its Spanish acronym, Prorena, is complicated by the presence of an invasive and persistent form of a grassy plant called wild sugar cane or paja blanca (Saccharum spontaneum).
 Dr. Stallard said biologists first spotted this grass in the canal area in 1978, and since then it has established itself in huge stands. 
 The plant, apparently an immigrant from Asia, has tenacious roots that hold the soil, an advantage in preventing soil runoff. But it grows aggressively and crowds out potentially useful native plants. ''It might prevent erosion, but it does not have any other use,'' Mr. Alvarado said. So the authorities here want to remove as much of it as they can.
 For many in Panama, the success of these and other efforts to protect the canal watershed means more than the money -- $65,000 for an average toll -- for ships passing through the canal. 
 ''People came from all over the world to make this dream possible,'' Ms. Carrillo tells visitors at the locks at Miraflores.
 But, she reminds them, ''Even when the Americans were here, if they had cut the forest we would have no canal today.''

HEADLINE: A Family of Strivers Faces Deportation to a Country They Barely Recall

BYLINE: By ANDREA ELLIOTT

 BODY:
It was a controversial program from the outset. In the hunt for terrorists after 9/11, the government required men in the United States from more than 20 Muslim-majority countries to be fingerprinted, photographed and questioned at immigration centers. 
 There is much debate over whether the program succeeded in gathering information about terrorist activities. An estimated 83,000 men came forward, but government officials would not say whether any have been charged with terrorism-related offenses, only that a handful were linked to terrorism. Eventually, the Department of Homeland Security shifted its resources, and in April 2003 the program, known as Special Registration, was largely suspended and forgotten.
 Still, for many the program has lived on; roughly 13,000 of the men who stepped forward were placed into deportation proceedings after immigration officers discovered that they were living here without legal status. Among them are men like Kamal, Hassan and Housseine Essaheb, three brothers from Queens who fit only the profile of classic immigrant success, minus the proper paperwork. 
 For them, Special Registration is far from over and could soon exact its toll.
 ''It's like losing your whole life,'' said Kamal Essaheb, 23, a law student at Fordham University who came to the United States from Morocco 13 years ago. After an extended trek through the court system, the Essaheb brothers believe they will be ordered deported at hearings in June and July. They hold few memories from the country of their birth, and speak only wisps of Arabic and French. 
 ''It's not too different from putting us anywhere else,'' Kamal Essaheb said of being sent to Morocco. ''My house isn't there. I can't go to my bedroom. I can't get on the J train and close my eyes for 20 minutes and be home. It's not Queens. It's not where we belong.''
 It is impossible to fully know this universe of men, who they are, why they came here and how many have remained. Hundreds boarded planes or fled to Canada with their families after Special Registration began in the summer of 2002. Others have chosen to stay and challenge the policy in court, buying time with appeals. And some have slipped into hiding as they continue to earn a living here illegally. 
 The Essaheb brothers, who are pursuing graduate degrees and have no criminal record, are not isolated examples. Like many other Muslim immigrants who wanted to comply with the law, the Essahebs appear to have been caught up in a program aimed at finding a vastly different group of men.
 ''It was the right program at the time,'' said Russ Knocke, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security. ''National security was one important element of that program with a broader objective of increasing integrity in the immigration system.''
 Kamal Essaheb remembers clearly the day he learned he was different from his classmates at the Bronx High School of Science. He dreamed of becoming an engineer and mentioned to a college counselor that he planned to apply to Johns Hopkins and Carnegie Mellon. The counselor told him she needed his Social Security number. He learned at home that evening that he had no such number. 
 ''It was a pretty weird moment,'' Kamal Essaheb said.
 He and his brothers are among an estimated 65,000 illegal immigrants who graduate from high schools in the United States every year. Federal law prevents them from receiving government-backed financial aid, though some still find their way to college with scholarships and by attending less expensive state universities.
 Kamal Essaheb lowered his sights and attended Queens College, where he became editor of the student newspaper and graduated cum laude in 2002. His younger twin brothers, Hassan and Housseine, were fast on his heels: Hassan planned to become a stock trader and Housseine an actuary.
 To understand the drive of the Essaheb brothers, one need only meet their parents, who declined to give their first names for fear they could also face deportation. The couple came to America on a whim, but unlike many immigrants, the life they left behind was better, in many ways, than the one they acquired. In Casablanca, they owned a spacious apartment, had two maids and sent their sons to private schools.
 Mr. Essaheb was an entrepreneur who sold medical products before starting a jewelry design company, and Mrs. Essaheb worked as a tax inspector. But the parents, who loved books and Italian cinema, lived under a repressive monarchy and worried that their children would grow up with limited exposure to the world.
 ''It's not about money sometimes,'' Mrs. Essaheb, 49, said. ''When we arrived to J.F.K., I can't tell you how I felt. I felt so free.''
 It was the first and last airplane trip the boys, then 11 and 9, ever took. The family headed straight to Astoria, Queens, where thousands of Moroccans have settled. Mr. Essaheb was soon hired as a caseworker for Islamic Family Services in Queens. The agency agreed to sponsor him for a green card, but the papers it filed were incomplete, he said.
 Mr. Essaheb became a taxi driver and started a newspaper, Attawassul News, on the side. He often drives with his laptop on the seat next to him, composing his monthly editorial. In 1995, the Essahebs bought a two-story stucco house in Woodhaven. 
 Kamal, Hassan and Housseine Essaheb seem to have skipped the typical adolescence of rebellion and separation; they still come home most days before dark and spend their weekends playing hockey, or watching movies with their parents. 
 The twins are now 22. Hassan is pursuing a master's degree in financial engineering at Columbia University. Housseine is taking graduate courses in economics at Queens College. Only Kamal changed academic tracks. He was ready to apply to an economics program at Hunter College in January 2003 when he learned that Moroccans living in the United States had been asked to register with the government.
 A few days later, the brothers and their father silently rode the subway to 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan. The Essahebs were questioned, photographed, fingerprinted and asked to turn in their passports. One officer asked Kamal Essaheb if he was a terrorist, he recalled.
 ''That was the day I decided to go to law school,'' Kamal said. ''That was the day I felt injustice in a way I could not conceptualize before.''
 All four Essaheb men were placed into deportation proceedings, but a government lawyer asked an immigration judge to toss out the father's case. Mr. Essaheb's sons were not as lucky. 
 Kamal Essaheb applied to Fordham University's law school two months later, and during his first year there distinguished himself by winning a coveted Stein scholarship, for aspiring public interest lawyers. He stayed quiet about his legal troubles, juggling schoolwork with the job of representing himself and his brothers at hearings in court.
 ''It's kind of unimaginable to me what it must be like going through law school and to have -- on top of the regular concerns you have as a law student -- this incredible, overriding concern about being deported,'' said William M. Treanor, the dean of the school.
 In the summer of 2004, Kamal Essaheb went to work as a legal intern for Sanctuary for Families, an agency for victims of domestic violence. There, he began talking to an immigration lawyer, Julie E. Dinnerstein, about his case. 
 Ms. Dinnerstein, 36, quickly realized he needed a lawyer, she said, and has been representing the Essahebs ever since. She can often be found at the Essaheb home, surrounded by briefs and other papers, strategizing late into the night. At her urging, Mr. Essaheb finally spoke publicly about his case on a panel at Fordham in April, which prompted the students to begin a letter-writing campaign. So far, 1,150 letters have been submitted to the government lawyers pursuing the case.
 The effort seems to have made no difference, Ms. Dinnerstein said. Mr. Knocke said he could not comment about the case. 
 ''I joke all the time that this case is going to break my heart and I'm going to become a shelver of books in a library,'' she said one afternoon as she sat in the Essahebs' living room.
 Hassan and Housseine Essaheb are more reluctant to speak publicly. They have yet to tell their oldest friends, the young Italian-Americans with whom they play hockey every week.
 Food is the measure of stress in the Essaheb home. On difficult days, baklava and cornes de gazelle pile up on the dining room table. Platters of beef, couscous and fried fish stream endlessly from the kitchen. Mrs. Essaheb learned to cook after the family left Morocco and soon the kitchen became her domain and food her firmest hold on the men in her house. Lately, she bakes at all hours.
 ''I don't want them to feel there is something bad happening,'' Mrs. Essaheb said as she stood over a bowl of ground almonds and sugar. She began to cry and walked to the sink to dry her face.
 For all the tumult, the Essahebs rarely discuss their immigration problems. In a rare moment one Saturday afternoon, the family gathered to talk about what they would do if the three sons were deported. The Essahebs have lost touch with most of their relatives. Kamal, Hassan and Housseine Essaheb would in many ways have to repeat the lonely passage their parents took to the United States: they would arrive in Morocco, a foreign country, with a suitcase and some telephone numbers.
 Kamal Essaheb shook his head at the thought. 
 ''We feel like we've accomplished quite a bit, and we're on the brink of really contributing,'' he said. ''My dad has worked so hard. This kid is going to work on Wall Street,'' he said, pointing to his brother Hassan.
 ''I have to sell the house and go,'' Mrs. Essaheb said later. ''I can't send my kids and stay here. For what? For them I came here.''

PERSON: Brig. Gen. William Thomas Seawell

HEADLINE: Brig. Gen. William T. Seawell, 87, Former Chief of Pan American

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Brig. Gen. William Thomas Seawell, who commanded bombers in World War II and the cadet corps at the Air Force Academy and led Pan American World Airways, died on Friday at home in Pine Bluff, Ark., his birthplace. He was 87. 
 The apparent cause was a heart attack, his family said. 
 General Seawell (pronounced SOO-uhl) was a 1941 graduate of West Point and received a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1949. His 22-year military career began in World War II with the Army Air Corps in Europe.
 He led a bomber squadron and then the 401st Bombardment Group, earning a Silver Star; the Distinguished Flying Cross with three oak-leaf clusters; the Air Medal, also with three oak-leaf clusters; and the Croix de Guerre, with palm, from France. After more postwar air commands, he was named military assistant to the secretary of the Air Force in 1958.
 His last posting, from 1961 to 1963, was as commandant of cadets at the Air Force Academy. He then worked briefly for the Air Transport Association as vice president for operations and engineering.
 In 1965 he moved to New York as senior vice president for operations at American Airlines and, after that, as president of Rolls-Royce Aero Engines, an American subsidiary of Rolls-Royce Ltd. of Britain. Pan Am recruited him in 1971 as its president and chief operating officer, under Najeeb E. Halaby, then the chairman and chief executive.
 At the time, airlines were in a slump and Pan Am, despite its illustrious history, stood out as one of the most troubled. As the crisis mounted, the Pan Am board forced Mr. Halaby out in 1972 and made General Seawell chairman and chief executive. 
 Mr. Halaby had championed the Boeing 747 jumbo jet, but the cost of its introduction was compounded by a recession, increased competition and the prospects of higher fuel costs. General Seawell sought to halt the airline's economic decline, but by 1980 its operating loss for the year was $127 million, the worst in its history to that point, with worse to come.
 In mid-1981, he announced his retirement. He was succeeded by C. Edward Acker. In the years that followed, Pan Am went into its final decline, its fate sealed with the sale of many of the overseas routes that made it famous. It went out of business in 1991. 
 General Seawell is survived by his wife of 63 years, Judith Alexander Seawell; a son, A. Brooke Seawell of Menlo Park, Calif.; a daughter, Anne S. Robinson of Pine Bluff; and four grandsons.

HEADLINE: What Women Want

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Suppose you could eliminate the factors often blamed for the shortage of women in high-paying jobs. Suppose that promotions and raises did not depend on pleasing sexist male bosses or putting in long nights and weekends away from home. Would women make as much as men?
 Economists recently tried to find out in an experiment in Pittsburgh by paying men and women to add up five numbers in their heads. At first they worked individually, doing as many sums as they could in five minutes and receiving 50 cents for each correct answer. Then they competed in four-person tournaments, with the winner getting $2 per correct answer and the losers getting nothing. 
 On average, the women made as much as the men under either system. But when they were offered a choice for the next round -- take the piece rate or compete in a tournament -- most women declined to compete, even the ones who had done the best in the earlier rounds. Most men chose the tournament, even the ones who had done the worst.
 The men's eagerness partly stemmed from overconfidence, because on average men rated their ability more highly than the women rated theirs. But interviews and further experiments convinced the researchers, Muriel Niederle of Stanford and Lise Vesterlund of the University of Pittsburgh, that the gender gap wasn't due mainly to women's insecurities about their abilities. It was due to different appetites for competition.
 ''Even in tasks where they do well, women seem to shy away from competition, whereas men seem to enjoy it too much,'' Professor Niederle said. ''The men who weren't good at this task lost a little money by choosing to compete, and the really good women passed up a lot of money by not entering tournaments they would have won.''
 You can argue that this difference is due to social influences, although I suspect it's largely innate, a byproduct of evolution and testosterone. Whatever the cause, it helps explain why men set up the traditional corporate ladder as one continual winner-take-all competition -- and why that structure no longer makes sense.
 Now that so many employees (and more than half of young college graduates) are women, running a business like a tournament alienates some of the most talented workers and potential executives. It also induces competition in situations where cooperation makes more sense. 
 The result is not good for the bottom line, as demonstrated by a study from the Catalyst research organization showing that large companies yield better returns to stockholders if they have more women in senior management. A friend of mine, a businessman who buys companies, told me one of the first things he looks at is the gender of the boss. 
 ''The companies run by women are much more likely to survive,'' he said. ''The typical guy who starts a company is a competitive, charismatic leader -- he's always the firm's top salesman -- but if he leaves he takes his loyal followers with him and the company goes downhill. Women C.E.O.'s know how to hire good salespeople and create a healthy culture within the company. Plus they don't spend 20 percent of their time in strip clubs.''
 Still, for all the executive talents that women have, for all the changes that are happening in the corporate world, there will always be some jobs that women, on average, will not want as badly as men do. Some of the best-paying jobs require crazed competition and the willingness to risk big losses -- going broke, never seeing your family and friends, dying young.
 The women in the experiment who didn't want to bother with a five-minute tournament are not likely to relish spending 16 hours a day on a Wall Street trading floor. It's not fair to deny women a chance at those jobs, but it's not realistic to expect that they'll seek them in the same numbers that men will. 
 For two decades, academics crusading for equality in the workplace have been puzzled by surveys showing that women are at least as satisfied with their jobs and their pay as men are. This is known as ''the paradox of the contented female worker.'' 
 But maybe it's not such a paradox after all. Maybe women, like the ones who shunned the experimental tournament, know they could make more money in some jobs but also know they wouldn't enjoy competing for it as much as their male rivals. They realize, better than men, that in life there's a lot more at stake than money.

HEADLINE: The College Dropout Boom

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

DATELINE: CHILHOWIE, Va. 

 BODY:
One of the biggest decisions Andy Blevins has ever made, and one of the few he now regrets, never seemed like much of a decision at all. It just felt like the natural thing to do.
 In the summer of 1995, he was moving boxes of soup cans, paper towels and dog food across the floor of a supermarket warehouse, one of the biggest buildings here in southwest Virginia. The heat was brutal. The job had sounded impossible when he arrived fresh off his first year of college, looking to make some summer money, still a skinny teenager with sandy blond hair and a narrow, freckled face.
 But hard work done well was something he understood, even if he was the first college boy in his family. Soon he was making bonuses on top of his $6.75 an hour, more money than either of his parents made. His girlfriend was around, and so were his hometown buddies. Andy acted more outgoing with them, more relaxed. People in Chilhowie noticed that. 
 It was just about the perfect summer. So the thought crossed his mind: maybe it did not have to end. Maybe he would take a break from college and keep working. He had been getting C's and D's, and college never felt like home, anyway.
 ''I enjoyed working hard, getting the job done, getting a paycheck,'' Mr. Blevins recalled. ''I just knew I didn't want to quit.''
 So he quit college instead, and with that, Andy Blevins joined one of the largest and fastest-growing groups of young adults in America. He became a college dropout, though nongraduate may be the more precise term.
 Many people like him plan to return to get their degrees, even if few actually do. Almost one in three Americans in their mid-20's now fall into this group, up from one in five in the late 1960's, when the Census Bureau began keeping such data. Most come from poor and working-class families.
 The phenomenon has been largely overlooked in the glare of positive news about the country's gains in education. Going to college has become the norm throughout most of the United States, even in many places where college was once considered an exotic destination -- places like Chilhowie (pronounced chill-HOW-ee), an Appalachian hamlet with a simple brick downtown. At elite universities, classrooms are filled with women, blacks, Jews and Latinos, groups largely excluded two generations ago. The American system of higher learning seems to have become a great equalizer.
 In fact, though, colleges have come to reinforce many of the advantages of birth. On campuses that enroll poorer students, graduation rates are often low. And at institutions where nearly everyone graduates -- small colleges like Colgate, major state institutions like the University of Colorado and elite private universities like Stanford -- more students today come from the top of the nation's income ladder than they did two decades ago.
 Only 41 percent of low-income students entering a four-year college managed to graduate within five years, the Department of Education found in a study last year, but 66 percent of high-income students did. That gap had grown over recent years.''We need to recognize that the most serious domestic problem in the United States today is the widening gap between the children of the rich and the children of the poor,'' Lawrence H. Summers, the president of Harvard, said last year when announcing that Harvard would give full scholarships to all its lowest-income students. ''And education is the most powerful weapon we have to address that problem.'' 
 There is certainly much to celebrate about higher education today. Many more students from all classes are getting four-year degrees and reaping their benefits. But those broad gains mask the fact that poor and working-class students have nevertheless been falling behind; for them, not having a degree remains the norm. 
 That loss of ground is all the more significant because a college education matters much more now than it once did. A bachelor's degree, not a year or two of courses, tends to determine a person's place in today's globalized, computerized economy. College graduates have received steady pay increases over the past two decades, while the pay of everyone else has risen little more than the rate of inflation.
 As a result, despite one of the great education explosions in modern history, economic mobility -- moving from one income group to another over the course of a lifetime -- has stopped rising, researchers say. Some recent studies suggest that it has declined over the last generation. 
 Put another way, children seem to be following the paths of their parents more than they once did. Grades and test scores, rather than privilege, determine success today, but that success is largely being passed down from one generation to the next. A nation that believes that everyone should have a fair shake finds itself with a kind of inherited meritocracy.
 In this system, the students at the best colleges may be diverse -- male and female and of various colors, religions and hometowns -- but they tend to share an upper-middle-class upbringing. An old joke that Harvard's idea of diversity is putting a rich kid from California in the same room as a rich kid from New York is truer today than ever; Harvard has more students from California than it did in years past and just as big a share of upper-income students.
 Students like these remain in college because they can hardly imagine doing otherwise. Their parents, understanding the importance of a bachelor's degree, spent hours reading to them, researching school districts and making it clear to them that they simply must graduate from college.
 Andy Blevins says that he too knows the importance of a degree, but that he did not while growing up, and not even in his year at Radford University, 66 miles up the Interstate from Chilhowie. Ten years after trading college for the warehouse, Mr. Blevins, 29, spends his days at the same supermarket company. He has worked his way up to produce buyer, earning $35,000 a year with health benefits and a 401(k) plan. He is on a path typical for someone who attended college without getting a four-year degree. Men in their early 40's in this category made an average of $42,000 in 2000. Those with a four-year degree made $65,000. 
 Still boyish-looking but no longer rail thin, Mr. Blevins says he has many reasons to be happy. He lives with his wife, Karla, and their year-old son, Lucas, in a small blue-and-yellow house at the end of a cul-de-sac in the middle of a stunningly picturesque Appalachian valley. He plays golf with some of the same friends who made him want to stay around Chilhowie. 
 But he does think about what might have been, about what he could be doing if he had the degree. As it is, he always feels as if he is on thin ice. Were he to lose his job, he says, everything could slip away with it. What kind of job could a guy without a college degree get? One night, while talking to his wife about his life, he used the word ''trapped.''
 ''Looking back, I wish I had gotten that degree,'' Mr. Blevins said in his soft-spoken lilt. ''Four years seemed like a thousand years then. But I wish I would have just put in my four years.''

The Barriers
 Why so many low-income students fall from the college ranks is a question without a simple answer. Many high schools do a poor job of preparing teenagers for college. Many of the colleges where lower-income students tend to enroll have limited resources and offer a narrow range of majors, leaving some students disenchanted and unwilling to continue. 
 Then there is the cost. Tuition bills scare some students from even applying and leave others with years of debt. To Mr. Blevins, like many other students of limited means, every week of going to classes seemed like another week of losing money -- money that might have been made at a job. 
 ''The system makes a false promise to students,'' said John T. Casteen III, the president of the University of Virginia, himself the son of a Virginia shipyard worker.
 Colleges, Mr. Casteen said, present themselves as meritocracies in which academic ability and hard work are always rewarded. In fact, he said, many working-class students face obstacles they cannot overcome on their own. 
 For much of his 15 years as Virginia's president, Mr. Casteen has focused on raising money and expanding the university, the most prestigious in the state. In the meantime, students with backgrounds like his have become ever scarcer on campus. The university's genteel nickname, the Cavaliers, and its aristocratic sword-crossed coat of arms seem appropriate today. No flagship state university has a smaller proportion of low-income students than Virginia. Just 8 percent of undergraduates last year came from families in the bottom half of the income distribution, down from 11 percent a decade ago. 
 That change sneaked up on him, Mr. Casteen said, and he has spent a good part of the last year trying to prevent it from becoming part of his legacy. Starting with next fall's freshman class, the university will charge no tuition and require no loans for students whose parents make less than twice the poverty level, or about $37,700 a year for a family of four. The university has also increased financial aid to middle-income students. 
 To Mr. Casteen, these are steps to remove what he describes as ''artificial barriers'' to a college education placed in the way of otherwise deserving students. Doing so ''is a fundamental obligation of a free culture,'' he said. 
 But the deterrents to a degree can also be homegrown. Many low-income teenagers know few people who have made it through college. A majority of the nongraduates are young men, and some come from towns where the factory work ethic, to get working as soon as possible, remains strong, even if the factories themselves are vanishing. Whatever the reasons, college just does not feel normal.
 ''You get there and you start to struggle,'' said Leanna Blevins, Andy's older sister, who did get a bachelor's degree and then went on to earn a Ph.D at Virginia studying the college experiences of poor students. ''And at home your parents are trying to be supportive and say, 'Well, if you're not happy, if it's not right for you, come back home. It's O.K.' And they think they're doing the right thing. But they don't know that maybe what the student needs is to hear them say, 'Stick it out just one semester. You can do it. Just stay there. Come home on the weekend, but stick it out.'''
 Today, Ms. Blevins, petite and high-energy, is helping to start a new college a few hours' drive from Chilhowie for low-income students. Her brother said he had daydreamed about attending it and had talked to her about how he might return to college.
 For her part, Ms. Blevins says, she has daydreamed about having a life that would seem as natural as her brother's, a life in which she would not feel like an outsider in her hometown. Once, when a high-school teacher asked students to list their goals for the next decade, Ms. Blevins wrote, ''having a college degree'' and ''not being married.''
 ''I think my family probably thinks I'm liberal,'' Ms. Blevins, who is now married, said with a laugh, ''that I've just been educated too much and I'm gettin' above my raisin'.''
 Her brother said that he just wanted more control over his life, not a new one. At a time when many people complain of scattered lives, Mr. Blevins can stand in one spot -- his church parking lot, next to a graveyard -- and take in much of his world. ''That's my parents' house,'' he said one day, pointing to a sliver of roof visible over a hill. ''That's my uncle's trailer. My grandfather is buried here. I'll probably be buried here.''

Taking Class Into Account
 Opening up colleges to new kinds of students has generally meant one thing over the last generation: affirmative action. Intended to right the wrongs of years of exclusion, the programs have swelled the number of women, blacks and Latinos on campuses. But affirmative action was never supposed to address broad economic inequities, just the ones that stem from specific kinds of discrimination.
 That is now beginning to change. Like Virginia, a handful of other colleges are not only increasing financial aid but also promising to give weight to economic class in granting admissions. They say they want to make an effort to admit more low-income students, just as they now do for minorities and children of alumni. 
 ''The great colleges and universities were designed to provide for mobility, to seek out talent,'' said Anthony W. Marx, president of Amherst College. ''If we are blind to the educational disadvantages associated with need, we will simply replicate these disadvantages while appearing to make decisions based on merit.''
 With several populous states having already banned race-based preferences and the United States Supreme Court suggesting that it may outlaw such programs in a couple of decades, the future of affirmative action may well revolve around economics. Polls consistently show that programs based on class backgrounds have wider support than those based on race.
 The explosion in the number of nongraduates has also begun to get the attention of policy makers. This year, New York became one of a small group of states to tie college financing more closely to graduation rates, rewarding colleges more for moving students along than for simply admitting them. Nowhere is the stratification of education more vivid than here in Virginia, where Thomas Jefferson once tried, and failed, to set up the nation's first public high schools. At a modest high school in the Tidewater city of Portsmouth, not far from Mr. Casteen's boyhood home, a guidance office wall filled with college pennants does not include one from rarefied Virginia. The colleges whose pennants are up -- Old Dominion University and others that seem in the realm of the possible -- have far lower graduation rates.
 Across the country, the upper middle class so dominates elite universities that high-income students, on average, actually get slightly more financial aid from colleges than low-income students do. These elite colleges are so expensive that even many high-income students receive large grants. In the early 1990's, by contrast, poorer students got 50 percent more aid on average than the wealthier ones, according to the College Board, the organization that runs the SAT entrance exams. 
 At the other end of the spectrum are community colleges, the two-year institutions that are intended to be feeders for four-year colleges. In nearly every one are tales of academic success against tremendous odds: a battered wife or a combat veteran or a laid-off worker on the way to a better life. But over all, community colleges tend to be places where dreams are put on hold.
 Most people who enroll say they plan to get a four-year degree eventually; few actually do. Full-time jobs, commutes and children or parents who need care often get in the way. One recent national survey found that about 75 percent of students enrolling in community colleges said they hoped to transfer to a four-year institution. But only 17 percent of those who had entered in the mid-1990's made the switch within five years, according to a separate study. The rest were out working or still studying toward the two-year degree. 
 ''We here in Virginia do a good job of getting them in,'' said Glenn Dubois, chancellor of the Virginia Community College System and himself a community college graduate. ''We have to get better in getting them out.''

'I Wear a Tie Every Day'
 College degree or not, Mr. Blevins has the kind of life that many Americans say they aspire to. He fills it with family, friends, church and a five-handicap golf game. He does not sit in traffic commuting to an office park. He does not talk wistfully of a relocated brother or best friend he sees only twice a year. He does not worry about who will care for his son while he works and his wife attends community college to become a physical therapist. His grandparents down the street watch Lucas, just as they took care of Andy and his two sisters when they were children. When Mr. Blevins comes home from work, it is his turn to play with Lucas, tossing him into the air and rolling around on the floor with him and a stuffed elephant. 
 Mr. Blevins also sings in a quartet called the Gospel Gentlemen. One member is his brother-in-law; another lives on Mr. Blevins's street. In the long white van the group owns, they wend their way along mountain roads on their way to singing dates at local church functions, sometimes harmonizing, sometimes ribbing one another or talking about where to buy golf equipment.
 Inside the churches, the other singers often talk to the audience between songs, about God or a grandmother or what a song means to them. Mr. Blevins rarely does, but his shyness fades once he is back in the van with his friends.
 At the warehouse, he is usually the first to arrive, around 6:30 in the morning. The grandson of a coal miner, he takes pride, he says, in having moved up to become a supermarket buyer. He decides which bananas, grapes, onions and potatoes the company will sell and makes sure that there are always enough. Most people with his job have graduated from college.
 ''I'm pretty fortunate to not have a degree but have a job where I wear a tie every day,'' he said. 
 He worries about how long it will last, though, mindful of what happened to his father, Dwight, a decade ago. A high school graduate, Dwight Blevins was laid off from his own warehouse job and ended up with another one that paid less and offered a smaller pension.
 ''A lot of places, they're not looking that you're trained in something,'' Andy Blevins said one evening, sitting on his back porch. ''They just want you to have a degree.''
 Figuring out how to get one is the core quandary facing the nation's college nongraduates. Many seem to want one. In a New York Times poll, 43 percent of them called it essential to success, while 42 percent of college graduates and 32 percent of high-school dropouts did. This in itself is a change from the days when ''college boy'' was an insult in many working-class neighborhoods. But once students take a break -- the phrase that many use instead of drop out -- the ideal can quickly give way to reality. Family and work can make a return to school seem even harder than finishing it in the first place.
 After dropping out of Radford, Andy Blevins enrolled part-time in a community college, trying to juggle work and studies. He lasted a year. From time to time in the decade since, he has thought about giving it another try. But then he has wondered if that would be crazy. He works every third Saturday, and his phone rings on Sundays when there is a problem with the supply of potatoes or apples. ''It never ends,'' he said. ''There's a never a lull.''
 To spend more time with Lucas, Mr. Blevins has already cut back on his singing. If he took night classes, he said, when would he ever see his little boy? Anyway, he said, it would take years to get a degree part-time. To him, it is a tug of war between living in the present and sacrificing for the future.

Few Breaks for the Needy
 The college admissions system often seems ruthlessly meritocratic. Yes, children of alumni still have an advantage. But many other pillars of the old system -- the polite rejections of women or blacks, the spots reserved for graduates of Choate and Exeter -- have crumbled.
 This was the meritocracy Mr. Casteen described when he greeted the parents of freshman in a University of Virginia lecture hall late last summer. Hailing from all 50 states and 52 foreign countries, the students were more intelligent and better prepared than he and his classmates had been, he told the parents in his quiet, deep voice. The class included 17 students with a perfect SAT score.
 If anything, children of privilege think that the system has moved so far from its old-boy history that they are now at a disadvantage when they apply, because colleges are trying to diversify their student rolls. To get into a good college, the sons and daughters of the upper middle class often talk of needing a higher SAT score than, say, an applicant who grew up on a farm, in a ghetto or in a factory town. Some state legislators from Northern Virginia's affluent suburbs have argued that this is a form of geographic discrimination and have quixotically proposed bills to outlaw it. 
 But the conventional wisdom is not quite right. The elite colleges have not been giving much of a break to the low-income students who apply. When William G. Bowen, a former president of Princeton, looked at admissions records recently, he found that if test scores were equal a low-income student had no better chance than a high-income one of getting into a group of 19 colleges, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Williams and Virginia. Athletes, legacy applicants and minority students all got in with lower scores on average. Poorer students did not. 
 The findings befuddled many administrators, who insist that admissions officers have tried to give poorer applicants a leg up. To emphasize the point, Virginia announced this spring that it was changing its admissions policy from ''need blind'' -- a term long used to assure applicants that they would not be punished for seeking financial aid -- to ''need conscious.'' Administrators at Amherst and Harvard have also recently said that they would redouble their efforts to take into account the obstacles students have overcome. 
 ''The same score reflects more ability when you come from a less fortunate background,'' Mr. Summers, the president of Harvard, said. ''You haven't had a chance to take the test-prep course. You went to a school that didn't do as good a job coaching you for the test. You came from a home without the same opportunities for learning.''
 But it is probably not a coincidence that elite colleges have not yet turned this sentiment into action. Admitting large numbers of low-income students could bring clear complications. Too many in a freshman class would probably lower the college's average SAT score, thereby damaging its ranking by U.S. News & World Report, a leading arbiter of academic prestige. Some colleges, like Emory University in Atlanta, have climbed fast in the rankings over precisely the same period in which their percentage of low-income students has tumbled. The math is simple: when a college goes looking for applicants with high SAT scores, it is far more likely to find them among well-off teenagers. 
 More spots for low-income applicants might also mean fewer for the children of alumni, who make up the fund-raising base for universities. More generous financial aid policies will probably lead to higher tuition for those students who can afford the list price. Higher tuition, lower ranking, tougher admission requirements: they do not make for an easy marketing pitch to alumni clubs around the country. But Mr. Casteen and his colleagues are going ahead, saying the pendulum has swung too far in one direction.
 That was the mission of John Blackburn, Virginia's easy-going admissions dean, when he rented a car and took to the road recently. Mr. Blackburn thought of the trip as a reprise of the drives Mr. Casteen took 25 years earlier, when he was the admissions dean, traveling to churches and community centers to persuade black parents that the university was finally interested in their children.
 One Monday night, Mr. Blackburn came to Big Stone Gap, in a mostly poor corner of the state not far from Andy Blevins's town. A community college there was holding a college fair, and Mr. Blackburn set up a table in a hallway, draping it with the University of Virginia's blue and orange flag.
 As students came by, Mr. Blackburn would explain Virginia's new admissions and financial aid policies. But he soon realized that the Virginia name might have been scaring off the very people his pitch was intended for. Most of the students who did approach the table showed little interest in the financial aid and expressed little need for it. One man walked up to Mr. Blackburn and introduced his son as an aspiring doctor. The father was an ophthalmologist. Other doctors came by, too. So did some lawyers.
 ''You can't just raise the UVa flag,'' Mr. Blackburn said, packing up his materials at the end of the night, ''and expect a lot of low-income kids to come out.''
 When the applications started arriving in his office this spring, there seemed to be no increase in those from low-income students. So Mr. Blackburn extended the deadline two weeks for everybody, and his colleagues also helped some applicants with the maze of financial aid forms. Of 3,100 incoming freshmen, it now seems that about 180 will qualify for the new financial aid program, up from 130 who would have done so last year. It is not a huge number, but Virginia administrators call it a start.

A Big Decision
 On a still-dark February morning, with the winter's heaviest snowfall on the ground, Andy Blevins scraped off his Jeep and began his daily drive to the supermarket warehouse. As he passed the home of Mike Nash, his neighbor and fellow gospel singer, he noticed that the car was still in the driveway. For Mr. Nash, a school counselor and the only college graduate in the singing group, this was a snow day.
 Mr. Blevins later sat down with his calendar and counted to 280: the number of days he had worked last year. Two hundred and eighty days -- six days a week most of the time -- without ever really knowing what the future would hold.
 ''I just realized I'm going to have to do something about this,'' he said, ''because it's never going to end.'' 
 In the weeks afterward, his daydreaming about college and his conversations about it with his sister Leanna turned into serious research. He requested his transcripts from Radford and from Virginia Highlands Community College and figured out that he had about a year's worth of credits. He also talked to Leanna about how he could become an elementary school teacher. He always felt that he could relate to children, he said. The job would take up 180 days, not 280. Teachers do not usually get laid off or lose their pensions or have to take a big pay cut to find new work. 
 So the decision was made. On May 31, Andy Blevins says, he will return to Virginia Highlands, taking classes at night; the Gospel Gentlemen are no longer booking performances. After a year, he plans to take classes by video and on the Web that are offered at the community college but run by Old Dominion, a Norfolk, Va., university with a big group of working-class students. 
 ''I don't like classes, but I've gotten so motivated to go back to school,'' Mr. Blevins said. ''I don't want to, but, then again, I do.''
 He thinks he can get his bachelor's degree in three years. If he gets it at all, he will have defied the odds.

HEADLINE: No Degree, and No Way Back to the Middle

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SPOKANE, Wash. 

 BODY:
Over the course of his adult life, Jeff Martinelli has married three women and buried one of them, a cancer victim. He had a son and has watched him raise a child of his own. Through it all, one thing was constant: a factory job that was his ticket to the middle class.
 It was not until that job disappeared, and he tried to find something -- anything -- to keep him close to the security of his former life that Mr. Martinelli came to an abrupt realization about the fate of a working man with no college degree in 21st-century America.
 He has skills developed operating heavy machinery, laboring over a stew of molten bauxite at Kaiser Aluminum, once one of the best jobs in this city of 200,000. His health is fine. He has no shortage of ambition. But the world has changed for people like Mr. Martinelli. 
 ''For a guy like me, with no college, it's become pretty bleak out there,'' said Mr. Martinelli, who is 50 and deals with life's curves with a resigned shrug.
 His son, Caleb, already knows what it is like out there. Since high school, Caleb has had six jobs, none very promising. Now 28, he may never reach the middle class, he said. But for his father and others of a generation that could count on a comfortable life without a degree, the fall out of the middle class has come as a shock. They had been frozen in another age, a time when Kaiser factory workers could buy new cars, take decent vacations and enjoy full health care benefits.
 They have seen factory gates close and not reopen. They have taken retraining classes for jobs that pay half their old wages. And as they hustle around for work, they have been constantly reminded of the one thing that stands out on their resumes: the education that ended with a high school diploma.
 It is not just that the American economy has shed six million manufacturing jobs over the last three decades; it is that the market value of those put out of work, people like Jeff Martinelli, has declined considerably over their lifetimes, opening a gap that has left millions of blue-collar workers at the margins of the middle class.
 And the changes go beyond the factory floor. Mark McClellan worked his way up from the Kaiser furnaces to management. He did it by taking extra shifts and learning everything he could about the aluminum business.
 Still, in 2001, when Kaiser closed, Mr. McClellan discovered that the job market did not value his factory skills nearly as much as it did four years of college. He had the experience, built over a lifetime, but no degree. And for that, he said, he was marked.
 He still lives in a grand house in one of the nicest parts of town, and he drives a big white Jeep. But they are a facade.
 ''I may look middle class,'' said Mr. McClellan, who is 45, with a square, honest face and a barrel chest. ''But I'm not. My boat is sinking fast.''
 By the time these two Kaiser men were forced out of work, a man in his 50's with a college degree could expect to earn 81 percent more than a man of the same age with just a high school diploma. When they had started work, the gap was only 52 percent. Other studies show different numbers, but the same trend -- a big disparity that opened over their lifetimes.
 Mr. Martinelli refuses to feel sorry for himself. He has a job in pest control now, killing ants and spiders at people's homes, making barely half the money he made at the Kaiser smelter, where a worker with his experience would make about $60,000 a year in wages and benefits. 
 ''At least I have a job,'' he said. ''Some of the guys I worked with have still not found anything. A couple of guys lost their houses.''
 Mr. Martinelli and other former factory workers say that, over time, they have come to fear that the fall out of the middle class could be permanent. Their new lives -- the frustrating job interviews, the bills that arrive with red warning letters on the outside -- are consequences of a decision made at age 18.
 The management veteran, Mr. McClellan, was a doctor's son, just out of high school, when he decided he did not need to go much farther than the big factory at the edge of town. He thought about going to college. But when he got on at Kaiser, he felt he had arrived.
 His father, a general practitioner now dead, gave him his blessing, even encouraged him in the choice, Mr. McClellan said.
 At the time, the decision to skip college was not that unusual, even for a child of the middle class. Despite Mr. McClellan's lack of skills or education beyond the 12th grade, there was good reason to believe that the aluminum factory could get him into middle-class security quicker than a bachelor's degree could, he said.
 By 22, he was a group foreman. By 28, a supervisor. By 32, he was in management. Before his 40th birthday, Mr. McClellan hit his earnings peak, making $100,000 with bonuses.
 Friends of his, people with college degrees, were not earning close to that, Mr. McClellan said.
 ''I had a house with a swimming pool, new cars,'' he said. ''My wife never had to work. I was right in the middle of middle-class America and I knew it and I loved it.''
 If anything, the union man, Mr. Martinelli, appreciated the middle-class life even more, because of the distance he had traveled to get there. He remembers his stomach growling at night as a child, the humiliation of welfare, hauling groceries home through the snow on a little cart because the family had no car.
 ''I was ashamed,'' he said. 
 He was a C student without much of a future, just out of high school, when he got his break: the job on the Kaiser factory floor. Inside, it was long shifts around hot furnaces. Outside, he was a prince of Spokane.
 College students worked inside the factory in the summer, and some never went back to school.
 ''You knew people leaving here for college would sometimes get better jobs, but you had a good job, so it was fine,'' said Mike Lacy, a close friend of Mr. Martinelli and a co-worker at Kaiser.
 The job lasted just short of 30 years. Kaiser, debt-ridden after a series of failed management initiatives and a long strike, closed the plant in 2001 and sold the factory carcass for salvage.
 Mr. McClellan has yet to find work, living off his dwindling savings and investments from his years at Kaiser, though he continues with plans to open his own car wash. He pays $900 a month for a basic health insurance policy -- vital to keep his wife, Vicky, who has a rare brain disease, alive. He pays an additional $500 a month for her medications. He is both husband and nurse.
 ''Am I scared just a little bit?'' he said. ''Yeah, I am.''
 He has vowed that his son David will never do the kind of second-guessing that he is. Even at 16, David knows what he wants to do: go to college and study medicine. He said his father, whom he has seen struggle to balance the tasks of home nurse with trying to pay the bills, had grown heroic in his eyes.
 He said he would not make the same choice his father did 27 years earlier. ''There's nothing like the Kaiser plant around here anymore,'' he said.
 Mr. McClellan agrees. He is firm in one conclusion, having risen from the factory floor only to be knocked down: ''There is no working up anymore.''

HEADLINE: A Modest Victory for the President, but Challenging Tests Still Lie Ahead

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
President Bush won enough from the bipartisan compromise on judicial nominees on Monday night to claim a limited victory, but he now faces a series of additional tests of his political authority, with the stakes extending to the fate of his second-term agenda.
 On the plus side for Mr. Bush, the bipartisan agreement among 14 centrist senators expressly called for up-or-down votes on three of his nominees to federal appeals court seats, all but ensuring their confirmations, though it left in limbo the fate of two more.
 By explicitly exempting from the agreement two additional judges opposed by Democrats, it did not meet Mr. Bush's oft-stated demand that all his nominees get a vote, and it did not foreclose the possibility that Democrats could block an eventual nominee to the Supreme Court, a matter of intense concern to the White House. The split-the-baby outcome, moreover, did little to resolve a rolling series of challenges to Mr. Bush that in coming days and weeks could do much to set the tone for his second four years in office. 
 On Tuesday, the House is to vote on a bill that would defy Mr. Bush and lift restrictions on federal financing of stem-cell research, legislation that stands a good chance of passing. 
 In the days and weeks that follow, Congress will confront a proposed trade agreement with Central America, the confirmation of Mr. Bush's embattled choice as to be ambassador to the United Nations, an effort to rein in government spending and the first legislative steps toward overhauling Social Security -- all topics on which Mr. Bush faces excruciatingly close votes in Congress, where Democrats are generally united against him and his own party is splintering around the edges.
 Although the deal on judges announced by the 14 senators fell well short of the principle set out by Mr. Bush that all nominees get a vote on the Senate floor, the White House said it viewed the development as positive. Mr. Bush has always tried to create an atmosphere within the White House that takes the day-to-day bumps in stride and focuses on winning in the long run.
 But Monday evening's partial victory was hardly a display of overwhelming political strength. Beyond the judicial nominations, administration officials and their outside advisers recognize that the convergence of so many high-stakes issues in such a short period will shape public perceptions of Mr. Bush's power at a time when his approval ratings are already lackluster and his signature domestic initiative, remaking Social Security, is in trouble.
 To some degree, the confluence of disparate issues is coincidence. But in another way it is the logical consequence of Mr. Bush's decision to expend his political capital, as he put it immediately after his re-election, to push through initiatives that he suggested voters had endorsed by putting him back in the White House. 
 From his push to add investment accounts to Social Security to his nomination of John R. Bolton to be the United States envoy to the United Nations to his opposition to pork barrel spending in the Senate's highway construction bill, Mr. Bush has been assertive and even provocative in probing the limits of his own power.
 In recognition of the stakes, Mr. Bush has been stepping up his courtship of Congress members, holding nine meetings over the last month in the Cabinet Room and the White House residence, with two more meetings scheduled this week. Vice President Dick Cheney has been taking a more active role in dealing with Congress on domestic issues. The White House message machine has been relentlessly seeking to put the onus on Congress not to block Mr. Bush's initiatives, in effect putting the responsibility on Democrats to move toward Mr. Bush rather than the other way around, and pre-emptively casting them as obstructionist.
 ''This is a critical period,'' said Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman. ''The American people expect Washington to act and work to find solutions to our most pressing priorities.''
 Should Mr. Bush follow up his partial victory on the judicial nominees with progress on the other issues that are tied up before the House and Senate, he would no doubt be strengthened when it comes to a possible Supreme Court nomination this summer and for other topics working their way through the pipeline, including his energy bill and his stalled immigration initiative.
 Among those in Washington who think Mr. Bush has bitten off more than even a Republican Congress can digest, his situation is analogous to what happened to President Bill Clinton in 1993, when he faced messy battles on Capitol Hill over his economic, trade and health care initiatives, and to Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1995, when he ran into the limits of support for a Republican reshaping of government.
 ''It was an overreach in both cases, and in both cases their reputations suffered as a result of lack of success,'' said Stephen Wayne, a presidential scholar at Georgetown University. ''I see Bush's situation as kind of parallel.''
 But when faced with tight legislative situations in the past, Mr. Bush has shown an ability to win narrowly, or to win ugly, or occasionally, as when faced in his first term with certain defeat over his opposition to creating a new homeland security department, to capitulate and brazenly claim an opponent's idea as his own. 
 So no one is counting him out now, in any of the specific battles he faces, or in the overall situation. In some ways, he is winning simply by showing his conservative base that he will fight on principle, no matter the political cost, a trait that has also tended to buttress his standing among voters generally.
 White House officials say that in fact Mr. Bush has gotten off to a fast start in his second term, signing legislation to tighten the bankruptcy code and rein in class action lawsuits, getting Congress to adopt a budget blueprint that largely hews to his proposals and setting the stage for action on the other big issues.
 ''It's important for us to keep the focus on the progress that's been made and the significant victories that may have been overshadowed by some of the drama,'' said Nicolle Devenish, the White House communications director. ''It's important for us to reassure the American public that we're making important progress on Social Security reform and energy legislation.''
 Among more moderate Republicans there is some concern that Mr. Bush has so harnessed his presidency to ideological issues that he has lost touch with the issues of most concern to Americans right now, like high gasoline prices. 
 ''The only reason he's still up there in the 40's is that the Democrats are really brain dead and have nothing positive to put on the table,'' said one veteran Republican who has close ties to the White House, referring to approval ratings in polls that are at or near Mr. Bush's low points. 
 ''What you see is that he's increasingly turning overseas to demonstrate leadership because he's having so much trouble in the molasses of the Beltway,'' said the Republican, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to be quoted criticizing the president.

HEADLINE: Corzine Offers Health Plan; Rivals Unite in Attacking It

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: VOORHEES, N.J., May 23 

 BODY:
With Republicans mired in an increasingly caustic primary, Senator Jon S. Corzine, the de facto Democratic nominee, sought to take center stage on Monday in New Jersey's gubernatorial race by unveiling a health care plan intended to slow increases in insurance premiums and help hundreds of thousands of uninsured New Jersey residents afford coverage.
 Mr. Corzine's proposal called for universal coverage for pregnant women and children and for a pool of finances to help small businesses pay for catastrophic care. The proposal would also require insurance companies to allow parents to cover their adult children, ages 19 to 30. He said that his goal was to have 95 percent of the state's residents covered by health insurance by 2009, up from 81 percent today. 
 The plan also called for steps to trim costs of the state's health care system by imposing harsher penalties for fraud, encouraging electronic processing of claims and increasing the use of generic prescription drugs. Mr. Corzine said that tens of millions of dollars in savings would allow him to start his programs with only $15 million in additional money from taxpayers.
 ''Through small investments and by redirecting resources, we can make New Jersey's health care system more accessible and more affordable,'' Mr. Corzine said in an address to health care providers at the Virtua Health complex here.
 Regardless of whether Mr. Corzine is elected or his plan is ever enacted, his announcement allowed the state's embattled Republicans to pause after weeks of pounding each other and unite in their condemnation of the proposal. Tom Wilson, chairman of the state's Republican Party, said the $15 million price tag understated the cost.
 ''If cutting the number of uninsured in New Jersey by half, providing universal health care for pregnant women and children, reducing air pollution, solving minority health disparities and addressing the shortage of health care workers only cost $15 million, then Jim Florio would have done it 15 years ago,'' Mr. Wilson said, referring to the former Democratic governor. ''This plan fails the fundamental threshold issue of being honest.''
 Douglas Forrester, one of the leading candidates for the Republican nomination in the June 7 primary, called Mr. Corzine's record on health care ''abysmal.''
 ''He voted against a prescription drug plan, medical savings accounts, tax credits for small businesses to purchase health insurance and has voted four times against legislation to lower insurance costs by curbing medical liability cases,'' said Sherry Sylvester, a spokeswoman for Mr. Forrester.
 Mr. Corzine's announcement came on a day when a new poll was released showing that he had a sizable lead over any of the contenders for the Republican nomination. Republicans said that they were buoyed by the survey -- conducted by the Eagleton Institute of Politics in New Brunswick, N.J., and The Star Ledger of Newark -- because it showed that Mr. Corzine's approval ratings had dropped to 44 percent in May from 53 percent in February. But Democrats were quick to point out that the poll showed how little interest the Republican primary had generated: pollsters asked respondents their opinion of a fictional candidate, Pete Vincelli, and his recognition among registered voters was higher than that of Todd Caliguire, one of the Republican Party's actual candidates.
 ''While the Republican primary takes the shape of a circular firing squad, Senator Corzine continues to move forward with new ideas and real solutions,'' said Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of Mercer County.
 Some political analysts questioned the timing of Mr. Corzine's announcement, wondering why Democrats would want attention while Republicans were battling one another.
 But Tom Shea, Mr. Corzine's campaign manager, said that the senator wanted to lay out his agenda on ethics reform, the economy, health care and property taxes on his own time.
 ''We've always said that when Jon is going to lay out his plans on major issues when he is ready, regardless of what the other candidates are doing,'' Mr. Shea said. ''We've been enjoying the show, watching the Republicans go after each other. But it was time to talk about the issues.''

HEADLINE: Pirro May Face Senator Clinton In '06 Election

BYLINE: By PATRICK D. HEALY and JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
Under heavy pressure to run against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2006, Jeanine F. Pirro, the district attorney of Westchester County, said yesterday that she would not seek re-election this fall but would instead enter the United States Senate race or another statewide contest next year.
 Such a half step toward an announcement is unusual, but Ms. Pirro, a Republican, apparently calculated it to be in her interest after weeks of pleas from party leaders in Albany, New York City and Washington who are eager to mold her as a new Republican star in advance of the 2006 races.
 New York Republicans were in a rare mood of excitement and anticipation yesterday, after months of worrying that they might be left without a high-profile candidate if Gov. George E. Pataki chooses not to seek re-election next year. 
 Some went so far as to describe Ms. Pirro as this year's version of a younger Mr. Pataki, who was a little-known state senator in 1994 when, with the guidance of party strategists, he went on to vanquish a Democratic legend, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
 ''Jeanine could mount a tremendous challenge to Hillary Clinton, and I feel confident enough to say that Jeanine could beat her,'' said Stephen J. Minarik III, chairman of the New York State Republican Party. ''Anyone who knows Jeanine recognizes her as the giant killer she would be.''
 Ms. Pirro, 53, said at a news conference at the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains that she would forgo seeking a fourth term as district attorney so she could challenge Mrs. Clinton or enter another statewide race next year: the race for governor, her aides said, if Mr. Pataki chooses not to seek a fourth term, or for state attorney general, to face whoever emerges from a crowded field of Democrats.
 Ms. Pirro's decision to move beyond Westchester politically also signaled confidence among her and her aides that she could overcome what they acknowledged was significant baggage created by her husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., a lobbyist in White Plains, who was convicted in 2000 of income tax fraud and served 11 months in a federal prison. But Democrats were skeptical, saying that Mr. Pirro's past would be especially problematic if Ms. Pirro were to run for attorney general.
 Some Westchester Republicans said yesterday they thought she was considering the attorney general's race, given her three terms as district attorney. But those urging her to run against Mrs. Clinton have more power, influence and money behind them.
 Political operatives at the White House and the Republican National Committee have told state Republicans that Ms. Pirro would be a strong candidate for Senate. Ken Mehlman, the chairman of the committee, recently called Ms. Pirro to urge her to consider running, and other Republicans with ties to the White House -- including Mr. Pataki -- have made entreaties to her, according to high-level New York Republicans.
 As their thinking goes, Ms. Pirro, who has won votes across the political spectrum, is better suited than any New York Republican to take on Mrs. Clinton, being a telegenic, intelligent and well-spoken woman who lives in the suburbs and supports abortion rights. 
 According to Republicans who have made that argument directly to Ms. Pirro, even a loss in the Senate race would make her a national Republican celebrity who took her best shot -- and took one for the team -- and who could still easily run later for Senate or governor. 
 Ms. Pirro is known to enjoy her frequent appearances as a commentator on cable television, and a sharp-edged challenge to Mrs. Clinton could only heighten her visibility and appeal, Republicans said.
 ''If she ran and lost against Hillary, she'd at least come away with her own show on Fox,'' said one state Republican who is advising Ms. Pirro, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid upstaging her. 
 Ms. Pirro emphasized yesterday that she had not made a final decision on which race to enter, and that she would wait at least until Mr. Pataki announced his own plans, which he is expected to do by the end of June.
 But she also made clear that she was not intimidated by Mrs. Clinton, who enjoys approval ratings of about 70 percent in New York.
 ''I have never run away from a fight,'' Ms. Pirro said. ''The more challenging something is, the more interested I am in going after it.''
 Asked whether she would make up her mind by going on a pre-Senate ''listening tour,'' like Mrs. Clinton did in 1999 as a newcomer to the state, Ms. Pirro, who was born in Elmira, N.Y., replied: ''The good news is I won't have to listen. I am from this state. I'm from upstate New York and I live down here and I have been in the trenches for the last 29 years.''
 She also said that her relatively specific experience in law enforcement would not limit her, despite concerns among some Westchester Republicans that she would be outmatched by Mrs. Clinton on economic, defense and military issues.
 ''Law enforcement is not just a small issue, it is a huge issue,'' she said. ''Terrorism is an issue, national defense is an issue, Social Security is an issue.''
 The political pressures on Ms. Pirro reflect a variety of competing self-interests among Republicans. State officials want her to run for the Senate because, they believe, tens of millions of dollars in donations nationally will flow to her candidacy, leaving state money for the candidates for governor and attorney general.
 Washington Republicans, meanwhile, think that her law enforcement credentials and past victories could make her a stronger candidate than some others weighing the Senate race, such as the lawyer Edward F. Cox, and the state's health commissioner, Antonia C. Novello.
 Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the state Democratic Party who is close to Mrs. Clinton, declined to handicap a Pirro-Clinton matchup. 
 ''There's a fairly widespread belief in New York that Senator Clinton has done a good job, she's worked hard and she's delivered for the state,'' he said. 
 ''Having said that, we don't take anything for granted,'' Mr. Wolfson added.
 Westchester Democrats, meanwhile, were claiming victory yesterday, saying that Ms. Pirro's decision not to seek re-election showed that she was worried she might lose to her expected opponent, Tony Castro. Ms. Pirro defeated Mr. Castro in the 2001 election, but by her slimmest margin yet, 6 percentage points.
 In recent months, Ms. Pirro faced criticism for implying, during a news conference, that a man accused of kidnapping and raping a young girl was infected with H.I.V.

HEADLINE: Europeans' Anger May Step Up the Pace of Change

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS, May 23 

 BODY:
If voters are angry about economic legislation that rolls back the social welfare state, and they take out their anger on the governing party, does that make more such legislation inevitable?
 As undemocratic as that might sound, investors in Germany seem to think so. As financial analysts said chances of new legislation had increased, the country's stock market rallied Monday after a stinging defeat in regional elections for the Social Democratic Party of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, which led him to call for national elections in the fall.
 ''Early elections could be a positive trigger to recatalyze the reform agenda,'' wrote Julian Callow, chief European economist for Barclays Capital, arguing that the leaderships of both major German parties ''wish to embark upon new reforms.'' 
 Perhaps the most remarkable thing about European politics, at a time when the governments of most Western European countries appear to be unpopular, is that the unpopularity has done nothing to shake the consensus among political leaders that legislation to reduce the welfare state and make it easier to hire and fire workers is needed for Europe to regain its competitive position.
 So far, the major Western European governments have enacted halting reorganizations, with Germany perhaps going the farthest as it cut back on unemployment benefits. The changes have begun to inflict pain but have not produced much measurable improvement in macroeconomic statistics. Growth is slower, and unemployment higher, than a few years ago, and governments in Germany, France and Italy suffered stinging defeats in regional elections.
 In the first five years of the current decade, gross domestic product in the United States and Britain rose more than 13 percent cumulatively, compared with the fourth quarter of 1999. In France, the figure was under 10 percent, while in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands the figure was 5 percent or less. Italy is in a recession, but the government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi managed to cobble together a new coalition to avoid early elections.
 Even though leaders of the two largest political parties in France are campaigning for the proposed European Union constitution, polls still show a narrow majority for opponents in the referendum to be held Sunday. In the Netherlands, which votes a few days later, polls indicate opponents have a larger majority.
 Dutch unemployment is far below that of many of its neighbors -- 5 percent based on a standardized definition used by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, versus 9.8 percent in Germany and France -- but that rate is twice what it was in 2001, and fear of immigration and immigrants has changed the Dutch political landscape.
 Rejection of the constitution would have little immediate practical effect, since the European Union would still operate with its current structure. But rejections could come to be seen as a protest from voters over changes being made that they do not like, including the adoption, albeit in watered-down form, of legislation aimed at making it easier to hire and fire workers and to cut back on state pension benefits. Trying to head off defeat for the constitution, the French president, Jacques Chirac, has argued that the constitution would help to preserve the European social welfare systems, but many backers of the systems remain hostile to the constitution and to changes enacted by Mr. Chirac's government.
 In Germany, none of the parties have spelled out the economic platforms they will run on if the election is this fall. They appear to agree on some areas in which legislative action has stalled, like a proposal to lower the corporate tax rate to 19 percent from 25 percent. While both the Social Democrats and the opposition Christian Democrats support that reduction, they have differed over how to finance it, and it appears unlikely to pass, in part because the opposition does not want Mr. Schroder to get the credit.
 The Social Democrats' defeat in regional elections has left the upper house of Germany's Parliament under the control of the opposition, which has made it much harder to pass legislation. 
 Elga Bartsch, a European economist for Morgan Stanley, said Monday that she thought that an opposition victory in a German national election this year ''would be good news for Germany's economic growth prospects and for further structural reforms.'' She said that in its first years in office, a government led by the Christian Democratic leader, Angela Merkel, would be likely to enjoy substantial majorities in both houses of Parliament and therefore be able to enact reforms.
 Just what those changes would be is far from clear. One idea suggested by Ms. Merkel is to stop paying for the national health care system through a tax on wage earners, which opponents say drives up the cost for employers and discourages hiring. Instead, she suggested a flat tax on all beneficiaries of the system., whether or not they were full-time wage earners. But, Ms. Bartsch said, the Christian Democrats' allies in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union, might not support the idea, which means their combined election platform might be vague.
 After the 2002 German election, which Mr. Schroder narrowly won, he embraced a package of measures he called Agenda 2010. As enacted, the proposals have cut back on Germany's unemployment benefits system and introduced other changes in pensions and health care. Anger at the changes is widely believed to have contributed to his party's defeat in the election on Sunday in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and in the final days of campaigning his party adopted some antibusiness themes, seeking to win back disappointed leftists.
 ''Voting for the C.D.U. Sunday meant putting a stop to Schroder's reform agenda,'' Ms. Bartsch said. ''But in the future, if the C.D.U. has power, there is no stopping the reforms.''

HEADLINE: State's Regions Are Vying For Cut-Rate Electricity

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 23 

 BODY:
Tax breaks for businesses are not the only incentives that New York State can dole out to spur economic development. A less known but equally sought-after benefit is a mix of programs that provide low-cost electricity. 
 Disagreements about who should get the bulk of the cheap, government-subsidized energy are increasingly roiling state lawmakers and their constituents as several programs are expiring and coming up for new debate.
 At the root of the debate is a traditional upstate-downstate clash. Some power customers in the vast western and northern regions of the state, which are struggling with a sluggish economy, pay some of the lowest power rates in the country and want to keep it that way; other customers, including some in New York City and its suburbs, pay among the highest rates and want more of the ''cheap juice,'' particularly if upstate businesses do not use it all. 
 Seen through the prism of Albany politics, the moment is ripe for a literal power struggle over the state's store of cheap electricity and the way it is used to lure and preserve jobs, particularly manufacturing jobs. Mere talk of changing the status quo is angering upstate lawmakers from competing regions and exposing traditional fault lines between upstate and downstate interests.
 One debate centers on electricity generated by the water that cascades over Niagara Falls and whether it should continue to be sent at bargain rates to companies in western New York, or be shared across the state. Another centers on a deal, which expired in January, that allowed New York to give businesses across the state cheap electricity from a nuclear power plant near Lake Ontario. The state sold the plant to a private company, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, in 2000.
 But downstate officials argue that they are already being socked with some costly hidden fees and that on top of that, Consolidated Edison raised its rates in March.
 Upstate representatives are vigorously resisting any attempt by those outside their region to take more of the cheap power, and they have some formidable people speaking for them, including State Senator James W. Wright, a Watertown Republican who is chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, and Assemblyman Paul A. Tokasz, a powerful Democrat from Buffalo.
 ''I think New York would be a net loser if it opened up,'' Mr. Tokasz said of altering the way the subsidized energy is divided. ''This is one of those things, you just don't stick your toe in the water.''
 Jennifer Meicht, a spokeswoman for the Pataki administration, said the future of the power-subsidy programs was a priority topic to be discussed with lawmakers, ''in the hopes of developing a comprehensive long-term solution that encourages job creation and economic development across the state.''
 At issue are the hundreds of megawatts of cheap power that are produced both at the state's Niagara Power Project plant in Lewiston, N.Y., and at the James A. FitzPatrick nuclear plant in Scriba, N.Y., outside Oswego.
 Starting in December, the state will no longer be bound by federal law to provide a subsidy, known as ''replacement power,'' to 60 companies in western New York that get 445 megawatts of bargain electricity from the hydroelectric Niagara Power Project plan, although the state has opted to extend the program through mid-2007. Also, the Niagara plant's federal license is due for renewal in August 2007, when various contracts between the state, the power producer and the customers will also expire.
 As for nuclear power, the state is being forced to buy electricity on the open market to continue a program known as Economic Development Power, which provides 71 companies throughout the state with 260 megawatts of low-cost power. But turning to the open market will mean higher energy costs that several manufacturing companies fear may drive them out of New York. Contracts with customers in that program are beginning to expire this year.
 A possible solution centers on roughly 60 megawatts of unallocated hydroelectric power produced by the Niagara Power Project. But a bill pending in the State Legislature would bar any hydroelectric power from being part of the mix of energy sources the state could use to continue the low-cost power program, whose beneficiaries include The New York Times, as well as other New York newspapers.
 Assemblyman Paul D. Tonko, a Democrat from Amsterdam, west of Albany, who is the chairman of the Assembly Energy Committee, said the sliver of hydroelectric power could be a short-term fix to keep energy costs for those in the subsidy program from nearly doubling.
 He said he had ''serious concerns with proposals that lock up low-cost hydroelectric power in limited geographic areas even when companies leave the region or state.''
 He added: ''The hydroelectric projects are owned by all the people of New York State and should provide economic benefits to citizens across the state.''

HEADLINE: Syria Stops Cooperating With U.S. Forces and C.I.A.

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL and THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
Syria has halted military and intelligence cooperation with the United States, its ambassador to Washington said in an interview, in a sign of growing strains between the two nations over the insurgency in Iraq.
 The ambassador, Imad Moustapha, said in the interview on Friday at the Syrian Embassy here that his country had, in the last 10 days, ''severed all links'' with the United States military and Central Intelligence Agency because of what he called unjust American allegations. The Bush administration has complained bitterly that Syria is not doing enough to halt the flow of men and money to the insurgency in Iraq.
 Mr. Moustapha said he believed that the Bush administration had decided ''to escalate the situation with Syria'' despite steps the Syrians have taken against the insurgents in Iraq, and despite the withdrawal in recent weeks of Syrian troops from Lebanon, in response to international demands. 
 He said American complaints had been renewed since February, when a half-brother of Saddam Hussein, who was once the widely feared head of Iraq's two most powerful security agencies, was handed over to the Iraqi authorities after being captured in Syria along with several lieutenants. The renewal of complaints caused Syria to abandon the idea of providing further help, he said.
 ''We thought, why should we continue to cooperate?'' he said.
 Bush administration officials said Syria's stance has prompted intense debate at high levels in the administration about new steps that might be taken against the Syrian government. The officials said the options included possible military, diplomatic or economic action. But senior Pentagon and military officials cautioned Monday that if any military action was eventually ordered, it was likely to be limited to insurgent movements along the border.
 ''There's a lot of discussion about what to do about Syria and what a problem it is,'' said the administration official, who works for a government agency that has been involved in the debate.
 Relations between Syria and the United States have been souring for months, and some Bush administration officials said Syria's level of cooperation had been dwindling even before the latest move. 
 Lawrence Di Rita, the Pentagon spokesman, said there have been occasional low-level military-to-military communications along the border. He said the Defense Department had received no official notification of a change in that status, nor that the status of American military attaches in Damascus had been altered.
 The American officials declined to provide an on-the-record response to Mr. Moustapha's statements on halting intelligence cooperation, citing the delicacy of the issue.
 American intelligence officials have said Syria has provided important assistance in the campaign against Al Qaeda since the Sept. 11 attacks. In recent months, senior Pentagon officials and military officers say, cooperation between the two nations has included low-level communications across the border between captains and field-grade officers of the American-led alliance and their Syrian counterparts.
 One senior military officer said those communications had been helpful in mitigating a number of ''cross-border firings'' of artillery that have occurred between Syrian forces and the American-led military in Iraq. Any further scaling back of cooperation there or between Syria and the C.I.A. could have a tangible impact, officials said.
 American military officers in Baghdad and intelligence analysts in Washington say militant cells inside Iraq draw on ''unlimited money'' from an underground financial network run by former Baath Party leaders and relatives of Mr. Hussein, many of whom they say found safe haven to live and operate in Syria.
 Those officials say Damascus has done very little in its banking system to stop the financing, nor has it seized former Iraqi Baathists identified by the United States as organizing and financing the insurgency. 
 In presenting Syria's case, Mr. Moustapha said his government had done all it could to respond to American complaints, including taking steps to build barriers and add to border patrols.
 He declined to comment on any role Syria might have played in the capture of Mr. Hussein's half-brother, Sabawi Ibrahim al-Hassan al-Tikriti, No.36 on the American list of 55 most-wanted Iraqis. But the ambassador said Syria had jailed some 1,200 foreign fighters who sought to enter Iraq from Syria, and had returned scores of others to their home countries.
 On the day of the interview with Mr. Moustapha, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Syria was ''allowing its territory to be used to organize terrorist attacks against innocent Iraqis.''
 A senior American military officer acknowledged that ''the Syrian government has in some cases been helpful'' in building border berms and otherwise taking action against people involved in providing support to the insurgency. But the officer added: ''Our sense is that they protest a bit too much and that they are capable of doing more. We expect them to do more.''
 The United States ambassador to Damascus, Margaret Scobey, has been in Washington for several months, having been recalled for consultations after the assassination in Lebanon on Feb. 14 of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister.

	 	 		--------------------	 	

Syrian Pullout Verified
 UNITED NATIONS, May 23 (AP) -- A United Nations team has verified the pullout of all Syrian troops and intelligence officials from Lebanon, Secretary General Kofi Annan announced Monday.
 ''We have verified all the withdrawal, including the border area,'' he told reporters.
 The Security Council adopted a resolution last Sept. 2 calling on Syria to withdraw completely from Lebanon. But it was the international pressure after the Hariri assassination that led the Syrians to leave.
 Syria's last soldier in Lebanon crossed the border on April 26, ending a 29-year military presence that was the key to Damascus's control of Lebanon.

HEADLINE: In Free-Speech Ruling, Justices Say All Ranchers Must Help Pay for Federal Ads

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the government-imposed assessment on beef producers to pay for the ''Beef: It's What's for Dinner'' marketing campaign does not violate the free-speech rights of dissident ranchers who want to opt out of the program.
 Coming after years of constitutional confusion over the many similar programs the Department of Agriculture oversees, for a variety of commodities like cotton, milk and watermelons, the 6-to-3 majority reached its conclusion through a new analytical route that is likely to end much of the courtroom conflict, if not the policy debate behind it. 
 The speech at issue was ''government speech,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority, and as such was not subject to challenge under the First Amendment. The decision overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which had declared the beef program unconstitutional as an instance of ''compelled speech,'' reasoning that it forced the dissident producers to subsidize a message with which they disagreed. 
 That decision, in turn, was based on a Supreme Court decision in 2001, which invalidated, by the same analysis, a similar marketing program for mushrooms. 
 That case, United States v. United Foods, did not address the issue of whether the speech in question was ''government speech,'' instead drawing its conclusion from a line of precedents giving members of labor unions and bar associations the right to withhold their dues from advocacy they did not support.
 But the Supreme Court's application of those precedents from the private sector to government programs raised thorny questions about the right of citizens to withhold tax payments if they disagreed with government activities.
 Sensing the court's readiness in this case, Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Association, No. 03-1164, to reconceptualize the issue, the solicitor general's office argued that government speech was different and should not be subject to ordinary First Amendment analysis, something the court's precedents had suggested but never explicitly held.
 It was an invitation the court grasped. 
 ''Compelled funding of government speech does not alone raise First Amendment concerns,'' Justice Scalia said, adding, ''Citizens may challenge compelled support of private speech, but have no First Amendment right not to fund government speech.'' 
 He said it made no difference whether the speech at issue was supported by general taxes or, as in this case, by ''targeted assessments devoted exclusively to the program to which the assessed citizens object.'' 
 Cattle producers are assessed under the program, generally referred to as a checkoff, $1 for each head of cattle. More than $1 billion has been collected and sent since Congress enacted the program under the Beef Promotion and Research Act of 1985.
 Objectors to this and similar programs are typically family farmers or specialty producers who argue that they have nothing to gain, and in fact are harmed, by generic advertising that overwhelms their own efforts to persuade the public that their products are special and worth searching for.
 Larry Ginter, a pork farmer in Rhodes, Iowa, who is a spokesman for dissident pork producers, called the decision ''outrageous'' in an interview on Monday. ''Now it's government speech!'' he said. ''The court has changed horses in the middle of the stream.''
 The dissident pork producers had won a similar challenge to the pork checkoff before a different appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati. The government's appeal in that case, Johanns v. Campaign for Family Farms, No. 03-1180, is pending at the Supreme Court, which will almost certainly now vacate the appeals court's decision.
 Justice Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg concurred separately, saying that she viewed the assessments in all the marketing cases as ''permissible economic regulation.''
 The dissenters were Justices David H. Souter, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy. In an opinion by Justice Souter, they said the beef campaign amounted to little more than ''government deception by omission,'' because the advertisements gave the impression that they were the voluntary product of the cattle industry with no indication of government sponsorship.
 Noting that most of the advertisements say only ''funded by America's Beef Producers,'' Justice Souter said, ''If government relies on the government-speech doctrine to compel specific groups to fund speech with targeted taxes, it must make itself politically accountable by indicating that the content actually is a government message, not just the statement of one self-interested group the government is currently willing to invest with power.''
 These were among the court's other decisions on a busy Monday:

Property Rights
 In a unanimous opinion, the court clarified its private-property precedents and overturned an appeals court decision invalidating Hawaii's rent-control law for oil companies.
 With an opinion by Justice O'Connor, the court held that one of its own cases, a 25-year-old precedent, was ''regrettably imprecise'' in suggesting that courts were free to invalidate land-use regulations that did not ''substantially advance legitimate state interests.'' 
 That precedent, Agins v. City of Tiburon, caused confusion and was ''doctrinally untenable'' as a test for whether a regulation amounted to an unconstitutional ''taking'' of private property, Justice O'Connor said. The Hawaii case ''foreshadows the hazards of placing courts'' in the role of scrutinizing ''the efficacy of a vast array of state and federal regulations,'' she explained.
 The new decision, Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc., No. 04-163, marks a return to the Supreme Court's traditional inquiry, under which it seeks to identify regulations that are ''functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.'' 
 The rent-control regulation at issue did not come close to meeting that test because Chevron was still able to earn a reasonable return from the property it leased to service stations, Justice O'Connor said.

Primary Voting
 The court upheld Oklahoma's law on eligibility for voting in primary elections, under which a party may permit independent voters to participate, but not voters registered in other parties.
 The law was challenged successfully in the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit by the Libertarian Party of Oklahoma and by Republican and Democratic voters who wanted to vote in the Libertarian primary without registering as Libertarians. The appeals court held that the law placed an unconstitutional burden on the First Amendment right of freedom of association.
 But the burden was minimal and did not violate the Constitution, Justice Thomas wrote for himself and three other justices, Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Scalia and Kennedy. Justices O'Connor and Breyer concurred in the judgment, making the vote in the case, Clingman v. Beaver, No. 04-37, 6 to 3. The dissenters were Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Souter.

Prisoner Shackling
 The court ruled 7 to 2 that it is unconstitutional to use shackles to restrain a prisoner who has been convicted of capital murder and is facing a jury that will determine whether to issue a death sentence unless there is some special reason for the visible restraint.
 The court's precedents have forbidden the routine use of shackles during the guilt phase of a capital murder trial, based on an English common-law rule requiring prisoners to appear ''without irons, or any manner of shackles or bonds.'' In this case, Deck v. Missouri, No. 04-5293, the Supreme Court of Missouri refused to apply the rule to the trial of Carmen Deck, convicted of robbing and killing an elderly couple. During his sentencing hearing, Mr. Deck was shackled with leg irons, handcuffs and a belly chain. The jury sentenced him to death.
 In the majority opinion on Monday, Justice Breyer said shackling at any phase of a trial was inherently prejudicial and should not be done without ''adequate justification.'' Justice Breyer said, ''If there is an exceptional case where the record itself makes clear that there are indisputably good reasons for shackling, it is not this one.''
 Justice Thomas dissented in an opinion that Justice Scalia joined. He said the common-law rule should not be ''extended by rote to modern restraints,'' which were different ''in certain essential respects'' from old-fashioned irons. ''My legal obligation is not to determine the wisdom or the desirability of shackling defendants, but to decide a purely legal question,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Repeal of Alternative Tax Gains a Top G.O.P. Backer

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
A top Senate Republican challenged a crucial element of President Bush's budget and tax strategy on Monday, calling for a repeal of the alternative minimum tax at a cost of at least $611 billion over 10 years.
 Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has teamed with senior Democrats to introduce a bill that would repeal the tax and forgo hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue the tax is expected to generate.
 The Bush administration has promised to change the alternative minimum tax, a parallel income tax that was originally aimed at the richest taxpayers but is expected to increase taxes for tens of millions of families as early as 2006.
 But administration officials are still counting on a surge of tax revenue from the alternative tax -- about $95 billion a year in additional revenue by 2010 -- in their long-term plans to reduce the budget deficit. 
 Mr. Bush has ordered an advisory panel to come up with proposals for tax changes by July 31, but the panel has been told to pay for reductions in the alternative tax with increases in other areas.
 At a Senate Finance subcommittee hearing on Monday, Senator Grassley parted ways with the White House by saying that the administration should not count on the money.
 ''We're talking about an unintended tax which balloons federal revenue,'' he said. ''Is it appropriate to assume that the federal revenue windfall from the A.M.T. must be offset by other tax increases?'' 
 Mr. Grassley noted that it would cost $385 billion over the next 10 years just to continue the temporary fixes that Congress has passed in recent years to reduce the incidence of the alternative tax, and he implied that the government should give up at least that amount of tax revenue.
 Robert J. Carroll, the Treasury Department's deputy assistant secretary for tax policy, told the subcommittee that any reductions on the alternative tax should be ''revenue neutral.''
 Created in 1969, the alternative minimum tax is essentially a flat tax designed to prevent the wealthiest families from using tax breaks to avoid all or most of their income taxes. The tax is usually applied to income above $58,000 a year and disregards common tax deductions like those for dependent children and state and local taxes.
 It affects growing numbers of middle-class families for two main reasons. The first is that it is not indexed to inflation, so it affects more people as nominal incomes rise each year.
 The second reason is a result of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. The tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 lowered normal income taxes, but not the alternative tax. Because taxpayers have to pay whichever tax is higher -- the normal income tax or the alternative minimum -- the tax cuts greatly increased the number of cases in which the alternative tax is higher.
 Any effort to repeal the tax could generate a major political battle between Democratic-leaning states on the East and West Coasts, which tend to have higher taxes, and many Republican-leaning states that have lower incomes and lower taxes.
 About 3.8 million people had to pay the alternative tax in 2004, but administration and Congressional analysts predict the number will rise to 20 million in 2006 and 35 million in 2010.
 Mr. Grassley said he would introduce a bill this week to repeal the tax. The bill's co-sponsors are Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona; Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana; and Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon.
 Stanley Collender, a longtime budget analyst in Washington, predicted that the Bush administration would eventually relent on deficit reduction so that it could reduce the alternative tax.
 ''You're talking about $600 billion to $800 billion in increased taxes,'' Mr. Collender said. ''I can't believe this administration would ever agree to a tax increase like that.''
 Mr. Bush's problem is that he has already included those revenues in his budget plan, which calls for cutting the deficit in half by 2009. The deficit last year was $412 billion. Tax revenues are climbing more rapidly than expected, but military spending in Iraq is running higher and Mr. Bush has yet to budget money for that beyond this year.

HEADLINE: Fitch Cuts G.M. to Junk, Citing Poor S.U.V. Sales

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and JONATHAN FUERBRINGER; Danny Hakim reported from Detroit for this article and Jonathan Fuer-bringer from New York.

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 24 

 BODY:
Citing declining sales of larger sport utility vehicles, Fitch Ratings on Tuesday became the second of the three major debt ratings agencies to cut its rating on General Motors below investment grade. 
 The downgrade to junk status reflects Wall Street's increasingly dim view of G.M.'s prospects and will prevent many large bond investors from buying bonds from G.M., which has traditionally been one of the nation's largest bond issuers. More lenient rules soon to go into effect at Lehman Brothers, which maintains the most closely watched corporate bond index, require companies to maintain an investment-grade rating from two of the three credit agencies. Standard & Poor's downgraded G.M., as well as the Ford Motor Company, to junk on May 5. 
 Fitch cited a number of factors in the downgrade, from rising health care costs to the strength of competitors like Toyota. Fitch said it was also concerned that G.M. would no longer be able to pass cost cuts on to major suppliers like Delphi because they are facing their own, more severe financial woes. But the credit agency said the recent slump in larger S.U.V. sales, a bulwark of G.M.'s profitability until recently, was the biggest setback. 
 ''We've seen the continuing sharp declines in S.U.V. sales, particularly midsized and large vehicles,'' said Mark Oline, an analyst at Fitch. ''It really impacted the profitability expectations that we had for '05 and carrying into '06.'' 
 Fitch also said it expected that G.M., which lost $1.1 billion in the first quarter, could use up $6 billion in cash this year. The agency put G.M. on a negative outlook and said its new rating of BB+, the highest junk bond rating, could be lowered further this year, particularly if the economy faltered. 
 In a statement, G.M. said it was ''disappointed'' by the action. 
 ''Clearly G.M. has many challenges in North America but the company is moving aggressively,'' the company said, reiterating a four-point plan its spokesmen have laid out in recent weeks that involves a combination of cost cuts and building more competitive products. The company is also pressing the United Auto Workers union for cuts in health care benefits, which cost G.M. more than $5 billion annually, though union leaders have said major concessions will not come before the expiration of G.M.'s labor contract in 2007. 
 In the corporate bond market, the price of G.M. bonds fell only modestly after the news and were above recent lows. Several analysts said that they did not expect the fallout to be as serious as it was after the Standard & Poor's downgrade of G.M. and Ford.
 The effect of the downgrades on G.M.'s borrowing costs has been minimal because the company has largely abandoned the corporate bond market and is using other avenues to raise funds. 
 But the move by Fitch was significant because of recent rules changes by Lehman Brothers. Currently, Lehman's rules drop a company from its investment-grade corporate bond index if is cut to junk by either S.&P. or Moody's Investors Service. But as of July 1, dropping a company will require a downgrade to junk by at least two credit agencies, including Fitch. Before Fitch's action on Tuesday, G.M. would have been removed from the investment-grade index on June 1 and then returned on July 1 when the new rules took effect. Now, though, G.M. will be the biggest high-yield credit by far in the Lehman indexes. 
 S.&P.'s downgrade last month came earlier than many investors expected. Some hedge funds got caught betting the wrong way in transactions involving G.M. bonds and stock. In the derivatives market, credit default indexes that included G.M. and Ford responded more strongly than expected. 
 As a result, there were sudden fears that some hedge funds could face big losses that would then affect banks that provided financing for the hedge funds' bets. These fears, in turn, touched off a sell-off in the stock market and a rush of many investors to the safety of the Treasury market, which helped push down the yield on the 10-year note to its lowest level since February. 
 But on Tuesday, the markets appeared to have been ready for a second shoe to drop. 
 ''The first time you have a market blowup, the market tends to overreact,'' said John Tierney, head of credit derivatives research at Deutsche Bank. ''The second time around, people better understand the risk and have lightened up on their positions or have better hedges in place.''
 Still, the junk bond market has suffered. Since May 4, the day before the S.&P. downgrade, the Lehman U.S. Credit index, which covers investment-grade corporate bonds, had a return of 0.56 percent through Monday, even with G.M. and Ford still in the index. 
 But Lehman's high-yield index, even before G.M. and Ford have officially joined, had a loss of 0.26 percent.
 The price of the of the G.M. bond maturing in 2033 fell 1.4 percent on Tuesday to 73 cents on the dollar, with the yield rising to 11.7 percent. On May 5, the G.M. bond dropped 6 points, or 7.6 percent, to 73 cents on the dollar. Last Tuesday, the price fell to 69 cents.
 Tuesday's move by Fitch underscores that although both G.M. and Ford are seen as being in tough shape, many analysts appear to feel that Ford's outlook is somewhat brighter. 
 Fitch said last week that it was unlikely to cut Ford to junk anytime this year, and reiterated on Tuesday that it had a more positive view on Ford, in part because the company has fewer retirees than G.M. and has a product lineup more suited to the current market.
 Craig Hutson, an analyst at the independent debt rating firm Gimme Credit, said Fitch's assessment ''should suggest to G.M. and the union that there ought to be a sense of urgency here, if there hasn't been already.''

HEADLINE: Chief Urges World Bank to Pick Leader More Openly

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24 

 BODY:
James D. Wolfensohn, the departing World Bank president, said on Tuesday at his farewell news conference that the bank should change the way it selects its leader.
 Instead of allowing the United States alone to appoint a candidate, as has been the case throughout the history of the World Bank, Mr. Wolfensohn said the president of the bank, the world's largest development agency, should be selected from a range of candidates and in a transparent way. 
 ''I would personally wish that one could make those appointments on merit,'' Mr. Wolfensohn said.
 He said he would support a switch to the model of the World Trade Organization, which recently chose its new director general from four public candidates through the consensus of all its members.
 Mr. Wolfensohn, an American citizen, repeated his concern that the world's wealthiest nations, including the United States, have failed to make a ''quantum leap'' in the amount of aid given to the world's poorest countries. He has proposed an increase of $50 billion a year.
 ''It's a question of balance. Does it make sense to put all that money -- $500 billion each year -- into the military when you don't deal with the underlying causes of distress,'' he said, referring to the annual United States military budget.
 Paul D. Wolfowitz, the former deputy secretary of defense who is poised to take over as the World Bank president next week, will have a ''better chance than I do'' to persuade the Bush administration to make that leap, Mr. Wolfensohn said.
 At several points, Mr. Wolfensohn made it clear that he fully backed Mr. Wolfowitz as his successor, praising his motivation as well as his intellect and dismissing fears that he would impose an ideological standard on poor nations.
 ''Paul may prefer democracies based on his own beliefs -- so do I,'' Mr. Wolfensohn said. ''But I do not believe he would be making loans contingent on democracy because he was asked to do it by any government.''
 Mr. Wolfensohn said that during his decade as the president, the World Bank had shifted its focus to the effect of the programs on the people immersed in poverty rather than the statistics amassed about poverty alleviation. He said he was especially proud of transferring a third of his employees from the World Bank headquarters in Washington to the field. 
 He also challenged a recent internal study done by the bank that said he should have focused more on promoting economic growth rather than social policies as the route to reducing poverty.
 ''I don't think you can separate growth from social programs or development,'' he argued. ''I'd hate to have a strategy for growth in a country without education or health programs -- that's preposterous.''
 Among his greatest regrets, he said, was his failure to raise the profile of Africa or the money needed to help that continent.
 ''I tried to get more money, but the sheer truth is that the world, including the press, pays less attention to issues in Africa than elsewhere,'' he said. ''We're all to blame.''
 Mr. Wolfensohn's last day is Tuesday. He will become a special coordinator to help the Palestinian Authority run Gaza once the Israelis start leaving this summer.

HEADLINE: Columbia's President, an Expert On Free Speech, Gets an Earful

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON and N. R. KLEINFIELD

 BODY:
Toward dusk of a dim day, the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University was dotted with chattering students in various states of decompression. White tents were rising on the groomed lawns for the commencement exercises, that ritual of release and beckoning promise. 
 Striding down the empty and echoing hallway of Low Library, Lee C. Bollinger, the university's president, said of his workaday routines: ''This is how it is. You walk down the hallways, and people applaud.''
 He came upon a solitary woman waiting to guide arrivals for a cocktail reception. She beamed at him. 
 ''See,'' he said, ''not everyone hates me.''
 It was his wry way of addressing a divisive undercurrent that has pierced the university and raised doubts about his own promise. Three years into the job as the university's 19th president, Mr. Bollinger has taken a beating during a brutal academic year that included a cantankerous eruption in the Middle East studies department that consumed the campus. 
 Pro-Israel Jewish students complained that they were intimidated by pro-Palestinian professors, sentiments elaborated on in a short film financed by a pro-Israel group outside the university, and these narrow grievances were transformed into a bitter showdown over academic freedom and student rights. 
 Over the course of it, Mr. Bollinger has lost much of the dazzle he arrived with, and has been roundly criticized as detached, overly deliberative and inept at communicating his governing ideology. 
 In one of many telling moments, Ann Douglas, an English professor, described a recent book party attended by many faculty members, where ''everyone was saying disparaging things about Bollinger and no one was rising to his defense.'' 
 For his part, the soft-spoken Mr. Bollinger insists that the disapproval is not that extensive, or worrisome. ''I'm just not troubled by the level of disagreement and debate,'' he said recently, during an interview in his expansive office on the second floor of Low Library, adorned with bright geometric paintings by Josef Albers. ''It's debate and it's healthy.'' 
 But he acknowledged the need for certain adjustments. ''Do I need to build more and better relationships with the university, and deeper ones?'' he asked. ''No question about it. I've already reached the conclusion that I want to spend more time inside the institution. That's a balance that will shift.'' 
 Mr. Bollinger has his admirers. Eric R. Kandel, a university professor and winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine, described him as a visionary. David Stern, the National Basketball Association commissioner, who is the head of Columbia's board, said he was quite pleased with Mr. Bollinger's performance, and several other trustees concurred. ''I told him, there's nothing that he's experienced before that will be like this,'' Mr. Stern said. ''I think, after three years on the job, he's willing to concede the point.''
 It is generally felt that animosity toward Mr. Bollinger would be more subdued were it not for the snowballing disputes that began with the charges by the pro-Israel students against the pro-Palestinian professors. Many at Columbia seemed piqued at what they felt was Mr. Bollinger's tardy and timid handling of the issue, which contributed to its becoming a protracted matter that saturated the university with sour publicity.
 Even after an internal investigative committee ruled on the claims, finding a single credible incident of inappropriate professorial behavior, and after new procedures were developed to handle student complaints, distaste persisted. The whole matter has by no means subsided. 
 Mr. Bollinger, 58, a lean man who runs four or five miles most days (''At my age,'' he said, ''every day I do it is a victory''), professed few misgivings about how he addressed the Middle East studies eruption.
 ''I tried to walk a very, very fine line,'' he said. ''I have a problem because I like to see complexity.''
 ''It would be nice if I was smarter, and in 48 hours could have grasped everything,'' added Mr. Bollinger, who was a clerk for Warren E. Burger, the chief justice of the United States. ''But I'm not. And I still don't grasp everything."
 Mr. Bollinger, who is paid $611,000 a year (and also receives housing and other perquisites) has embraced a grand -- detractors say mushy and overreaching -- vision. His ambition is for Columbia to be considered one of the three best universities in the country, on a level with the likes of Harvard and Yale, schools that are far richer and consistently ranked as better. 
 Such a transformation, Mr. Bollinger argues, depends on Columbia's expansion beyond its cramped 34-acre campus into 18 acres in Harlem. It is a combustible undertaking, for land in Manhattan is akin to birthright, never yielded without strident fanfare. Previous presidents have added space piecemeal, each time tackling the politically fraught bargaining with the adjacent community anew. Mr. Bollinger wants to assure the university's future in one bold swoop. 
 ''I started with space because it unlocks not only the physical constraints but also the imaginative constraints,'' Mr. Bollinger said.
 But the obstacles are immense. More than 50 faculty members recently sent a letter to Mr. Bollinger complaining that the expansion plan would have an adverse and unacceptable impact on Harlem.
 The Columbia Spectator, the campus newspaper, recently published an editorial skewering the Bollinger administration for what it characterized as dishonest dealings in its quest to acquire that land, as well as in addressing graduate students seeking to unionize. ''In the not-too-distant future, Columbia might become the next Enron,'' the editorial charged. Mr. Bollinger, knowing where to pick his battles, would say only, ''I think The Spectator is terrific.''
 Some of the ill will toward Mr. Bollinger is undoubtedly a result of his reputation as a president who is too often away from campus.
 Although he teaches a popular course on freedom of speech and the press to about 130 students each year, many professors say they have not truly gotten to know him, and some depict him, not positively, as a hologram. One dean said he was embarrassed to admit how little contact he had had with Mr. Bollinger in his three years. How much? ''Zero,'' he said. 
 In interactions, Mr. Bollinger is gracious, but also often matter-of-fact and fixated. Meeting with student leaders one morning, he spent virtually no time on personal greetings but swept into the issues at hand.
 When he arrived at Columbia in the summer of 2002 after serving as president of the University of Michigan, Mr. Bollinger was known as a First Amendment scholar and a proponent of affirmative action. He had a buzz about him for being a finalist for the Harvard presidency, a job that went to Lawrence H. Summers. 
 Among his early actions, Mr. Bollinger shut down several costly enterprises, like Columbia's management of the Biosphere 2 ecology project in Arizona and its sponsorship of Fathom, an online learning business, and he has centralized some facets of the university, to economize. He has orchestrated change in the heralded journalism school and the athletic program. He has deployed a new administrative team that has itself had a mixed reception. Mr. Bollinger also itches to transform the university into a place that transcends pure theory and where scholars fight against poverty, AIDS and other world ills.
 ''We are now at a new period where universities are re-entering the world,'' he said. ''If we don't understand issues like poverty, modern communications and how the world looks from Nairobi or Bombay, we will not serve the world.''
 But not everyone gets the relevance of what he is talking about. Some see him as misguided, especially when there are pressing day-to-day concerns. The science faculty is miffed that a long-promised new building never seems to be built. Students in the arts ask why Columbia has done things like spend $1.7 million to bring the theater director Peter Brook and his troupe to campus for a month rather than invest the money in their own work. 
 There have been continuing financial problems at the medical school. Graduate students want to unionize. For more than a year, PETA, the animal-rights group, has been tailing Mr. Bollinger around the world to disrupt his appearances over what it feels is cruel treatment of primates in Columbia's research labs. 
 And faculty detractors say that new grievance procedures prompted by the Middle East studies agitation could have chilling reverberations. ''As I talk to faculty,'' said Walter M. Frisch, chairman of the executive committee of the faculty of arts and sciences, ''people say, 'Maybe I shouldn't have made that joke in the classroom. Will someone take it the wrong way?''' 
 Some people think his goals are important and noble, Professor Frisch said, ''but other people think there are other needs, like salaries, quality of life and classroom space, that are not being addressed while we are working on paradise up north.''
 Much of Mr. Bollinger's time has been devoted to pursuing alumni, a neglected body that could help pay for future projects. In the first nine months of the university's fiscal year, donations rose 27 percent over the same period in the previous year. 
 One thing that is clear is that the Bollinger vision cannot happen without a powerful infusion of money. As of last June, Columbia's endowment stood at less than $5 billion, compared with roughly $22 billion at Harvard and $13 billion at Yale. 
 He has replaced the head of development and increased the alumni and development staff by more than a third. Things like getting Columbia named in people's wills has taken on higher priority. Mr. Bollinger intends to start a capital drive soon with a hoped-for goal of $4 billion to $5 billion over seven or eight years. He has made more than nine major foreign trips since taking office -- to China; India; Japan; Eastern and Western Europe; and several underdeveloped countries like Mozambique, Kenya and Ghana, trips he considers part of his ''education.'' 
 In addition, Mr. Bollinger has told people that his lack of visibility on campus was partly a consequence of housing disruptions, an experience he has described as one of the most miserable times of his life. He has lived in several interim quarters while the president's house was undergoing a $23 million renovation. He moved into the official residence only in February of last year. 
 Now that the house is finished, Mr. Bollinger has begun holding receptions there. One recent day, local clergy members joined him for breakfast, and he entertained members of a black students' organization in the evening.
 Time, of course, can be redemptive for a university president, and infusions of money even more so. If, decades from now, Columbia looms larger in both space and esteem, Mr. Bollinger could be retrospectively regarded as a singular president, all else forgiven. ''The thing we're going to judge him on is the money and the real estate,'' said Bruce Berne, the chairman of the chemistry department.

HEADLINE: Debate on Immigration Also Involves Ecuador's Top Sport

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: DANBURY, Conn., May 24 

 BODY:
The march on June 12 will be a straight shot down Main Street and will double as a kind of walking tour of the tension here.
 It will begin at Kennedy Park, where the crowds of Hispanic men who gather before dawn to find work as day laborers helped prompt Mayor Mark D. Boughton to ask that the state police be deputized to enforce federal immigration laws.
 Then it will move past the storefronts that a decade ago were vacant and are now filled with Brazilian bakeries, Ecuadorean restaurants, immigrant-owned clothing shops and a sense of determined striving.
 And finally, exactly a mile from where it starts, the march will end at Rogers Park, where young Ecuadorean men play volleyball on crowded courts most evenings, sweating in work clothes beside uniformed children playing baseball. 
 The mayor has proposed adding more courts, a peace offering march organizers say is welcome but insufficient. 
 ''We are asking him for an apology, not only to new immigrants but to all Danburians,'' said Wilson Hernandez, a naturalized citizen who owns a downtown restaurant, La Mitad Del Mundo, and is the leader of the march organizers. ''We are asking for respect for our contribution to this town.''
 While leaders in some small cities across the country have won political support by taking steps against soaring populations of illegal immigrants, in Danbury some critics say Mr. Boughton, a Republican, has gone too far. Now the latest immigrants in this eternally working-class city are pressing for political respect. And the mayor, while not necessarily in retreat, is trying to repair his links to immigrant groups by meeting with church leaders and march organizers. 
 ''I don't think you're going to hear me saying I'm sorry,'' the mayor said in an interview at City Hall recently. ''I think you're going to hear me say the laws of the United States of America should be enforced.''
 On April 15, Mr. Boughton asked the state to deputize state police officers, a move considered in other suburban cities with high immigration. The mayor has said that as many as 15,000 of the city's immigrants are illegal, a figure immigrant leaders say is drastically overstated. He has also moved to restrict overcrowded apartments and tighten controls on large backyard volleyball games organized by Ecuadoreans, for whom volleyball is a national passion. City officials say the games grow into raucous parties with gambling, prostitution, drugs and alcohol sales and disrupt once-quiet neighborhoods.
 Immigrants also complained after a group called Connecticut Citizens for Immigration Control, which has links to the Minuteman Project, a volunteer patrol along the Mexican border, held a meeting in Danbury attended by some city officials, though not by the mayor. 
 Now, while members of Danbury's Common Council continue to draft a ''repetitive outdoor activity'' ordinance to restrict volleyball by cracking down on parking and noise, among other things, the mayor says deputizing the state police may not be necessary, that the police may have enough remedies without becoming immigration agents.
 ''I don't think I'm backing away at all,'' Mr. Boughton said. ''I'm recognizing that communication is crucial to this whole process.''
 A former state lawmaker and high school social studies teacher, Mr. Boughton said his attempts to confront immigration problems were driven by stressed city services and constant complaints from residents. 
 Echoing officials in other towns, he said, ''These actions should not be personalized by individuals because I'm talking about a failed federal public policy.''
 His critics say that by emphasizing a few extreme situations, he risks painting all immigrants as criminals instead of as crucial players in the city's revitalization. And so they plan to hold what many people say may be the city's first march organized in defense of immigrants. 
 ''We'll be wearing white shirts, with no insults to anybody,'' Mr. Hernandez said. ''We've always said if we march we'll march silently, peacefully.'' 
 Immigration has defined Danbury for two centuries, with the Irish, Italians and Portuguese once coming to work in the city's famous hat factories. Now the newcomers are Brazilians and Ecuadoreans, who often labor in landscaping, construction and other trades in the wealthy suburbs of Fairfield County. They come home at night to downtown Danbury, a struggling city surrounded by a suburban building boom.
 About 12,000 of the city's 75,000 residents are Hispanic, according to the 2000 Census. Yet both the mayor and immigrant leaders say the number of Ecuadoreans has increased significantly since the census, growth driven by economic struggle in Ecuador and an established pipeline into the New York region. Some say the march will announce the political arrival of the newer immigrants. No Brazilians or Hispanics are among the 17 Republicans and 4 Democrats on the Common Council. Yet concern over how the march will come off -- even whether it will occur at all -- has become an issue in itself. 
 Mr. Hernandez said at least 500 people were expected to march, and perhaps many more. He said illegal immigrants who feared being arrested might not participate. ''Somebody has to represent these people,'' he said. ''We want the mayor to represent them, too.'' Mr. Hernandez said that he and other immigrant leaders continued to meet with the mayor. ''I'm supportive of many of their concerns and issues,'' Mr. Boughton said on Tuesday. 
 Gov. M. Jodi Rell, a Republican, has asked the state commissioner of public safety, Leonard C. Boyle, to discuss Mr. Boughton's request with federal officials, but Mrs. Rell said Tuesday that the state should not rush into deputizing state officers. 
 Speaking to reporters after addressing the Greater Danbury Chamber of Commerce, the governor said Mr. Boughton was struggling with demands new immigrants had put on his local budget and had ''done a great job of easing tensions and trying to bring people together to say, 'You know this is not us against you. We want people to feel welcome in our city, but we also want people to be legally here.'''
 Both sides in the Danbury debate have a point, said Oscar Chacon, director of Enlaces America, a Chicago-based group that helps link emerging immigrant advocate groups across the country.
 ''The reality is we do a very poor job as a society when it comes to how to handle changing demographics,'' he said. ''We don't have a policy at the federal level that is helping local communities manage change.''
 At least one immigrant plans to become a candidate for the Common Council elections this fall. Rina F. Machado, 40, a mortgage broker who came from Brazil two decades ago, said he planned to run as a Democrat. ''We've got to have someone who will look out for the community, the immigrant community,'' he said. 
 Asked how he defined that community, in a town filled with generations of newcomers from all over the world, he said, ''People with accents.''

HEADLINE: Notes Show Fed Deciding to Brush Aside Signs of Slower Growth

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24 

 BODY:
Policy makers at the Federal Reserve brushed aside evidence of an economic slowdown early this month and made it clear that they wanted to keep raising interest rates in the months ahead.
 Notes from their meeting on May 3, released on Tuesday, suggested that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise rates several more times this year, even if higher oil prices take a toll on growth.
 The notes also suggested considerable uncertainty and perhaps disagreement among Fed officials about the direction of the economy, causing some analysts to warn that the Fed's strategy of ''measured'' rate increases was murkier than it appeared.
 Participants in the Fed meeting were confronted with a barrage of statistics that suggested slowing growth, but the participants indicated that they felt that any slowdown would be transitory and that they should ''should not overreact to a comparatively small number of disappointing indicators.'' 
 In hindsight, the decision turns out to have been prescient. In the weeks since the meeting, new data has indicated that job creation, consumer spending and exports have been stronger than originally thought.
 Indeed, Wall Street economists have been raising their estimates of growth for the first half of the year. On Thursday, the Commerce Department is expected to revise its estimate of growth in the first three months to 3.5 percent or higher, from 3.1 percent.
 New data on Tuesday showed that the frenzy in the housing market was more fierce than ever.
 The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes hit a record annual rate of 7.18 million in April and that the national median price for an existing home was 15.1 percent higher than a year earlier.
 To the bewilderment of many Fed officials, the robust housing activity is being fed by rates on 30-year mortgages that have fallen even as the Fed has raised short-term interest rates eight times since last June.
 At the time of their meeting, Fed officials were wrestling with evidence of slowing growth and faster inflation. The minutes suggested that they were more anxious about rising prices but divided among themselves about how serious the dangers might be.
 What seemed to unite all the players was a sense that short-term interest rates were still too far below normal and would eventually fuel inflation.
 ''The key message is that short-term softness will not stop rate hikes,'' Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note on Tuesday. 
 Fed officials were particularly fixated on higher oil prices, noting that they were feeding into higher prices for other goods and services and that businesses were having an easier time passing cost increases on to their customers.
 According to the notes, which are sanitized summaries of the discussions, Fed officials were still reasonably confident that consumer prices would climb more slowly and that inflation expectations would remain low.
 But the minutes also hint at disagreement about the underlying trends. Some Fed officials suggested that the Fed declare that the risks of inflation were ''skewed to the upside,'' but they ultimately decided to say the risks remained ''balanced.''
 Fed officials seemed openly muddled about the message they wanted to convey. In March, the central bank hedged its prediction of stable prices and growth by saying that it was dependent on ''appropriate monetary policy.''
 In the May meeting, some officials complained that the prediction had been drained of any meaning -- a criticism many private economists have made. Despite the complaint, the Fed kept the statement.
 ''This piling on of arguments and counterarguments is a sign that there's really a debate about what's going on,'' said Ethan Harris, an economist at Lehman Brothers. 
 The Fed's uncertainty is apparent in other ways though it still says it expects to raise rates at a measured pace. That has been interpreted as increasing the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by a quarter percentage point at each meeting.
 But Fed officials have broadened the definition of measured, saying it is dependent on economic developments and ''would not stand in the way of either a pause or a step-up'' in rate increases.
 Mr. Harris said Fed officials might be genuinely baffled by contradictory evidence: energy prices and commodity prices were higher and productivity growth was slower, but employment costs were barely keeping up with inflation.
 Since the Fed's meeting, the inflation picture has brightened. The Labor Department reported last week that core inflation, which excludes prices for energy and food, had all but stopped in April. That was good news, but it may have heightened the confusion.

HEADLINE: C.E.O.'s, M.I.A.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
After six weeks of being a foreign correspondent traveling around America, the biggest question I have come home with is not ''What's the matter with Kansas?'' but rather, ''What's the matter with big business?'' 
 America faces a huge set of challenges if it is going to retain its competitive edge. As a nation, we have a mounting education deficit, energy deficit, budget deficit, health care deficit and ambition deficit. The administration is in denial on this, and Congress is off on Mars. And yet, when I look around for the group that has both the power and interest in seeing America remain globally focused and competitive -- America's business leaders -- they seem to be missing in action. I am not worried about the rise of the cultural conservatives. I am worried about the disappearance of an internationalist, pro-American business elite. 
 Is there any company in America that should be more involved in lobbying for some form of national health coverage than General Motors, which is being strangled by its health care costs? Is there any group of companies that should have been picketing the White House more than our high-tech firms, after the Bush team cut the National Science Foundation budget by $100 million in 2005 and in 2006 has proposed shrinking the Department of Energy science programs and basic and applied research in the Department of Defense -- key sources of innovation? 
 Is there any constituency that should be clamoring for a sane energy policy more than U.S. industry? Is there any group that should be mobilizing voters to lobby Congress to pass the Caribbean Free Trade Agreement and complete the Doha round more than U.S. multinationals? Should anyone be more concerned about the fiscally reckless deficits we are leaving our children than Wall Street? 
 Yet, with a few admirable exceptions, American business has not gotten out front on these issues. In part, this is because boardrooms tend to be culturally Republican -- both uncomfortable and a little afraid to challenge this administration. In part, this is because of the post-Enron keep-your-head-down effect. And in part, this is because in today's flatter world, many key U.S. companies now make most of their profits abroad and can increasingly recruit the best talent in the world today without ever hiring another American.
 So with business with its head in the clouds, labor with its head in the sand, the administration focused on terrorism and Congress catering to people who think ''intelligent design'' is something done by God and not by Intel, it's not surprising that ''we don't have a strategy for making America competitive in the 21st century -- a century of three billion new capitalists,'' as Clyde Prestowitz put it. He is the author of a smart new book about the rise of China and India, called, appropriately, ''Three Billion New Capitalists.'' 
 If we don't get our act together, this will affect not just our economy, but also our power. America has just completed the most sweeping transformation of its national security establishment since 1947. ''Unfortunately, the entire restructuring has been oriented toward combating one threat -- terrorism,'' said David Rothkopf, a Carnegie Endowment scholar who has just published a timely and important new book, ''Running the World,'' about the U.S. National Security Council.
 ''This is dramatically different from what was done in the wake of World War II, when, in addition to creating the N.S.C., Department of Defense, Air Force and C.I.A., we also created the U.N., I.M.F., World Bank, conducted the Marshall Plan, rebuilt Japan and recognized that domestic growth was the most important wellspring of our national security.''
 That domestic strength made us both feared and attractive. Remember: America won the cold war not just with containment, but, even more important, with attraction -- attraction for the society we were building. 
 ''Undercutting that attraction with fiscal irresponsibility, inattentiveness to the engines of competitiveness on which future jobs will depend, cavalier treatment of the values that make the American way of life more appealing, closing our borders to the world -- and thus both losing our edge and our understanding of that world -- or focusing exclusively on enemies or the failings of the international community,'' added Mr. Rothkopf, ''is both self-defeating and runs counter to every lesson of how we won the cold war.'' 
 But who will tell the people? If not the situation room, it better be the boardroom -- otherwise the costs to our country will exceed anything that can measured on a balance sheet.

HEADLINE: Real Estate Trusts Add the World to Portfolios

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
With real estate investment trusts cooling off in the United States after five straight years of vigorous returns, some investors are shifting their attention to the nascent markets overseas.
 More than a dozen countries offer REIT's or REIT-like structures, which are publicly traded companies with portfolios of commercial property that distribute most of their income to shareholders. Several governments, too, are considering legislation to create them. Market watchers see growing opportunities outside the United States, where in some regions commercial real estate has been showing signs of overheating. 
 ''The fundamentals are different,'' said Scott Crowe, global real estate strategist for UBS in London. ''In Asia, after years of deflation and recession, these markets are now improving. And generally speaking, world interest rate pressures are very modest compared to the United States, where rates have been rising; it's probably the most benign in Europe.'' 
 International REIT's may also offer better value right now. Buyers of domestic REIT stocks can expect to pay a 5 to 10 percent premium to the underlying property value, Mr. Crowe said, while many foreign stocks trade at par or, in some cases, at a discount. International REIT yields are comparable to those in the United States -- roughly 4.5 percent worldwide, he said. 
 The price gap largely reflects past performance: American REIT's returned 20 percent, annualized, over the five years that ended March 31, as measured by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts composite index. The index, however, was down around 7.5 percent in the first quarter.
 Many money managers still remain bullish on the domestic market, attributing this year's about-face to a much-needed correction and dismissing speculation that commercial real estate is headed for bubble territory. But at the same time, they like the diversity that global REIT's afford, along with their ''low correlation'' with most other financial securities -- in other words, their tendency not to move in tandem.
 ''If you're interested in Germany, you can buy stock in Deutsche Bank or DaimlerChrysler, but if you really want to invest in the economy, you do it through real estate,'' said Martin Cohen, co-chairman and co-chief executive of Cohen & Steers, which specializes in REIT funds like Cohen & Steers International Realty. ''You also diversify your currency risks.''
 Germany is expected to create REIT's sometime next year, and so is Britain. Italy is also considering them. Since 2001, Japan, France, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea have enacted REIT legislation.
 Most global versions are modeled after the American REIT, which has been around for four decades but did not really take off until the early 1990's. In exchange for paying no tax on corporate income, real estate investment trusts are required to disburse a large percentage of what they earn in the form of dividends.
 The American market remains by far the largest, with at least half of all REIT's, but real estate analysts expect to see more public ownership of property management companies abroad as foreign companies push for more favorable tax treatment. Worldwide real estate equities, including REIT's, Mr. Crowe said, now total around $600 billion, nearly twice as much as six years ago.
 Samuel A. Lieber, manager of the Alpine International Real Estate Fund, which has been around since 1989, said he expected to double his foreign REIT holdings to around 30 percent in the next 18 months as more stocks hit the market. ''The market is really growing,'' he said.
 Among Mr. Lieber's favorites these days are the French companies Gecina, which develops high-end office and apartment buildings in Paris, and Unibail, which builds shopping centers. The Fortune Real Estate Investment Trust, which is traded in Singapore, also makes his list. The company owns five shopping malls in Hong Kong.
 Mr. Crowe also sees building opportunities in Paris and other European cities, where demand for office and retail space is outstripping supply, thanks partly to government restrictions on development. 
 Mr. Cohen said commercial real estate companies could still find opportunities within city limits. ''While there's not a lot of growth in Europe, it is likely that property will be changing hands, and usage,'' he said. ''There's also a lot of buildings that are centuries old and infrastructure that is centuries old.'' 
 Real estate analysts also see improvement ahead in many economies in Asia, including those of Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, and in Australia. Mr. Crowe noted that in Tokyo, in particular, real estate prices have stabilized, and office supply and vacancy rates are falling. Mr. Cohen added that ''there's infrastructure that needs to be created'' in many Asian cities, too. 
 So far, most of the interest in foreign REIT's has come from large institutional investors, money managers say, but even investors with more modest means can gain a foothold in income-producing real estate abroad. The growth of real estate stocks overseas has spawned new mutual funds. The ING Global Real Estate Fund opened in 2001 and the Fidelity International Real Estate Fund last September. Cohen & Steers introduced both closed- and open-end global real estate funds this year. 
 Average investors can also buy American REIT's that are expanding overseas. Jonathan Litt, a real estate analyst with the Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, says he recommends ProLogis of Aurora, Colo., one of the largest developers of warehouses in Europe; the AMB Property Corporation of San Francisco, which owns distribution centers in Europe, Japan and Mexico; and Shurgard Storage Centers of Seattle, ensconced in Western Europe.
 ''We're bringing our expertise over there,'' he said, but ''you also have to remember that you're buying a very local market.''

HEADLINE: Iran and Europeans Jockey for Meeting on Nuclear Issue Today

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PARIS, May 24 

 BODY:
Iran and its European negotiating partners struggled in preliminary talks on Tuesday to salvage their nuclear agreement after threats by Iran to resume activities banned by the accord.
 Iranian negotiators met with senior Foreign Ministry officials of Britain, France and Germany and a senior European Union official to lay the groundwork for a crucial high-level meeting in Geneva on Wednesday.
 That meeting will bring together Hassan Rowhani, the cleric who is Iran's senior nuclear negotiator, on one side and the foreign ministers of the three European countries along with Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief. 
 In the talks on Tuesday, the Europeans reiterated their warning to Iran in a letter this month that they would end their two years of negotiations and begin punitive action if Iran resumed nuclear activities frozen under the November 2004 accord, a European official said.
 European officials said the short-term goal was to keep talking. They hope to persuade Mr. Rowhani, head of Iran's influential Supreme National Security Council, to preserve the current freeze on Iran's uranium conversion and enrichment activities until after Iran's presidential elections, which are scheduled for June 17. Iran has maintained that such activities are for electricity generation only, while the United States maintains that Iran is working secretly to produce nuclear weapons.
 The Europeans are gambling that with a new Iranian president could come a more flexible approach to the thorny nuclear issue.
 The Iranian side wants a concrete gesture by the Europeans to justify continuing the negotiations, which are aimed at eventually reaching a long-term agreement on nuclear, economic and security cooperation between Iran and Europe. 
 Both sides on Tuesday emphasized that the negotiations were at a crucial point and refused to predict the outcome of the meeting on Wednesday.
 ''We need to see tangible progress rather than just talking,'' Javad Zarif, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations and a leading negotiator, said in a telephone interview from Brussels after the meeting. ''We need a formula that will allow each side to address its concerns.''
 He added: ''We have made some progress in the past, and it is not inconceivable that we will make progress tomorrow. Nothing is guaranteed.''
 Hossein Mousavian, one of the Iranian negotiators and a member of the Supreme National Security Council, told reporters in Brussels: ''Our chance for success in tomorrow's meeting is 50-50. I think these talks were more difficult and complicated than ever.''
 In Tehran, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hamid Reza Asefi, suggested that Iran would break off the talks if the Europeans did not produce an adequate incentive.
 ''Tomorrow's session could bring an end to the extensive talks we have had with the Europeans if they don't have a clear proposal,'' Mr. Asefi told the state-controlled radio. ''Or they can be a turning point in relations and cooperation between Iran and Europe.''

HEADLINE: China, New Land of Shoppers, Builds Malls on Gigantic Scale

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: DONGGUAN, China 

 BODY:
After construction workers finish plastering a replica of the Arc de Triomphe and buffing the imitation streets of Hollywood, Paris and Amsterdam, a giant new shopping theme park here will proclaim itself the world's largest shopping mall.
 The South China Mall -- a jumble of Disneyland and Las Vegas, a shoppers' version of paradise and hell all wrapped in one -- will be nearly three times the size of the massive Mall of America in Minnesota. It is part of yet another astonishing new consequence of the quarter-century economic boom here: the great malls of China.
 Not long ago, shopping in China consisted mostly of lining up to entreat surly clerks to accept cash in exchange for ugly merchandise that did not fit. But now, Chinese have started to embrace America's modern ''shop till you drop'' ethos and are in the midst of a buy-at-the-mall frenzy. 
 Already, four shopping malls in China are larger than the Mall of America. Two, including the South China Mall, are bigger than the West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, which just surrendered its status as the world's largest to an enormous retail center in Beijing. And by 2010, China is expected to be home to at least 7 of the world's 10 largest malls.
 Chinese are swarming into malls, which usually have many levels that rise up rather than out in the sprawling two-level style typical in much of the United States. Chinese consumers arrive by bus and train, and growing numbers are driving there. On busy days, one mall in the southern city of Guangzhou attracts about 600,000 shoppers.
 For years, the Chinese missed out on the fruits of their labor, stitching shoes, purses or dresses that were exported around the world. Now, China's growing consumerism means that its people may be a step or two closer to buying the billion Cokes, Revlon lipsticks, Kodak cameras and the like that foreign companies have long dreamed they could sell. 
 ''Forget the idea that consumers in China don't have enough money to spend,'' said David Hand, a real estate and retailing expert at Jones Lang LaSalle in Beijing. ''There are people with a lot of money here. And that's driving the development of these shopping malls.''
 For sale are a wide range of consumer favorites -- cellphones, DVD players, jeans, sofas and closets to assemble yourself. There is food from many regions of China and franchises with familiar names -- KFC, McDonald's and IMAX theaters. Stores without Western pedigree sell Gucci and Louis Vuitton goods. While peasants and poor workers may only window-shop, they have joined a regular pilgrimage to the mall that has set builders and developers afire. The developers are spending billions of dollars to create these supersize shopping centers in the country's fastest-growing cities -- betting that a nation of savers is on the verge of also becoming a nation of tireless shoppers. 
 For the moment, the world's biggest mall is the six-million-square-foot Golden Resources Mall, which opened last October in northwestern Beijing. It has already sparked envy and competitive ambition among the world's big mall builders, who outwardly scoff at the Chinese ascent to mall-dom, even as they plot their own path to build on such scale in China.
 How big is six million square feet? That mall, which is expected to cost $1.3 billion when completed, spans the length of six football fields and easily exceeds the floor space of the Pentagon, which at 3.7 million square feet is the world's largest office building. It is a single, colossal five-story building -- with rows and rows of shops stacked on top of more rows and rows of shops -- so large that it is hard to navigate among the 1,000 stores and the thousands of shoppers. 
 The shopping-mall building spree, like much economic activity in China these days, is so aggressive that some economists and officials have started to worry that it may be another sign of an overheated economy, and that the country's building frenzy may be lurching toward a fall. 
 So far, though, there is no end in sight -- and no evidence that China's long boom is likely to suffer anything more than a modest slowdown. 
 ''These shopping centers are just huge,'' said Radha Chadha, who runs Chadha Strategy Consulting in Hong Kong, which tracks shopping malls and the sales of luxury goods in Asia. ''China likes to do things big. They like to make an impact.''
 Retail sales in China have jumped nearly 50 percent in the last four years, as measured by the nation's biggest retailers, government data says. And with rising incomes, Chinese are spending their money on shoes, bags, clothing and even theme-park-style rides. 
 ''We like this place a lot,'' said Ruth Tong, 27, an early visitor to the South China Mall here in Dongguan with her husband and 5-year-old son. ''They have a lot of fun things to do. They have shopping and even rides. So we like it and yes, we'll come back again.''
 The central government recently ordered state-controlled banks to tighten lending to huge shopping mall projects. But that has not yet tempered the plans of aggressive developers and local government officials for transforming vast tracts of land into huge shopping centers.
 After all, the demand is certainly growing. Income per person in China has reached the equivalent of about $1,100 a year, up 50 percent since 2000. 
 China is still a land of disparity, though it has a growing middle class that has swelled to as many as 70 million. 
 And as the country rapidly urbanizes and modernizes, open-air food markets and old department stores are being replaced by giant supermarkets and big-box retailers.
 Ikea and Carrefour, the French supermarket chain, are mobbed with customers. And China's increasingly affluent young people are adopting the American teenager's habit of hanging out at the mall.
 Big enclosed shopping malls, which came of age in America in the late 1970's and Europe in the late 80's, are sprouting up all over China. According to retail analysts, more than 400 large malls have been built in China in the last six years.
 And at a time when the biggest malls under construction in the United States measure about a million square feet, developers here are creating malls that are six, seven and eight million square feet.
 The current titleholder, the Golden Resources Mall, where 20,000 employees work, is the creation of Huang Rulun, an entrepreneur who made a fortune selling real estate in coastal Fujian Province. Six years ago, Mr. Huang acquired a 440-acre tract of land outside Beijing to create a virtual satellite city, which will soon have 110 new apartment buildings, along with schools and offices planted like potted trees around his neon-lighted mall.
 Perhaps the most aggressive mall building is taking place in Guangdong Province in the south, the seat of China's flourishing Pearl River Delta region. In January, more than 400,000 people showed up in the principal city, Guangzhou, for the opening of the Grandview Mall, which also calls itself the world's largest mall, with three million square feet. It even says it has the tallest indoor fountain.
 Exactly who has the world's largest shopping mall appears to be in dispute. Some Chinese malls claim the largest floor size; others count leased space. Still others say that what counts is that there is only one roof. 
 Indeed, the Triple Five Group, which owns the Mall of America (2.5 million square feet of leased shopping space) and the West Edmonton Mall in Canada (3.2 million square feet), has not conceded defeat.
 ''They are just shops, like a bazaar in the Middle East,'' Nader Ghermezian, one of the company's principals, said dismissively -- and mistakenly -- about the Golden Resources Mall, which is under one roof. ''They shouldn't be considered. We are still the largest in the world.''
 But that raises another question: Are the malls in this country too big? 
 ''It's not so easy to shop at these locations,'' Mr. Hand of Jones Lang LaSalle said. ''Most shopping centers survive on repeat customers. To go to a shopping mall so big and so congested, it may be difficult to have repeat customers.'' 
 The developers beg to differ.
 ''Shopping malls are a new concept in China, and we are trying to find our own way to do it,'' said Cai Xunshan, vice president of the Golden Resources Mall. ''We don't think we can just copy the format from the U.S.''
 In Dongguan, the developers of the South China Mall say they traveled around the world for two years in search of the right model. The result is a $400 million fantasy land: 150 acres of palm-tree-lined shopping plazas, theme parks, hotels, water fountains, pyramids, bridges and giant windmills. Trying to exceed even some of the over-the-top casino extravaganzas in Las Vegas, it has a 1.3-mile artificial river circling the complex, which includes districts modeled on the world's seven ''famous water cities,'' and an 85-foot replica of the Arc de Triomphe.
 ''We have outstanding architecture from around the world,'' Tong Rui, vice chief executive at Sanyuan Yinhui Investment and Development, the mall's developer, said as he toured a section modeled on Paris. ''You can't see this architecture anywhere else in shopping malls.'' 
 Hu Guirong, the man behind the development, made his fortune selling noodles and biscuits in China. His aides say he built his mall in Dongguan, a fast-growing city whose population is estimated as high as eight million, with one of the highest car-to-household ratios in the country, because it is situated at a crossroads of two bustling South China metropolises, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. 
 ''We wanted to do something groundbreaking,'' Mr. Tong said, referring to his boss. ''We wanted to leave our mark on history.''
 But just to keep a seven-million-square-foot shopping center from looking deserted, some retailing specialists say, requires 50,000 to 70,000 visitors a day. 
 Officials of the South China Mall say they will easily surpass those figures. 
 But before the mall is fully open, the Triple Five Group is working to reclaim the world title, with three megamalls in the planning stages that will expand its operations from its base in North America into China.
 Two of them, the Mall of China and the Triple Five Wenzhou Mall, are each projected to be 10 million square feet.
 ''You'll see,'' Mr. Ghermezian of Triple Five said. ''We are also expanding the Mall of America. There's going to be a Phase 2.''

PERSON: Howard Morris

HEADLINE: Howard Morris, an Actor in Television Comedies, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Howard Morris, a character actor in the Golden Age of television best known for his work with Sid Caesar and for his brief, memorable role as the manic hillbilly poet Ernest T. Bass on ''The Andy Griffith Show,'' died on Saturday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 85.
 No cause of death was announced, but Mr. Morris's son, David, told The Los Angeles Times that his father had had heart problems in recent years. 
 With Carl Reiner, Mr. Morris formed the comic ensemble that supported Mr. Caesar and Imogene Coca on ''Your Show of Shows,'' broadcast on NBC from 1950 to 1954. He also worked as a TV director and was a familiar voice in television cartoons and commercials.
 Five feet six and slightly built, Mr. Morris was so gifted a vocal performer that early in his career he got a job that involved impersonating inanimate objects, among them boxing gloves and a chopping block. (The job was on the radio.) On television, he was the voice of the Qantas Airways koala and the cartoon character Atom Ant.
 Howard Morris was born in the Bronx in 1919. He learned early to joke about life's darkest moments: when he was a youth, his father lost his job in the Depression and shortly afterward died of a heart attack.
 ''He died of unemployment,'' Mr. Morris often said.
 Mr. Morris attended New York University, majoring in drama, until World War II interrupted his studies. He served in the Pacific, where he later performed as part of an entertainment unit. The troupe's repertory, Mr. Morris recalled, ranged from ''Hamlet'' to ''Five Jerks in a Jeep.''
 After the war, Mr. Morris appeared on Broadway, playing Rosencrantz in Mike Todd's production of ''Hamlet,'' which featured returned servicemen; he also appeared in ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.''
 Mr. Morris owed his television career to his short stature and stout lapels. In 1949, Mr. Caesar was starring on television in ''The Admiral Broadway Revue,'' a precursor of ''Your Show of Shows.'' He needed a little guy to play a character called Weasel; the actor had to be light enough for Mr. Caesar to pick him up by the lapel of his coat.
 Mr. Morris auditioned for Mr. Caesar and the show's producer, Max Liebman. Mr. Caesar reached out his hand, grabbed and lifted Mr. Morris off the ground. He turned to his producer. ''Max!'' he cried, with Yiddish-inflected syntax. ''Him! Get!''
 On ''Your Show of Shows,'' Mr. Morris used his size to comic effect. In one memorable sketch, a sendup of ''This Is Your Life,'' he played Uncle Goopy, a man so devoted to the guest of honor (Mr. Caesar) that he latched onto his leg and refused to let go. As the live broadcast unfolded, Mr. Caesar was forced to drag Mr. Morris behind him as he walked across the stage.
 Mr. Morris appeared in Mr. Caesar's next program, ''Caesar's Hour,'' and in a 1967 reunion show, ''The Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, Howard Morris Special.''
 As a director, he worked on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show,'' ''Hogan's Heroes'' and ''Get Smart.'' Mr. Morris appeared in many films, notably Mel Brooks's ''History of the World: Part I'' (1981), and directed several others, including ''Don't Drink the Water'' (1969), by Woody Allen.
 Mr. Morris was divorced five times, The Los Angeles Times reported. Besides his son, he is survived by three daughters, Gabrielle, Kim and Devra; and three grandchildren, The Times said.
 Mr. Morris was able to find comedy in absolutely anything, as Mr. Brooks recalled in a 1998 article in The Minneapolis Star Tribune. After Mr. Morris's father died, so the story went, the young man went down to the Hudson River to scatter his ashes. A breeze came up, blowing the ashes onto Mr. Morris's good suit.
 ''So where do you consider your father's final resting place to be?'' Mr. Brooks asked him.
 Mr. Morris replied: ''I would have to say Grand Cleaners on Park Avenue.''

HEADLINE: Study Sees Worrisome Gaps In Growth Rates Worldwide

BYLINE: By BRIAN CHILDS; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, May 24 

 BODY:
Differences in economic performance are widening among Europe, Asia and the United States, with possible long-term consequences for global growth and the stability of the dollar, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned on Tuesday. 
 The United States economy is enjoying a soft landing that may warrant higher interest rates to curb consumption, while growth prospects in Asia continue to strengthen, the agency said in its semiannual assessment of the global economy.
 But in Europe, the outlook is dim enough that the European Central Bank must consider cutting borrowing costs by at least another half-point, from a historically low level of 2 percent, to stimulate growth, the O.E.C.D.'s chief economist, Jean-Philippe Cotis, said in an interview Monday, before the report was released by the agency, which is based in Paris. 
 The recommendation came as the O.E.C.D. cut its growth forecast for the economy of the 12-member euro region to 1.2 percent for this year, down from a forecast of 1.9 percent in December. The O.E.C.D. said that it expected growth of no more than 2 percent in 2006. 
 The notion of trimming rates to stimulate growth has been rejected by the European Central Bank, whose members have signaled in recent speeches that economic conditions do not warrant lower borrowing costs. 
 On Tuesday, Klaus Liebscher, a member of the bank's governing council, said a rate cut would hurt its credibility and raise inflation expectations, Reuters reported.On Tuesday, more evidence of weakness emerged as an important survey showed that German investor confidence fell in May to its lowest level in six months.. 
 With economies lagging in Europe, the O.E.C.D. urged governments to press ahead with measures to stimulate investment and jobs. 
 ''Whatever the political difficulties, the case for further European economic integration and structural reforms remains pressing,'' the O.E.C.D. said. 
 Growth in the United States was forecast at 3.3 percent in 2006, down from 3.6 percent this year and 4.4 percent in 2004, Mr. Cotis said. But the current-account deficit in the United States could rise to 6.7 percent of gross domestic product next year, a level the agency said was unsustainable and could lead to a weakening of the dollar. 
 In Asia, the agency said that China's pegging its currency, the yuan, to the dollar was risky because it undervalues the yuan while increasing the chance for inflation. 
 The yuan's peg to the dollar has already resulted in a 3 percent decline this year in its effective exchange rate against the currencies of all of China's trading partners, the agency said. Combined with the boom in textile exports after the abolition of international textile quotas on Jan. 1, the weaker currency would keep China's trade surplus expanding through 2006, the agency said. 
 But the stimulus provided by China's economic expansion should continue to underpin strong growth in Asia, it added. Despite government efforts to prevent it, ''the economy is accelerating again,'' Mr. Cotis said. ''The problem is still to contain activity.'' 
 The O.E.C.D. expects China's economy to expand at a 9 percent rate this year and accelerate to 9.2 percent in 2006, accompanied by a rise in inflation to 4 percent this year and next, from 3.9 percent last year and 1.2 percent in 2003.
 The agency lowered its forecast for growth in Japan to 1.5 percent from the 2.1 percent forecast in December and from 2.6 percent last year. 
 Mr. Cotis said the agency expected Japan's deflationary period to end by the end of 2006.

HEADLINE: Surplus Shrinks Again in Japan As Imports Rise

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus declined for the third month in four in April as manufacturers bought more machinery made overseas to increase capacity. 
 The surplus fell 10.4 percent, to 962.8 billion yen ($8.95 billion), the Ministry of Finance said on Wednesday. 
Exports rose 7.8 percent, and imports gained 12.7 percent. 
 A revival in Japanese consumer spending, which helped the nation cement a recovery from last year's recession, is also fueling purchases of imported goods. 
 ''Companies are using profits to increase capital spending, which is driving up demand for imports,'' said Ryota Sakagami, an economist at Nomura Holdings Financial and Economic Research Center, who had predicted the surplus would narrow. ''Domestic demand is going to drive the economic recovery.'' 
 The trade surplus fell 20.5 percent from March, seasonally adjusted, to 712.2 billion yen, the report said. Exports rose 1.1 percent from March, and imports rose 5.6 percent. 
 Net exports, or the difference between exports and imports, shaved 0.1 percentage point from first-quarter growth after exports fell for the first time in more than three years. 
 ''Based on the orders in the first three months of the year, which were relatively good, the capital expenditure mood among the makers is fairly positive,'' Terry Higashi, chairman of Tokyo Electron, said earlier this month. ''We expected a greater decline in the market, but the conditions are better than we originally expected.'' 
 Rising oil prices have also increased the value of imports. The gains in oil prices will not be enough to curb profits and discourage manufacturers from spending, economists said. 
 Exporters including the Kenwood Corporation, a maker of car navigation systems, say growth in China and the United States will increase sales this year.

HEADLINE: Union Leaders Back Overhaul of Visteon

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 24 

 BODY:
The Visteon Corporation, the struggling auto parts maker, won support on Tuesday from leaders of its largest union for a major overhaul plan that would allow the company to shed a quarter of its work force and nearly all of its plants in the United States.
 Under the agreement, Visteon's former parent company, Ford Motor, would reabsorb about 17,700 Visteon workers and assume control of 15 plants, most of them in the Midwest. The agreement, which must be ratified by rank-and-file members of the United Auto Workers union, would let Ford sell most of those 15 plants and offer buyouts to as many as 5,000 current Visteon workers. 
 The plan includes no layoffs, wage cuts or benefit reductions, according to a copy obtained by The New York Times. 
 The endorsement from the leadership of the U.A.W. is an important step forward for Visteon as it struggles to survive. The company has not turned a yearly profit since it was spun off by Ford in 2000, and has accumulated more than $3 billion in losses in the last three years. Two weeks ago, Visteon said that if it did not reach a cost-restructuring agreement with its former parent, it would not have enough cash to operate for the rest of the year.
 If it is successful in spinning off the plants, Visteon's North American manufacturing operations will be even more concentrated in Mexico. The company, which also has operations in Europe, South America, Asia and Africa, sells components to carmakers around the world. Its biggest customer is Ford.
 At a meeting of U.A.W. officials on Tuesday morning in downtown Detroit, local union leaders representing Visteon workers across the country voted to recommend the proposal to their members. Voting begins next week and concludes on June 5. 
 ''Obviously, we're all very apprehensive about what's going to take place,'' said Eugene Morey, the president of the U.A.W. Local 849, which represents Visteon workers at a plant in Ypsilanti, Mich. ''But from what I can read into this, it took a bad situation and I think we did pretty well when you consider that Visteon was on the brink of going bankrupt.''
 While the agreement would allow Visteon to eliminate costly factory jobs that pay workers as much as $70 an hour, those jobs would shift to Ford, which is in no position to absorb additional labor costs. 
 ''There's no real place for them to transfer in Ford,'' said Sean McAlinden, the chief economist at the Center for Automotive Research.
 Ford, which has already bailed out Visteon once this year, is beset with its own troubles and has warned that it may not make money in its automotive division this year. In March, Ford agreed to purchase equipment from Visteon valued at about $150 million. It also allowed Visteon to reduce its employee reimbursement payments by $25 million a month through the end of the year.
 After the spinoff in 2000, Ford continued to pay thousands of employees who were working in Visteon factories while Visteon reimbursed Ford for the wages. Some 17,700 of those employees remain on the Ford payroll and will be brought back under Ford entirely if the restructuring proposal is approved.
 A spokesman said Ford would withhold comment until a final plan is in place. A spokeswoman for Visteon did not return several phone calls seeking comment. 
 When Ford spun off Visteon, the U.A.W. negotiated to have its members remain employees of Ford, not Visteon, so workers would be guaranteed employment if the parts venture failed. In that respect, Ford had little choice but to reabsorb the workers it leased to Visteon and to assume control of the plants. 
 Of the 15 Visteon plants Ford would control, 13 would be placed in a holding company under the plan. Ford would then sell 11 plants in the holding company, close one and reorganize another. Two other Visteon plants would be placed directly under Ford's control.

HEADLINE: Pataki Aide Flexes Early Muscle In Effort to Speed Up Rebuilding

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
In the two weeks since the governor appointed him to oversee the development of the former World Trade Center site, John P. Cahill has moved quickly to assert his power, taking a variety of small but significant actions that appear meant to demonstrate that a central authority now leads downtown development. 
 On May 13, the day after he was named to the post, Mr. Cahill canceled the contract with the company in charge of demolishing the Deutsche Bank building, hoping to speed up the construction of a new building on the site. The building was damaged beyond repair in the attacks of 2001, and its demolition has been repeatedly delayed by a series of environmental disputes. 
 Since then, Mr. Cahill, who as Gov. George E. Pataki's chief of staff spent most of his time in Albany, has been passing most of his days in Lower Manhattan, gripped by daily meetings with community board members, agency officials and others who have a stake in Lower Manhattan's future. 
 Yesterday, he flew to Washington to meet with members of Congress to discuss the use of $2 billion in tax credits that President Bush has approved to pay for a rail link between Lower Manhattan and Kennedy International Airport. 
 ''I'm trying to reintroduce myself to the folks down here,'' said Mr. Cahill in a telephone interview from Washington, ''and to emphasize how important this is not just to Lower Manhattan but to the entire United States.''
 The rebuilding process for Lower Manhattan has been stymied in recent months as myriad agencies, private corporations, residents and scores of other interested parties have sparred over how to proceed with various aspects of the plan. 
 In the most significant setback, Goldman Sachs recently scrapped plans to build a $2 billion headquarters across the street from the former trade center site, citing uncertainty and security issues. Mr. Cahill is laboring to reverse the decision. 
 An important component to rebuilding the site has been the demolition of the Deutsche Bank building, where one of the new trade towers is scheduled to be built. Last year, the Gilbane Building Company, which had been hired to bring down the building, released a draft plan for the first phase of deconstruction to meet Mr. Pataki's goal of demolishing the building by the end of the year. 
 But when the Environmental Protection Agency and other groups raised concerns that those plans did not adequately guard against the potential release of contaminants in the air, the project became more or less deadlocked, with the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and Gilbane wrestling with how to meet the new deconstruction demands. After federal officials decided that the project would be covered in scaffolding for decontamination, Mr. Cahill concluded the entire project needed to be put up for bidding again. Gilbane's original contract was for $45 million, but that figure is expected to increase vastly. 
 Gilbane will be invited to bid on what will be either two or three contracts, one for scaffolding alone, which Mr. Cahill wants up by August, and the others for decontamination and demolition of the building. 
 ''There is a complete sea change in the thinking,'' said Charles Maikish, executive director of Lower Manhattan Construction Command Center, which coordinates construction at the site. ''Good public policy dictates that when you have a change in scope you rebid the project.'' 
 George Cavallo, senior vice president and regional manager for the Northeast office of Gilbane, said he was not inclined to bid again, but remained ambivalent. ''I do understand their position,'' said Mr. Cavallo, who said he had other pressing contracts around New York. 
 Mr. Cahill has also tried to turn 1 Liberty Plaza -- home to the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the Memorial Foundation and the site's construction command center -- into a bull's-eye for constant meetings and discussions among agencies.
 ''There seems to be an increased sense of coordination, particularly among the state agencies,'' said Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff, whose portfolio includes Lower Manhattan. ''There are meetings that are taking place that did not happen before and there is an increased sense of urgency.''
 The involvement of Mr. Pataki's closest aide in every aspect of the project has given many interested parties a sense that stalled projects and unraveled conversations are back on track, after months of grumbling that Mr. Pataki had become disengaged. ''I think that is a big plus, when a senior aide to the governor is accessible,'' said Carl Weisbrod, the president of the Alliance for Downtown New York.
 But others also caution that it is far from time to declare victory. ''There's a whole new feeling downtown,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, ''but we'll have to see some proof. Feeling isn't good enough, and to me the first real test is Goldman Sachs.''

HEADLINE: Steep Rise in Prices for Homes Adds to Worry About a Bubble

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Home prices rose more quickly over the last year than at any point since 1980, a national group of Realtors reported yesterday, raising new questions about whether some local housing markets may be turning into bubbles destined to burst.
 With mortgage rates still low and job growth accelerating, the real estate market is defying yet another round of predictions that it was on the verge of cooling. The number of homes sold also jumped in April, after having been flat for almost a year.
 Nationwide, the median price for sales of existing homes, which does not factor in newly built ones, rose to $206,000 last month, up 15.1 percent over the last year and breaking the $200,000 level for the first time, the National Association of Realtors said. Adjusted for inflation, the median price -- the point at which half cost more and half cost less -- has increased more than a third since 2000. 
 ''We've had robust markets before,'' said Maurice J. Veissi, the president of a real estate agency in Miami, who has been a broker for 30 years. ''But this one is so much broader and deeper.''
 Even before this surge, housing prices had risen more steeply over the last 10 years than during any such period since World War II. A growing number of economists worry that real estate is to this decade what technology stocks were to the 1990's, with many people assuming that home values will rise forever.
 Over all, home prices have never fallen by a significant amount, and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Friday that a national drop in price remained unlikely. But they have sometimes fallen sharply in certain locations, including New York and Los Angeles, and Mr. Greenspan, in his strongest warning to date, stated that some metropolitan areas were clearly showing signs of ''froth.''
 Having been sanguine about real estate in recent years, Mr. Greenspan began to change his tone in March, when he cited some analysts' concern that the housing market might ''implode.''
 Prices continue to rise most rapidly in the places where they are already highest, including Florida, the Boston-Washington corridor and along the West Coast. In the late 1980's, a typical house in San Diego cost about as much as two typical houses in Syracuse, according to the Realtors' association; today, someone could buy six Syracuse houses for the price of one in San Diego.
 Prices have jumped most sharply over the last year in the West -- up 21 percent in April from a year earlier, compared with an increase of 14 percent in the calendar year 2004. Price increases also accelerated in the Midwest, to almost 13 percent, while they remained roughly similar in the Northeast at 16 percent, and the South, where they are up about 8 percent compared with a year earlier. 
 In a separate report, the Census Bureau said Tuesday that the percentage of homes worth at least a million dollars had almost doubled from 2000 to 2003. California had the highest share of million-dollar homes in 2003, with more than 4 percent valued above that amount. It was followed by Connecticut; Washington, D.C.; Massachusetts; and New York, where an estimated 2.1 percent of the homes were valued at more than $1 million. Nationally, 1 percent are worth more than that.
 ''There's clearly speculative excess going on,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR Inc., an economic research group in New York. ''A lot of people view real estate as a can't lose.''
 Until the April surge, the overall housing market had seemed to have reached a plateau. Economists, even some working for real estate lobbying groups, predicted that sales would decline a little in 2005 and prices would rise more modestly.
 But even as the Fed has steadily lifted its benchmark short-term interest rate, mortgage rates have remained low. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed loan is now 5.71 percent, down from 6.30 percent a year ago, according to Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage buyer. 
 Mortgage rates are closely tied to the market for long-term government bonds, which are benefiting from purchases by foreign governments, particularly in Asia, that continue to buy Treasury bonds, as well as from investors looking for a haven from risky corporate securities.
 As the economy has gained strength this year, the still low rates and creative financing arrangements appear to have wooed a new group of homebuyers into the market. Some are trading up to larger houses, while others are buying a vacation homes or putting money into real estate simply as an investment. 
 ''Mortgage rates are doing this,'' said David A. Lereah, chief economist of the Realtors' association. ''They're near historic lows.''
 The number of existing homes that changed hands in April increased 4.5 percent, the biggest monthly gain since early 2004. Sales of condominiums, particularly popular among real estate speculators, rose faster than sales of free-standing homes. Condo prices rose faster, too. 
 To economists worried about a bubble, the growing gap between house prices and almost everything else -- rents, incomes, population growth -- is the surest sign of trouble. A typical apartment, for example, costs less to rent than it did five years ago, taking inflation into account, according to the National Real Estate Index, which is published by Global Real Analytics, a research company based in San Francisco.
 The last time that house prices increased more than 15 percent over a 12-month period was in 1980, according to the Realtors' group. But overall inflation was also high at the time, helping to drive home values higher as well. Inflation has been modest in recent years.
 Mr. Shapiro of MFR said that even a moderate rise in mortgage rates now had the potential to cause a price decline in some expensive markets. A rate increase would change the calculation for people buying residential real estate as an investment, he said, and could make other buyers realize that the recent price jumps could not continue.
 But other economists predict that powerful demographic forces will keep prices increasing in most of the country. Many baby boomers are buying second homes, and their children -- like many immigrants who have arrived in the last generation -- are destined, in this view, to buy their first, continuing to stoke demand.
 Construction companies have also avoided the kind of overbuilding that plagued some regions during the real estate downturn of the early 1990's. Fewer than 2.5 million homes remained on the market in April, equal to only about four months' worth of home sales, and that is near a record low.
 ''Obviously, there are some local bubbles,'' said Mr. Lereah, of the Realtors' group, who called last month's price increase unsustainable. ''But I tend to think that with most of the bubbles, the air will come out slowly, rather than popping.''

HEADLINE: In Moscow, U.S. Strives for Greater Share of Oil Exports

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 24 

 BODY:
Samuel W. Bodman, United States energy secretary, met with Kremlin officials Tuesday to relay the concerns of American energy companies about Russia's investment climate, and added that Russian oil exports to the United States should be ''10 times'' what they are currently.
 In an effort to revive flagging energy cooperation between the two countries, Mr. Bodman met with his counterpart, Russia's minister of industry and energy, Viktor B. Khristenko, and the economic development and trade minister, German O. Gref, regarding critical issues. 
 Among them were a long-delayed oil pipeline to Murmansk, in Russia's far North; potential joint projects in liquefied natural gas; and ways to improve the investment environment, perceived as hostile since the Russian government partly renationalized its largest private oil company, Yukos.
 ''My observations ran from the need to improvements in transparency, the sanctity of contracts and judicial independence,'' Mr. Bodman said at a news briefing at the American Embassy here, ''all matters that have caused concern in the private sector.''
 Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the United States has sought alternative sources of energy to replace supplies from the Middle East, and Russia's crude production in recent years had grown as fast as 10 percent a year. 
 But the attack on Yukos, once Russia's largest private oil company, has crimped its record production growth, and prompted worries about the safety of property rights. 
 ''Russia's oil exports to the U.S. total about 230,000 to 240,000 barrels a day,'' Mr. Bodman said. ''It should be 10 times that or more, given the reserves that are here.''
 Asked whether he raised the Yukos affair specifically with the Kremlin officials, Mr. Bodman answered: ''Not that I remember. I guess I did allude to the fact that it was one of the reasons that there was uncertainty. I think I probably did in some of the conversations and I didn't in others.''
 Meanwhile, big United States energy companies have been largely sidelined from direct investments in Russia's oil and gas sector. 
 Last year, Exxon Mobil abruptly lost its license to the Sakhalin-3 concession, a huge project in Russia's Far East that it has been developing for roughly a decade.
 Exxon Mobil's chief, Lee. R. Raymond, said in December that the company was re-evaluating whether it would invest more money in Russia until there was clarity on the investment climate.
 In January, the Kremlin said it would re-auction the oil-rich block on the remote eastern island of Sakhalin, though Exxon Mobil said the deal had been exclusive.
 Mr. Bodman acknowledged that the United States was competing globally with China and India for energy investments. 
 Russia's plans for a pipeline to Murmansk, destined to ship oil to America's Eastern Seaboard, are now suspended, and a pipeline to Asian customers ending in Nakhodka in Russia's Far East is on the drawing board. 
 ''To the extent it is viewed as being best for Russia to build every pipeline to China, then that's what they should do,'' Mr. Bodman said. ''I respectfully suggest that there are better ways.''

HEADLINE: Iran's Ex-Leader Seeks Return In the Trappings of a Reformer

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: TEHRAN, May 24 

 BODY:
It is an election as contradictory as Iran itself: the front-runner is a pillar of the Islamic Revolution now cast as the man who can curb the excesses of hard-line clerics and improve relations with the country's bogeyman, the United States. 
 Indeed, this politician, Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and self-styled free-marketer, cloaks himself in the trappings of a reformist as carefully as he wears his tailored blue-gray clerical robes. 
 But in an interview, one of a series he is giving to promote his candidacy, Mr. Rafsanjani sounds less than conciliatory. He says the United States is not a democracy, and demands that it make the first concession before relations improve. Like all senior officials, he steadfastly defends Iran's right to develop nuclear technology. 
 ''There is only a veneer of democracy in the United States, and we have a real democracy,'' he said, brushing aside suggestions that Iran's election rules unfairly favor the hard-liners who control much of the government. ''Election laws are so complicated in your country that people have no choice but to vote for one of the candidates who are with one of the two parties.'' 
 Mr. Rafsanjani, 70, may best embody the absurdities of the election, on June 17, even if defending Iran by attacking the United States is a favorite tactic of any official dodging questions about domestic issues. 
 Political and social change is so popular that all candidates adopt the vocabulary and style of reform; the arch-conservative mayor of Tehran even showed up to register as a candidate in a remarkable, highly fashionable pink shirt. Yet none of the eight candidates allowed to run want to alter what many here see as their central problem: all power rests in the hands of an unaccountable, supreme religious leader who can overrule elected officials at whim. 
 Hence Iranians are expected to avoid the polls with the same zeal with which they flocked to them in the past two elections, when they arrived full of hope that their votes would produce real change. 
 This is particularly true given that the Guardians Council, an unelected watchdog group, first eliminated, then reinstated the main reformist candidate only after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appealed to the council to give voters a choice. 
 The reinstatement of this reformist, Mustafa Moin, and of another independent candidate signaled that the fate of any candidate remained in the hands of the ayatollah. 
 Aside from Mr. Rafsanjani, the remaining candidates hoping to succeed President Mohammed Khatami include one moderate cleric and four former senior officers in the Revolutionary Guards, whose loyalty to the supreme leader is unquestionable. 
 In this lineup, Mr. Rafsanjani is viewed as a compromise figure -- the least distasteful conservative to the liberals and the most liberal among the conservatives. 
 At times he might be described as the most hated man in Iran -- blamed for ills ranging from corruption to the inability of reformers to push through even mild political change. Then again, many Iranians wonder if his religious and revolutionary credentials might lend him sufficient influence to confront the supreme leader, a friend and rival.
 ''They would like to see him as president, but they don't want to vote for him,'' said Nasser Hadian, a political scientist.
 One rival candidate, Mehdi Karoubi, a centrist cleric and former speaker of Parliament, laid out Mr. Rafsanjani's past democratic failings in a widely circulated letter. He attacked Mr. Rafsanjani for not defending candidates rejected by the Guardians Council in previous elections, for allowing the Intelligence Ministry to dabble in the economy, and indirectly for the deaths of dissident intellectuals during his presidency from 1989 to 1997, killings later traced to intelligence agents. 
 Aides to Mr. Rafsanjani concede that their candidate sometimes lost confrontations with the conservatives, but suggest this time will be different because he wants to polish his legacy. His political stock had fallen so low by 2000 that he failed to win a Parliament seat.
 ''Mr. Rafsanjani believes that we have to provide people with a better life, better education, more welfare, better urban life, and eventually these changes will lead to a bigger change, breaking the obstacle of tradition and the clergy,'' said Mohammad Atrianfar, a Rafsanjani adviser and editor in chief of the daily Shargh. ''Mr. Khatami thought he could do it more directly and that's why he somehow failed. The direct approach in Iran isn't a very good approach because somehow the government rejects this approach by disqualifying candidates, weakening the Parliament and supervising the press.''
 The mere fact that Mr. Rafsanjani gave an interview to The New York Times -- his first -- and has spoken to a few other foreign news organizations is a sign that he seeks to convince voters that his reach stretches far beyond Iran. 
 The reformists' main props during the past eight years were the crushing election victories that swept Mr. Khatami to power in 1997 and 2001. Though he loosened the social climate, supporters were disappointed by constant assaults on civil liberties, like the shuttering of some 100 newspapers. Ayatollah Khamenei, who already controls the military, the judiciary and the state-run television and radio, is suspected of seeking to control the presidency next, after effectively defanging Parliament last year by eliminating all reformist candidates. 
 A combination of apathy and anger appears particularly rampant among the 66 percent of Iran's 70 million people who are under 30. A huge share of the 48 million eligible voters are expected to deny the government its traditional attempt to use a high turnout to argue that all Iranians support clerical rule.
 The Interior Ministry has been issuing veiled threats that any formal boycott attempt would be considered a crime, so Iranians avoid the word. 
 ''People are tired of lending a democratic face to this regime,'' said Abdullah Momeni, a student leader. ''They don't think the regime will offer any kind of fundamental change to bring democracy.''
 Yet Mr. Rafsanjani's camp thinks it can appeal to this constituency. Mr. Atrianfar reels off numbers like any ward boss. He said about two-thirds of Iranians wanted some manner of reform, with almost half of them seeking complete constitutional change. Only 10 percent like the status quo.
 The 10 percent, which others describe as up to seven million hard-core conservative voters, are likely to support Mr. Rafsanjani, not least because he is the main cleric left in the race. Mr. Atrianfar suggests that Mr. Rafsanjani can sway some voters in other reformist camps. 
 In his hour-long interview on Monday evening, held in a stunning former royal palace of pale green marble in downtown Tehran, Mr. Rafsanjani did not go so far as to suggest re-establishing ties with Washington. But after detailing a long list of domestic and regional ills caused by the United States, he ventured that it was time to retire the past. 
 ''It is not a priority for us, but the current state is not reasonable either,'' he said, repeating the demand he made as president that the first step should be the release of some $11 billion in Iranian assets frozen since the American Embassy in Tehran was seized for 444 days right after the revolution. 
 Mr. Rafsanjani is a staunch supporter of Iran's developing its nuclear capacity for electric power, medical applications and other uses, but says he opposes nuclear weapons. 
 That contrasts with a sermon at a Friday Prayer in 2001, however, in which he suggested that just one nuclear bomb could solve the problem of Israel's threatening the region with its own nuclear arsenal. 
 On social issues, considered a key among the mass of young voters, he says the government should get out of people's private lives. ''Even Islam says one should not interfere in the private lives of people,'' he said. 
 There is one cornerstone that he would not change: the enforcement of the hijab, or head-covering, for all women. Tehran has been rife with rumors that Mr. Rafsanjani, who holds the religious rank of hojatolislam, one step below ayatollah, would find a way to make hijabs voluntary.
 ''We are Muslims and we enforce Islamic law, which is also in our Constitution,'' he said.
 In terms of the economy, Mr. Rafsanjani said he would like to reduce greatly the 44 percent of the economy in public hands. (Others put the government's share as high as 85 percent.) Recent decisions to overturn contracts signed with Turkish companies to improve Iran's overburdened cellphone network and run its new international airport were a mistake, he said. 
 Mr. Rafsanjani's critics -- and they are legion -- accuse him of repeating old themes and note his difficulties in challenging the radicals when president. He proved unable to unify the currency exchange rate, for example, and lost several battles with the conservatives over who would serve in his cabinet. 
 Among voters, discussions after Friday Prayer in Isfahan, south of Tehran, produced varied results. 
 A retired elementary school teacher said Mr. Rafsanjani was the only candidate who could strengthen the economy, while a young clerical student said eight years was enough and the country needed a younger man. 
 Reza Jaedi, 24, was slouching through Isfahan's main square in a bright yellow shirt, the colorful clothing and his long hair both favorite forms of silent protest. 
 ''I'm not going to vote for anyone because it's just a show,'' he said. ''This one comes and this one goes and nothing changes.''

HEADLINE: Young Bolivians Adopt Urban U.S. Pose, Hip-Hop and All

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: EL ALTO, Bolivia, May 24 

 BODY:
This sprawling city on Bolivia's windswept high plains, home to nearly 800,000 Indians, is a tradition-bound place where the language is Aymara, the women wear derby hats and layer-cake skirts and families relax to centuries-old Andean music, which is heavy on pipes but devoid of lyrics.
 In other words, not exactly the place you would expect to find a thriving, politically charged rap culture. 
 But El Alto -- a flash point for protest and the capital of indigenous Bolivia -- is seething, and a growing number of young Aymara are expressing their anger in a hard-driving rap, complete with rapid-fire lyrics excoriating Bolivia's leaders and venting about the dire social conditions of the country's Indian majority.
 Adopting the trappings of American hip-hop, young Aymara wear baggy pants and baseball caps and strike the pose of urban America, hand signs, cocky talk and all. 
 Their inspiration, though, comes straight from Bolivia's recent tumultuous history: the fall of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in October 2003 after protests in which 60 Indian demonstrators were killed, the bitter struggle over development of Bolivia's huge natural gas reserves, the indignation over the Washington-financed eradication of coca and the desperate poverty.
 ''We have lyrics about Black October,'' said Abraham Bojorquez, 22, the natural leader of a group of about 20 rappers. ''We sing about coca, about poverty. Our singing is revolutionary. We protest without marches or strikes. We do it through music, to reach as many people as possible.'' 
 In the song ''Jichaw'' -- Aymara for ''Now'' -- the chorus, also in Aymara, captures the fervor of Bolivia's emboldened Indians: ''Now we are speaking. Now they will know us. Now we will rise up.'' Switching to Spanish, the rappers then sing of how ''the revolution has started, against the system and the state.''
 The rappers, belonging to groups with names that translate as, for example, Insane Race, the Lyrical Urban Movement and the Clandestines, often mix Aymara with their Spanish. Their songs combine a strong love of their country with a deep resentment toward those who have oppressed and exploited it, whether insiders or outsiders.
 ''Proud to be born in my Bolivia,'' goes one song by Lyrical Urban Movement, ''though a land wounded by oppressors who call themselves defenders of my land.''
 In ''The People Do Not Fall,'' written by Mr. Bojorquez and performed by his two-man rap group, Ukamau y Ke, whose nearly untranslatable name means, literally, ''like it is and what,'' the lyrics seek to capture the violence to which indigenous protesters have been subjected. It heaps scorn on the former president, Mr. Sanchez de Lozada, widely known by his nickname, Goni, and condemns the state for selling Bolivia's natural gas.
 ''Goni, inept, the people ask for gas; the people ask for peace,'' the lyrics go. ''Goni, understand, the gas is not for sale, because the people depend on democracy -- they demand their rights.''
 Another song, ''Blessed People,'' by the Clandestines, captures the fighting spirit of a downtrodden Indian community. ''Blessed people wounded; how many times have you fallen?'' the Clandestines wrote. ''But I never leave; I live where I love. I survive. I say what I think, what I am. It's cold; the streets are with me.''
 With little money and virtually no experience with commercial music, the rappers in El Alto get their rap out through a cutting-edge radio station, Wayna Tambo, which also serves as a youth center. On their radio show, ''Rincon Callejero,'' or ''The Street Corner,'' the rappers play their music, interview players in El Alto's budding hip-hop culture, talk politics and ham it up.
 The one CD the rappers recorded, called ''Wayna Rap,'' sells robustly on the streets of El Alto, pirated by the hundreds -- just as the rappers like. ''I do not live off hip-hop, and I did not plan to,'' said Grover Canaviri, 23, who sings for the Clandestines. ''I do not care if my music is pirated. The money is not important. What we want is to send out our lyrics so they can influence.'' 
 Still, the rappers hope to record professionally, something Abraham Bojorquez is on his way to doing with one of Bolivia's foremost musicians, Alvaro Montenegro. 
 ''The music is very left, almost from the 70's, an institutional left, but at the same time it sounds fresh, like original Bolivian music,'' said Mr. Montenegro, who first met the rappers while teaching music to young people at Wayna Tambo.
 Mr. Montenegro says the rappers need to shed some of the North American flavor in their rap and incorporate Bolivian touches, like using highland wind instruments as background music. The rappers say they are open to suggestions, but they explain that it was easy to find inspiration, and style, for their music from black urban America.
 ''We're also discriminated against for being dark, for not having money,'' said Rodolfo Quisbert, 19. ''That's why we like hip-hop.'' 
 Life in El Alto is hard. People live in drab adobe or cinder-block homes. There is no heat to ward off the frigid winds that whip off snow-capped mountains. Most people work in Bolivia's informal economy, selling what they can on the streets. Crime and infant mortality are common.
 ''We grew up with nothing to eat, a breakfast with just chuno,'' a type of freeze-dried potato, Mr. Canaviri said. ''We didn't even know what lunch was.''
 A life filled with hardship, though, yields a rich harvest of material.
 ''I say what I see, what I feel, what I think, the thinking of the people here,'' Mr. Canaviri said. ''I put all of that in my lyrics.''

HEADLINE: April Sales Of New Homes Show a Surge

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
The country's avid appetite for real estate propelled sales of newly built homes to a record pace in April, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, helping to raise prices and adding to concerns that the housing market may be in overdrive.
 In another sign of the economy's strength, the department also reported that orders for durable goods like aircraft and computer equipment rose 1.9 percent last month after three straight months of declines. That strong showing was the latest in a series of April economic reports to reverse poor March numbers.
 ''On the whole, the data for the month of April have quarantined the March soft patch to a one-month event,'' said Alan Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund company. 
 Housing appeared more robust than ever. New-home sales rose 0.2 percent in April, to an annual rate of 1.32 million units, the government said, putting 2005 on track to break 2004's record of 1.2 million in sales.
 New-home prices rose 3.8 percent from the previous year, reaching a median price of $230,800, with half of the houses costing more and half costing less.
 ''Housing is red hot, and nothing has happened to discourage people from thinking it will remain that way,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR, an economic research group in New York.
 Even after a sharp reduction in the government's initial estimate, home sales reached an annual pace of 1.31 million in March.
 Other recent data has also showed unexpected strength in housing, challenging economists' predictions of a slowdown this year. The National Association of Realtors reported on Tuesday that sales of existing homes climbed at a record pace in April, while the median home price surged 15.1 percent over the last year, to $206,000. 
 The surge in home sales and prices has raised concerns that the real estate market may be swelling into a bubble that is likely to burst, especially as more people buy property in the hope of selling quickly at a profit.
 Although he has resisted using the bubble characterization, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman, warned last week of ''froth'' in some local markets.
 Mr. Levenson of T. Rowe Price said that ''what's different about this cycle is the greater share of homes being bought for investment purposes,'' adding that parts of the country are ''ripe'' for a correction. 
 But, he said, ''We're not going to get a meaningful slowdown in housing demand until we see interest rates back up significantly.'' 
 With mortgage rates still at historic lows, Mr. Shapiro of MFR said, ''there's nothing out there that indicates the bubble is going to pop anytime soon.''
 Even as real estate continues to bolster the economy, business spending appears poised for an upturn, based on the government's data on durable goods. 
 In addition to reporting a 1.9 percent rise last month in new orders for big-ticket items, the government also revised its reading for March to a 1.6 percent decline, much less severe than the initially reported drop of 2.3 percent. 
 ''After last month's report, there was some concern that the factory sector might have been on the verge of a sharp slowdown,'' said Andrew Tilton, United States economist at Goldman, Sachs. 
 Instead, ''not only did you get the rebound that you expected, but we actually were rebounding from a much smaller hole.'' 
 Orders rose $3.7 billion in April to $200.3 billion, surpassing the 1.3 percent advance predicted by economists in a Bloomberg News poll. Besides reversing three months of declines, that was the biggest improvement since November, when orders grew 2 percent. 
 The transportation sector posted the biggest gain in orders, an 8.2 percent advance to $53.1 billion, after losing ground for the previous four months. Demand for nonmilitary aircraft drove the increase, adding $1.5 billion, or 28.2 percent.
 Excluding transportation orders, which vary widely from month to month, manufacturers experienced a 0.2 percent decline. But that followed a 0.2 percent advance in March, revising the previously reported drop of 0.5 percent.
 Inventories edged up 0.1 percent, to $291.8 billion, the smallest gain since late 2003, suggesting that manufacturers are whittling away at an overstock of goods.

HEADLINE: Move to Rein In Loan Buyers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25 

 BODY:
A House committee on Wednesday approved legislation that would strengthen federal oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage companies. 
 The bill, approved 65-5 by the House Financial Services Committee, falls short of the Bush administration's proposal to reduce the multibillion-dollar holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 Republicans are pushing to rein in the two government-sponsored companies that have been beset by accounting scandals. Efforts by Democrats to reshape the bill generally failed in the Republican-controlled committee. 
 The bill would create a stronger federal regulator with authority over the nation's two biggest buyers of home mortgages. Expressing concern, Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said, ''We shouldn't go overboard here.'' 
 The measure would also expand the government-set goals for the companies for making home ownership affordable. It would require that the companies devote 5 percent of their annual profits to financing housing for low-income people. 
 In addition, the companies could buy bigger mortgage loans than are allowed in high-cost states like California. The nationwide limit now is $359,650. 
 Congress created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to inject money into the home-loan market, with a view to keeping mortgage rates lower. 
 In June 2003, No.2 Freddie Mac disclosed that it had misstated earnings, mostly underreporting them, by $5 billion for 2000 to 2002. 
 The administration wants Congress to establish a new regulatory agency with the power to limit mortgage portfolios of the companies, which total $1.5 trillion.

HEADLINE: Early Heat Wave Kills 12 Illegal Immigrants in the Arizona Desert

BYLINE: By NICK MADIGAN

DATELINE: TUCSON, May 25 

 BODY:
The shades were drawn against the blistering sun in a room at the Southside Presbyterian Church, where six immigrants, survivors of punishing treks across the desert that took at least 12 lives in the last few days across Arizona, lay on cots and pondered their luck.
 ''I'm never going through that again,'' said Jose Jacinto, 20, from Michoacan, Mexico, who had crossed the border clandestinely in a group of 14 people trying to blend into the United States work force, like countless others every day. ''I got really scared out there. Maybe next time, it'll kill me.'' 
 Somewhere in the scorching expanse of the Sonoran Desert, two people in Mr. Jacinto's group, ages 15 and 17, died before his eyes, he said. Mr. Jacinto recalled that he fainted of dehydration three times.
 ''I couldn't walk any more,'' he said in Spanish, as a ceiling fan struggled to shake the overbearing heat above him. ''And my eyes got foggy. I couldn't see. But I'm better now.''
 Mr. Jacinto, a father of three children back home, could be considered fortunate. The Border Patrol knows of 12 immigrants who died in the last week as the desert temperatures ran as high as 115 degrees, and their deaths could be a harbinger of a summer of similar fatalities.
 ''It's definitely quite a lot,'' said Andrea Zortman, a Border Patrol spokeswoman for the Tucson sector, which covers much of the state, including 261 miles of border with Mexico. ''But we've done a lot, hopefully, to mitigate the deaths.''
 Since Oct. 1, when the agency's annual reporting period began, 72 deaths have been reported in the Arizona desert. There would have been many more, Ms. Zortman said, if the patrol had not increased its medical emergency teams, many of whom conduct rescues by helicopter.
 One of the 12 dead last weekend was a pregnant woman, Marcela Cruz-Gonzalez, 24, according to a news release from the Yuma County Sheriff's Office. As Ms. Gonzalez became weaker and weaker in the desert heat near Yuma, the report said, her husband asked the two smugglers leading their group of 18 people to lend him a cellphone to call for medical assistance. The smugglers refused, the husband told the authorities.
 ''They told them they should return to Mexico,'' Joe Brigman, a Border Patrol spokesman for the Yuma sector, said. ''They were basically abandoned.''
 The husband left his wife to seek help and was spotted by a Border Patrol team. They took him back to the site, where they found Ms. Cruz-Gonzalez dead.
 ''It's a bad deal,'' Officer Brigman said. ''One phone call could have saved her life.''
 Given the size of the desert, it is universally understood that many illegal immigrants die in the heat without being found. As the summer takes hold, the problem becomes acute.
 ''This is crunch time,'' said Sue Goodman, a founder of Humane Borders, a five-year-old organization that builds and stocks water stations for immigrants in the desert. 
 The group, using a combination of sources, also tracks immigrant deaths, which have markedly increased in recent years. The groups says the total reached at least 190 across Arizona in the 2003-4 fiscal year.
 Ms. Goodman, who drove to two water stations near Three Points, 23 miles west of here, on Wednesday to replenish stocks, said a common misperception since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was that terrorists hid among the immigrants. 
 ''I'm out there every day, and what I see is a 23-year-old man and his wife and their 2-year-old son, and they're coming here to work,'' she said. ''They're going to pick cherries in eastern Washington. They're shoveling manure in Kansas, or they're landscaping yards on Long Island. Why should people die when they're on their way to work for us? We're willing to make them walk through a deathtrap to get to work.'' 
 The increase in patrols since Sept. 11 -- not only by federal agents, but also by self-appointed border guardians whom some people call vigilantes -- has meant longer walks through inhospitable snake-ridden terrain for immigrants who seek to avoid the patrols, many of which stick to roads and well-traveled paths. 
 Often, Ms. Goodman said, the immigrants' smugglers, called coyotes, abandon the immigrants when the going becomes too rough, even after the immigrants have paid $1,000 or more for their services.
 ''The coyotes will tell them they'll be able to walk to Los Angeles in three hours,'' she said. ''They don't know where they're going.''
 At Three Points, a tiny community at the intersection of the Ajo Highway and a road that leads 45 miles to the Mexico border at Sasabe, a rancher in a cowboy hat said the area was experiencing tension because of the immigrants' constant movement.
 Roy Isaman, the rancher, said the Mexican government was ''sloughing off its economic problems on the U.S.'' by permitting high levels of illegal immigration.
 Mr. Isaman, who said he owned a ranch in Sasabe whose southern edge abuts the border, complained that migrants cross his property constantly. 
 ''I just tell them, 'Welcome to the United States, and good luck,' and I give them water,'' Mr. Isaman said. ''But I've come close to drawing a gun on coyotes who came at me in a threatening way.''
 At the Presbyterian church here, Tomas Pacheco, 40, also from Michoacan, recovering from dehydration and a leg injury from his trek through the desert last weekend, said his group of 150 people abandoned him when he could not keep up. 
 He then spent two days alone, most of that time without water.
 ''I just asked God to help me out, because when your water is gone you'll never get out of there alive,'' said Mr. Pacheco, 40, his arms displaying the scratches he acquired from creosote and mesquite shrubs. ''Finally, I saw another group of about 10 people, and I asked them for some water. I made it.''

HEADLINE: EUROPE GETS IRAN TO EXTEND FREEZE IN NUCLEAR WORK

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 25 

 BODY:
The foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany persuaded Iran on Wednesday to continue its freeze on nuclear activities, averting a diplomatic crisis that could have led to punitive international measures against Iran. 
 In exchange, the Europeans offered to present Iran with detailed, step-by-step proposals by early August at the latest on how to move toward consensus on the shape of Iran's nuclear program. Last November in Paris, Iran agreed to suspend all of its uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities while it negotiated the economic, nuclear, political and security benefits it would receive. 
 Despite the progress on Wednesday, the Europeans and the Iranians remain far apart on their ultimate goals. The Europeans want to prolong the freeze in Iran's enrichment activities until it becomes permanent, doling out trade, political, economic and security rewards, including access to nuclear energy, along the way. 
 The Iranians, by contrast, insist the freeze is only temporary. Iranian officials have pointed out that they are not required under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to freeze these activities and are doing so on a voluntary basis to show good will.
 The Bush administration, which accuses Iran of secretly using its nuclear program to develop weapons, reacted with caution to the developments on Wednesday, reaffirming its support for the European effort, but reiterating its suspicion of Iran's motives.
 ''Iran hid its nuclear activity from the international community for two decades,'' said Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman. ''That is why we are skeptical about their activities.'' 
 If Iran accepts the European proposal, as expected, both sides will have bought some time, and the freeze on Iran's uranium conversion and enrichment activities will still be in place when Iranians go to the polls to elect a new president on June 17.
 After three hours of negotiations that the Europeans and the Iranians described as very difficult, both sides claimed success. 
 ''We continue to work in the spirit of Paris,'' the French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, told reporters after the meeting. ''And from here on it will take us some weeks to make concrete proposals, particularly with the goal of putting in place a civilian program in Iran -- exclusively civil -- but other issues as well.'' 
 That statement suggested the Europeans were ready to present a concrete plan to satisfy Iran's demand that Europe help it gain access to nuclear reactors to generate electricity and a reliable nuclear fuel supply. 
 Hassan Rowhani, a cleric who is Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, said the meeting Wednesday was the first in which the Europeans had committed themselves to laying out in a timely fashion and in detail steps to a final agreement on Iran's nuclear program. 
 To throw the weight of the entire European Union behind the process, the union's foreign policy chief, also took part in the meeting.
 In the meeting, Mr. Rowhani told the Europeans bluntly that if they were putting incentives on the table expecting Iran to accept a permanent halt to its enrichment activities, they were ''going in the wrong direction,'' one of the Iranians said.
 He reiterated Iran's position to reporters, saying, ''We will remain committed to all our promises and at the same time we want all the rights applicable to countries, members of the Nonproliferation Treaty.''
 The talks were sought by the Europeans after Iran had threatened to resume work at a uranium-conversion plant in the city of Isfahan, along with work at other sites.
 The Europeans replied to the threat by warning Iran that restarting work would violate the Paris agreement and force them to support an American effort to refer Iran's case to the United Nations Security Council for possible punishment.
 That prompted Mr. Rowhani to write back that while Iran was considering resuming operations in Isfahan, his country wanted to avoid a breakdown in the talks and to move quickly toward a final agreement with Europe that would acknowledge Iran's rights to nuclear energy and would improve relations.
 On Wednesday, the Europeans took over a half-hour to outline their ideas and asked Iran to keep the nuclear freeze in place, one participant said on condition of anonymity. Mr. Rowhani asked more than once what specifically was being offered, and Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, finally asked for patience, saying Iran would lose nothing by waiting more two months.
 One Iranian participant said, ''What they put forward made it hard for us to say no.'' 
 Iranian officials have said repeatedly that they are under pressure in the prelude to their presidential election to show concrete results from their negotiations with the Europeans, and that if the Europeans did not deliver, they would be forced to restart the nuclear program.
 Although negotiators on both sides said that the talks were difficult and at times extremely tense, they had agreed in advance to keep the talks free of threats. 
 ''I'm happy that it didn't come to that,'' Mr. Fischer said after. But he stressed that serious differences remained. Asked what carrots the Europeans had offered as incentives, a European negotiator replied, ''There were no carrots.''
 In a sign of willingness in some circles in Iran to preserve the nuclear accord and continue the negotiations, Ali Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the former president who is considered the front-runner the election next month, was upbeat. 
 ''I don't believe the negotiations will remain fruitless,'' Mr. Rafsanjani told German ZDF television in Tehran on Wednesday. ''The negotiations are difficult and there is much scope for discussion.''
 Much to Iran's satisfaction, Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, noted that Iran had ''reaffirmed its commitment to not seeking nuclear weapons,'' and he underscored that Iran's right to pursue a peaceful nuclear program remained in place.
 The most difficult challenge for Iran remains to meet its commitment under the agreement to provide clear proof that its nuclear program can just be used for peaceful purposes. The Europeans insist that can be accomplished only by ending uranium enrichment and reprocessing altogether; the Iranians say that there are other means, including international inspections.
 The Europeans, in turn, may find it difficult to deliver on some of the more ambitious rewards they have discussed with Iran, including nuclear reactors. Such technology depends on the cooperation of the United States, which is convinced Iran is secretly developing a nuclear weapon and wants Iran referred to the Security Council for possible sanctions if it does not agree to give up the program permanently.

HEADLINE: 5 Leading Institutions Start Journalism Education Effort

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
The leaders of five of the nation's most prominent journalism programs are joining in a three-year, $6 million effort to try to elevate the standing of journalism in academia and find ways to prepare journalists better.
 The unusual collaboration, which has been developing for three years, involves Nicholas Lemann, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University; Orville Schell, dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley; Loren Ghiglione, dean of the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University; Geoffrey Cowan, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Southern California; and Alex S. Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University.
 Their goal is to revitalize journalism education by jointly undertaking national investigative reporting projects, integrating their journalism programs more deeply with other disciplines at their universities and providing a national platform to try to influence the discourse on media-related issues.
 ''Journalism as a whole is clearly in something of a crisis,'' Mr. Schell said. As journalistic scandals crop up with more frequency, surveys show trust in the news media eroding, newspaper circulation declining and young people disengaged from newspapers and television news. 
 ''Those of us who run journalism schools are confronted with the prospect of ever fewer distinguished media outlets -- especially in broadcast -- to which we can aspire to send our students to work,'' Mr. Schell added. ''So this is a time not only to try and make journalism schools as relevant as possible to the evolving profession, but also to have universities begin to weigh in on the debate about what happens in the media.'' 
 The effort is being supported by grants from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation, and Hodding Carter III, president of the Knight Foundation, are to announce the initiative today in New York, with Carnegie pledging $2.4 million for the first two years and Knight pledging $1.7 million for the first two years.
 Mr. Gregorian said the presidents of all five universities had pledged to support the initiative both institutionally and financially for its third year, assuming it met certain benchmarks of success in the first two years.
 ''This is not just another grant,'' Mr. Gregorian said. ''It is a vision for what journalism schools can become when they are clearly part of a university president's priorities.'' He said journalism schools were doing their best, ''but their best is not good enough in this complex day and age.''
 The money will be used for three main purposes: to develop national investigative reporting projects that would hire the best students and be written or broadcast in collaboration with major news organizations; to create a media policy task force at the Shorenstein Center to conduct research and coordinate the views and voices of the deans and university presidents in debates over media issues; and to develop more innovative curriculums by pairing journalists with scientists, historians, economists and other scholars on their campuses.
 To get the national reporting project off the ground, an ''incubator'' program has been set up for this summer at ABC News, where 10 students, two from each of the schools, will help produce a program about the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 In subsequent years, the ''incubator'' program, to be called ''News 21'' for the 21st century and the perspective of people under 21, will be based at each campus. A national manager will coordinate the student reporting and work with national news outlets to get the projects on the air, in print or online.
 While journalists have long debated the value of journalism schools, Mr. Schell, who did not attend journalism school, said he now thought such institutions were more vital than they might have been in the past.
 ''Things have changed substantially since we came up the journalistic food chain,'' he said. ''As news cycles have gotten faster and more bottom-line driven, there has been less inclination and capacity in media outlets to train, mentor and guide upcoming generations.'' 
 Mr. Carter said more people were becoming journalists by way of journalism school than ''through any other portal.'' But journalism programs are insufficient, he said, in preparing students for the real world. 
 ''Virtually everything in journalism is, at the moment, insufficient and in a state of flux,'' he said. ''Basic principles do not change, but the environment in which they must be applied is changing radically. So should the education of those who must work within that environment.''

HEADLINE: Dueling Pasts Shape G.O.P. Race in New Jersey

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: WEST WINDSOR, N.J., May 25 

 BODY:
They were both Republican mayors who took office as development was beginning to explode in their communities. But beyond that, Bret Schundler and Douglas R. Forrester, the leading candidates in the Republican primary for governor in New Jersey, have about as much in common as a skyline and a subdivision.
 Mr. Schundler was a political maverick from Wall Street who brought a burst of energy and conservative ideas to the state's second-largest city, Jersey City, in 1992. In his nine years as mayor, he slashed the city payroll and built charter schools. He persuaded investment firms from Manhattan's financial district to build gleaming office towers on the city's Gold Coast, and he patched chronic budget gaps with novel, often controversial, financing.
 Mr. Forrester was the imperturbable insider, chosen as mayor of the tiny township of West Windsor by Republican committeemen in 1981. Serving two single-year terms, he used a municipal tax increase to pay for a sewer-line project and other improvements to the infrastructure, allowing West Windsor to triple its population and grow from a sleepy rural outpost to a quiet bedroom community bordered by the busy Route 1 corridor. 
 As the June 7 primary nears, those records have become a major focus, allowing each candidate to use selective memory and artfully chosen facts to trumpet his own successes and magnify his rival's missteps.
 Four of the other candidates have served as legislators on the county or state level, and a fifth, Steve Lonegan, is mayor of Bogota. But Mr. Schundler and Mr. Forrester are the only ones polling above 5 percent, so the skirmish over their tenures as mayors has dominated the race.
 An examination of their mayoral legacies -- gleaned from public records and interviews with political analysts and elected officials who served alongside them -- provides a far more nuanced and favorable assessment than the heated campaign language. And a review of their different approaches to the job gives insights into the style of leadership that each could bring to the governor's office.
 ''It's really a vivid contrast,'' said Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers. ''Schundler is inspirational, and Forrester is managerial.''
 But listening to the claims from both sides, it would be easy to assume that each man left behind a morass of cronyism, tax increases and debt. 
 Mr. Forrester has spent millions on fliers, radio spots and television ads that portray Mr. Schundler as a smooth-talking sharp who introduced an onerous payroll tax and showered municipal contracts on the same developers who larded his campaign coffers.
 Mr. Schundler has turned his criticism of Mr. Forrester's record into a statistical mantra, saying that he doubled West Windsor's spending, tripled its property taxes and increased debt sixfold.
 Outside the crucible of the campaign, however, even some politicians who fought against the men when they were mayors now praise their performance.
 By almost any measure, Mr. Schundler was seen as flashier. An energetic, impatient iconoclast, he swept into office in 1993 at the age of 34 -- the first Republican elected mayor of Jersey City since World War I -- and began transforming its stultified and corrupt bureaucracy.
 He helped close a budget gap by packaging the city's property tax liens and selling them to investors. And he cashed in on the soaring high-tech stock market bubble of the 1990's, using a blend of tax abatements and salesmanship to lure investment firms from Manhattan across the Hudson, adding thousands of jobs to the local economy.
 Mr. Schundler's initial success made him such a darling among conservatives that in the mid-1990's, the Republican National Committee featured him on a brochure with Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.
 But Mr. Schundler found it difficult to maintain the momentum. His reliance on one-time revenue enhancers to balance the city's budget raised skepticism among bond agencies. And some of these deals had hidden costs to Jersey City residents, like the city's 1997 sale of an athletic field to the school system, which had to borrow $9 million to pay for it.
 By the time he left office, property tax rates were 19 percent higher than when he arrived nine years earlier. But Mr. Schundler points out that the total amount of property taxes collected by the city actually fell during his tenure, and, when adjusted for inflation, property tax rates dropped 6 percent.
 ''Bret brings a great deal of intensity, intellectual rigor and passion to the things he believes,'' said Michael P. Torpey, a lobbyist who was Gov. Christie Whitman's chief of staff. ''Sometimes that rubs people the wrong way. But he does manage to get a lot done.''
 Whereas Mr. Schundler inherited a fiscal crisis in Jersey City, Mr. Forrester began his tenure in West Windsor government facing a public health crisis.
 He was elected a committeeman in 1979, at age 26, just as the residents of West Windsor, a sparsely populated community of farms and scattered homes, were experiencing widespread problems with leaky septic tanks. Mr. Forrester voted to finance a costly sewer system. By the time he was appointed mayor two years later, cost overruns had raised the price of the project, and Mr. Forrester and the Township Committee had increased property taxes from 38 cents per $100 of assessed value in 1979 to $1.19 in 1982.
 Democrats in West Windsor acknowledge that the sewer system was necessary and higher property taxes inevitable. But they fault Mr. Forrester and the Township Committee for resisting ideas from outsiders and failing to stand up to the developers, many of whom were Republicans.
 As a result, said Michael J. Mastro, a Democrat who ran against Mr. Forrester, West Windsor turned into a patchwork of subdivisions and office parks with little cohesiveness and an amorphous identity.
 With polls showing that voters' top concern is New Jersey's high property taxes, it is no surprise that Mr. Schundler and Mr. Forrester have chosen to attack each other's tax record. But some of those claims are misleading or unsubstantiated.
 Mr. Schundler is accurate when he says that Mr. Forrester raised property taxes, doubled his own salary and increased spending apart from the cost of the sewer project.
 But the Schundler campaign rarely mentions several facts that ease the sting of those charges. Mr. Forrester's salary increased to $2,400 from $1,200 a year. And the higher administrative spending in West Windsor, Democrats acknowledge, was devoted to coping with the rapid growth of the town, not to the kind of payroll padding Mr. Schundler encountered in Jersey City.
 Mr. Forrester's advertisements also rely on insinuation, particularly in a commercial calling Mr. Schundler's administration a shameful example of New Jersey's ''pay to play'' system. While it is true that Mr. Schundler received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from contractors, there is no evidence that he steered contracts to donors.
 Both sides appear to take liberties with the facts surrounding Mr. Schundler's involvement in the payroll tax plan in Jersey City. Mr. Forrester's campaign has at times described the proposal as a tax on workers' incomes and left the impression that it has become a permanent burden. In reality, it was a 1 percent tax levied on corporate payrolls and was struck down by the courts after three months.
 Mr. Schundler, meanwhile, has portrayed himself as a reluctant proponent of the idea, saying that he supported it only because Democrats had a veto-proof majority and were determined to approve the tax. That description is at odds with news reports of the time and the recollection of business leaders and elected officials who said that Mr. Schundler advocated the payroll tax as the only alternative to a property tax increase.
 With all the dueling sound bites and provocative ads, some political analysts say that voters are being left to make their assessments based on subjective instinct. 
 ''While you would never want to say this during a campaign,'' said Ingrid Reed, a professor of political science at Rutgers, ''they also proved that when they had to make tough choices, they did, and pushed for judicious increases in taxes that would make a contribution to their communities.''

HEADLINE: The Farm-Subsidy Model of Financing Academia

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger. 
Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu

 BODY:
THE University of Michigan received $4 million for curriculum development and training at its Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy. Marshall University in West Virginia received $11 million for a new heart institute. The University of Iowa is hoping to get $16.5 million from a pending highway bill to study taxation of drivers based on miles driven on certain types of highways. 
 These are just three of thousands of examples of recent ''academic earmarks,'' provisions inserted into federal spending bills to finance specific university projects, like research, or the construction of classrooms and laboratories. 
 Increasingly, universities are being financed like farmers and military contractors, with legislative earmarks. According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, there were 1,964 earmarks to 716 academic institutions costing a total of $2 billion in the 2003 fiscal year, or just over 10 percent of the federal money spent on academic research. From 1996 to 2003, the amount spent on academic earmarks grew at an astounding rate of 31 percent a year, after adjusting for inflation. 
 Earmarks contrast with the way the government finances most university projects, which is through open competitions for grants. In these competitions, agencies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health review grant applications, often consulting with outside experts, and base awards on the applications' perceived merit. Earmarks are decided by a political process, without external peer review. 
 As academic earmarks have grown, so have universities' lobbying expenditures. Spending on lobbying jumped to $62 million in 2003 from $23 million in 1998, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
 A study by John M. de Figueiredo of the University of California, Los Angeles and Brian S. Silverman of the University of Toronto, which will soon be published in The Journal of Law and Economics, finds that universities receive a high return on their lobbying dollars. The researchers related the amount each university received in earmarks to its lobbying expenditures from 1997 to 1999, and other factors. 
 Studying earmarks in the academic sector has important advantages. First, unlike for-profit corporations, universities that get tax-exempt donations are prohibited from forming political action committees, which give money to candidates and political parties. Consequently, the pure effect of lobbying can be isolated.
 Second, most universities' lobbying efforts are directed at attracting earmarks as opposed to seeking legislative changes. 
 Third, for largely idiosyncratic reasons, some universities have stronger incentives to lobby for earmarks than others because they receive more generous supplementary funds from the federal government on top of their grants. Those extra funds, known as overhead, can be used by universities to subsidize activities not directly supported by grants, like hiring administrators.
 Analyzing differences in lobbying expenditures stemming from differences in overhead rates with a statistical technique called ''instrumental variables,'' Professors de Figueiredo and Silverman found that a $1 increase in lobbying expenditures is associated with a $1.56 increase in earmarks for universities in districts that do not have a senator or congressman on the crucial Appropriations Committees, and more than a $4.50 gain in earmarks for universities with a representative on one of the Appropriations Committees. 
 Even among universities that do not lobby, those that have a congressman or senator on the Appropriations Committees tend to be awarded more earmarked funds.
 A university's fortunes also tend to rise or fall when senators from its state join or exit the Appropriations Committee. For example, the year after Senator Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, a member of the committee, was defeated by John Edwards, who did not become a member, earmarks to universities in North Carolina fell by half.
 Unlike lobbying efforts and political factors, a university's academic standing, as measured by the National Academy of Science's ranking of departments, is not related to the amount of earmarked funds it receives.
 A. Abigail Payne, an economist at McMaster University in Canada, has studied how earmarks affect the quantity and quality of academic research, inferring quality from the number of times research studies are cited by subsequent studies. She concludes that ''earmarked funding may increase the quantity of publications but decrease the quality of the publications and the performance of earmarked funding is lower than that from using peer-reviewed funding.'' 
 Indications are that academic earmarks crowd out spending on competitive peer-reviewed grants, at least in the short run. 
 The competitive merit-based system that has financed most academic research since World War II is probably one reason the United States has been pre-eminent in science and higher education. If academic earmarks continue to grow at an exponential rate, this system could be in jeopardy. 
 Slowing the growth of academic earmarks would require a concerted effort by American universities to shun the practice, or a new consensus in Congress to finance academic research only through the competitive merit-based process. The Association of American Universities, a group of 62 elite research universities, is currently re-examining its position on earmarks, and could send a strong signal by unequivocally rejecting the practice.

HEADLINE: 15 Years on the Bottom Rung

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
In the dark before dawn, when Madison Avenue was all but deserted and its pricey boutiques were still locked up tight, several Mexicans slipped quietly into 3 Guys, a restaurant that the Zagat guide once called ''the most expensive coffee shop in New York.'' 
 For the next 10 hours they would fry eggs, grill burgers, pour coffee and wash dishes for a stream of customers from the Upper East Side of Manhattan. By 7:35 a.m., Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York, was holding a power breakfast back near the polished granite counter. In the same burgundy booth a few hours later, Michael A. Wiener, co-founder of the multibillion-dollar Infinity Broadcasting, grabbed a bite with his wife, Zena. Just the day before, Uma Thurman slipped in for a quiet lunch with her children, but the paparazzi found her and she left.
 More Mexicans filed in to begin their shifts throughout the morning, and by the time John Zannikos, one of the restaurant's three Greek owners, drove in from the North Jersey suburbs to work the lunch crowd, Madison Avenue was buzzing. So was 3 Guys. 
 ''You got to wait a little bit,'' Mr. Zannikos said to a pride of elegant women who had spent the morning at the Whitney Museum of American Art, across Madison Avenue at 75th Street. For an illiterate immigrant who came to New York years ago with nothing but $100 in his pocket and a willingness to work etched on his heart, could any words have been sweeter to say? 
 With its wealthy clientele, middle-class owners and low-income work force, 3 Guys is a template of the class divisions in America. But it is also the setting for two starkly different tales about breaching those divides. 
 The familiar story is Mr. Zannikos's. For him, the restaurant -- don't dare call it a diner -- with its $20 salads and elegant decor represents the American promise of upward mobility, one that has been fulfilled countless times for generations of hard-working immigrants. 
 But for Juan Manuel Peralta, a 34-year-old illegal immigrant who worked there for five years until he was fired last May, and for many of the other illegal Mexican immigrants in the back, restaurant work today is more like a dead end. They are finding the American dream of moving up far more elusive than it was for Mr. Zannikos. Despite his efforts to help them, they risk becoming stuck in a permanent underclass of the poor, the unskilled and the uneducated.
 That is not to suggest that the nearly five million Mexicans who, like Mr. Peralta, are living in the United States illegally will never emerge from the shadows. Many have, and undoubtedly many more will. But the sheer size of the influx -- over 400,000 a year, with no end in sight -- creates a problem all its own. It means there is an ever-growing pool of interchangeable workers, many of them shunting from one low-paying job to another. If one moves on, another one -- or maybe two or three -- is there to take his place. 
 Although Mr. Peralta arrived in New York almost 40 years after Mr. Zannikos, the two share a remarkably similar beginning. They came at the same age to the same section of New York City, without legal papers or more than a few words of English. Each dreamed of a better life. But monumental changes in the economy and in attitudes toward immigrants have made it far less likely that Mr. Peralta and his children will experience the same upward mobility as Mr. Zannikos and his family.
 Of course, there is a chance that Mr. Peralta may yet take his place among the Mexican-Americans who have succeeded here. He realizes that he will probably not do as well as the few who have risen to high office or who were able to buy the vineyards where their grandfathers once picked grapes. But he still dreams that his children will someday join the millions who have lost their accents, gotten good educations and firmly achieved the American dream. 
 Political scientists are divided over whether the 25 million people of Mexican ancestry in the United States represent an exception to the classic immigrant success story. Some, like John H. Mollenkopf at the City University of New York, are convinced that Mexicans will eventually do as well as the Greeks, Italians and other Europeans of the last century who were usually well assimilated after two or three generations. Others, including Mexican-Americans like Rodolfo O. de la Garza, a professor at Columbia, have done studies showing that Mexican-Americans face so many obstacles that even the fourth generation trails other Americans in education, home ownership and household income.
 The situation is even worse for the millions more who have illegally entered the United States since 1990. Spread out in scores of cities far beyond the Southwest, they find jobs plentiful but advancement difficult. President Vicente Fox of Mexico was forced to apologize this month for declaring publicly what many Mexicans say they feel, that the illegal immigrants ''are doing the work that not even blacks want to do in the United States.'' Resentment and race subtly stand in their way, as does a lingering attachment to Mexico, which is so close that many immigrants do not put down deep roots here. They say they plan to stay only long enough to make some money and then go back home. Few ever do. 
 But the biggest obstacle is their illegal status. With few routes open to become legal, they remain, like Mr. Peralta, without rights, without security and without a clear path to a better future.
 ''It's worrisome,'' said Richard Alba, a sociologist at the State University of New York, Albany, who studies the assimilation and class mobility of contemporary immigrants, ''and I don't see much reason to believe this will change.'' 
 Little has changed for Mr. Peralta, a cook who has worked at menial jobs in the United States for the last 15 years. Though he makes more than he ever dreamed of in Mexico, his life is anything but middle class and setbacks are routine. Still, he has not given up hope. Querer es poder, he sometimes says: Want something badly enough and you will get it.
 But desire may not be enough anymore. That is what concerns Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico's consul general in New York. Mr. Sarukhan recently took an urgent call from New York's police commissioner about an increase in gang activity among young Mexican men, a sign that they were moving into the underside of American life. Of all immigrants in New York City, officials say, Mexicans are the poorest, least educated and least likely to speak English. 
 The failure or success of this generation of Mexicans in the United States will determine the place that Mexicans will hold here in years to come, Mr. Sarukhan said, and the outlook is not encouraging.
 ''They will be better off than they could ever have been in Mexico,'' he said, ''but I don't think that's going to be enough to prevent them from becoming an underclass in New York.''

Different Results
 There is a break in the middle of the day at 3 Guys, after the lunchtime limousines leave and before the private schools let out. That was when Mr. Zannikos asked the Mexican cook who replaced Mr. Peralta to prepare some lunch for him. Then Mr. Zannikos carried the chicken breast on pita to the last table in the restaurant.
 ''My life story is a good story, a lot of success,'' he said, his accent still heavy. He was just a teenager when he left the Greek island of Chios, a few miles off the coast of Turkey. World War II had just ended, and Greece was in ruins. ''There was only rich and poor, that's it,'' Mr. Zannikos said. ''There was no middle class like you have here.'' He is 70 now, with short gray hair and soft eyes that can water at a mention of the past. 
 Because of the war, he said, he never got past the second grade, never learned to read or write. He signed on as a merchant seaman, and in 1953, when he was 19, his ship docked at Norfolk, Va. He went ashore one Saturday with no intention of ever returning to Greece. He left behind everything, including his travel documents. All he had in his pockets was $100 and the address of his mother's cousin in the Jackson Heights-Corona section of Queens.
 Almost four decades later, Mr. Peralta underwent a similar rite of passage out of Mexico. He had finished the eighth grade in the poor southern state of Guerrero and saw nothing in his future there but fixing flat tires. His father, Inocencio, had once dreamed of going to the United States, but never had the money. In 1990, he borrowed enough to give his first-born son a chance. 
 Mr. Peralta was 19 when he boarded a smoky bus that carried him through the deserted hills of Guerrero and kept going until it reached the edge of Mexico. With eight other Mexicans he did not know, he crawled through a sewer tunnel that started in Tijuana and ended on the other side of the border, in what Mexicans call el Norte. 
 He had carried no documents, no photographs and no money, except what his father gave him to pay his shifty guide and to buy an airline ticket to New York. Deep in a pocket was the address of an uncle in the same section of Queens where Mr. Zannikos had gotten his start. By 1990, the area had gone from largely Greek to mostly Latino.
 Starting over in the same working-class neighborhood, Mr. Peralta and Mr. Zannikos quickly learned that New York was full of opportunities and obstacles, often in equal measure. 
 On his first day there, Mr. Zannikos, scared and feeling lost, found the building he was looking for, but his mother's cousin had moved. He had no idea what to do until a Greek man passed by. Walk five blocks to the Deluxe Diner, the man said. He did. 
 The diner was full of Greek housepainters, including one who knew Mr. Zannikos's father. On the spot, they offered him a job painting closets, where his mistakes would be hidden. He painted until the weather turned cold. Another Greek hired him as a dishwasher at his coffee shop in the Bronx. 
 It was not easy, but Mr. Zannikos worked his way up to short-order cook, learning English as he went along. In 1956, immigration officials raided the coffee shop. He was deported, but after a short while he managed to sneak back into the country. Three years later he married a Puerto Rican from the Bronx. The marriage lasted only a year, but it put him on the road to becoming a citizen. Now he could buy his own restaurant, a greasy spoon in the South Bronx that catered to a late-night clientele of prostitutes and undercover police officers. 
 Since then, he has bought and sold more than a dozen New York diners, but none have been more successful than the original 3 Guys, which opened in 1978. He and his partners own two other restaurants with the same name farther up Madison Avenue, but they have never replicated the high-end appeal of the original.
 ''When employees come in I teach them, 'Hey, this is a different neighborhood,''' Mr. Zannikos said. What may be standard in some other diners is not tolerated here. There are no Greek flags or tourism posters. There is no television or twirling tower of cakes with cream pompadours. Waiters are forbidden to chew gum. No customer is ever called ''Honey.'' 
 ''They know their place and I know my place,'' Mr. Zannikos said of his customers. ''It's as simple as that.'' 
 His place in society now is a far cry from his days in the Bronx. He and his second wife, June, live in Wyckoff, a New Jersey suburb where he pampers fig trees and dutifully looks after a bird feeder shaped like the Parthenon. They own a condominium in Florida. His three children all went far beyond his second-grade education, finishing high school or attending college. 
 They have all done well, as has Mr. Zannikos, who says he makes about $130,000 a year. He says he is not sensitive to class distinctions, but he admits he was bothered when some people mistook him for the caterer at fund-raising dinners for the local Greek church he helped build. 
 All in all, he thinks immigrants today have a better chance of moving up the class ladder than he did 50 years ago. 
 ''At that time, no bank would give us any money, but today they give you credit cards in the mail,'' he said. ''New York still gives you more opportunity that any other place. If you want to do things, you will.''
 He says he has done well, and he is content with his station in life. ''I'm in the middle and I'm happy.''

A Divisive Issue
 Mr. Peralta cannot guess what class Mr. Zannikos belongs to. But he is certain that it is much tougher for an immigrant to get ahead today than 50 years ago. And he has no doubt about his own class.
 ''La pobreza,'' he says. ''Poverty.'' 
 It was not what he expected when he boarded the bus to the border, but it did not take long for him to realize that success in the United States required more than hard work. ''A lot of it has to do with luck,'' he said during a lunch break on a stoop around the corner from the Queens diner where he went to work after 3 Guys.
 ''People come here, and in no more than a year or two they can buy their own house and have a car,'' Mr. Peralta said. ''Me, I've been here 15 years, and if I die tomorrow, there wouldn't even be enough money to bury me.'' 
 In 1990, Mr. Peralta was in the vanguard of Mexican immigrants who bypassed the traditional barrios in border states to work in far-flung cities like Denver and New York. The 2000 census counted 186,872 Mexicans in New York, triple the 1990 figure, and there are undoubtedly many more today. The Mexican consulate, which serves the metropolitan region, has issued more than 500,000 ID cards just since 2001. 
 Fifty years ago, illegal immigration was a minor problem. Now it is a divisive national issue, pitting those who welcome cheap labor against those with concerns about border security and the cost of providing social services. Though newly arrived Mexicans often work in industries that rely on cheap labor, like restaurants and construction, they rarely organize. Most are desperate to stay out of sight.
 Mr. Peralta hooked up with his uncle the morning he arrived in New York. He did not work for weeks until the bakery where the uncle worked had an opening, a part-time job making muffins. He took it, though he didn't know muffins from crumb cake. When he saw that he would not make enough to repay his father, he took a second job making night deliveries for a Manhattan diner. By the end of his first day he was so lost he had to spend all his tip money on a cab ride home.
 He quit the diner, but working there even briefly opened his eyes to how easy it could be to make money in New York. Diners were everywhere, and so were jobs making deliveries, washing dishes or busing tables. In six months, Mr. Peralta had paid back the money his father gave him. He bounced from job to job and in 1995, eager to show off his newfound success, he went back to Mexico with his pockets full of money, and he married. He was 25 then, the same age at which Mr. Zannikos married. But the similarities end there. 
 When Mr. Zannikos jumped ship, he left Greece behind for good. Though he himself had no documents, the compatriots he encountered on his first days were here legally, like most other Greek immigrants, and could help him. Greeks had never come to the United States in large numbers -- the 2000 census counted only 29,805 New Yorkers born in Greece -- but they tended to settle in just a few areas, like the Astoria section of Queens, which became cohesive communities ready to help new arrivals. 
 Mr. Peralta, like many other Mexicans, is trying to make it on his own and has never severed his emotional or financial ties to home. After five years in New York's Latino community, he spoke little English and owned little more than the clothes on his back. He decided to return to Huamuxtitlan (pronounced wa-moosh-teet-LAHN), the dusty village beneath a flat-topped mountain where he was born.
 ''People thought that since I was coming back from el Norte, I would be so rich that I could spread money around,'' he said. Still, he felt privileged: his New York wages dwarfed the $1,000 a year he might have made in Mexico. 
 He met a shy, pretty girl named Matilde in Huamuxtitlan, married her and returned with her to New York, again illegally, all in a matter of weeks. Their first child was born in 1996. Mr. Peralta soon found that supporting a family made it harder to save money. Then, in 1999, he got the job at 3 Guys. 
 ''Barba Yanni helped me learn how to prepare things the way customers like them,'' Mr. Peralta said, referring to Mr. Zannikos with a Greek title of respect that means Uncle John. 
 The restaurant became his school. He learned how to saute a fish so that it looked like a work of art. The three partners lent him money and said they would help him get immigration documents. The pay was good.
 But there were tensions with the other workers. Instead of hanging their orders on a rack, the waiters shouted them out, in Greek, Spanish and a kind of fractured English. Sometimes Mr. Peralta did not understand, and they argued. Soon he was known as a hothead. 
 Still, he worked hard, and every night he returned to his growing family. Matilde, now 27, cleaned houses until the second child, Heidi, was born three years ago. Now she tries to sell Mary Kay products to other mothers at Public School 12, which their son, Antony, 8, attends. 
 Most weeks, Mr. Peralta could make as much as $600. Over the course of a year that could come to over $30,000, enough to approach the lower middle class. But the life he leads is far from that and uncertainty hovers over everything about his life, starting with his paycheck. 
 To earn $600, he has to work at least 10 hours a day, six days a week, and that does not happen every week. Sometimes he is paid overtime for the extra hours, sometimes not. And, as he found out in May, he can be fired at any time and bring in nothing, not even unemployment, until he lands another job. In 2004, he made about $24,000. 
 Because he is here illegally, Mr. Peralta can easily be exploited. He cannot file a complaint against his landlord for charging him $500 a month for a 9-foot-by-9-foot room in a Queens apartment that he shares with nine other Mexicans in three families who pay the remainder of the $2,000-a-month rent. All 13 share one bathroom, and the established pecking order means the Peraltas rarely get to use the kitchen. Eating out can be expensive.
 Because they were born in New York, Mr. Peralta's children are United States citizens, and their health care is generally covered by Medicaid. But he has to pay out of his pocket whenever he or his wife sees a doctor. And forget about going to the dentist. 
 As many other Mexicans do, he wires money home, and it costs him $7 for every $100 he sends. When his uncle, his nephew and his sister asked him for money, he was expected to lend it. No one has paid him back. He has middle-class ornaments, like a cellphone and a DVD player, but no driver's license or Social Security card. 
 He is the first to admit that he has vices that have held him back; nothing criminal, but he tends to lose his temper and there are nights when he likes to have a drink or two. His greatest weakness is instant lottery tickets, what he calls ''los scratch,'' and he sheepishly confesses that he can squander as much as $75 a week on them. It is a way of preserving hope, he said. Once he won $100. He bought a blender.
 Years ago, he and Matilde were so confident they would make it in America that when their son was born they used the American spelling of his name, Anthony, figuring it would help pave his passage into the mainstream. But even that effort failed.
 ''Look at this,'' his wife said one afternoon as she sat on the floor of their room near a picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Mr. Peralta sat on a small plastic stool in the doorway, listening. His mattress was stacked against the wall. A roll of toilet paper was stashed nearby because they dared not leave it in the shared bathroom for someone else to use. 
 She took her pocketbook and pulled out a clear plastic case holding her son's baptismal certificate, on which his name is spelled with an ''H.'' But then she unfolded his birth certificate, where the ''H'' is missing. 
 ''The teachers won't teach him to spell his name the right way until the certificate is legally changed,'' she said. ''But how can we do that if we're not legal?''

Progress, but Not Success
 An elevated subway train thundered overhead, making the afternoon light along Roosevelt Avenue blink like a failing fluorescent bulb. Mr. Peralta's daughter and son grabbed his fat hands as they ran some errands. He had just finished a 10-hour shift, eggs over easy and cheeseburgers since 5 a.m. It had been especially hard to stand the monotony that day. He kept thinking about what was going on in Mexico, where it was the feast day of Our Lady of the Rosary. And, oh, what a feast there was -- sweets and handmade tamales, a parade, even a bullfight. At night, fireworks, bursting loud and bright against the green folds of the mountains. Paid for, in part, by the money he sends home.
 But instead of partying, he was walking his children to the Arab supermarket on Roosevelt Avenue to buy packages of chicken and spare ribs, and hoping to get to use the kitchen. And though he knew better, he grabbed a package of pink and white marshmallows for the children. He needed to buy tortillas, too, but not there. A Korean convenience store a few blocks away sells La Maizteca tortillas, made in New York. 
 The swirl of immigrants in Mr. Peralta's neighborhood is part of the fabric of New York, just as it was in 1953, when Mr. Zannikos arrived. But most immigrants then were Europeans, and though they spoke different languages, their Caucasian features helped them blend into New York's middle class.
 Experts remain divided over whether Mexicans can follow the same route. Samuel P. Huntington, a Harvard professor of government, takes the extreme view that Mexicans will not assimilate and that the separate culture they are developing threatens the United States. 
 Most others believe that recent Mexican immigrants will eventually take their place in society, and perhaps someday muster political clout commensurate with their numbers, though significant impediments are slowing their progress. Francisco Rivera-Batiz, a Columbia University economics professor, says that prejudice remains a problem, that factory jobs have all but disappeared, and that there is a growing gap between the educational demands of the economy and the limited schooling that the newest Mexicans have when they arrive.
 But the biggest obstacle by far, and the one that separates newly arrived Mexicans from Greeks, Italians and most other immigrants -- including earlier generations of Mexicans -- is their illegal status. Professor Rivera-Batiz studied what happened to illegal Mexican immigrants who became legal after the last national amnesty in 1986. Within a few years, their incomes rose 20 percent and their English improved greatly. 
 ''Legalization,'' he said, ''helped them tremendously.'' 
 Although the Bush administration is again talking about legalizing some Mexicans with a guest worker program, there is opposition to another amnesty, and the number of Mexicans illegally living in the United States continues to soar. Desperate to get their papers any way they can, many turn to shady storefront legal offices. Like Mr. Peralta, they sign on to illusory schemes that cost hundreds of dollars but almost never produce the promised green cards. 
 Until the 1980's, Mexican immigration was largely seasonal and mostly limited to agricultural workers. But then economic chaos in Mexico sent a flood of immigrants northward, many of them poorly educated farmers from the impoverished countryside. Tighter security on the border made it harder for Mexicans to move back and forth in the traditional way, so they tended to stay here, searching for low-paying unskilled jobs and concentrating in barrios where Spanish, constantly replenished, never loses its immediacy. 
 ''Cuidado!'' Mr. Peralta shouted when Antony carelessly stepped into Roosevelt Avenue without looking. Although the boy is taught in English at school, he rarely uses anything but Spanish at home. 
 Even now, after 15 years in New York, Mr. Peralta speaks little English. He tried English classes once, but could not get his mind to accept the new sounds. So he dropped it, and has stuck with only Spanish, which he concedes is ''the language of busboys'' in New York. But as long as he stays in his neighborhood, it is all he needs. 
 It was late afternoon by the time Mr. Peralta and his children headed home. The run-down house, the overheated room, the stacked mattress and the hoarded toilet paper -- all remind him how far he would have to go to achieve a success like Mr. Zannikos's.
 Still, he says, he has done far better than he could ever have done in Mexico. He realizes that the money he sends to his family there is not enough to satisfy his father, who built stairs for a second floor of his house made of concrete blocks in Huamuxtitlan, even though there is no second floor. He believes Manuel has made it big in New York and he is waiting for money from America to complete the upstairs.
 Manuel has never told him the truth about his life up north. He said his father's images of America came from another era. The older man does not know how tough it is to be a Mexican immigrant in the United States now, tougher than any young man who ever left Huamuxtitlan would admit. Everything built up over 15 years here can come apart as easily as an adobe house in an earthquake. And then it is time to start over, again.

A Conflict Erupts
 It was the end of another busy lunch at 3 Guys in late spring 2003. Mr. Peralta made himself a turkey sandwich and took a seat at a rear table. The Mexican countermen, dishwashers and busboys also started their breaks, while the Greek waiters took care of the last few diners. 
 It is not clear how the argument started. But a cross word passed between a Greek waiter and a Mexican busboy. Voices were raised. The waiter swung at the busboy, catching him behind the ear. Mr. Peralta froze. So did the other Mexicans. 
 Even from the front of the restaurant, where he was watching the cash register, Mr. Zannikos realized something was wrong and rushed back to break it up. ''I stood between them, held one and pushed the other away,'' he said. ''I told them: 'You don't do that here. Never do that here.''' 
 Mr. Zannikos said he did not care who started it. He ordered both the busboy and the waiter, a partner's nephew, to get out. 
 But several Mexicans, including Mr. Peralta, said that they saw Mr. Zannikos grab the busboy by the head and that they believed he would have hit him if another Mexican had not stepped between them. That infuriated them because they felt he had sided with the Greek without knowing who was at fault. 
 Mr. Zannikos said that was not true, but in the end it did not matter. The easygoing atmosphere at the restaurant changed. ''Everybody was a little cool,'' Mr. Zannikos recalled.
 What he did not know then was that the Mexicans had reached out to the Restaurant Opportunities Center, a workers' rights group. Eventually six of them, including Mr. Peralta, cooperated with the group. He did so reluctantly, he said, because he was afraid that if the owners found out, they would no longer help him get his immigration papers. The labor group promised that the owners would never know. 
 The owners saw it as an effort to shake them down, but for the Mexicans it became a class struggle pitting powerless workers against hard-hearted owners.
 Their grievances went beyond the scuffle. They complained that with just one exception, only Greeks became waiters at 3 Guys. They challenged the sole Mexican waiter, Salomon Paniagua, a former Mexican army officer who, everyone agreed, looked Greek, to stand with them. 
 But on the day the labor group picketed the restaurant, Mr. Paniagua refused to put down his order pad. A handful of demonstrators carried signs on Madison Avenue for a short while before Mr. Zannikos and his partners reluctantly agreed to settle. 
 Mr. Zannikos said he felt betrayed. ''When I see these guys, I see myself when I started, and I always try to help them,'' he said. ''I didn't do anything wrong.'' 
 The busboy and the Mexican who intervened were paid several thousand dollars and the owners promised to promote a current Mexican employee to waiter within a month. But that did not end the turmoil. 
 Fearing that the other Mexicans might try to get back at him, Mr. Paniagua decided to strike out on his own. After asking Mr. Zannikos for advice, he bought a one-third share of a Greek diner in Jamaica, Queens. He said he put it in his father's name because the older man had become a legal resident after the 1986 amnesty. 
 After Mr. Paniagua left, 3 Guys went without a single Mexican waiter for 10 months, despite the terms of the settlement. In March, an eager Mexican busboy with a heavy accent who had worked there for four years got a chance to wear a waiter's tie.
 Mr. Peralta ended up having to leave 3 Guys around the same time as Mr. Paniagua. Mr. Zannikos's partners suspected he had sided with the labor group, he said, and started to criticize his work unfairly. Then they cut back his schedule to five days a week. After he hurt his ankle playing soccer, they told him to go home until he was better. When Mr. Peralta came back to work about two weeks later, he was fired. 
 Mr. Zannikos confirms part of the account but says the firing had nothing to do with the scuffle or the ensuing dispute. ''If he was good, believe me, he wouldn't get fired,'' he said of Mr. Peralta.
 Mr. Peralta shrugged when told what Mr. Zannikos said. ''I know my own work and I know what I can do,'' he said. ''There are a lot of restaurants in New York, and a lot of workers.''
 When 3 Guys fired Mr. Peralta, another Mexican replaced him, just as Mr. Peralta replaced a Mexican at the Greek diner in Queens where he went to work next. 
 This time, though, there was no Madison Avenue address, no elaborate menu of New Zealand mussels or designer mushrooms. In the Queens diner a bowl of soup with a buttered roll cost $2, all day. If he fried burgers and scraped fat off the big grill for 10 hours a day, six days a week, he might earn about as much as he did on Madison Avenue, at least for a week. 
 His schedule kept changing. Sometimes he worked the lunch and dinner shift, and by the end of the night he was worn out, especially since he often found himself arguing with the Greek owner. But he did not look forward to going home. So after the night manager lowered the security gate, Mr. Peralta would wander the streets. 
 One of those nights he stopped at a phone center off Roosevelt Avenue to call his mother. ''Everything's O.K.,'' he told her. He asked how she had spent the last $100 he sent, and whether she needed anything else. There is always need in Huamuxtitlan. 
 Still restless, he went to the Scorpion, a shot-and-beer joint open till 4 a.m. He sat at the long bar nursing vodkas with cranberry juice, glancing at the soccer match on TV and the busty Brazilian bartender who spoke only a little Spanish. When it was nearly 11 p.m., he called it a night. 
 Back home, he quietly opened the door to his room. The lights were off, the television murmuring. His family was asleep in the bunk bed that the store had now threatened to repossess. Antony was curled up on the top, Matilde and Heidi cuddled in the bottom. Mr. Peralta moved the plastic stool out of the way and dropped his mattress to the floor. 
 The children did not stir. His wife's eyes fluttered, but she said nothing. Mr. Peralta looked over his family, his home. 
 ''This,'' he said, ''is my life in New York.'' 
 Not the life he imagined, but his life. In early March, just after Heidi's third birthday, he quit his job at the Queens diner after yet another heated argument with the owner. In his mind, preserving his dignity is one of the few liberties he has left. 
 ''I'll get another job,'' he said while baby-sitting Heidi at home a few days later. The rent is already paid till the end of the month and he has friends, he said. People know him. To him, jobs are interchangeable -- just as he is to the jobs. If he cannot find work as a grillman, he will bus tables. Or wash dishes. If not at one diner, then at another.
 ''It's all the same,'' he said.
 It took about three weeks, but Mr. Peralta did find a new job as a grillman at another Greek diner in a different part of New York. His salary is roughly the same, the menu is roughly the same (one new item, Greek burritos, was a natural), and he sees his chance for a better future as being roughly the same as it has been since he got to America.

A Long Day Closes
 It was now dark again outside 3 Guys. About 9 p.m. Mr. Zannikos asked his Mexican cook for a small salmon steak, a little rare. It had been another busy 10-hour day for him, but a good one. Receipts from the morning alone exceeded what he needed to take in every day just to cover the $23,000 a month rent. 
 He finished the salmon quickly, left final instructions with the lone Greek waiter still on duty and said good night to everyone else. He put on his light tan corduroy jacket and the baseball cap he picked up in Florida. 
 ''Night,'' he said to the lone table of diners. 
 Outside, as Mr. Zannikos walked slowly down Madison Avenue, a self-made man comfortable with his own hard-won success, the bulkhead doors in front of 3 Guys clanked open. Faint voices speaking Spanish came from below. A young Mexican who started his shift 10 hours earlier climbed out with a bag of garbage and heaved it onto the sidewalk. New Zealand mussel shells. Uneaten bits of portobello mushrooms. The fine grounds of decaf cappuccino. 
 One black plastic bag after another came out until Madison Avenue in front of 3 Guys was piled high with trash. 
 ''Hurry up!'' the young man shouted to the other Mexicans. ''I want to go home, too.''

ABOUT THE SERIES

This article is the sixth part of a series examining the role of social class in America today. A team of reporters spent more than a year exploring ways that class -- defined as a combination of income, education, wealth and occupation -- influences destiny in a society that likes to think of itself as a land of unbounded opportunity.

Sunday: The New Markers of Status

HEADLINE: Broad Decline Ends Nasdaq's 8-Day Rally

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks declined yesterday as oil touched a two-week high and technology stocks faded after a profit warning from Network Appliance, ending the Nasdaq composite index's longest rally in five years.
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 45.88 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 10,457.80. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index decreased 4.06 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,190.01. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.50 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,050.12. 
 Oil prices, which had dropped last week and helped feed the rally in stocks, rose above $51 a barrel for the first time in two weeks. Light crude for July delivery rose $1.31, to $50.98 a barrel, after the United States government said oil inventories fell last week.
 Shares of blue-chip economically sensitive industrial companies were among the losers. Honeywell International, an aerospace and industrial conglomerate, slipped 64 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $36.63; 3M, the maker of products ranging from medical supplies to Post-it notes, fell $1.13, or 1.5 percent, to $77.06; and Caterpillar, a heavy-equipment maker, was down $1.36, or 1.5 percent, to $92.47.
 Technology shares were also off, with investors taking profits after the Nasdaq staged its longest rally since December 1999.
 ''I can't remember the last time Nasdaq had an eight-day rally, so the gravity is kind of falling'' on the sector, said Bryan Piskorowski, market analyst at Wachovia Securities in Richmond, Va.
 Cisco Systems slipped 1.9 percent, to $19.62; Marvell Technology, the chip maker, was down 2.2 percent, to $40.59; and Network Appliance was down 4.9 percent, to $28.92.
 In health care, shares of Boston Scientific, which makes heart stents, were off 3.7 percent after the company cut its 2005 profit outlook. Its shares slipped $1.14, to close at $29.46 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Oil company shares rallied, with Exxon Mobil up 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $55.68. Chevron was up 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $53.32.
 The American Stock Exchange index of 11 energy companies closed up 1 percent.
 In autos, shares of the ailing parts supplier Visteon surged after Ford Motor, a leading customer and Visteon's former parent company, said it would spend up to $1.15 billion to take on some of Visteon's unprofitable plants and up to 17,400 employees to help keep the company afloat.
 Visteon shares rose 90 cents, or 14.4 percent, to $7.17, and Ford lost 2 cents, to $9.96, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
 On the economic front, the Commerce Department said that new orders for durable goods jumped by 1.9 percent in April, a larger- than-expected increase. But excluding the volatile transportation category, orders for long-lasting products made in the United States, like washing machines and refrigerators, dropped unexpectedly by 0.2 percent. 
 Treasury prices fell on a wave of selling after a three-week rally failed to push benchmark yields below the 4 percent technical barrier, shifting market momentum in favor of bears.
 Solid demand in a $22 billion auction of two-year notes proved largely unable to stem the selling, as the many traders seized the opportunity to shed their bond holdings.
 The 10-year Treasury note declined 15/32, to a price of 100 10/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.09 percent from 4.03 percent on Tuesday.
 Here are the results of the two-year note auction:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
High Price: 99.780
High Yield: 3.615
Low Yield: 3.500
Median Yield: 3.598
Accepted at low price: 13%
Total applied for: $58,947,561
Accepted: $29,116,266
Noncompetitive: $973,328
Interest set at: 3 1/2

The two-year notes mature May 31, 2007.

HEADLINE: Student's Start-Up Draws Attention and $13 Million 

BYLINE: By ELLEN ROSEN

 BODY:
It is not easy capturing the attention of Jim Breyer, one of Silicon Valley's leading venture capitalists. But Mark Zuckerberg, a 21-year-old Harvard student, managed to do it with a Web site that has attracted 2.8 million registered users on more than 800 campuses since it began in February 2004. 
 Mr. Breyer was so taken with Mr. Zuckerberg's company, thefacebook.com, which creates online interactive college-student networks, that his firm, Accel Partners, plans to announce a $13 million investment in the start-up today.
 ''It is a business that has seen tremendous underlying, organic growth and the team itself is intellectually honest and breathtakingly brilliant in terms of understanding the college student experience,'' Mr. Breyer said. 
 Five years after the Internet bubble burst, a new generation of Web start-ups is quietly attracting investment capital. Thefacebook.com typifies the breed: a company that is built on substance rather than high expectations. While $13 million might seem paltry next to the free-flowing sums of the late 1990's, Mr. Breyer said it was a ''significant investment'' from Accel's new $400 million fund. 
 ''The first model was to raise a lot of venture money early on, even before we understood the consumer experience and knew the risks,'' Mr. Breyer said. Today, by contrast, his firm backs companies ''like thefacebook, which have built a deep relationship again and again with the customer.'' Social sites, as well as those involving music and video, are among those that are particularly attractive right now, he said. 
 Mr. Zuckerberg and his two roommates, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, started the venture in February 2004 as an online directory of all Harvard's students, a big step up from the photo books of incoming freshmen the school produced annually.
 The premise -- and the process -- were both simple: students wanting to join needed a current ''.edu'' e-mail address to register without fees. They could then supply a digital photo and create a profile of themselves. 
 They could view one another's profiles and, as the site spread to other campuses, those at other schools if they were accepted as a ''friend.'' Think of individual college directories connected by -- at most -- six degrees of separation. 
 (Thefacebook.com is not the first foray into a college site for Mr. Zuckerberg, a computer-sciences-turned-psychology major. As a prank in November 2003, he set up facemash.com, a site that ''popped up two students' photos and asked users to choose who was more attractive,'' he said. Harvard officials were not amused and they put him on probation. But the university's administration has not voiced any complaints with thefacebook.com, he said.)
 The three friends designed their site, Mr. Zuckerberg said, ''in such a way that if it was good, it could be introduced at other schools.'' It was an instant hit, and within one month Columbia, Stanford and Yale students could log on to sites at their schools. By June 2004, sites were available for about 30 campuses and 150,000 students were registered. (The colleges and universities themselves do not have any editorial or financial involvement.)
 Realizing they were onto something with big potential, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Moskovitz decided to spend last summer in Silicon Valley, where they had friends working as interns at established companies like Google. (Mr. Hughes joined them for the summer, but returned to Harvard to act as the company's media spokesman.)
 The two intend to return to Harvard in the fall and nurture their company slowly, Mr. Zuckerberg said, adding schools to their roster slowly ''because we wanted to create safe communities'' and make sure the system could handle the increased use.
 But events overtook them. Before heading west, Mr. Zuckerberg arranged a dinner with Sean Parker, the founder of Napster, to talk about his Web site, which had swept through Stanford University in a number of weeks. A few weeks later, the two bumped into each other on a street in Palo Alto, Calif. Before long, Mr. Parker, who is also a co-founder of Plaxo, an online service that updates e-mail address books, began informally advising the company. By the end of the summer, he became president. And he introduced Mr. Zuckerberg to Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and founder of PayPal, the online payment service acquired by eBay in 2002.
 Mr. Thiel invested $500,000 as seed money, the first major infusion of cash into thefacebook.com, Mr. Zuckerberg said. More important, his connection gave it the imprimatur of an up-and-coming company. Soon, other investors came calling.
 But the one who impressed them most was the team from Accel, said Mr. Zuckerberg, who is thefacebook.com's chief executive. At 43, Mr. Breyer, the firm's managing partner, is a seasoned investor who serves on the boards of Wal-Mart Stores and Real Networks.
 Mr. Breyer has taken a seat on the company's board, joining Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Parker and Mr. Thiel. He would not disclose the size of the stake Accel will take in thefacebook.com. And while he envisions that the company will one day go public, he said there was ''no significant timetable.'' 
 Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Parker decline to disclose revenue, which comes solely from advertising, though they say the company is profitable. With the infusion of outside cash, they are also able to pay themselves salaries and rent an office in Palo Alto. They have not determined when they will return to Harvard, where they remain on leave. 
 The site is becoming ubiquitous at the 840 colleges where it is available. Laura Hofmann, who just finished her sophomore year at Loyola College in Baltimore, said that when thefacebook.com was introduced at her school in the fall, ''everyone was addicted; at first, I was on five times a day.'' 
 Ms. Hofmann's sister Kate, who graduated this week from Tufts University in Medford, Mass., missed the site's early days because she was studying abroad for a semester. Upon her return, she acknowledged that the site was a ''huge procrastination tool.'' But now, she said, it is most useful as a means of keeping up with alumni.
 How to retain alumni as users is ''an interesting question for us,'' Mr. Parker said. ''We're trying to figure out what functionality they want once they graduate. Are they looking for jobs? Are they trying to date?''
 But first, with the help of the new financing, the company wants to saturate the approximately 1,400 four-year colleges nationwide.
 Running thefacebook.com has not been one success after another. A competitor, ConnectU, has sued the company in a federal district court in Massachusetts, asserting that Mr. Zuckerberg took its idea. Mr. Zuckerberg denies the allegation, saying he helped out at ConnectU for only a few weeks in the fall of 2003, when, he says, it was more of a dating service than a directory. He says his company has counterclaimed, asserting defamation. Calls and e-mails messages to ConnectU were not returned.
 While the breakout success of thefacebook.com is unusual, those in Silicon Valley say there is plenty of room for other Internet companies. According to Allen Wiener, an analyst at the research firm Gartner Inc., a successful company needs to have a ''clearly articulated product and service,'' that will ''save time or money, offer something someone can't find somewhere else and fulfill a greed or lust factor.'' The service offered should be ''compelling,'' adds Mr. Thiel, and one which ''draws in new users to get organic grass-roots growth.''
 Difficult? Maybe, but Mr. Thiel predicts a lot of young entrepreneurs will make the grade. ''We are nowhere near the end of the innovation arch,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Abbas's Gamble: Pulling a Foe Into Palestinian Politics

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: DEIR AL BALAH, Gaza, May 24 

 BODY:
Ahmad el-Kurd, the new Hamas mayor of this city of 60,000 people, stopped his car, furious. ''Who's building here?'' he demanded. The owner came from behind a cement truck, sheepish.
 ''Do you have a permit?'' the mayor asked. The man shrugged. ''Shall I send the police?'' The man said he would get one. Mr. Kurd pulled out his cellphone, which has an Islamic prayer as its ringer, and told his office to follow up.
 Retail politics, even by Hamas members, is familiar the world over. Officials elected on promises of reform, honesty and transparency start paving streets, replacing broken streetlights, paying city employees on time, picking up the garbage -- at least, more of the garbage. 
 But Hamas, the radical Islamic group considered a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel, is also about attacks against Israel and its occupation, and has sent rockets, mortars and suicide bombers against civilians. That casts its move into Palestinian politics in a different and, to many, deeply troubling light. 
 As the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, meets President Bush in Washington on Thursday, one of the main questions hovering over the future is the growing strength of Hamas. Mr. Abbas, better known as Abu Mazen, has refused to confront the group, instead choosing to try to co-opt it by bringing it into politics.
 It is a considerable gamble. Will democracy help bring Hamas into the mainstream? Or will Mr. Abbas empower a terrorist group that could sweep him away and reignite warfare with Israel? What concerns some Israelis is how eager Hamas is to be seduced, moving into Palestinian politics with such success, at least on the local level, that Mr. Abbas's long-dominant Fatah movement is running scared.
 The former mayor of Deir al Balah, Sami Abu Salim, one of the city's richest men, was appointed by Yasir Arafat. Municipal management was more of a hobby than a job, and Mr. Salim, a landowner with a lavish house, was seldom at the office. In December municipal elections, Mr. Salim lost badly; Hamas won 13 of 15 seats. Mr. Kurd, a teacher who had run a Hamas-financed school, became mayor of a town with $2 million in unpaid salaries, utility bills and medical insurance payments, with broken water pipes and only 11 employees to pick up the garbage with only two working trucks.
 ''We're about providing services at this level, not about national politics,'' said Mr. Kurd, who is in the office from 6 a.m. until after midnight. 
 In their meeting on Thursday, Mr. Bush is expected to tell Mr. Abbas that bringing Hamas into politics will work only if he moves against the military wing to disarm it and ensure that the Palestinian Authority has a clear monopoly on weapons and force, a senior American official said.
 ''The United States would have to be convinced either that Hamas is not a terrorist organization, or that they are dismantled,'' the official said. ''We don't care about religious people with views we dislike sitting in parliament. But we can't accept militant terrorism brought into politics.''
 Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon, overstates the danger, the official added. ''Bush doesn't buy Sharon's zero or 100 percent on Hamas. But Abu Mazen has to take the guns away from the street -- not necessarily seize them from houses.'' The Palestinian Authority has enough weaponry now ''to at least get started,'' the official said, relaying the judgment of Lt. Gen. William E. Ward, the American security coordinator for the Palestinians.
 There have been organizational reforms in security and some firings. But the police here recently stopped a truck full of locally made Qassam rockets produced by Hamas, American and Israeli officials said, but did not confiscate them.
 Hamas is moving hard into politics, its popularity based on its extensive social-welfare and charitable system, financed largely from the outside, including Iran; its resistance to Israel; and its reputation for honesty compared with the weakness and corruption of Fatah.
 Hamas spokesmen talk of winning the parliamentary elections, scheduled for July 17, though they may be delayed in a dispute over the voting system. That quarrel is itself a dispute between Mr. Abbas and the old guard of Fatah, including the current prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, who were close to Mr. Arafat and who are not allies of Mr. Abbas.
 But here in Gaza, Hamas's stronghold, few politicians and analysts expect Hamas to win a majority in the parliament, pointing out that their most famous leaders have been assassinated by Israel, they are not prepared to govern, they are much weaker in the more populous West Bank and they are unwilling to give up their military organization.
 In this they seem to be following the model of southern Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Iranian-supported group that is both a religiously based political party, with seats in Parliament, and an army. Avi Dichter, who just retired as head of Shin Bet, which is responsible for counterterrorism, predicts that Hamas will try to form a Hezbollah-style ''people's army'' in Gaza after Israel pulls out this summer that will be a direct challenge to the Palestinian Authority.
 American and Israeli officials also expect that Hamas, which has agreed to a period of calm, or tahdia -- a cease-fire with Israel at least through the end of the year -- is then likely to resume military activities and attack Israeli targets in the West Bank.
 ''It's in Hamas's interests to keep Gaza quiet and even make a success of Gaza,'' said the senior American official. ''But if Hamas believes that Israel can't deal with casualties, and that it won the war for Gaza, why shouldn't it transfer resistance to the West Bank? There's no reason for Hamas to assume that further quiet will bring about another Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.''
 The contradictions in the Hamas position will hold down their vote, said Omar Shaban, a Gaza economist, pointing out that recent Palestinian opinion polls tend to give Hamas about 30 to 32 percent of the vote. ''The Palestinian people are not extreme, and those who vote for Hamas are the exception,'' he said. ''Many people see Hamas as clean and as an excellent service provider, but not as a government or ruler. It's why they may vote for Hamas locally, but will vote for Abu Mazen nationally. They know that if Hamas comes to power, it will be different.''
 Khaled Abdel Shafi, an economist and manager, thinks Mr. Abbas is making the right choice, ''trying to help Hamas convert to political life and responsibility, which will change it.'' The only other option is civil war, which is impossible, Mr. Shafi said.
 But pulling Hamas them deeper into responsible politics is also likely to mean that Hamas will tie Mr. Abbas's hands and make it difficult for him to negotiate realistically on any form of Palestinian state that would satisfy Israel. 
 Hamas officials say they can accept an independent Palestine on the 1967 boundaries with Jerusalem as its capital and a recognition of the right of return for refugees, positions that are unacceptable to Israel. So even if Mr. Abbas gets the negotiations that he wants on final-status issues like Jerusalem, final borders and refugees, they may go nowhere and could lead to new violence.
 But new violence may be coming anyway, if Mr. Dichter and the Americans are correct. The Israeli Army is drawing up contingency plans for a renewed intifada.
 Mr. Shafi hopes they are wrong. ''Hamas and the militants will always be the excuse for Sharon not to deliver on his commitments, let alone on peace,'' he said. ''He'd love this Hamas card to remain in the game, so he doesn't have to deal, and he can continue to build settlements and put facts on the ground. And of course that just strengthens Hamas. That's why we need the Americans and the international community to push. If you leave it to the parties, it can't get solved.''
 Whatever the goals of Hamas's secretive leadership, the performance of Mr. Kurd and other Hamas mayors is impressive so far. Mr. Kurd, 56, was born in Deir al Balah refugee camp a year after his family of five fled their village near Ashkelon, less than 20 miles away. Those five are now 70 people, he says proudly; he has 11 children with his Russian wife.
 ''I'm not asking to return to Ashkelon. I want to live in Deir al Balah, in a decent city, in an independent Palestinian state like other states.''
 He thinks Hamas will play a responsible political role. ''When you're here, you face reality,'' he said. ''Hamas is part of the society, and it protects people's interests and helps alleviate their suffering.''
 Will Hamas resistance continue? ''We're in Gaza. If the Israelis withdraw, why do we need the resistance?''
 What about the West Bank? He smiled, then echoed the comments of Mushir al-Masri, a Hamas spokesman here. ''Resistance is a legitimate right so long as there is occupation,'' he said. ''Wherever there is occupation, there will be resistance.''

HEADLINE: Pipeline Done, Oil From Azerbaijan Begins Flowing to Turkey

BYLINE: By ERIN E. ARVEDLUND

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 25 

 BODY:
A long-awaited $3.6 billion pipeline linking the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean took its first flow of crude oil from Azerbaijan on Wednesday, opening a conduit that may help reduce Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil.
 Heads of state from the neighboring countries of Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkey were on hand for the inauguration ceremony not far from Baku, the Azerbaijan capital. The United States energy secretary, Samuel W. Bodman, and Lord Browne, chief executive of the British energy giant BP, which led the pipeline investment consortium were also there. 
 The presence of the officials underscored how politically important the Caspian region has become as an alternative energy source to the Middle East. 
 The pipeline, first planned in 1994, will carry crude oil from fields in the Caspian Sea off Baku to Tbilisi in Georgia, and on to the Mediterranean terminal at Ceyhan in Turkey. The fields are estimated to hold 4.6 billion barrels of oil and 3.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
 ''Some did not believe in the realization of this project, some tried to disrupt it, but the support of the United States and the activity of BP helped realize the project,'' the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, said at a news conference, according to news agencies. The ceremony was broadcast on Russian television.
 Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, the countries the pipeline will traverse, as well as part owners in the fields, could collect more than $150 billion in revenue from oil, gas and transit fees from 2005 to 2024, according to estimates by BP. 
 Stephen O'Sullivan, an oil industry analyst at the brokerage firm UFG, said the opening was the end of a long effort. ''After many years of talking and building, they finally put oil in the pipeline,'' he said.
 The pipeline has a capacity of 10 million barrels, he said, and the fields are initially expected to produce more than 400,000 barrels of oil a day. By 2008, the project is expected to pump a million barrels a day. BP said the pipeline could take more than six months to fill, with the loading of the first tanker at Ceyhan expected in the fourth quarter. 
 For the United States and other Western oil-consuming nations, the pipeline is attractive because its route avoids Russia and the environmentally sensitive Bosporus, an 18-mile strait dividing Istanbul. Some analysts have said the pipeline could offer an insurance policy against Russia's possibly tightening its grip on oil supplies from the Caspian region.
 At 1,100 miles, the pipeline, is one of the world's longest, according to the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank and an investor in the project. A gas pipeline following the same route is under construction and should be ready by 2006, according to Toby Odone, a BP spokesman in London.
 The consortium of 11 partners on the pipeline are also the developers of the oil fields. The group is led by BP, the largest shareholder with 30.1 percent. The other partners are the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan, with 25 percent; Unocal, with 8.9 percent; Statoil of Norway, with 8.7 percent; the Turkish Petroleum Corporation, with 6.5 percent; Eni and Total, with 5 percent each; Itochu, with 3.4 percent; Inpex and ConocoPhillips, with 2.5 percent each; and Amerada Hess, with 2.3 percent. 
 While the oil would not necessarily be exported directly to the United States, it would supplement now-tight global supplies, perhaps helping to lower energy prices. The pipeline advances Washington's goal of developing multiple oil and gas export routes, Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said on Wednesday.
 ''The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline is a major success for the United States goal of enhancing and diversifying global energy supplies,'' Mr. Boucher said. 
 The United States had at one time relied on Russia as its top energy alternative to the Middle East. But Secretary Bodman made clear that the Bush administration was seeking backup sources elsewhere, particularly in the Caspian. 
 ''Russian oil production is flat-lining,'' Mr. Bodman said earlier this week in Moscow. ''That fact is clear to both the Russian government and outsiders. It's in the interest of the United States to have greater alternative sources of supply.'' 
 The pipeline may provide one of those alternative sources, Mr. Bodman added. ''We view this as a step forward in the energy security of the region, which provides for investment in oil and maybe liquefied natural gas. This contributes to the increased supply of oil in the world. It adds new supplies of some consequence.'' 
 Also Wednesday, Human Rights Watch issued a letter to Mr. Aliyev, who succeeded his father in 2003, and denounced the detention of Azeri opposition figures last week. 
 Baku city authorities denied the opposition bloc permission to hold a rally last Saturday on the grounds that its timing was too soon before the opening of the pipeline. The rally occurred anyway, and police used force to disperse the marchers, beating participants with batons and detaining more than 100, Human Rights Watch said.
 Those events, Human Rights Watch said, underscored that Azerbaijan ''has yet to take significant steps to open up its political processes, to ensure that a plurality of groups can voice their opinions on political and social issues.''

HEADLINE: Diverse Investors Mix in Airline Deal

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
When America West and US Airways outlined the financing for their $1.5 billion merger last week, it turned out that two of their lead investors were hedge funds -- both with a flighty relationship to the airline industry.
 PAR Investment Partners, a private equity firm based in Boston, and Peninsula Investment Partners, an investment company based in Charlottesville, Va., have each danced in and out of airline investments over the years, holding stakes of various sizes in carriers like American, Independence Air and America West. This time around, they also will get some payoff, even if the deal is not consummated.Their perceived lack of constancy worries some analysts, who wonder whether the funds are in their new investment for the long haul. And it creates a challenge for W. Douglas Parker, chief executive of America West, who will run the combined companies. 
 He will have to balance the interests of both the hedge funds and other investors and financial contributors to the new airline, including Air Wisconsin, Air Canada, and Airbus, the European aircraft manufacturer.
 ''They are all going to have their views on the industry and where it is headed,'' said William Warlick, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, who follows the airlines.
 He added, ''You would worry a little bit about Doug Parker's ability to balance all these interests and bring it together in a cohesive way.''
 Mr. Parker, for his part, seems happy with his disparate collection of investors. ''We've worked very hard to put together a plan that we feel very good about,'' Mr. Parker said last week, in announcing the merger.
 Together, the two hedge funds and Air Wisconsin and Air Canada have put up $350 million, while Airbus is providing a $250 million loan. The airline is looking for more investors, and is pledging to find hundreds of millions of dollars in savings. 
 The deal will require approval by the federal loan board, which is owed a total $1 billion on packages of loan guarantees by the two airlines, and by the United States Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria, Va., which is overseeing US Airways' second bankruptcy case in three years.
 Outside investors have always been precariously attracted to airlines like Icarus to the sun, the most famous examples being Warren E. Buffett, who took a stake in US Airways in 1989, and Carl C. Icahn, who controlled Trans World Airlines. Both were stung by their airlines' weak performance, leading to the famous industry joke, ''How do you become a millionaire? Start as a billionaire and buy an airline.''
 But the hedge funds involved this time are assured of at least some return even if the deal falls apart. Documents filed with the bankruptcy court in Virginia, showed that PAR, which is investing $100 million for 6.6 million shares in the new airline, would get $3 million if the deal does not occur by Dec. 31. 
 Peninsula, which is investing $50 million for 3.3 million shares, would get $1.5 million in breakup fees. In short, the pair would receive a 3 percent return on their money even if the deal falls apart. 
 That might come as no surprise to either fund, since they are familiar with the industry's travails, raising and lowering their airline stakes numerous times in recent years. PAR, which is run by Edward L. Shapiro, has been an investor in America West since it emerged from bankruptcy protection in 1994 and holds 1.7 percent of its shares.
 It is the sixth-largest shareholder, with a 3.9 percent stake, in the AMR Corporation, the parent of American, the industry's biggest airline. And it is the biggest shareholder, with 9.9 percent, in Flyi, the parent of Independence Air. PAR has about $1 billion in investments.
 Mr. Shapiro created a stir last fall when he told management at Flyi that the airline should return to its roots as a regional carrier, rather than continue to wrack up big losses as a low-fare airline. ''You no longer have the luxury of blindly pursuing a strategy that will clearly require more financial resources than you have at your disposal,'' Mr. Shapiro wrote in a letter to Flyi's chairman, Kerry B. Skeen.
 But Independence opted to remain independent, and Mr. Shapiro has since been silent. Aside from a couple of phone calls from Mr. Shapiro to Mr. Skeen, ''We don't have any relationship'' with PAR, said an Independence spokesman, Rick DeLisi.
 Mr. Shapiro, whose career included stints at Wellington Management and Morgan Stanley, said he planned to leave the running of the new US Airways to Mr. Parker and his management team.
 ''We don't have any other agenda'' other than making an investment, Mr. Shapiro said by telephone from Boston this week. He added, ''This is as pure a financial transaction as anything.''
 Peninsula, headed by R. Ted Weschler, has also been a major investor in America West's stock in the last few years, but does not currently rank among its biggest holders. Mr. Weschler, a former specialist in leveraged buyouts, sits on the boards of two of his other investments, Virginia National Bank and Wilsons Leather. His fund has about $900 million in investments.
 In a brief interview, Mr. Weschler said he did not expect to sit on the new US Airways board, and declined to comment on his latest airline investment. ''I do my darnedest to keep a low profile,'' he said by telephone from Charlottesville this week. 
 Mr. Shapiro, however, is expected to become one of the new airline's 13 directors, taking one of three seats set aside for new equity investors. 
 But there is no seat designated for US Airways' current chairman, David G. Bronner, whose Alabama pension fund became US Airways' largest investor when it emerged from its first bankruptcy in 2003. Airline officials say Mr. Bronner's fund may still participate in the merged company. He did not return calls seeking comment this week.
 Mr. Warlick at Fitch said more such equity players could emerge as struggling airlines look for investors. ''This may be the way the capital structures of the airlines are going -- groups of private equity investors pooling their resources,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Has Loosened Rules For Arms Sales, Study Says

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The sale of military weapons to other countries, including many that were once barred from making such purchases, has increased sharply since the attacks on Sept. 11, according to a study by a New York research group. 
 As the United States is trying to secure new allies in its fight against terrorism, the study by the World Policy Institute -- a research group based at the New School University -- says that the nation has expanded the sales of weapons to countries that were once prohibited from receiving American-made goods because of their poor human rights records.
 Among the countries are Pakistan and Afghanistan as well as Algeria and Uzbekistan. Some two dozen countries have either become first-time recipients since Sept. 11 or have been readmitted to the program after long absences. 
 The study found that the largest aid program, Foreign Military Financing, increased 68 percent from 2001 to 2003, to reach $6 billion -- a peak amount -- before trending back to a current $4.5 billion. 
 More than half of the top 25 recipients in 2003, either through the commercial sales program or through foreign military sales, were countries that the State Department has defined as undemocratic.
 They included Saudi Arabia (purchases of $1.1 billion); Egypt ($1 billion); Kuwait ($153 million); and the United Arab Emirates ($110 million). 
 In other cases, weapons were sold to countries having internal conflicts, including Angola, Chad and Ethiopia, or where the human rights record was ''poor,'' according to the State Department; this category included Nigeria, Tunisia and Nepal. 
 Policy makers in Washington have said that the aid is necessary to secure overseas military bases or reward allies.
 But the author of the report, William Hartung, said the equipment could end up ''fueling conflict, arming human rights abusers or falling into the hands of U.S. adversaries.''
 Charles Pena, a military specialist at the Cato Institute, a Washington research group that promotes free-market policies, said that while arms transfers were preferable to sending troops, there are risks. 
 ''If a regime can use these arms to subdue their own population,'' Mr. Pena said, ''this could come back to haunt us. We need to be more mindful of the long-term implications, especially in the Muslim world.''
 While the overall increase in these military sales may make for some good strategic policy, said Michael O'Hanlon, a military specialist at the Brookings Institution, the approach could be a ''missed opportunity'' if not accompanied by other forms of aid.

HEADLINE: Bill to Create Asbestos Disease Fund Goes to Senate for Vote

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26 

 BODY:
Legislation to create a $140 billion fund for victims of asbestos exposure gained considerable momentum on Thursday when it was overwhelmingly approved by a Senate committee after weeks of debate.
 The measure would restrict asbestos victims from bringing their claims into court and would limit the liability of makers and insurers but force them to make contributions to the fund. It would set up a schedule of payments, based on the severity of the illness, ranging from $25,000 for breathing impairments to as much as $1.1 million for victims of mesothelioma, a lethal cancer of the lungs. Fees for lawyers would be capped at 5 percent of the final award. 
 The bill, adopted by a vote of 13-5 by the members of the Judiciary Committee, could reach the floor of the Senate as early as next month. While the committee's decision was an important milestone for the measure, its fate remains uncertain. 
 Three of the Republicans who voted in favor of the measure -- Jon Kyl of Arizona, John Cornyn of Texas and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma -- said that they did so only to move it to the floor, and that they would oppose it there unless it was significantly changed. Moreover, the legislation has been opposed by some companies that have used asbestos and insurers, as well as labor organizations and trial lawyers. It is supported by some asbestos makers, as well as the National Association of Manufacturers.
 Two years ago, when the Senate Judiciary Committee last adopted an asbestos measure, the legislation was blocked on the Senate floor when sponsors did not have enough votes to end debate. Since then, supporters of the measure have gained more support, although it is uncertain whether they have the 60 votes necessary to limit debate and break a possible filibuster. 
 Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who heads the committee and has worked assiduously to move the legislation, said that he remained optimistic about final passage despite the political challenges posed by the groups and their supporters in Congress.
 ''Everybody wants a little more,'' he said shortly after the committee vote. ''But the final vote will hinge on whether this is better than the current system.''
 ''We will accommodate more members, but not on the core provisions,'' he added.
 President Bush has campaigned in support of legislation to create the asbestos fund and limit the liability of companies and their insurers as part of his plan to overhaul the nation's tort law system. He has said that the litigation is a significant drag on the economy.
 ''We're pleased to see the committee report out a bill,'' said Michele St. Martin, a spokeswoman for the White House. ''The president believes it's important to address the asbestos litigation crisis, which has cost tens of thousands of jobs. For the sake of U.S. workers, we encourage the full Senate to take up this legislation quickly.'' 
 Three Democrats --Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Dianne Feinstein of California and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin -- joined the Judiciary Committee's 10 Republicans in supporting the measure. 
 Other Democrats said the legislation was too favorable to industry, would not provide enough money to victims, unfairly raised the burden of proof and imposed limits on lawyers' fees that would discourage competent lawyers from representing people who claim to be injured from exposure to asbestos.
 ''What we have before us today is an Asbestos Trust Fund that excludes many seriously ill victims from receiving compensation and that fails to provide a guarantee of adequate funding to make sure the victims who are eligible will actually receive what the bill promises them,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. 
 ''The real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation crisis, it is an asbestos-induced disease crisis. Asbestos is the most lethal substance ever widely used in the workplace.'' 
 Asbestos has been widely used as an insulation and construction material, and exposure to it in the workplace may not manifest itself in harmful ways until decades later. Illnesses it may cause range from the relatively minor to the fatal. 
 Experts say that more than 100,000 asbestos claims were filed in 2003 alone, and that federal and state courts already laboring under a deluge of cases could face significant new numbers as more people show symptoms of asbestos poisoning.
 A study issued two weeks ago by the Rand Institute for Civil Justice found that more than 730,000 people in the United States filed compensation claims for asbestos-related injuries from the early 1970's through the end of 2002, costing businesses and insurance companies more than $70 billion. 
 The study also found that the court system had imposed high transactional costs. Asbestos victims received about 42 cents of every dollar spent on asbestos litigation, according to the study. Another 31 cents has gone to defense costs, and 27 cents has gone to plaintiffs' lawyers and other related costs.
 The fund created by the legislation would be financed by asbestos makers, other companies that used the substance and their insurers. The companies would provide $90 billion over 30 years and insurers would pay $46 billion over 27 years. Another $4 billion would come from trusts, like the Manville Trust, created by asbestos makers to get out of bankruptcy. Those trusts have said they will challenge that provision in court action should the legislation become law.

HEADLINE: Insurers Balk at Bariatric Operations, Citing Cost and Risks

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The success stories of weight-loss surgery have been numerous and widely reported. Dangerously overweight patients -- both the famous and the unknown -- have lost hundreds of pounds, shown in before and after pictures. Many overcame life-threatening weight-related diseases.
 And as demand soared for new types of weight-loss surgery, known as bariatric surgery, hundreds of general surgeons took quick courses and started performing the procedures. The number of doctors rose rapidly, to more than 1,300 now from a few hundred in the early 1990's. 
 But after several years in which the surgery was seen as the last best hope by many obese people, a growing array of scientific data shows that the risks are greater than patients realized. One new study reported that almost one in 5 patients had complications after surgery. For one in 20 patients, the complications were serious, including heart attacks and strokes. Another recent study said the mortality rate for the most common type of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass, was one in 200 -- a rate higher than for coronary angioplasty, which opens blocked heart vessels. 
 For thousands of patients, the weight-loss surgery has eliminated debilitating diseases and improved the quality of life. But the threat of malpractice lawsuits against doctors and hospitals, as well as the reluctance of health plans to cover the surgery costs, is creating difficulties for people now seeking treatment. 
 With an estimated one-third of American adults classified as obese -- based on a body mass index of 30 or higher -- nationwide spending for weight-related conditions and associated economic losses is at least $117 billion a year, according to the National Institutes of Health. 
 Weight-control products and services, including drugs, diet and exercise programs as well as the bariatric surgery, came to $15.2 billion in 2003, the Fredonia Group, an industrial marketing firm, said. Patients and their insurers spent more than $3.5 billion last year for 145,000 bariatric procedures at an average of $25,000 each, according to the American Society for Bariatric Surgery, a professional group. But complications can raise a patient's costs to $100,000.
 With the number of candidates for the operations increasing, the number of procedures is expected to continue to grow, if more slowly. Some malpractice insurers have dropped bariatric coverage, and some surgeons have stopped performing the operations rather than pay sharply higher insurance premiums. Now, health plans are scrambling to set up networks of experienced doctors and hospitals with high standards and good results. For some patients, that will mean traveling further for the surgery. Insurers are already requiring anyone seeking the procedure to undergo a lengthy regimen of dieting, exercise and psychological counseling before getting coverage.
 Doug S. Hess, a surgeon in Bowling Green, Ohio, said he decided to retire rather than pay $300,000 a year to protect himself against legal costs. His son, Douglas W. Hess, also a surgeon in Bowling Green, gave up bariatric procedures, too. ''I can't afford to do bariatric surgery,'' he said. ''The malpractice premium is a big jump up.'' 
 Andrea Carrero, a New Jersey longshoreman's wife, paid for her surgery out of pocket last November after her Cigna health plan insisted on prerequisites she saw as delaying tactics. She said the plan refused to approve the surgery, although her doctors sent letters saying she was ''extremely obese and had hypertension, severe depression, edema, skin abrasions and sleep apnea.'' 
 Mrs. Carrero said Cigna required ''six months of planning'' before a bariatric procedure. ''I fought them,'' she said. ''In that six months, you can have a heart attack.'' Mrs. Carrero added: ''I've been dieting since I was 8 years old. This is a disease; it's not just because you like to eat. Dieting doesn't work. I lost 300 pounds on my own and gained it back.'' 
 A spokesman for Cigna, Wendell B. Potter, declined comment on Mrs. Carrero's case, citing federal privacy laws. But he said, ''Given the significant risks associated with bariatric surgery, attempts to manage weight using other methods are considered necessary'' before surgery is approved.
 Elliot Goodman, the lead bariatric surgeon at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, said Mrs. Carrero's procedure was effective. She has lost more than 90 pounds and her sleep apnea and high blood pressure are gone.
 At least five million adults are candidates for the surgery because of weight and weight-related conditions like heart disease, diabetes and sleep apnea, according to standards set by the National Institutes of Health. 
 Almost one in 20 patients (4.8 percent) had serious cardiovascular complications after surgery -- heart attacks, stroke or ''severe'' high blood pressure -- according to a study by RAND, the California research center, in the Annals of Internal Medicine last month. A study in The Journal of the American Medical Association in October said the death rate was one in 200 within 30 days after a gastric bypass.
 Sixty-four percent of large employers, those with 10,000 or more workers, cover bariatric procedures, according to a survey by Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm. Smaller employers are less likely to provide the coverage. 
 But malpractice insurance companies say that covering them is generating losses.
 The largest malpractice insurer in New York, the Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company, recently notified surgeons that it would end all coverage for bariatric surgeons on July 1, unless the state insurance department approved a 50 percent increase in premiums. The insurer, known as Mlmic, stopped accepting new applicants for this coverage last year. It had a ''loss ratio on bariatric coverage of 400 to 600 percent,'' Edward Amsler, a vice president, said. 
 Paresh Shah, a bariatric surgeon who moved to Lenox Hill Hospital in January from the Lahey Clinic in Massachusetts, said he was rejected by Mlmic and two other insurers, ''even though I had no lawsuits, no judgments, no settlements'' in five years as chief of obesity surgery at Lahey.
 He was forced into the state insurance pool for doctors who cannot get insurance. His premium there was $170,000, more than $100,000 higher than his colleagues were paying. ''It has a very chilling effect,'' he said.
 If regulators approve new rate increases, the premium for bariatric surgeons in Manhattan would rise to $93,000 from $62,000 now, and to more than $120,000 in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. 
 Most malpractice lawsuits are settled without publicity, but $1.6 million was awarded to the family of Tracey Mayes, a 39-year-old school district employee in a California case that went to trial two years ago. She died from complications 62 days after a stomach-stapling surgery procedure in a Pasadena hospital, said Bruce Fagel, a physician who was her lawyer.
 In a current case, Glennalee Smock, 65, a retired city employee of Long Beach, Calif., suffering complications after a gastric bypass procedure, has been hospitalized and unable to get out of bed for almost two years, her daughter Lisa said. The family is suing the hospital and doctors.
 Like Mlmic in New York, other malpractice insurers are raising rates and reviewing the qualifications of each bariatric surgeon and hospital.
 ''Surgeons will get out of the specialty and others may not take on more difficult cases because they don't want to be exposed to the liability,'' Dr. Goodman said.
 Restrictions on malpractice protection and on authorizations by health insurers are putting surgeons in ''a double squeeze,'' said Dr. Harvey J. Sugarman, president of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery. The society said its membership has risen steadily, to 1,364 from 162 in 1992.
 Big insurers like UnitedHealth Group, Aetna and Cigna typically offer bariatric coverage only as a rider that employers can purchase for an extra charge. The rider raises the insurance costs as much as 12 percent in some parts of the country. 
 A number of states, including New York, California and Maryland, require the coverage. But a federal law exempts most large employers, who are self-insured. In New York, ''in general it's covered,'' said Dr. Alan Sokolow, chief medical officer of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. 
 Frank Sloan, a health economist at Duke University, said malpractice rate increases could play a positive role by reducing the number of costly operations in cases where the prospects for success were poor. ''It's a risky procedure,'' he said. ''Maybe some of these guys will look before they leap.''

HEADLINE: $642,000 Bribe Plot Tied to Brokerage Aide

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
As the executive in charge of construction and technology at Salomon Smith Barney, Thomas A. Moogan was skilled at juggling multimillion-dollar offers from computer consultants and building contractors eager to do business with the brokerage company. When it came to major renovation projects on his own home, Mr. Moogan apparently knew how to get the job done. And on the cheap. 
 The problem, prosecutors say, is that he did not like to use his own money. 
 According to charges filed yesterday by the Manhattan district attorney, Mr. Moogan leveraged his position as managing director at Salomon Smith Barney to solicit $642,000 in bribes from vendors who won contracts with his company. 
 The money, the authorities said, helped finance the construction of a pool, a whimsical waterfall and a 2,500-square-foot cabana behind Mr. Moogan's million-dollar home in Montvale, N.J.
 About $25,000 of that money, they said, paid for a two-story deck behind the Brooklyn brownstone owned by Mr. Moogan's brother, and $50,000 more went to pay off Mr. Moogan's credit card debt. The money was received between 1998 and 2001 from two companies -- one a technology concern, the other an interior construction contractor -- which prosecutors refused to name. 
 In addition to bribery, tax evasion and charges of falsifying business records, prosecutors accused his wife, Joan K. Moogan, with complicity in the scheme, which involved issuing fake invoices to the vendors through a corporation initially established for Ms. Moogan's freelance writing business. The corporation, based in the Moogans' home, would then issue biweekly paychecks to Ms. Moogan, who is a textbook writer. 
 During an appearance yesterday in State Supreme Court, the couple pleaded not guilty to the charges, all felonies. Ms. Moogan, 46, has been charged with one count of tax evasion, which carries a four-year sentence, and her husband faces three separate charges. They and their lawyer, Paul K. Rooney, refused to comment. 
 Until 2002, Mr. Moogan, 38, was a managing director at Salomon Smith Barney, where he oversaw millions of dollars in technology purchases and interior renovations to the company's offices. 
 A spokeswoman, Kim Atwater, said Mr. Moogan was fired after misusing the company's Diners Club card. In an unrelated incident, he was arrested in February outside a bar in White Plaines and charged with cocaine possession. 
 Mr. Moogan told the authorities that he had been unemployed since his dismissal from Salomon Smith Barney, although he maintains a desk and phone at Digital Systems Group, a software company in Pennsylvania. Reached by phone, a company spokesman refused to comment about Mr. Moogan's position. 
 Prosecutors said the discovery of Mr. Moogan's relationship with the contractors was revealed in 30 secretly recorded conversations, the result of a long-running investigation into the construction industry.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth in Quarter Was Greater Than Estimated

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26 

 BODY:
An improved trade performance and robust homebuilding helped the economy expand at a revised 3.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, faster than estimated, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
 Previously, the Commerce Department estimated that gross domestic product, which measures total production of goods and services in the United States, grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate from January through March -- at the time, the slowest advance in gross domestic product in two years.
 The revised growth represents only a modest slowing from the 3.8 percent of the fourth quarter. It was slightly less than Wall Street economists' forecast of 3.6 percent. 
 Growth in spending by both consumers and businesses softened from fourth-quarter rates but still supported a view from the Federal Reserve and the Bush administration that the economy was on track for steady growth.
 The Commerce Department said imports increased at a 9.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter instead of the 14.7 percent that Commerce estimated last month. That helps G.D.P. because imports subtract from the calculation of national output.
 But some of the benefit from slower import growth was lost because inventories, which are a positive for G.D.P., grew at a $68.4 billion annual rate, rather than $80.2 billion. The revised rate, however, was still ahead of the fourth quarter's $47.2 billion pace.
 Separately, the Labor Department reported that new claims for jobless benefits edged up 1,000 last week, to 323,000 -- just short of analysts' expectations for 325,000 applicants. The more closely watched four-week moving average, which smooths out weekly fluctuations, similarly gained, reaching 330,500 from 330,000 the previous week. 
 The revised G.D.P. report showed that personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy -- a price gauge favored by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan -- increased at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, the same as estimated last month, after a 1.7 percent rate of advance in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Heeding a Call for Mexican Kitchen Labor

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
The dingy office on the fourth floor of an old Chelsea building is where the ghosts come to find work. 
 They are ghosts because they do not exist here in the city, not legally. Most have just come from the southern part of Mexico without visas, green cards or any other official document that proves their existence. 
 But even ghosts need to eat, and when they ask on the street ''Who has work?'' the answer many hear is Mr. Dinos. 
 Dinos Kazanis is a strange ally. He does not speak more than a few words of broken Spanish. His English echoes with bass notes of Greek. When he shouts, it is hard to tell what language he is using, and he shouts all the time. He is rude. ''I don't have job,'' he thunders into the phone. ''Why are you calling me now?'' 
 But the ghosts keep coming. 
 Since 1986, shortly after he came to New York from Greece, he has run his own employment agency, helping the Greeks, who still own many of the city's diners and coffee shops, hire the busboys, dishwashers and waiters that keep their businesses going. 
 In a complex, constantly changing city, niche businesses keep things humming. Fifteen years ago Mr. Kazanis sent men from Bangladesh and China to fill the back-of-the-house positions in restaurant kitchens. But the population of Mexicans in the city tripled during the 1990's, making Mexicans one of the fastest-growing groups in New York. Now he specializes almost exclusively in sending Mexican workers to Greek restaurants and diners. 
 ''They are very good quality workers,'' Mr. Kazanis says one morning, his words a drumbeat of Old World vowels and New World weariness. ''If these illegals leave New York City, New York will die. I know.'' 
 Most of the workers he sends for jobs are thin young men with shallow cheeks and dark eyes who have come illegally from the parts of Mexico that have not benefited from that country's deepening economic ties with the United States. 
 Every weekday morning they come to Mr. Kazanis's Atlas Employment Agency -- everybody calls it Mr. Dinos' -- as soon as he opens at 7 a.m. 
 The office's windows are dim with dirt. The carpet is threadbare, the gray metal desks are banged up and the walls are covered with as much grime as paint. Behind him are three American flags and a small poster proclaiming, ''Proud to be an American.'' 
 He became a citizen a few years ago and now Mr. Kazanis, 66, is often the only American in the office. The Mexican job seekers sit in two rows of dirty plastic chairs, with a blurry television tuned to Spanish-language soap operas. Mr. Kazanis says experienced cooks are picked right away. But most who come here have no skills, so they wait. 
 At 11:15, he takes a call from the frantic owner who has just realized that with lunch about to begin, he is short one busboy. Holding the phone with his shoulder, Mr. Kazanis looks out over the dozen young men who have been waiting to be called. 
 ''Busboy,'' he shouts. ''Rapido.'' 
 From the second row, back near the wall, a young man with a backpack stands up. 
 ''Trabajo,'' Mr. Kazanis says -- ''work'' -- after the man has come to stand by his battered desk as sheepishly as if he had been called to the principal's office. ''Start at 12 o'clock. You leave at 11:30.''
 The young man, who says his name is Rodolfo, came less than a year ago from the state of Puebla, the starting point for the uncertain voyages of many other Mexicans in New York. He had been working at another Greek diner but he wanted a different schedule, and he was confident Mr. Kazanis would find something for him. 
 It is a pattern followed by many Mexicans in the city who bounce from job to job. Little changes -- not salary, nor hours, nor working conditions nor, for many, the chances of getting ahead.
 ''The vast majority of them never experience any promotion or job seniority,'' says Saru Jayaraman, executive director of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, a labor rights group. ''Most never move up at all.''
 So Rodolfo says he will take the job. He fills out an application.
 ''Busboy, and delivery,'' Mr. Kazanis repeats. ''Is good. You have bike?''
 ''Yes, and I have a helicopter, too.'' 
 Rodolfo looks back at his friends and laughs. 
 ''Helicopter better,'' Mr. Kazanis says. 
 Then it is back to business. ''I tell you, they pay more than minimum. Six days, 12:30 to 10. Saturday off. Sunday 3 to 12.'' A 50-hour week, for which he will make $500, without health benefits. 
 ''If you have any problems call me,'' Mr. Kazanis says. ''The owner is my friend. I help this guy too many times. When you get there, see Mr. Nick. How you get there? Take the train, No. 6, uptown. You pay now.'' 
 ''How much?'' Rodolfo asks, though he knows the fee is $100, half in advance, and the remainder due after the first paycheck.
 ''For you, $1,000.'' 
 Rodolfo takes two twenties and a ten from a small roll of bills in his pocket and leaves. 
 Mr. Kazanis looks at the application card he filled out. Except for his first name and a cellphone number, Rodolfo has left the card blank. 
 ''You believe they tell me the truth over here? They don't have ID. There's no way to check. I have too many guys with the same last name.'' 
 He knows they are illegal. The owners who hire them know they are illegal. Immigration officials know where to find them. But they rarely try. There are more than 200,000 Mexicans in New York, according to city officials, and most are illegal. They are the poorest immigrants, but they also have about the lowest unemployment rate, in part because New York businesses need them. 
 The perpetual cycle of job seekers brings in a steady income, but no great fortune. There is something else that motivates Mr. Kazanis, something called empathy, a word with good Greek roots. He wants to help them because their struggles are familiar. 
 ''The Italians, the Greeks, the Polish, they were all illegals,'' Mr. Kazanis says. ''It's the same story now.''
 It is 11:45 a.m. by the time he puts down the graying Rolodex cards with the names of diners and their owners. He calls over one of the Mexicans waiting in his office and hands him $25. 
 ''Wendy's. Rapido,'' he says.
 It is a daily ritual, followed religiously. A hamburger for each man still waiting for work, and one for Mr. Kazanis, too. Later, he will pass through the rows of chairs with a two-liter bottle of soda and a sleeve of plastic cups. He insists it is not charity, but a business tool. 
 ''I have to give them food,'' he says. ''If I don't and they go out to eat, I don't have anybody to send to anybody if they call.'' But he knows few calls come in the afternoon. 
 The men eat in silence. Some hold on to their burgers, waiting for the darkness of night when there may be nothing else to eat. Mr. Kazanis never charges for the food, nor does he object to the men spending the whole day in his office. 
 ''O.K., Dinos,'' one of the Mexicans says from across the room after he has finished his burger. ''Now I want to work.'' 
 Mr. Kazanis looks through his cards, takes a heavy breath and picks up his ringing phone. 
 ''At-las. Who is this?''

HEADLINE: Trade Group to Start Talks to Admit Iran

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO; Tom Wright contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 26 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization announced Thursday that it would start talks to admit Iran as a member, a reward for Tehran's agreement to continue to freeze its nuclear activities.
 The decision came after the United States, in a small but important conciliatory gesture, dropped its long-standing opposition to Iranian membership in the organization, which governs global trade.
 ''It is a long overdue decision but it is a positive decision,'' said Mohammad Reza Alborzi, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, in a telephone interview. ''We have a Persian proverb: 'A fish is always fresh, even if it is caught when you go fishing late in the day.''' 
 In Washington, the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said the timing of the United States reversal on Iran's World Trade Organization membership talks was ''not totally coincidental.'' He said the negotiations between the Europeans and the Iranians in Geneva on Wednesday demonstrated ''that efforts to achieve a peaceful, diplomatic solution on the Iran nuclear issue do continue.''
 The United States, which accuses Iran of secretly developing nuclear weapons, has vetoed its efforts to join the organization since it first applied in 1996. Even though politics is not supposed to play a role in issues relating to membership, the Clinton and Bush administrations used the World Trade Organization veto as one of a range of American economic penalties against Iran, an Islamic republic.
 Because the organization, which is based in Geneva and has 148 member countries, makes decisions by consensus, the United States alone was able to block Iran more than 20 times over the years.
 In March, President Bush announced that he would reverse that policy and agreed to consider sales of commercial aircraft parts after European leaders warned him that their nuclear negotiations with Iran would fail unless the United States joined Europe in a common bargaining position.
 An array of Iranian officials dismissed the American gestures as insignificant.
 Under a preliminary accord with Iran in Paris last November, France, Germany and Britain promised economic, political and security benefits in exchange for Iran's ''objective guarantees'' that its nuclear program was totally peaceful.
 The economic benefits included helping Iran gain membership in the World Trade Organization, the promotion of private investment and technical help or cooperation in automobiles, telecommunications, civil aviation, agriculture and other fields. Joining the World Trade Organization offers access to a club of nations that are trying to reduce tariffs on trade in goods and services. The organization also settles trade disputes among members, and offers technical aid to developing nations.
 In Geneva on Wednesday, the foreign ministers of the three European countries persuaded Iran to continue its freeze on nuclear activities, averting a diplomatic crisis that could have led to international penalties against Iran.
 In exchange, the Europeans offered to present Iran with detailed step-by-step proposals by early August on how to move toward consensus on the shape of Iran's nuclear program.
 A senior State Department official said that after the talks, the British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, told Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by telephone that progress had been made and that the European side wanted the United States to carry through with its pledge on the World Trade Organization to build confidence with the Iranians. Senior State Department officials are often under instructions to speak to reporters on condition of anonymity when discussing the diplomatic process. 
 Before the meeting in Geneva on Wednesday, Iran threatened to restart uranium conversion activities at its site at Isfahan, citing its rights under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and complaining about a lack of progress in the talks.
 The Europeans responded with a letter signed by the foreign ministers of the three countries and Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, warning Iran that restarting work would violate the Paris agreement and force them to recommend Iran for censure.
 The letter mentioned Europe's support for moving forward with Iranian membership in the World Trade Organization, saying, ''This sort of progress will be jeopardized if Iran now moves away from the Paris agreement.''
 The decision made Thursday to start World Trade Organization talks does not mean that Iran will easily gain entry. Membership takes years and requires a range of economic and political changes. China took more than 15 years of negotiations before becoming a member in 2001. 
 But the move may make it easier for Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Hassan Rowhani, to persuade Iran's leaders to await the Europeans' proposals on carrying out the Paris nuclear accord before deciding whether to restart nuclear activities.
 It also means that Iran now has observer status and can sit in on all World Trade Organization meetings. 
 The Bush administration has made clear that it has no intention of offering Iran more incentives now. In testimony before Congress last week, R. Nicholas Burns, the new under secretary of state for political affairs, said, ''There is no reason to believe that extra incentives offered by the United States at this point would make a difference.''
 Iran sees it differently. One of the highest items on its shopping list with the Europeans is access to advanced nuclear reactors.
 But Europe is not permitted to sell Iran nuclear reactors without American approval, because they contain American technology that may not be transferred to Iran under United States penalties.
 In a working-level meeting in Brussels on Tuesday between Iranian and European negotiators, Hossein Mousavian, an Iranian negotiator, asked the Europeans why they did not just ask ''their big boss,'' the United States, to directly supply Iran with 10 nuclear reactors, an idea he has floated before, two participants in the meeting said.
 ''The United States,'' one European participant in the talks said, ''has always been the ghost at the table.''

HEADLINE: He Taught Picasso and Learned to Draw in 3 Dimensions

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

 BODY:
If ever an artist was in the right place at the right time, it was Julio Gonzalez (1876-1942), who, late in life, created welded wrought-iron, semi-abstract assemblages that would turn out to be among the most influential and inspirational works in all of Modern sculpture. 
 Gonzalez, currently the subject of a small gem of an exhibition at the Instituto Cervantes in Manhattan, did not start out as a revolutionary. Born into a family of metalsmiths in Barcelona, he started making art as a boy and began exhibiting his work when he was 16. In 1900 he moved to Paris with his family and there he focused on painting. During World War I he worked as a welder in an automobile factory, and after the war went back to painting until, fatefully, his friend Pablo Picasso asked him for technical help on a metal sculpture he was having trouble with. From 1928 to 1931, Gonzalez gave Picasso lessons in metalworking, and then turned around and asked Picasso for permission to use the vocabulary they had developed together to create his own sculptures. 
 What Gonzalez went on to do was not only to bring together Cubism and industrial ironworking, but also, and equally important, to depart from the solid mass of traditional carved or modeled sculpture. Using slender lengths and thin sheets of metal, he created open, linear structures defined as much by voids as by solids. Some would call it a kind of three-dimensional drawing in space. The long list of those inspired by his example begins with David Smith, the great American creator of welded steel assemblages, who called Gonzalez ''the father of all iron sculpture'' in the 20th century. It also includes highly esteemed artists like Mark di Suvero, Richard Stankiewicz, Anthony Caro, Melvin Edwards and many more.
 The 43 works in the Instituto Cervantes exhibition, drawn from a collection of 400 Gonzalez works in the Valencian Institute of Modern Art in Spain, provide an abbreviated but illuminating survey of his career. The earliest piece, a life-size, realistic chrysanthemum blossom made of wrought iron with every petal delicately formed, reveals Gonzalez's training in fine metalworking, as does a silver pendant resembling a crab's claw. A Lautrec-like watercolor of a woman in a rumpled bed shows his considerable skill and subtle touch as a draftsman, and small cast bronze figurative sculptures and reliefs reveal the influence of artists like Rodin, Degas and Maillol. Accomplished as all these objects obviously are, nothing about them foretells a career that would alter the course of Modern-art history. 
 The works from the years following the collaboration with Picasso, however, burst with the excitement of an artist discovering and exploring a whole new world of formal and expressive possibility. Made of dark pieces of found or cut-up metal, they have a rough, almost slapdash look, and most have a humorous and even cartoonish anthropomorphic aspect. ''The Hair,'' which has been cast in bronze, consists of an upright, scythe-like arc, with curvy, spiky elements sprouting from one end. They evoke, with delightful economy, a person with unruly hair. 
 More mysterious is the welded iron ''The Lovers II,'' in which a drumlike volume with a rounded bottom and a flat, geometrically cut-out lid balances like an abstract head on the point of a concave, triangular form. It has a primordial, totemic feeling. 
 A sweet playfulness prevails. Though his work may look like Picasso's, the mood of Gonzalez's sculpture is closer to that of Miro and Calder. Even a sculpture like ''Cactus Man I,'' from 1939, which has nails bristling from its boxy and bulbous volumes, exhibits little of the ferocity of Picasso's work from about the same time. 
 Some pieces are more busily complicated intersections of planes, cylinders, cones, spheres, beams, box shapes and curved lines. Yet Gonzalez's sculptures never become purely formal abstractions. Like Picasso, he always worked representationally, even at his most abstract, and his pieces always have a certain uncanny animation. The realistic illusionism of pre-Modernist sculpture is gone, but there is still a magical quickening of otherwise inert materials, as if the metal itself had a rambunctious life of its own.
 It would be misleading to say that without Gonzalez, there would be no 20th-century tradition of welded steel sculpture. With little left for traditional carving and modeling to do, someone was bound to put together Cubism and industrial metal fabrication. Picasso could have done it on his own; it just would have taken him a little longer to work out the technical bugs. In any event, when the ball fell into Gonzalez's court, he had the talent, the experience and the imagination to do something wonderful with it. 
 Today the tradition that Gonzalez helped start is pretty much exhausted. It peaked in the 1960's with Anthony Caro's assemblages of found industrial parts; after that, artists could do little more in that mode than produce refinements and variations. (Richard Serra's gigantic curved walls of rusted steel belong to a different tradition -- the one started by Brancusi.)
 Where sculpture students used to study welding as a matter of course, they are now more likely to pursue digital technologies, and the artist whose influence remains most alive for emerging generations of sculptors is Duchamp. Still, there is a lot of history compressed into this little show, and if you care about Modern sculpture, you should not miss it.

''Julio Gonzalez: Sculptures and Drawings'' remains through June 18 at the Instituto Cervantes Gallery, 211-215 East 49th Street, Manhattan. Information: (212)308-7720.

HEADLINE: The Many Shades of Now, Explored in 3 Dimensions

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
''Make It Now: New Sculpture in New York,'' the title of an exhibition of work by nearly 30 artists at the Sculpture Center in Long Island City, Queens, comes enticingly close to echoing Ezra Pound's famous exhortation to ''make it new.'' But the name, like the show itself, swerves at the last second, as if fearful of overreaching.
 The exhibition plays it safe with a lot more now than new. But you have to start somewhere, and it has a reasonable quota of intriguing beginnings and of promising parts not yet made whole.
 Advocating the new may sound like an old modernist saw, but I suspect that the urge for newness, difference -- or whatever its current designation might be (''institutional critique,'' for example) -- is one of the things that continue to get most artists out of bed in the morning. First make your work new for yourself. Then, size up the extent to which your effort already exists in the culture. Finally, get back to work. ''A poem that communicates something that's already known to a reader is not really communicating anything,'' is how John Ashbery once put it. 
 These words are germane to the Sculpture Center show, where there is too much exploring of known terrain. Vincent Mazeau and Matthew Ronay revisit Surrealism. Sol Sax's six life-size figures, which hang upside down like bats in the stairwell, reiterate the angular, rough-hewn figurative sculpture style of artists as disparate as Stephan Balkenhol and Alison Saar. 
 The show is a condensed, more focused version of ''Greater New York,'' P.S. 1's sprawling survey of local art. It was culled from some 200 studio visits by Mary Ceruti, the center's executive director; Anthony Huberman, its curator; and Franklin Sirmans, an independent critic and curator. Their selections give a partial account of the art form that, since the late 60's, has been the shape-shifting medium par excellence. Call it the sculptural diaspora. 
 In attendance are examples of installation art, video, design, ceramics and a touch of performance. Site-specificity is superficially reflected in Phoebe Washburn's wood-scrap tiered structure ''Poor Man's Lobster,'' which uses gravel from the center's courtyard for a rainbow-colored rock quarry, and Klara Hobza's ''Morse Code Communication (An Improved Attempt),'' which fills the skylight with clip-on lamps that suggest sun-thirsty aluminum blossoms. (They were used for a session of nighttime message-sending that, on video at least, has not improved nearly enough.)
 For interactive art, there's Nancy Hwang's ''Impromptu,'' in which the visitor can flop down on a bed, pick up a red phone and chat with the artist, who is casting her next video. (I said no thanks.) 
 As told here, the main tale of recent sculpture is the back and forth between the old-time modernist art of assemblage and the more rigorous, concept-driven postmodern practice of appropriation. Since the mid-1980's, when Neo-Geo pushed appropriation into three dimensions, these two forces have invigorated, competed with and thwarted each other. There's little here that doesn't fall somewhere between their increasingly blurred extremes, little that doesn't result from the hunting, gathering, purchasing, arranging and titling of familiar objects and materials.
 The Scylla and Charybdis along this line are mindless materiality and overly mindful scrawniness -- meticulous craft at the service of weak ideas and big thoughts that gloss over a lack of attention to physical materials. File under ''mindless materiality'' Jean Shin's tower-like spires of discarded amber-plastic pill bottles, coyly titled ''Chemical Balance''; Andrea Cohen's bricolage of wood, Styrofoam and plastic, which resembles something by Sarah Sze only much larger; and Bryan Savitz's expertly made cut-cardboard sculptures, which drown ideas about history and architecture in cuteness, technique and eye-numbing consistency. Fritz Welch's gnarly room-size assemblage made from neighborhood junk might be the remnant of an early Happening, except for the way it seems to erupt from a ganglia-like wall drawing.
 The show's freshest revision of conventional assemblage is found in Nicole Cherubini's work: enormous hand-built ceramic vases, in which found objects, subsumed within a larger whole, function as fetishes and accessories. Obsessively pinched, lathered with glaze, punctured with multiple orifices, spangled with jewelry and edged in fur, they suggest unearthed burial urns, a bling-bling take on ormolu, prehistoric pueblos and elaborately pierced bodies. Meanwhile, Robert Melee pushes his self-referential version of assemblage a little too completely toward a more anonymous Neo-Geo harshness. 
 To the other extreme, Gareth James writes a brilliant paragraph-long title about the role of the screw in the rise and fall of civilizations, but attaches it to an obscure arrangement of new turntables, Canal Street plastic boxes and a screw-like coil of paper, all on a pedestal of bubble-wrap. It is another twist on the current Neo-Conceptualist formula of the high-tech, the low-tech and the grudgingly handmade. Printing a news photograph of masked kidnappers displaying their hostage on sheets of plastic, Seth Price achieves a similar imbalance of brainy and slight. 
 Although it doesn't show her at full strength, the exhibition rightly includes the work of Rachel Harrison, an artist who has spent more than a decade negotiating raw, accessible, thought-provoking alliances between assemblage and appropriation art, using an approach informed by the work of Cady Noland and Jessica Stockholder. Ms. Harrison's ''Getting Ahead'' consists of a tall jumble of wood doused in silver paint, glommed to an aluminum stepladder and topped by a plastic powdered wig. Mount Rushmore's portrait of George Washington has either been defaced or has turned its back on us.
 Perhaps inspired by Ms. Harrison's art, some works bring an even-handed sense of economy to the use of language and materials. Gedi Sibony achieves a distressed yet evocative formalism with a tall section of salvaged aluminum wall studs, some industrial carpet and some relatively pristine white cardboard. It is titled ''Even Though Its Forms Are Constructed Completely of Things Taken From the World,'' and you could do worse than consider its oddly pure presentation of line and plane, mass and transparency, shiny and matte.
 Starting with hairy and smooth, beach and factory, the contrasts are more suggestive in Guyton/Walker's large cluster of light bulbs seemingly powered by coconuts, currently serving as a chandelier at the center's entrance. It might also look good in the SoHo windows of Moss, the world's artiest design store; but it is one of the better objects here.
 Corey McCorkle has softened Naumanesque deprivation with a family rec room's tacky glow by covering fluorescent lights with wood-grain Contac paper and stringing them the length of a long brick-and-stone corridor. Frank Benson's curving piece of four-foot-square fiberboard splits the difference between formal and found with an unpretentious, sculpturally satisfying combination of weight, shape and color.
 Ester Partegas's ''Monument to the Truth,'' which includes a sign reading ''Pardon Our Appearance While Under Construction,'' gives real weight to its political point by intimating an imposing possibly equestrian statue beneath wrappings of plastic and plywood. And Charlie Foos basically transforms himself into an equestrian statue on video in ''Monument With Anthem,'' a hilarious clash of outmoded weaponry, ancient technology and ineffectual heroics. He does this using only a toy lance and shield, a mechanical sidewalk rocking horse in constant need of quarters and ''The Ride of the Valkyries'' played on a feeble tape recorder.
 A final standout is ''Like It Is,'' one of two works by a young artist named Leslie Hewitt. (The other, ''Grounded,'' consists of three steps leading nowhere and is not as striking.) ''Like It Is'' meditates on family, historical narrative and black identity with five color photographs of what looks like the front panel of a hope chest. In each image the panel leans against a wall, resting on a copy of Alex Haley's ''Roots.'' It seems to float, like a ship, its repetition implying a journey, or a story. Other stories are intimated in different photographs by the addition, of books like ''Soul on Ice,'' ''The Fire Next Time'' and ''Before the Mayflower'' and snapshots of a little boy. 
 This improvised arrangement is reiterated by the work's plain, chunky frame, a sculpture in its own right, which leans against a wall but stands on its own boxy built-in feet. Evoking generations of chests, beds, pews and coffins, it radiates a grand immobility while validating the endurance of the various wood grains, real and fake, that fill the photographs. This promising balance of assemblage, appropriation, abstract sculpture and photography is one of the several hints of newness that make this cautious show worth visiting.

''Make It Now: New Sculpture in New York'' is at the Sculpture Center, 44-19 Purves Street, near Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)361-1750, through July 31.

'B.F.E.' Opens Tuesday. A kooky Asian-American family tries to escape its stifling home life, while a serial killer stalks its neighborhood in Arizona (1:45). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.

'AFTER THE NIGHT AND THE MUSIC' Opens Wednesday. Elaine May's three one-acts make up a new comedy on Broadway (remember those?) about married couples and aging singles looking for love.

'BIRDIE BLUE' Previews start Thursday. Opens June 23. S. Epatha Merkerson stars as the title character in this memory play about a woman whose life changed tragically on the day that Martin Luther King Jr. was killed (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422.

'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' Opens June 15. Is it a comic tragedy or a tragic comedy? Renew that old debate at Tom Donaghy's new adaptation of Chekhov's last play (2:00). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200.

Broadway

'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, ''All Shook Up'' might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100. (Ben Brantley)

'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol'' (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley) 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' Robert Goulet is now striding gallantly through this garish revival of the Jerry Herman-Harvey Fierstein musical. Although he is not too agile, Mr. Goulet brings a subdued professionalism to the role of Georges, the owner of a transvestite nightclub on the Riviera who is facing a rising souffle of domestic conflict (2:30). Marquis, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212)307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-like machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2.30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper, this tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005). Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in this placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Whether it fits comfortably into the Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to this abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE GLASS MENAGERIE' This revival suggests that to recollect the past is to see life as if it had occurred underwater, in some viscous sea. Folks drown in this treacherous element. Unfortunately, that includes the show's luminous but misdirected and miscast stars: Jessica Lange and Christian Slater (2:30). Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS' Highly caffeinated bliss. Watching Joe Mantello's hopping revival of David Mamet's play about a dog-eat-dog real estate office is like having espresso pumped directly into your bloodstream. But what's a little lost sleep when you've had the chance to see a dream-team ensemble, including Liev Schrieber and Alan Alda, pitching fast-ball Mamet dialogue with such pure love for the athletics of acting (1:45)? Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Jackie Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act, and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'JULIUS CAESAR' Those cruel forces of history known as the dogs of war are chewing up everything in their path in this tragedy: friends, Romans, countrymen, blank verse and even the noblest movie star of them all. That's Denzel Washington, who plays the conflicted Brutus (2:40). Belasco, 111 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'ON GOLDEN POND' Placing a powerhouse like James Earl Jones in Ernest Thompson's teary, sentimental comedy about an elderly couple's summer of healing suggests a German shepherd in a poodle-sized dog house. Yet rather than make his surroundings feel small and artificial in this surprisingly fresh revival, Mr. Jones's natural grandeur forces the play to find room for his sweeping emotional breadth (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal has been set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor (2:20). Broadhurst, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'SPAMALOT' This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' Despite an ensemble featuring high-profile veterans of stage, film and television, sitting through this portrait of friendship among Southern women, set in a beauty parlor in small-town Louisiana, is like watching nail polish dry (2:20). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE' The capricious gods of casting have not been kind to Tennessee Williams of late. This staging, starring an erratic Natasha Richardson as Blanche, is not the hazy mess that the current ''Glass Menagerie'' is. But it, too, suffers from fundamental mismatches of parts, especially John C. Reilly's sexually unmagnetic Stanley (2:45). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212)719-1300. (Brantley)

'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Wayne Cilento, never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

*'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

*'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?' Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the Longacre feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

*'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE ARGUMENT' Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros, co-author of the post-9/11 play ''Omnium Gatherum,'' aims to personalize another hot-button issue here, but it's not likely that any serious thought, old or new, is going to be provoked by this whiny debate between two uninteresting types about the ever-sensitive topic of abortion. He wants the baby; she doesn't. It is hard to care (1:30). The Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212)353-0303. (Isherwood)

'BEAST ON THE MOON' Richard Kalinoski's musty romantic drama depicts the fractious marriage of two survivors of the mass killings of Armenians during World War I. Larry Moss's production is respectable and effective, but the performances by Omar Metwally and Lena Georgas are exhaustingly busy (2:00). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'CAPTAIN LOUIE' The York Theater is serving a charming, child-size slice of Broadway with Captain Louie, a one-hour musical based on the 1978 picture book ''The Trip'' by Ezra Jack Keats. A talented young cast performs music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz, an Oscar and Grammy winner whose credits include ''Pocahontas,'' ''The Prince of Egypt'' and the current Broadway hit ''Wicked'' (1:00). The York Theater Company at the Theater at Saint Peter's, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Miriam Horn)

'FLIGHT: THE RISE AND FALL OF CHARLES LINDBERGH' Garth Wingfield's droning bio-play transforms Charles Lindbergh's journey from tickertape hero to disgraced Nazi sympathizer into a sort of talking newspaper, minus op-ed pages, lively writing and the weather report. With Gregg Edelman playing the everyman pilot turned celebrity, and Brian D'Arcy James on hand to personify a series of slimy reporters (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212)279-4200. (Isherwood)

'HENRY FLAMETHROWA' John Belluso's timely drama about a girl in a coma who may or may not heal the sick engages the issues raised during the Terri Schiavo media circus. It's a thought-provoking and ambitious play (starring Tim Daly), but unfortunately, there are no characters in it you can believe in (1:30). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212)279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)

*'HOWIE THE ROOKIE' Mark O'Rowe's blood-and-guts-filled comic yarn, which features two baroque monologues climaxing in sudden, irresistible bursts of mayhem, tells a gangland story set in working-class Dublin. Despite being overproduced, the play, displaying traces of David Mamet and Quentin Tarantino, packs a wallop (1:50). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. (Zinoman)

*'HURLYBURLY' If you are going to inhabit a wasteland, you might as well be thoroughly wasted. That seems to be the first rule of survival for the characters who have been brought so vibrantly and unforgivingly to life in this smashing revival of David Rabe's 1984 play. But thanks to a terrific cast, theatergoers are likely to experience a heady buzz of excitement and clarity, which any of the desperate characters onstage would kill for (3:15). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

'THE MAIDS' It is no small feat to find the chill in Jean Genet's 1947 play about two maids who fantasize about killing their boss, but Jean Cocteau Repertory manages it. Credit an eye-opening performance by Amanda Jones as Solange, the dominant of the pair (2:00). Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, (212)279-4200. (Neil Genzlinger)

'MISS JULIE' Anders Cato directs a new adaptation by Craig Lucas. Marin Hinkle, as Miss Julie, and Reg Rogers, as her father's uppity valet Jean, spar and flirt, humiliate each other and humble themselves as expected, in the traditional kitchen, with the designated disastrous results. Chances are you won't believe a word of it (1:35). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. (Isherwood)

'MORTAL LADIES POSSESSED' Linda Marlowe's admirable but difficult one-woman show is based on a 1974 collection of Tennessee Williams's short stories. The adaptation is sometimes awkward and the transitions hard to follow, but Ms. Marlowe captures the characters' pathos and fragility nicely (1:20). 59E59Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Anita Gates)

'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)

*'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros'' directed by Orson Welles and starring Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

*'THE PASSION OF THE CRAWFORD' For his slight but still tasty new show, John Epperson has decided to allow his voiceless alter ego, Lypsinka, to commune intimately and at length with one of her spiritual forebears, Joan Crawford. The centerpiece is a pointed but never vicious re-creation, or rather an interpretation, of a live interview Crawford gave at Town Hall in 1973 (1:30). Zipper, 336 West 37th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'THE PULL OF NEGATIVE GRAVITY' A Welsh man with no seeming interest in politics is badly injured in the Iraq war and discovers that returning home will not be so easy. In this bruising, intimate and overly familiar play, which is part of the Brits Off Broadway festival, Jonathan Lichtenstein beautifully portrays how the war destroyed one rural family (1:30). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. (Zinoman)

'SCORE' The subject of this one-man show is Leonard Bernstein and music, and the performer, Tom Nelis, and the director, Anne Bogart, ''get'' Lenny -- now brilliant, now flamboyant, now superficial, now physically responding to recorded music (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. The show is in repertory with ''Songs From an Unmade Bed.'' (Anne Midgette)

'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER' This comedy, written more than two centuries ago by Oliver Goldsmith, doesn't have much to say today, and Charlotte Moore, the director of the Irish Repertory Theater's production, wisely doesn't try to pretend otherwise. Instead she lets the actors play with the audience, a restrained glee that is hard to peg at first but ultimately pays off with some great laughs (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. (Genzlinger)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'SONGS FROM AN UNMADE BED' Slight but pithy, this humorous revue of 18 songs with lyrics by Mark Campbell and music by 18 different composers takes a sardonic and explicit look at gay life in New York: ''Sex with an actor. What was I thinking?'' (1:10). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. In repertory with ''Score.'' (Midgette)

'TERRORISM' Every element of everyday existence participates in the title activity of this smart, snarling shaggy dog of a play by the Siberian-born Preyskyakov brothers. But while Will Frears's production makes its thematic points clearly, it is still searching for a style that convincingly blends Slavic urgency and ennui (1:20). The Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)

*'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

'TROLLS' Dick DeBenedictis and Bill Dyer's semi-terrific musical is about gay men who aren't as young as they used to be. With a glorious opening, likable characters, affecting but derivative music, humor that ranges from tired to classic, too much sentiment and just enough irreverence, the show is worth seeing but needs some work (1:35). Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, (212)239-6200. (Gates)

'WOMAN BEFORE A GLASS' Peggy Guggenheim, doyenne of the 20th-century art world, becomes the latest public figure to be exhumed onstage in this one-woman show starring the formidable Mercedes Ruehl. Written by Lanie Robertson, the play is gaudy and moderately fun (1:40). Promenade, Broadway at 76th Street, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)

Off Off Broadway

'KNOCK ON WOOD' Thanks to Steven Spielberg and Bob Dole, the bar is fairly high these days for war stories, and Samuel Calderon comes nowhere near clearing it with ''Knock on Wood,'' a monologue about his perfectly ordinary service in the Israeli military during the Yom Kippur War. He sees a few moderately distressing sights, his friend is injured, and that's about it (1:30). 13th Street Repertory, 50 West 13th Street, (212)352-3101. (Genzlinger)

'PLANET BANANA' If you think women's gymnastics would be more interesting if performed in outfits from the Victoria's Secret catalog, then ''Planet Banana'' is the place for you. Featuring incongruous stunts, moderately difficult circus routines and a sketchy searching-for-love story, the show is as enjoyable as it is raucous (1:25). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, (212)868-4444. (Genzlinger)

'UNCLE JIMMY'S DIRTY BASEMENT' This strange brew of Catskills humor, heavy metal and filthy-minded puppets has developed a cult following downtown, and its bizarre band rocks out to some of the most bombastically silly songs since Spinal Tap's ''Big Bottom.'' But when the music stops, the show meanders without an involving story (1:15). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, (212)477-5288. ( Zinoman)

Long-Running Shows

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'DESSA ROSE' It's easy to admire Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (''Ragtime'') for their belief in the humanist potential in musical theater. But their new show isn't likely to win many converts to the cause (2:30). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'THE FALL' Through Kenneth Nowell's looking glass, Hamlet is reversed, and a daughter, Jill, is driven mad by her mother's ghost. Was the mother's expected death natural or an act of murder by her father, who too quickly married her mother's sister? A strong cast and superb director, Kate Marks, manage a tone that teeters effectively between the tragic and the hilarious, and one is left unexpectedly shaken (1:40). The Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212)307-9467, closing on Sunday. (Honor Moore)

'KING A' Het Laagland's variation on the legend of King Arthur for children features five energetic actors, 40 tiny chairs, several a cappella musical numbers, occasional swordplay and frequent inspiring affirmations. The show is inventive and full of physical energy, but in the end may be a little too talky for its intended audience (1:20.) New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Gates)

'MEMORY HOUSE' Dianne Wiest's warm, engaging performance provides the juicy filling in Kathleen Tolan's play about a tense standoff between a mother and her teenage daughter over their differing philosophies of life. As she bakes a pie -- from scratch, mind you -- Ms. Wiest performs the still more challenging feat of keeping our sympathies keenly attuned to the appealing emotional undercurrents in Ms. Tolan's slight but sensitively drawn two-hander (1:30). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'A PICASSO' Jeffrey Hatcher's play is a formulaic two-hander set in occupied Paris in 1941. Pablo Picasso (Dennis Boutsikaris) is brought in for interrogation by the severe Miss Fischer (Jill Eikenberry), who works for the German cultural ministry (1:10). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212)581-1212, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

*'SHOCKHEADED PETER' A gorgeous ''nasty picture book'' of a musical, in which badly behaved Victorian tots come to ghastly ends. Inspired by Heinrich Hoffmann's droll collection of grisly bedtime stories, ''Shockheaded Peter'' is both the silliest and most sinister show in town. It is also one of the smartest (1:40). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)

*'THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD' Working off a template popularized by Anna Deveare Smith, this engaging, smart and scrupulously balanced docudrama is an oral history of the gentrification of Carroll Gardens. Deanna Pacelli convincingly portrays an F Train full of ethnic types who document how the neighborhood moved from crack to baguettes (1:00). Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at East Ninth Street, East Village, (212)477-5288, closing on Sunday. (Zinoman)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

'A LOT LIKE LOVE' (PG-13, 107 minutes) A film that isn't half bad and every so often is pretty good, filled with real sentiment, worked-through performances and a story textured enough to sometimes feel a lot like life. (Manohla Dargis)

'THE AMITYVILLE HORROR' (R, 89 minutes) Low-key creepy rather than outright scary, this remake of the soporific 1979 horror flick is a modest improvement on the original. But this time don't get attached to the family dog. (Dargis)

'BORN INTO BROTHELS' (Not rated, 85 minutes, in Bengali) A lovely documentary about children of prostitutes in Calcutta. (A.O. Scott)

'BROTHERS' (R, 113 minutes, in Danish) This gripping psychological drama is Susanne Bier's second film to examine events worthy of Greek tragedy through a contemporary therapeutic lens; wartime trauma and sibling rivalry collide. (Stephen Holden)

'CRASH' (R, 107 minutes) A gaggle of Los Angeles residents from various economic and ethnic backgrounds collide, sometimes literally, in the course of a hectic 36-hour period. Well-intentioned, impressively acted, but ultimately a speechy, ponderous melodrama of liberal superstition masquerading as realism. (Scott)

'DOMINION PREQUEL TO THE EXORCIST' (R, 115 minutes) The solemn, high-minded attempt to redeem ''The Exorcist'' franchise is the movie equivalent of retrieving the eggshells, coffee grounds and banana peels from the trash and presenting them as art; the ingredients still stink. (Holden)

*'ENRON: THE SMARTEST GUYS IN THE ROOM' (Not rated, 110 minutes) This sober, informative chronicle of the biggest business scandal of the decade is almost indecently entertaining, partly because it offers some of the most satisfying movie villains in quite some time. Recommended for everyone except those likely to be in the Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey K. Skilling jury pools. (Scott)

*'FUNNY HA HA' (Not rated, 89 minutes) Twenty-somethings looking for love, direction and fulfilling work -- this smart, cheaply made first feature is low-key, note-perfect and sneakily artful. (Scott)

*'THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY' (PG, 103 minutes) In this hugely likable, long-awaited film of Douglas Adams's beloved book, the world comes to an end not just with a bang, but also with something of a shrug. Nicely directed with heart and sincerity by the newcomer Garth Jennings, the film features Martin Freeman, a sensational Sam Rockwell and some gloriously singing dolphins. (Dargis)

*'THE HOLY GIRL' (Not rated, 106 minutes; in Spanish) The Argentine director Lucrecia Martel's second feature is an oblique, feverish exploration of religious ecstasy and adolescent sexuality. Hard to classify, other than as a miraculous piece of filmmaking. (Scott)

'HOUSE OF WAX' (R, 105 minutes) Not the depilatory sequel to ''Beauty Shop,'' but rather a remake of the 1953 Vincent Price creep show, with Paris Hilton, Elisha Cuthbert and a bunch of guys menaced by maniacs in the Louisiana backwoods. Grisly and slow. (Scott)

'THE INTERPRETER' (PG-13, 123 minutes) A political thriller, both apolitical and unthrilling, notable for two accomplishments: turning the United Nations into a movie set, and, even more remarkably, giving Nicole Kidman the opportunity to embody the suffering of Africans everywhere. (Scott)

'JIMINY GLICK IN LALAWOOD' (R, 90 minutes) This frantic comic hodgepodge built around Martin Short's popular Comedy Central character is an intermittently funny free-for-all that suffers from attention deficit disorder. (Holden)

'KICKING AND SCREAMING' (PG, 90 minutes) A so-so family sports comedy with Will Ferrell acting goofy, and Robert Duvall (as the father of Mr. Ferrell's character and a rival youth soccer coach) parodying his performance in ''The Great Santini.'' The story follows a venerable Hollywood formula: its lesson is that winning isn't everything, but of course once you learn this lesson, you'll win big, anyway. (Scott)

'KINGDOM OF HEAVEN' (R, 145 minutes) A plaintive period epic from Ridley Scott, starring Orlando Bloom, about the bloody orgies of piety known as the Crusades. The film proves yet again that it takes an actor as self-serious as Russell Crowe to carry the weight of Mr. Scott's ambitions; it also takes a story Mr. Scott himself can really believe in. (Dargis)

'KINGS AND QUEEN' (No rating, 150 minutes, in French) A film about a hapless man and a woman who is alternately, perhaps even simultaneously, a mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust and subject of loathing, this latest work from the wildly talented French filmmaker Arnaud Desplechin is essential viewing. (Dargis)

'KUNG FU HUSTLE' (R, 95 minutes, in Mandarin and Cantonese) This kinetic, exhausting, relentlessly entertaining film throws scraps of a half-century of international pop culture into a fast-whirling blender. (Scott)

'LADIES IN LAVENDER' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Two dames of the British empire (Judi Dench and Maggie Smith) inhabit spinster sisters in Cornwall who nurse a handsome Polish violinist back to health in 1936. Amiably bogus. (Holden)

'LAYER CAKE' (R, 104 minutes) Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J.J. Connolly, this is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. The star of this show is the very good British actor Daniel Craig, who slices through ''Layer Cake'' like a knife. (Dargis)

*'LOOK AT ME' (PG-13, 110 minutes; in French) A delicious comedy, as tart as it is sweet, of ambition, miscommunication and egoism. Set in a Paris that seems to be populated entirely by artists and writers, the film affectionately tweaks the bad manners and complacency of France's intellectual elite. (Scott)

'MA MERE' (NC-17, 110 minutes, in French) Avid sensation-seeking in this film is such a grim affair that after a short while, the spectacle of its aimless characters bending themselves out of shape in the pursuit of depravity mutates from titillating to pathetic to laughable. (Holden)

'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers not much more than glimpses. (Scott)

'MINDHUNTERS' (R, 106 minutes) This thriller reimagines Agatha Christie's ''Ten Little Indians'' as ''Eight Little Profilers'': a team of would-be F.B.I. agents, isolated at a training compound to solve a simulated crime, soon realize that a real serial killer walks among them. The film may find a cult audience among fans of schlock cinema seeking a giggle and a scream. (Dana Stevens)

'MONSTER-IN-LAW' (PG-13, 102 minutes) Jane Fonda finds a zany, good-natured verve in a dragon-lady caricature that mirrors a comedy so desperate to avoid offending that it runs in panic from every issue it brings up but refuses to address. (Holden)

*'MYSTERIOUS SKIN' (Not rated, 99 minutes) Gregg Araki, one-time bad boy of the New Queer Cinema, has made a heartbreaking and surpassingly beautiful film out of Scott Heim's clear-eyed novel about two Kansas boys dealing with the consequences of their sexual abuse by a Little League coach. Superb performances, especially by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. (Scott)

'OLDBOY' (R, 118 minutes; in Korean) The latest in dubious pulp-fiction cool, ''Oldboy'' centers on a seemingly ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik), who, after being mysteriously imprisoned, goes on an exhausting rampage, seeking answers and all manner of bloody revenge. (Dargis)

'PALINDROMES' (Not rated, 100 minutes) The same backward and forward: dud. (Scott)

'ROBOTS' (PG, 89 minutes) This computer-animated film's setting, a world made entirely for and by clanky mechanical gizmos, is rendered with impressive skill and imagination. Otherwise, it's the usual junkyard assemblage of celebrity voices, lame pop-cultural allusions and heartwarming lessons. (Scott)

'SAHARA' (PG-13, 130 minutes) It may not be ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' but this screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. (Holden)

'SHAKE HANDS WITH THE DEVIL: THE JOURNEY OF ROMEO DALLAIRE' (no rating, 91 minutes) The unsettling documentary follows Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian commander of the tiny United Nations peacekeeping force stationed in Rwanda in 1994 as he returns to that African country 10 years after mass slaughter of 800,000 during his watch. (Holden) 'SIN CITY' (R, 126 minutes) Based on the comic book series of the same name by Frank Miller, this slavishly faithful screen adaptation tracks the ups and downs of tough guys and dolls. ''Sin City'' has been made with such scrupulous care and obvious love for its genre influences that it's a shame that the movie is kind of a bore. (Dargis)

'6IXTYNIN9' (R, 118 minutes) The Thai director Pen-ek Ratanarjuang's propulsive black comedy follows an unemployed secretary (Lalita Panyopas) as she struggles to begin a new life with money stolen from a local gangster. Despite drama-school performances and clear signs of budget constraint (most of the action takes place inside the same modest apartment), ''6ixtynin9'' ramps up the body count with energy, wit and a sustained awareness of the economically depressed world outside the frame. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

*'STAR WARS III: REVENGE OF THE SITH' (PG-13, 142 minutes) George Lucas saved the best -- or at least one of the best -- for the end. Or for the middle. In any case, the saga is now complete, and has regained much of its original glory. (Scott)

*'3-IRON' (not rated, 87 minutes; in Korean) A pop fable of urban loneliness that showcases the Korean director Kim Ki-Duk's witty sense of form. It's a thoroughly modern movie with elements of silent film, a love story shot with horror-film techniques, and a charming blend of style and sentiment. (Scott)

*'TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE' (R, 95 minutes) This intimate portrait of the legendary octogenarian cinematographer Haskell Wexler, filmed by his son, is an artistic father-son power struggle for control of a movie being made. It is the richest documentary of its kind since Terry Zwigoff's ''Crumb.'' (Holden)

*'A TOUT DE SUITE' (Not rated, 96 minutes; in French) This downbeat homage to the French New Wave is a small, nearly perfect film that follows the sad chain of events when a headstrong 19-year-old art student goes on the lam with a Moroccan bank robber. (Holden)

'2009 LOST MEMORIES' (R, 136 minutes; in Korean and Japanese) A beautifully designed and ambitious example of Korean cinema, this film confronts the political and racial enmity between Korea and Japan with astonishing directness and originality. Blending action, time travel and heartfelt drama, the film posits a future in which Japan has conquered Korea and won World War II. (Catsoulis)

'WALK ON WATER' (Not rated, 104 minutes) The director Eytan Fox takes on the controversial subject of Israeli nationalism in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Despite an implausible climax, this movie's quiet intelligence sneaks up on you. (Stevens)

'WILD SAFARI 3-D: A SOUTH AFRICAN ADVENTURE' (Not rated, 45 minutes) A choppy tour of South African flora and fauna. Kids will love the romping lion cubs and elephant calves, while adults will be grateful by this travelogue's vibrancy and brevity. (Ned Martel)

'XXX: STATE OF THE UNION' (PG-13, 94 minutes). A wildly silly action flick in which all that stand between the American people and the yoke of tyranny are big guns, bigger breasts, the thud-thud-thud of commercial rap and the multiplatform artist known as Ice Cube (ne O'Shea Jackson). (Dargis)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

ALVIN YOUNGBLOOD HART (Thursday). Syncopated fingerpicking and a sly rasp of a voice show Alvin Youngblood Hart's blues roots, but there's no telling which way he'll decide to stretch them with his band Muscle Theory. 7:30 p.m., Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212)576-1155. $18 in advance; $20 at the door. (Jon Pareles)

*BEENIE MAN, VYBZ KARTEL (Saturday) Two of dancehall reggae's biggest names come to town for what should be a manic, exuberant night of shouting and singing, by turns silly and ferocious. Vybz Kartel specializes in witty, rapid-fire narratives, whereas Beenie Man is less single-minded: an astonishingly versatile performer, he can go from a pop sing-along to an a cappella sex rhyme to an infectious dance track in a matter of minutes -- and often does. 10 p.m., Elite Ark, 900 Sheffield Avenue, at Wortman Avenue, Canarsie, Brooklyn, (718)649-6535. $40 in advance sold out; only $50 tickets left. (Kelefa Sanneh)

BRAZILIAN GIRLS (Wednesday) Boasting zero members from Brazil and only one girl (the multilingual surrealist jazz singer Sabina Sciubba), this downtown quartet, arising from the arty Nublu club scene, plays its erotic, electronica-inflected reggae and bossa novas on keyboards, computers, bass and drums. 9 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800. $20; $25 at the door. (Laura Sinagra)

(Pareles)

CORDERO (Tomorrow) Mixing the open atmospherics of the Southwest with the gritty feel of the Brooklyn art scene, the bilingual Ani Cordero, who has worked with Calexico and Giant Sand, and her band make guitar rock that gives urban brashness some borderland mystery. 11:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. $10. (Sinagra)

CHARANGA SOLEIL (Tonight) Pulling together an Afro-Caribbean diaspora, Charanga Soleil mixes the courtly Cuban charanga (for a group including flute and violin) with touches of Congolese guitar rumba, West African kora, Haitian rara drumming and more.

EDAN (Tuesday) The Boston indie rap polymath Edan distinguishes himself by doing it all -- DJ-ing, rapping and creating his own sample-based tracks that pay homage to late-80's hip-hop. The Other Music record store brings him into town for a performance and extended DJ set. 9 p.m. to 4 a.m., APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)414-4245. $5.(Sinagra)

*ROBBIE FULKS (Wednesday) The latest album of curveball Chicago country by Robbie Fulks once again prompts head shaking as to why this off-off-Opry wiseacre isn't a more famous songwriter (or at least a little bigger and richer). As alt-country fans know, he's a crackerjack guitarist and a charismatic performer to boot. 10 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. $10; $12 at the door. (Sinagra)

GLASS CANDY (Tonight) With a name that brilliantly recalls suburbia's deadliest home decor, these theatrical Portland no-wavers appropriately perform their fractured dance music in Lit's hipster dungeon. 9 p.m., Lit Lounge, 93 Second Avenue, near Fifth Street, East Village, (212)777-7987. $6. (Sinagra)

GOLDIE LOOKIN' CHAIN (Monday) If the idea of eight puerile Ali G dress-alikes rapping about whose mother has a penis appeals, these cheeky Welshmen deliver, slinging silly rhymes over thin, ironic beats. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. $15; $17 at the door.

HALLUCINOGEN ( Tonight) Since the 1999 release of ''Twisted'' (Twisted), a hallmark of electronica's psychotropic Goa trance style, Hallucinogen's Simon Posford has moved further into a slicker, more cleanly produced brand of dance dub. 10 p.m., Spirit, 530 West 27th, Chelsea, (212)268-9477. $30. (Sinagra)

Free. (Sanneh)

*THE HOMOSEXUALS (Monday and Tuesday) Though this seminal London band's stylistic forays placed them on a par with other polestars of 70's and 80's British art punk, they never rose to name-drop prominence. Last year's three-disc compilation of everything they ever recorded (they never released a full-length LP) gave them some deserved due. Monday at 7:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)420-1466. $15; $18 at the door. Tuesday at 11 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)475-7088 or www.rothkonyc.com. $10. (Sinagra)

JULIETTE & THE LICKS (Saturday) Rilo Kiley's Jennie Lewis isn't the only child actress named Lewis reinventing herself as a rocker.

The Superchunk leader Mac MacCaughan's long-standing side project Portastatic opens. 8 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600. $18; $20 at the door. (Sinagra)

*KRAFTWERK (Wednesday) Back in the 1970's, four German rockers billed themselves as ''the man-machine.'' They abandoned standard instruments for blipping synthesizers and ticking synthetic drums and sang in determinedly emotionless voices about the robotic pleasures of the modern world. They returned in the late 90's to capitalize on the techno scene they helped inspire, and they have recast their old songs from analog to digital. 6:30 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212)564-4882. $45; $47 day of. (Pareles)

LADYBUG (Tonight) The soothing yet strong female rapper from the groovy mid-90's ''hip-hop bebop'' group Digable Planets will release a solo album before her old trio tries a reunion later this year.

LOUIS THE XIV (Thursday) Like the metal parodists the Darkness, this energetic San Diego band riffs on glam-rock excess for hipster fans who find the group's anthems to flagrant groupie sex as hilarious as Spinal Tap. 9 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-5252. $16; $18 at the door.(Sinagra)

KYP MALONE, KIM AND MATT (Tonight) With his ethereal falsetto and coronal afro, Kyp Malone is known to many as a vocalist-guitarist in the spacy New York group TV on the Radio. For years, though, he was a fixture in San Francisco's indie scene. Lately he's been doing his own thing. The poppers Kim and Matt fill out the bill. 8 p.m., Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212)388-0077. $10. (Sinagra)

LEO NOCENTELLI, ZIGABOO MODELISTE, ROBERT WALTER AND DOUG WIMBISH (Tonight) Leo Nocentelli has been scratching the backbeat and teasing the blues for decades as the guitarist in the Meters, the great New Orleans funk band. He's jamming here with the Meters drummer Zigaboo Modeliste, the Greyboy All-Stars jazz funk keyboardist Robert Walter and the Living Color bassist and dub artist Doug Wimbish. 10:30 p.m., B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)997-4144. $20. (Pareles)

PLAID (Thursday) A ''laptop set'' from the British duo of Ed Handley and Andy Turner, purveyors of the opaque, at times aloof, techno associated with the once seminal Warp label. Their experience making cerebral electronic music stretches back to membership in the influential mid-90's act Black Dog Productions. 9 p.m., Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)475-7088, or www.rothkonyc.com $20. (Sinagra)

*THE RAVEONETTES (Tuesday) Clearing away the garage noise of its debut, this Danish duo strives for pure 60's pop classicism. Its new album incorporates rock history, from girl groups to surf rock to punk, as well as historic rock in the form of cameos by Ronnie Spector, Suicide's Martin Rev and the Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker. 9 p.m., Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, (201)653-1703. $15; sold out. (Sinagra)

ROCK AND ROLL CIRCUS (Sunday) The downtown party mavens Georgie Seville, DJ Justine D., Michael T. and friends celebrate their fifth year of libidinous holiday eve dress-up bashes. There's a circus theme, but you suspect that the DJ's will stick to the preferred mix of disco and danceable post-punk, both old and neo. 10 p.m., Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Manhattan, (212)645-5156. $15 with Web site discount; $25 without. (Sinagra)

SOUKOUS STARS (Sunday) Soukous is the Congolese music that sends guitars twining over a lilting rumba beat, and the Soukous Stars include the guitarist Lokassa Ya Mbongo; the bassist Nguoma Lokito; and the more recent addition, the guitarist Chico Mawatu, not to mention four female dancers. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)239-6200. $20.

(Sinagra)

*WIDE RIGHT (Today) One of the more winsome singer-guitarists around is this rocking bar band's chatty, no-nonsense frontwoman, Leah Archibald. This Buffalo transplant makes life as a musician mom look easy while penning sometimes scathing, shrewd domestic portraits and observant odes to rust-belt culture. 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, Brooklyn Heights, (718)834-0069. $4. (Sinagra)

THE WRENS (Tonight) They may write about life in their home state, New Jersey, but it's not with a Fountains of Wayne smirk. With their routinely understated, meditative albums and their intense, up-tempo live shows, these noise-artist indie rockers offer two different, entirely appropriate responses to suburban tensions. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111. $15. (Sinagra)

(Chinen)

*PAUL MOTIAN TRIO 2000 +1 (Tuesday through next Sunday) The lean, suggestive drumming of Paul Motian has been a common thread on several fine recent albums, along with his dreamlike compositions.

(Chinen)

*NICHOLAS PAYTON QUINTET (Tonight and tomorrow) The trumpeter Nicholas Payton first grabbed the jazz world's attention with his remarkable feeling for early New Orleans jazz and more recently made an obstinately spacey funk record, but he has spent most of his professional time dealing with the rich languages of post-1960 jazz.

(Ratliff)

TEST 3 (Tomorrow) Test no longer plays on subway platforms, but it's still an underground outfit, thanks to an unwavering ethos of freeform group improvisation -- and the inexplicable telepathy of its multi-reedists, Daniel Carter and Sabir Mateen. 9:30 p.m., Les Gallery Clemente Soto Velez, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side; www.visionfestival.org; $15. (Chinen)

Museums

*AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION: AFRICAN-AMERICAN ART FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Roberta Smith)

AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' view of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)

AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' through July 10. Jewelry dating to prehistoric times is used here to lend credence to contemporary works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212)769-5100. (Smith)

*ASIA SOCIETY AND QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'EDGE OF DESIRE: RECENT ART IN INDIA,' through June 5. A highly selective, multigenerational survey of different kinds of contemporary art being made in India; embracing craft, folk and tribal traditions as well as popular culture and academic modernism. The smaller portion is at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212)288-6400; the more expansive and varied section at the Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700. Also at Queens: ''Fatal Love.''(Holland Cotter)

BARD GRADUATE CENTER FOR STUDIES IN THE DECORATIVE ARTS, DESIGN AND CULTURE: 'CHERISHED POSSESSIONS: A NEW ENGLAND LEGACY,' through June 5. More than 100 choice objects from that vast attic of family relics, historic New England, from a box with two worm-eaten pieces of 17th-century bread to a grand Copley portrait. Thanks to bright captioning, this show conveys a sense of family connection with the objects. 18 West 86th Street, (212)501-3000. (Glueck)

*BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'BASQUIAT,' through June 5. Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-88) wrote, painted and drew his way to fame (usually on the same surface) with a loquacious style that mixed mediums and gave visual voice to the glories, history and pain of blackness. Despite a few glitches, this generous retrospective provides an exhilarating account of his short, innovative career. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Smith)

*BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. (See above.) (Smith)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES: DESIGNING FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely tech-y show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'etre is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)

COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS: WORKS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through Sept. 4. Shifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. (See above.) (Smith)

*EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'MEXICO, THE REVOLUTION AND BEYOND, PHOTOGRAPHS BY CASASOLA 1900-1940,' through July 31. This extraordinary show of work from a photo agency established by Agustin Victor Casasola in Mexico City has the span of a Greek epic and the nested themes and subplots of a picaresque novel, with revolutionary heroes and a vivid cast of everyday people. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)

*SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ART OF TOMORROW: HILLA REBAY AND SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM,' through Aug. 10. Appreciated more for her role as a founder of the Guggenheim Museum's forerunner, the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, Hilla Rebay (1890-1967) is finally given her due as a painter in a full-dress display of her work over six decades. This first chance to see it en bloc reveals a painter whose spirit, energy and invention, especially in collage, come as a revelation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500. (Glueck)

SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DANIEL BUREN: THE EYE OF THE STORM,' through June 8. Mr. Buren has devised a lumbering, 81-foot-tall construction, mirrored floor to ceiling. Imagine a glass office tower slammed through the front of the building. The spiraling ramps and circular roof complete themselves in the mirrored reflections; there is not much to the work beyond that. (See above.) (Michael Kimmelman)

*QUEEN SOFiA SPANISH INSTITUTE: 'FROM GOYA TO SOROLLA,' through July 30. More than 75 pictures from the Hispanic Society, celebrating its centenary; starting with Goya's grave portrait of Pedro Mocarte, they track an arc to figures like Francisco Nunez Losada and salon virtuosi like Ignacio Zuloaga and Joaquin Sorolla. 684 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)628-0420. (Kimmelman)

INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LARRY CLARK,' through June 5. The controversial creator of two influential photography books -- ''Tulsa'' (1971) and ''Teenage Lust'' (1983) -- and director of the brilliant movie ''Kids'' (1995) has his first retrospective. The provocative Mr. Clark specializes in the dark and seamy side of American youth culture, and his best works are unnervingly intimate, morally disturbing and beautiful. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000. (Ken Johnson)

*JAPAN SOCIETY: 'LITTLE BOY: THE ARTS OF JAPAN'S EXPLODING SUBCULTURE,' through July 24. Masterminded by the artist-writer-entrepreneur Takashi Murakami, this eye-boggling show traces the unexamined legacy of World War II as played out in Japan's popular culture. With Godzilla and Hello Kitty presiding, it reveals how this culture was twisted and darkened by the otaku, or geek, subculture, which has in turn influenced younger artists. 333 East 47th Street, (212)832-1155. (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12, 2006. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Cotter)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DEFINING YONGLE: IMPERIAL ART IN EARLY-15TH-CENTURY CHINA,' through July 10. Sequestered in the exquisite Chinese decorative arts galleries, this show is both perfect and messy. Its porcelain, metalwork, embroidery and ivory highlight the astounding craftsmanship of the imperial workshops under the Ming emperor Yongle, and reflect the miscegenation of Asian cultures at a time when most roads led to China. (See above.) (Smith)

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'MAX ERNST: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through July 10. Despite and because of Ernst's being one of modernism's mystery men, he remains of interest, and there are intriguing things in this survey: from early Surrealist paintings, to near-abstract images generated by chance techniques, to the collage-style books some consider his masterworks. But only when he responds to specific events, like war, does his art snap into focus. (See above.) (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'COMING HOME!: SELF-TAUGHT ARTISTS, THE BIBLE AND THE AMERICAN SOUTH,' through July 24. A new small museum devoted to art related to the Bible gets off to a lively start with a big show of artworks by 73 untrained Southern Christian evangelicals. Many names familiar to followers of 20th-century folk and outsider art are on hand, including William Edmondson, Minnie Evans, the Rev. Howard Finster and Sister Gertrude Morgan. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)

*MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'EL BARRIO: PUERTO RICAN NEW YORK,' through June 12. A snapshot of El Barrio -- East Harlem, or Spanish Harlem -- as seen through archival images and pictures by the contemporary photographer Hiram S. Maristany taken at a revolutionary political moment in the 1960's and early 70's. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Cotter)

MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'CHRIS MARKER,' through June 13. Made entirely on the computer, ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' -- a two-channel, eight-screen DVD with which this French underground film legend makes his New York debut as an installation artist -- gives the horrors of World War I an eroded beauty and haunting pertinence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Smith)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' through April 2006. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY,' through Sept. 5. The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. (See above.) (Glueck)

NEUE GALERIE: 'PORTRAITS OF AN AGE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, 1900-1938,' through June 6. More than 100 faces shot by 35 photographers. It's a savvy show that homes in on the changing ways people presented themselves in an era of rapidly turning social values. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Kimmelman)

*STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: CHRIS OFILI: 'AFRO-MUSES,' through July 3. More than 100 delirious watercolors by this familiar British artist, warm-up exercises for his daily routine. They depict imaginary men and women, head on or in silhouette, in African garb, and in deep, swimmy colors -- portraits as modest and charming as the work that made Mr. Ofili famous is outsize and occasionally over the top. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Kimmelman)

STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'BILL TRAYLOR AND WILLIAM EDMONDSON AND THE MODERNIST IMPULSE,' through July 3. The work of two self-taught proto-modern artists whose beautifully complementary achievements argue against the usual dualities, but offer further evidence that African-American folk art is as great as any art or music that this country has produced. (See above.) (Smith)

THE UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO: VISION AND CONTINUITY,' through Sept. 4. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces that inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)

WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'SUE DE BEER: BLACK SUN,' through June 24. In a walk-in pink castle, ''Black Sun'' is a two-screen video about teenage girlhood, which alternates passages of lyrical visual beauty and emotional poignancy with periods of aimless tedium. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)

Galleries: Uptown

ANTHONY CARO Four tabletop pieces from the 1970's and 80's, masterly exercises in balletic form and balance in rusting steel, by this reigning British standard-bearer of modernist abstract sculpture. They are elegant and a serious pleasure. Mitchell-Inness & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11.(Kimmelman)

*'PROVIDING FOR THE AFTERLIFE: BRILLIANT ARTIFACTS FROM SHANDONG' The archaeology boom in China continues, and the 50 objects from Han dynasty tombs in this show are being exhibited in the United States for the first time. China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212)744-8181, through June 4. (Cotter)

JULIAN SCHNABEL This excellent selection of 21 large and mostly early paintings includes some of the very works that made Mr. Schnabel the most hotly talked-about artist of the Neo-Expressionist era. C & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through June 4. (Johnson)

*RICHARD WATHEN A young British artist plugs some 21st-century energy into 18th-century portraiture, painting with a matte, flat delicacy that gives familiar poses a new-born freshness, and not only when clothing is subtracted. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through June 16. (Smith)

Galleries: 57th Street

DON COLLEY: 'FALL GUYS & ZEITGEISTS' Whether or not you like his images of thuggish clowns and romantic skies, you have to admit that Mr. Colley's new pieces are technically remarkable. They appear to be small, beautifully worked encaustic paintings, but they are, in fact, kiln-fired glazed ceramic tiles. George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212)644-5665, through June. (Johnson)

LARRY RIVERS Boldly setting up as a figural painter in the holy days of Abstract Expressionism, Rivers (1923-2002) early on produced portraits, nudes and takeoffs on historical events, like his sendup of the corny 19th-century painting by Emanuel Leutze, ''Washington Crossing the Delaware.'' This bulging retrospective covers work from the early 1950's to his death, ending with the rather forgettable fashion images of his last years. At his best, he was a painter to reckon with. Marlborough Gallery, 40 West 57th Street, (212)541-4900; Marlborough Chelsea, 211 West 19th Street, (212)463-8634, through June 4. (Glueck)

AIDA RUILOVA: 'LETS GO' A participant in the last Whitney Biennial and P.S. 1's current ''Greater New York,'' Ms. Ruilova makes short and briefly gripping multi-screen video works in a style you might call Neo-Goth Surrealistic Cubism. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)445-0444, through June 4. (Johnson)

Galleries: SoHo

TINA BARNEY The photographer known for her large, sumptuous color photographs of rich people often caught in situations of subtle psychological tension presents portraits shot in Spain and Germany that are included in her book ''The Europeans.'' Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212)431-0166, closing June 4. (Johnson)

Galleries: Chelsea

DEAN BYINGTON Skillfully blending the handmade and the mechanical, the paintings of this San Francisco artist use patterns suggestive of lacy wallpaper and images from 19th-century engravings to evoke landscapes and their not always peaceful inhabitants. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)255-8450, through June 18. (Smith)

IAN COOPER With a series of works that focus on the child star of the ''Poltergeist'' movies, this young artist adds his distinctive preoccupation with popular culture and the spirit world to the black-on-black, Goth-leaning current in new art. Cue Art Foundation, 511 West 25th Street, (212)206-3583, through June 4. (Smith)

CHERYL DONEGAN: 'OLD, TEMPORARY' While video-projected images of colorful, cheap toys unfold on the wall, a woman's maniacally cheerful voice recites a rapid-fire litany of affirmations composed for Amway salespeople: ''I am the best at what I do. There is no one better. I get the job done,'' and so on. It is funny and scary. Oliver Kamm/5BE, 504 West 22nd Street, (212)255-0979, through June 4. (Johnson)

ROBBERT FLICK: 'TRAJECTORIES' With the cinematic idea that successive views give a dynamic sense of place, Mr. Flick mounted a video camera in his car window. He packs the results in grid formation on big sheets that give off the vibes of a country road, a city street, a desertscape. The whole is more than the sum of its tiny parts. Robert Mann, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212)989-7600, through June 18. (Glueck)

NEETA MADAHAR Large, handsome, eerily unreal color photographs of real birds attracted to a free-form grid of tree branches by a shifting cast of birdfeeders. Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)627-2410, through June 11. (Smith)

RICHARD PRINCE A well-chosen assortment of works from the past 25 years by the influential Neo-Pop semiotician includes joke paintings, car hood sculptures and photographs of scruffy upstate New York landscapes. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212)206-9300, through June 18. (Johnson)

MICHAEL RYAN Using his training in the art of decorative marbleizing, this self-taught painter creates dreamy, primordial landscapes sparsely populated by bizarrely abstracted animals and people. Together, the brushy painting and the visionary imagery create a scary, feverish feeling. Andrew Edlin, 529 West 20th Street, (212)206-9723, through June 4. (Johnson)

'SCULPTURE' This judicious small selection of three-dimensional works includes a rustic dream house by Vito Acconci; videos showing through an antique Asian iron gate by Nam June Paik; big, smooth white birds by Hiraki Sawa; and an amazing, life-size stainless steel tree by Roxy Paine. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through June 25. (Johnson)

STURTEVANT: 'PUSH AND SHOVE' The artist known for copying works by Warhol, Johns and other contemporary artists presents a darkly elegant installation of fake Duchamps, including a ceiling of 1,200 scrotum-like coal bags, a urinal, two bottle racks and a snow shovel. Perry Rubenstein, 527 West 23rd Street and 526 West 24th Street, (212)627-8000, through June 18. (Johnson)

Other Galleries

*MIKE BOUCHET The main piece in this show is a recreation of Walter De Maria's gallery-filling 1977 ''New York Earth Room,'' in this case made of topsoil from Home Depot and compost from Rikers Island. To fill the craftsy requirements of the present art market, there are Tom Cruise sculptures and paintings of soft drink labels upstairs. Maccarone Inc., 45 Canal Street, Lower East Side, (212)431-4977, through Aug. 28. (Cotter)

*ALBERTO CASADO: TODO CLANDESTINO, TODO POPULAR,' This young artist uses a technique involving painting on glass and aluminum foil to create shimmering, faux-kitsch works about politics, religion and ordinary life in Cuba. Art in General, 79 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-0473, through June 25.(Johnson)

MICHAEL ELMGREEN AND INGAR DRAGSET: 'END STATION' The Fur-Lined Teacup Award goes to this art duo, who have meticulously transformed the basement here into a nearly full-scale subway station. Torn posters and graffiti evoke the 1980's. A metaphor for how the political protests of that decade were stopped in their tracks? Bohen Foundation, 415 West 13th Street, meatpacking district, (212)414-4575, through July 1. (Smith)

'GLASS, SERIOUSLY' This fine selection of artworks in glass, picked by the independent curator Lilly Wei, includes teardrops by Kiki Smith; hand grenades by Kristin Oppenheim; vessels that spell ''invisible'' by Rob Wynne; a kind of stained-glass window made of stacked found wine bottles, by Jean Shin and Brian Ripel; and an elegant bowed panel of frosted sea-green glass by Christopher Wilmarth. Dorsky, 11-03 45th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)937-6317, through June 27. (Johnson)

*WYNNE GREENWOOD AND K8 HARDY Wynne Greenwood is best known as the one-person rock trio called Tracy and the Plastics. K8 Hardy is a founder of the gay feminist art collective LTTR. For this show, they collaborated on a video called ''New Report'' in which they play anchorwomen for an alternative television news channel. Reena Spaulings Fine Art, 371 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 477-5006, through June 5. (Cotter)

JUDY LEDGERWOOD: 'SPRING FEVER' With a boldly insouciant touch and vibrantly dissonant colors, this Chicago-based artist makes grid-based pattern paintings using heraldic overtones and punchy mandala compositions of squished balloonlike shapes. Tracy Williams, 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212)229-2757, through June 24. (Johnson)

JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through October. (Johnson)

*AURIE RAMIREZ A remarkable self-taught artist creates a candy-colored but complex universe (in watercolor) of androgynous, dark-haired beauties who usually wear frock coats and pinstriped pants. Her first show anywhere dovetails nicely with smaller debuts of the bristling cannibalizations of texts, images and found materials by Peter Gallo and the collage drawings of an artist known only as Carter. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street, West Village, (212)924-4212, through June 11. (Smith)

DON SUNSERI: 'PIECES FOR A WALL' The appealing small painted and sculpted abstractions made out of found pieces of wood, metal and cardboard in this one-wall exhibition look like the result of a collaboration between Elizabeth Murray and Richard Tuttle. It is interesting to learn that Sunseri, who died in 2001, was once married to Ms. Murray. The Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, near Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)614-0505, through June 16. (Johnson)

Last Chance

'ALEXANDER THE GREAT: TREASURES FROM AN EPIC ERA OF HELLENISM,' Alexander (356-323 B.C.) and his age are evoked in this concentrated show of art and artifacts displaying portrait busts of this legendary Macedonian emperor, ancient coins, advanced Macedonian weaponry and pottery. Onassis Cultural Center, 645 Fifth Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212)486-4448, closing tomorrow. (Glueck)

VICTOR BURGIN: 'THE LITTLE HOUSE' This video meditation on architectural beauty and conflicting male and female desire by a veteran English artist is one of the best, least didactic works of his career. Christine Burgin, 243 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212)462-2668, closing tomorrow. (Smith)

'EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY' Among more than 70 narrative paintings, drawings and prints by a wide range of 20th-century artists are works by Max Beckmann, James Ensor, John Heartfield, KatheKollwitz, Sue Coe, Martha Rosler and Eric Fischl. Galerie St. Etienne, 24 West 57th Street, (212)245-6734, closing today. (Johnson)

AMY GARTRELL: 'HOT HANDS, COLD HEART' The tribulations and infatuations of youth are the subjects of drawings, felt banners and an installation involving faceted glass charms and a lugubrious tree that would have done Edward Gorey proud. Daniel Reich, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)924-4949, closing tomorrow. (Smith)

JAMES GOBEL: 'RIDICULE IS NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF' Fat Rococo-era fops pose on a striped floor against a background of snow-covered rocky peaks in a campy, mural-scale confection made of neatly assembled pieces of colored felt. Kravets/Wehby, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212)352-2238, closing today. (Johnson)

*JACK GOLDSTEIN A hero of the Pictures generation revered by the new Pop artists and theorists of the 80's. His films from the early 70's (from 20 seconds to 5 minutes long) have a cool, deadpan quality recalling early videos of William Wegman. Ed Ruscha-style paintings of lightning storms from the 80's, here and at Metro, are thrillingly cinematic. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212)744-7400, through June 11. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)206-7100, closing today. (Johnson)

TERAO KATSUHIRO, SHINKI TOMOYUKI, YOSHIMUNE KAZUHIRO, YUMOTO MITSUO Four artists, from a Japanese center for the artistically talented but mentally disabled, appear possessed of naive but intense imaginations and formal predilections bordering on compulsive. Phyllis Kind, 136 Greene Street, SoHo, (212)925-1200, closing on Tuesday. (Johnson)

'L.A.' A group show that reflects the sprawl and vitality of the Los Angeles art scene is also so desperately crowded that it seems superfluous, especially given the high profiles of half of the 48 artists. Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)243-3159, closing today. (Smith)

*METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'DIANE ARBUS REVELATIONS' Arbus could be cruel, but tenderness and melancholy were her finest modes of expression as she captured a moment, the anxious 1950's and 60's, and captured New York. Appropriately, she is given the royal treatment at the Met, including some absurdly theatrical galleries, where her work reveals that in the end we are all drawn together by our different flaws. Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, closing on Monday. (Kimmelman)

MUSEUM FOR AFRICAN ART: 'RESONANCE FROM THE PAST' Roughly 90 sculptures, along with a few bead and fabric pieces, from the African holdings of the New Orleans Museum of Art.

*MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'THOMAS DEMAND' A generally stellar midcareer survey of this 40-year-old German artist, who makes life-size reconstructions of scenes, often ones he has come across in photographs, taking his own cinematic works. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400, closing on Monday.(Kimmelman)

ADAM PENDLETON: 'DEEPER DOWN THERE' This young conceptualist lifts verbal phrases from modern African-American literature and music and neatly silkscreens them onto single-color canvases, creating a coolly provocative blend of romantic poetry, identity politics and formalist abstraction. Yvon Lambert, 564 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-3611, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)

*WAYNE THIEBAUD: 'SINCE 1962: A SURVEY' In the early 60's, Mr. Thiebaud arrived at the buttery, thick still-life paintings of commercial food products that perfectly combined formalism, realism and Pop. This excellent small retrospective shows how he got there and some of the places he has been since. Allan Stone, 113 East 90th Street, (212)987-4997, closing today. (Johnson)

QIU SHIHUA: 'INSIGHT' At first, the canvases by this painter from Shenzhen, China, look like nothing more than slightly scuffed expanses of raw fabric. Look again and you discover peaceful, luminously misty landscapes realized with amazing subtlety. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, at 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)414-1169, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

JOHN F. SIMON JR.: 'ENDLESS VICTORY' Mesmerizing animated patterns driven by sophisticated software programs and running on laptop screens; they would make excellent screen savers. One plays inventive variations on Mondrian's ''Victory Boogie Woogie.'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (646)336-7183, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)

JOAN WALLACE, 'VIOLENT POP PAINTINGS' Each of three videos set into white monochrome panels shows a white-frosted cake exploded in slow motion by a shotgun blast.

Dinter, 547 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212)947-2818, closing tomorrow.(Johnson)

*WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'TIM HAWKINSON,' closing on Sunday. On the gee-whiz meter, Mr. Hawkinson skews high.

(Kimmelman)

'WILDER' This tribute to the Los Angeles dealer Nicholas Wilder (1937-1989) presents works by 28 artists who were shown at his gallery from 1965 to 1979. The all-star lineup includes Dan Flavin, Agnes Martin, John McCracken, Richard Tuttle and Cy Twombly.

HEADLINE: Where's the Boeuf?

BYLINE: By Vincent Tournier. 
Vincent Tournier is a professor at the Institute of Political Studies in Grenoble. This article was translated by The Times from the French.

DATELINE: Grenoble, France 

 BODY:
WITH its project for a European Constitution, is Europe reliving the history of the United States? The Europeans take the comparison very seriously: they baptized the assembly charged with writing the document the ''Convention,'' in imitation of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. The president of the Convention, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, even proposed ''Federalist papers'' on the model of those written by the founders of the American democracy.
 Americans would no doubt be astonished by the comparison. Even a cursory look at the Constitutions drawn up by both Conventions demonstrates how far off Mr. Giscard is. In a few pages, the American Constitution established a foundation for the growth of democracy. In 450 pages, the European Constitution -- which establishes power-sharing among European Union members, provides for a foreign minister and full-time president and states more precisely the functions of the union and the member states -- enshrines a plethora of rules and regulations while ignoring the fundamental needs of democracy. When the French vote on Sunday on whether to accept the Constitution, one can ask if a resounding ''non'' that would send the document back to the drawing board would be a far greater service to Europe than the ''oui'' that French and European Union officials are urging. 
 Even before the 105 delegates to the Convention sat down to write the draft Constitution, the European-American comparison was strained. First, of course, the 25 European states are clearly more diverse than the 13 former colonies, with neither the same language nor the same cultural traditions. They are old nations whose identities have been fashioned over the centuries by wars that have pitted one against the other. 
 That's why the debates about the ''European project'' have mainly concerned each nation's prerogatives, each government putting a priority on preserving its sovereignty and assuring itself a leading role in the power structure. Discussions about democratic principles like the separation of powers and fundamental rights have been relegated to the background.
 Second, while the American Constitution stemmed from the fight for independence, the European Constitution is disconnected from history. Even though the union likes to say that Europe was born from the ashes of World War II, it is obvious that there is no particular reason for a European project at this particular moment. 
 That has affected how the Constitution was conceived and written. The participants in the Convention (who were appointed, not elected) certainly have good intentions, but are they worthy of such a lofty task? In exceptional circumstances, when history demands it, exceptional personalities emerge, people with an acute sense of what the times demand. When things are quiet, second-raters take up the job. That is why the ''founders'' of Europe have no hope of one day being considered in the same light as Washington, Madison and Franklin. That is also why, from the beginning, the European Union has been so marked by bureaucracy and run by unelected ''experts.''
 These two factors help explain what is called the ''democratic deficit'' of the union: the absence of a separation of powers, the weak Parliament and an inaccessible judiciary whose final role hasn't even been decided yet. The Constitution does not offer any solutions for these problems, aside from minor alterations that don't deal with the underlying causes. The text, which has as many exceptions as rules, isn't written for the ordinary citizen, but for the bureaucrat. Even its equivalent of the Bill of Rights, presented as a great democratic advance, raises serious problems, to such a point that the national governments have had to introduce numerous safeguards to limit its effects.
 The question that Europeans face today is whether a united Europe is more important than these democratic considerations. Some countries have said yes by approving the Constitution; in others, like France, opposition has been running strong. Certainly, factors having little to do with the Constitution have contributed to public hostility in this country, like the unpopularity of the government and the troubled economy. The European message is also muddled. For some, the union has not kept its promises, notably with the single currency, which was presented as a miracle remedy for economic problems. In addition, the union is founded on a contradiction (protecting itself from globalization while preaching the opening of markets and frontiers); there is also the uncertainty about integrating the new members from Eastern Europe and, eventually, Turkey.
 So the French, understandably, regard the Constitution with distrust. Now, the French may have many defects, but they are also an old political people who have seen many constitutions come and go. It's an error to explain their reluctance simply as their traditional scorn, or worse, as a refusal of the idea of Europe. They are expressing a genuine unease that is founded in a Constitution whose flaws are admitted even by its supporters. By voting no, the French will not topple Europe -- the union will continue under its current rules -- but they may provide the impetus for a Constitution that would be truly democratic and a truly historic document.

HEADLINE: Egyptian Is Buying Italian Phone Company

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: LONDON, May 26 

 BODY:
The Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris cemented plans to expand his telecommunications empire by agreeing Thursday to pay 3 billion euros ($3.8 billion) to take control of Wind, one of Italy's largest telephone companies.
 With 31.6 million customers, Wind has twice the subscriber base of Orascom Telecom Holdings, the Middle Eastern and African telecommunications company that Mr. Sawiris controls. 
 Wind is Italy's third-largest mobile phone company and a major provider of fixed-line telephone service, but it is under pressure from faster-growing competitors. 
 A consortium led by Mr. Sawiris, which also includes the American financier Wilbur L. Ross and the French investor Philippe Nguyen, will take a 62.75 percent stake in Wind by this summer, according to a statement from Enel, Wind's parent. The consortium plans to consolidate its stake in Wind by putting 50 percent plus one share of Orascom Telecom into a new venture called Weather.
 Mr. Sawiris could list Weather on the Italian stock market sometime in the next 12 months, telecommunications bankers said.
 By the first half of 2006, Weather is expected to acquire the rest of Wind for 328 million euros, Enel said. The new venture is also taking on Wind's 7 billion euros in debt. In an unexpected wrinkle, Enel will then take a 26 percent stake in Weather, in return for an investment of 1.96 billion euros in the company. 
 In total, the transactions value Wind at 12.1 billion euros, making the deal the largest buyout ever in Europe. 
 The deal is Mr. Sawiris's first big step toward his goal of creating a telecommunications company with 100 million subscribers. The Wind deal could be followed by others in Greece and Spain, analysts and bankers said.
 Mr. Sawiris could create a ''new kid on the block, with economies of scale and a customer base in the Middle East and Southern Europe,'' said Serafino Abate, a research director at Ovum, a telecommunications consultant group. 
 Mr. Sawiris, who is 50, is one of three brothers who own a network of businesses in Egypt.
 To win the deal for Wind, Mr. Sawiris and his group beat out another consortium led by the Blackstone private equity group. Enel preferred his offer because it promised the utility a stake in the new company, bankers said. 
 Now that Mr. Sawiris has control of Wind, he will need to invest in the company to make it more competitive, analysts said. Mr. Abate said that Wind's broadband and cable businesses in particular should increase the entertainment content they offer, attracting more households to subscribe.

HEADLINE: Teachers Seek to Add Pressure in Yonkers Talks

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: YONKERS, May 26 

 BODY:
Teachers in the Yonkers public schools, who have been working without a contract for almost two years, stepped up the pressure on the district on Thursday by voting to authorize the union's negotiating committee to ''take any and all action'' to achieve a ''fair and equitable contract.''
 But the motion stopped short of calling for a strike, and the president of the Yonkers Federation of Teachers, Steve Frey, said later that the wording was ''deliberately vague.'' He said an action could range from ''something as simple as picketing to something much stronger,'' but added that a strike was ''not likely before the end of the school year.'' 
 If the committee did call a strike for a specific date, the teachers would have to reconvene and vote on it, Mr. Frey said. It is illegal for teachers to strike in New York State, but that has not stopped teachers in Yonkers from walking out in the past. The last strike, in the fall of 1999, lasted three days.
 Still, the meeting, which was closed to the public, served as an expression of the teachers' mounting frustration over their expired contract. According to Mr. Frey, the school district has proposed a three-year contract with no wage increases in the first two years -- which would be retroactive -- followed by a 2 percent increase. In addition, it would require teachers to pay some of the cost of their health coverage for the first time.
 A spokeswoman for the district, Jerilynne Fierstein, said: ''The superintendent has been very clear that they are in negotiations, and he has no comment,'' referring to the Yonkers school superintendent, Angelo Petrone.
 Mr. Frey said that a state mediator who met with both sides this spring bowed out in mid-May after concluding that it was ''useless to mediate such a large gap.''
 The impasse over the contract comes at a time of growing turmoil for the Yonkers school district, with 27,000 students the fourth largest in the state. Though the district just scored strongly on the state's standardized tests, it lost hundreds of teaching jobs last fall and was hurt by the recent lengthy bus strike in Westchester County, which made it extremely difficult for many students to get to school. City officials are feuding with the state over the level of education financing. 
 And in late February, after an investigation, the city's inspector general concluded that a 24-year-old accountant appeared to have gotten a $90,000-a-year position as a senior accountant for the Board of Education because of his personal connections to Mr. Petrone, the superintendent.
 Some teachers expressed relief that the meeting did not result in a call for a strike. ''I was afraid that some people might have their minds made up and do something that would hurt the students, and that's not what happened,'' said John Dawson, who teaches American history, as well as economics and government, at Roosevelt High School. 
 An elementary school art teacher, who insisted that his name not be used, said: ''It's not the right time. It would make us look greedy.''

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Global Trade: W.T.O. Names a Director General

BYLINE: By Tom Wright (IHT)

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization appointed Pas-cal Lamy, the former European Union trade negotiator, left, as its next director general. Mr. Lamy will begin his four-year term Sept. 1 after Supachai Panitchpakdi leaves the post. Mr. Lamy was approved without the usual regional animosities, as developing countries warmed to his stance that the poorest countries should not have to open their markets as quickly as richer nations. As the trade representative, Mr. Lamy often fought with the United States on issues from steel production to genetically modified crops, but he managed to maintain good relations with Washington in part because of his friendship with Robert B. Zoellick, the former United States trade representative. Mr. Lamy's efforts to get the European Union to cut farm subsidies, which hurt the developing world by depressing prices, also pleased poor nations, though it earned him criticism at home in France. Mr. Lamy's first job will be to prepare the W.T.O. for a meeting on the current round of trade talks in December. Tom Wright (IHT)

HEADLINE: The Unwanted-Job Myth

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The claim that there are ''jobs no American will take'' has made its way into the heart of the debate over immigration reform (''Major Immigration Surgery,'' editorial, May 20). Yet the circular reasoning behind this claim is fundamentally flawed.
 Sure, if employers in a given sector face an endless supply of low-wage labor, the quality of jobs in that sector will fall to levels that only those desperate for work will accept. But it doesn't follow that those with higher standards, be they immigrants or natives, would refuse these jobs if, in a tighter labor market, their wages were bid up.
 The claim that Americans won't take certain jobs is too often made by those whose profits depend on hammering down labor costs. The outcome of our immigration debate will improve if we face its inherent illogic.

HEADLINE: Shares Advance on Report Of Faster Economic Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday after the government said the economy expanded in the first quarter at a faster pace than initially estimated. Homebuilders like Toll Brothers and chip makers like Intel led the gains.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 7.61 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,197.62. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 79.80 points, or 0.8 percent, to 10,537.60. The Nasdaq composite index gained 21.12 points, or 1 percent, to 2,071.24. 
 Toll Brothers, the nation's largest builder of luxury homes, gained $5.92, to $91.65. The company said fiscal 2005 profit would climb 70 percent from the previous year, more than its February forecast for an increase of 60 percent.
 ''The homebuilders are all doing well,'' said Donald W. Hodges, who manages the $95 million Hodges Fund in Dallas. ''They're very attractive investments. They're making great profits.'' 
 Pulte Homes, the No.2 United States homebuilder, added $3.12, to $76.32. Lennar, the third-biggest, jumped $2.10, to $57.47. Centex, the fourth-largest, climbed $1.90, to $64.50.
 A gauge of semiconductor-related companies added 1.7 percent for the second-best performance among 24 industry groups in the S.&P. 500. The market research firm IC Insights said 2005 industry sales would rise 4 percent because of better-than-expected global economic growth and falling customer inventories. It had projected a decline of 2 percent.
 Intel climbed 37 cents, to $27.37.
 Boeing gained $1.54, to $62.99. PT Lion Mentari Airline of Indonesia agreed to buy $3.9 billion worth of Boeing's 737-model aircraft.
 American International Group rallied $1.63, or 3 percent, to $55.71. The insurer and its former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, were sued by the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, on charges of using accounting tricks to distort A.I.G.'s finances and mislead regulators. A.I.G. will probably move quickly to settle, said Jacob Frenkel, a former federal prosecutor.
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rose after a Congressional panel approved legislation that would create a tougher regulator for the mortgage finance providers. Fannie Mae jumped $2.34, to $59.37. Freddie Mac climbed $1.47, to $64.99.
 Calpine, the owner of power plants in 21 states, advanced for a second day after announcing plans to accelerate $3 billion in debt reduction. Calpine added 20 cents, or 7.6 percent, to $2.84.
 Novell, which sells network software and consulting services, dropped 45 cents, to $5.83. The company said it broke even in the second quarter on a per-share basis, excluding some costs. Novell was expected to earn 2.5 cents.
 Boston Scientific, the maker of heart stents, tumbled for a second day, retreating $1.30, to $28.16. The company reduced its 2005 earnings forecast because of increased competition and acquisition costs.
 The 10-year Treasury rose after a government report showed inflation remained tame last quarter as the economy grew faster than previously estimated. The 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32, to a price of 100 12/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.08 percent, from 4.09 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Running Out of Bubbles

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Remember the stock market bubble? With everything that's happened since 2000, it feels like ancient history. But a few pessimists, notably Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley, argue that we have not yet paid the price for our past excesses. 
 I've never fully accepted that view. But looking at the housing market, I'm starting to reconsider. 
 In July 2001, Paul McCulley, an economist at Pimco, the giant bond fund, predicted that the Federal Reserve would simply replace one bubble with another. ''There is room,'' he wrote, ''for the Fed to create a bubble in housing prices, if necessary, to sustain American hedonism. And I think the Fed has the will to do so, even though political correctness would demand that Mr. Greenspan deny any such thing.''
 As Mr. McCulley predicted, interest rate cuts led to soaring home prices, which led in turn not just to a construction boom but to high consumer spending, because homeowners used mortgage refinancing to go deeper into debt. All of this created jobs to make up for those lost when the stock bubble burst.
 Now the question is what can replace the housing bubble.
 Nobody thought the economy could rely forever on home buying and refinancing. But the hope was that by the time the housing boom petered out, it would no longer be needed.
 But although the housing boom has lasted longer than anyone could have imagined, the economy would still be in big trouble if it came to an end. That is, if the hectic pace of home construction were to cool, and consumers were to stop borrowing against their houses, the economy would slow down sharply. If housing prices actually started falling, we'd be looking at a very nasty scene, in which both construction and consumer spending would plunge, pushing the economy right back into recession.
 That's why it's so ominous to see signs that America's housing market, like the stock market at the end of the last decade, is approaching the final, feverish stages of a speculative bubble. 
 Some analysts still insist that housing prices aren't out of line. But someone will always come up with reasons why seemingly absurd asset prices make sense. Remember ''Dow 36,000''? Robert Shiller, who argued against such rationalizations and correctly called the stock bubble in his book ''Irrational Exuberance,'' has added an ominous analysis of the housing market to the new edition, and says the housing bubble ''may be the biggest bubble in U.S. history''
 In parts of the country there's a speculative fever among people who shouldn't be speculators that seems all too familiar from past bubbles -- the shoeshine boys with stock tips in the 1920's, the beer-and-pizza joints showing CNBC, not ESPN, on their TV sets in the 1990's. 
 Even Alan Greenspan now admits that we have ''characteristics of bubbles'' in the housing market, but only ''in certain areas.'' And it's true that the craziest scenes are concentrated in a few regions, like coastal Florida and California. 
 But these aren't tiny regions; they're big and wealthy, so that the national housing market as a whole looks pretty bubbly. Many home purchases are speculative; the National Association of Realtors estimates that 23 percent of the homes sold last year were bought for investment, not to live in. According to Business Week, 31 percent of new mortgages are interest only, a sign that people are stretching to their financial limits. 
 The important point to remember is that the bursting of the stock market bubble hurt lots of people -- not just those who bought stocks near their peak. By the summer of 2003, private-sector employment was three million below its 2001 peak. And the job losses would have been much worse if the stock bubble hadn't been quickly replaced with a housing bubble. 
 So what happens if the housing bubble bursts? It will be the same thing all over again, unless the Fed can find something to take its place. And it's hard to imagine what that might be. After all, the Fed's ability to manage the economy mainly comes from its ability to create booms and busts in the housing market. If housing enters a post-bubble slump, what's left?
 Mr. Roach believes that the Fed's apparent success after 2001 was an illusion, that it simply piled up trouble for the future. I hope he's wrong. But the Fed does seem to be running out of bubbles.

PERSON: Chung C. Seto

HEADLINE: A Self-Imposed Exit From Politics Is Brief

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
WITH a cellphone cemented to one diamond-accented ear and her kohl-rimmed eyes darting laser-like between her BlackBerry and a visitor, Chung C. Seto, despite the dainty gold cross dangling from her neck, does not exactly exude spirituality as she selects a seat in the conference room at the unrenovated Harlem brownstone that houses C. Virginia Fields's mayoral campaign. 
 She emanates functionality, certainly, but not spirituality: not unless shutting off her gadgets and electing to sit by a poster that declares ''Women for Fields!'' in bold red letters connotes spirituality. Though in this campaign manager's case, perhaps it does. 
 ''I personally believe it's time for New York City to elect a woman mayor,'' says Ms. Seto, not by accident a founding member of the Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Committee, a political action initiative that supports female candidates and points to Hillary Rodham Clinton and Eleanor Holmes Norton as templates. ''We are problem solvers by nature. We are passionate and compassionate by nature. The notion that it takes a man to run New York City, that only a man can do this job, is total baloney.'' 
 Spirited stuff from a Tabasco addict (tiny bottles are lined up on her desk) who earned off-the-books pennies alongside her mother in garment district sweatshops before she turned 12 -- for this, the family left Hong Kong behind when she was 8 -- and attended Georgetown University on a scholarship before leaving for a job in advertising. At Georgetown she majored in English expressly to disprove the teachers who warned her she would never make it in the corporate world because of her poor English skills: these days she enunciates like an anchorwoman. Her parents have ''almost'' forgiven her for failing to fulfill their career dreams -- doctor or lawyer -- for her, the oldest of five and the only daughter not to adopt an American name with citizenship. She preferred Chung.
 Ms. Seto, now 40, dressed in black and fresh from a birthday excursion to Atlantic City, where she did serious damage at the blackjack tables (yes, she possesses card shark credentials), says she prayed long and hard before accepting an offer from Ms. Fields at an April breakfast meeting. 
 BESIDES the prayer marathon, she thought long and hard about it, too. She and her friends are the type who dedicate their dinner party conversations to ''figuring out'' how to change the world: ''We do it by making sure we have good people in government that look out for the more rather than just a privileged few.'' But she's also a pragmatist. Politics is all-consuming and is mostly why she is unmarried, independent, and lives on Mott Street, two blocks from her parents (her father is retired from his job as a chef in a Chinese restaurant; her mother is a retired union seamstress) and the apartment where she grew up. Her maternal instincts are parceled out among seven nephews and a niece. 
 Ms. Seto worked ''exhaustive hours'' for the past four years as executive director of the New York State Democratic Committee, where she was the first Asian to fill that post, just as she was the first Asian spokeswoman for the United States Labor Department, where she was press secretary for Alexis M. Herman, Bill Clinton's Secretary of Labor. 
 In February, she assumed that she had exited 24/7 politics by forming her own consulting agency, the Chung Seto Group. Not that she was giving politics the cold turkey treatment: her first client was the Democratic National Committee. Still, she had no plans to involve herself in the mayoral race. She was an interested bystander. 
 ''In wanting not to be involved, I got an opportunity to focus on what all the candidates were saying, and I found that Virginia was the one discussing issues that were important to me, like education, affordable housing and finding jobs for this whole population of people who are perpetually unemployed,'' she says.
 The lure of helping Ms. Fields, the Manhattan borough president, whip her belated campaign into the shape necessary to overtake Fernando Ferrer for the Democratic nomination and possibly slug it out with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg come November, proved too much for Ms. Seto to ignore. Also, there was the chance to take on a job few women are offered, or accept. ''Just like it's difficult to get women to run for office, it's difficult to get women interested in being political operatives. I can only name a handful who continue to do well at it: it's just like any other glass ceiling.''
 ''I prayed about it a lot, and it felt good to say yes,'' she adds. ''It impressed me that she would seek out a woman to run her campaign. It says a great deal about her commitment to inclusion.''
 Ms. Seto was nudged into politics while living in Washington -- she worked on the Clinton-Gore campaigns in 1992 and 1996 and kept the 1997 inaugural ball on budget as its manager -- by a friend who encouraged her to apply for a job as communications director of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights. She had misgivings about being a credible candidate due to her lack of public relations training. Her friend told her, '''Chung, you could sell my own garbage back to me.''' She aced the interview.
 ''The choice issue got me galvanized and threw me into the political battle. I wanted to work for the Department of Labor to combat sweatshops. And, mind you, there was another reason to keep working in politics: when I looked around, there sure weren't a lot of faces like mine. I want to stay long enough to help that change.''

HEADLINE: Don't Mind the Mayor. The Reporters Are Swarming Silver!

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Every so often in New York City, events conspire to create the journalistic equivalent of a dust devil -- a brief but intense vortex of shouting reporters and camera operators encircling a person in the news.
 Yesterday, all the ingredients were there: heat from the West Side stadium drama, anticipation of a crucial, and twice-delayed, vote next week, and growing intrigue surrounding the intentions of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. Nature soon took its course, spawning a news media microburst that quickly engulfed Mr. Silver and left him begging for help as he tried to flee a swarm of reporters. 
 The day began calmly enough. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg called a news conference at a school auditorium on Greenwich Street to announce the latest economic development boost for Lower Manhattan that seemed intended to please Mr. Silver. The Assembly speaker has complained in recent weeks about what he sees as too much emphasis on the Jets stadium, rather than on redevelopment in his legislative district, which includes the World Trade Center site.
 Mr. Bloomberg's proposal for a stadium hangs in the balance, and Mr. Silver has it in his power to tip the scales. He has one of three votes on a panel that is set to vote next week on $300 million in state financing for the stadium. Mr. Silver has not said how he intends to vote.
 Yesterday, the mayor praised the speaker and his support of the Greenwich Street project, a residential and retail development with a 30-story tower, a community center and a school annex. After the presentation and speeches, Mr. Bloomberg said there would be a brief break before opening the floor to questions.
 With people milling about, the mayor and the speaker could be seen behind the lectern engaged in what appeared to be an intense one-on-one chat. Curiosity aroused, reporters began drifting toward the stage.
 It soon became apparent that Mr. Silver did not intend to stay for the question-and-answer session. The crowd of reporters grew. Television camera lights switched on. School officials, sensing the gathering storm, shooed away the few remaining children. Mr. Bloomberg stepped to the lectern, looking perplexed as most of the journalists began trailing Mr. Silver down the stage steps.
 ''Uh, the press conference is over here,'' the mayor said, to no avail.
 As Mr. Silver tried to leave, the first questions began falling on him like hailstones. Was he any closer to deciding how to vote on the stadium?
 ''No,'' he said, trying to move away, ''I'm not further, not closer.''
 ''Where are you going?'' a reporter asked.
 ''I'm going to meet the chairman of Goldman Sachs,'' was the reply.
 The noisy swarm of bodies, with Mr. Silver at its center, moved slowly down a hallway, carrying the speaker past a stairwell door where several nervous-looking aides stood waiting to usher him out. A desperate aide, unable to push his way through the crowd, yelled above the din: ''Excuse me, folks, please! Speaker Silver, you have to come this way sir!''
 Mr. Silver paused, his back against the wall, and began pleading to be allowed out, ''Can I go?''
 Reporter: ''The governor's saying the stadium is being held up.''
 Aide: ''Can we create a space here please?''
 Mr. Silver: ''Can I, can I?''
 Aide: ''We have to go this way.''
 ''Can I just tell you?'' Mr. Silver said, quieting the crowd. ''I'm meeting with the chairman of Goldman Sachs to make another pitch to get him to come here, downtown Manhattan. I do not want to be late. It is very important to this community that Goldman Sachs reconsider and come back to downtown. That's what I'm focused on, downtown. So I'm begging your indulgence to allow me to do that.''
 As the storm dissipated, and Mr. Silver made his way to the exit, one last question landed on him with a splat, ''Mr. Speaker, could we beg you for one quick comment about the stadium?''

HEADLINE: U.S. Softens Its Warning To Beijing

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26 

 BODY:
Even as it publicly presses China to let its currency rise in value, the Bush administration has quietly softened a crucial demand.
 In a calculated shift, administration officials have stopped demanding that China let its currency, the yuan, float freely against other major currencies. 
 Instead, American officials are telling Chinese leaders that they can keep their policy of a fixed exchange rate -- at least for now -- if they increase the value of the yuan by 10 to 15 percent.
 The policy switch reflects a growing realization that Beijing is simply not going to let its currency soar, which would make its exports more expensive and could disrupt China's troubled banking system. 
 But the switch also highlights the administration's limited leverage over China. Having failed to budge Chinese leaders with polite financial diplomacy, administration officials are struggling to find ways to apply pressure without resorting to import barriers.
 ''I don't think it is in our interest or in their interest in going immediately to a full float,'' Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said at a hearing on Thursday at the Senate Banking Committee. ''I see them as on a path to a full float.''
 Mr. Snow refused to say how much he wanted China to revalue the yuan. But people close to the administration said it was privately demanding an immediate increase of 10 to 15 percent. So far, Chinese officials have shown little inclination to go even that far. The People's Bank of China, in an annual report, said this week that it planned to keep its currency stable at a ''reasonable and well-balanced level,'' according to The China Daily.
 Antagonism toward China and its trade surplus with the United States, which reached $162 billion last year and is still rising, has intensified in Congress recently.
 On Thursday, Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee sharply criticized Mr. Snow for being too easy on China.
 Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, warned Mr. Snow that Chinese officials appeared to be suggesting a very small revaluation of 3 to 5 percent -- ''preposterous figures,'' Mr. Sarbanes said.
 Senator Elizabeth Dole, Republican of North Carolina, told Mr. Snow she was ''frankly astounded'' that the Treasury Department declined to accuse China of currency manipulation in its report last week on foreign exchange practices.
 Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the banking committee, said the Treasury Department had ''punted'' on the issue by saying that China's foreign exchange policies did not meet the ''technical'' definition of currency manipulation.
 China has kept the value of the yuan at a fixed exchange rate of 8.3 to the dollar for more than 10 years, despite a soaring trade surplus with the United States that would normally lift the value of its currency.
 Many analysts estimate that the yuan is undervalued by more than 25 percent, which makes Chinese exports to the United States cheaper than they would be otherwise.
 To keep the yuan from rising in value, the Chinese government has bought large volumes of Treasury bonds and other dollar-denominated securities. Last year, it added $215 billion to its foreign reserves, which reached $647 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund.
 For two years, Mr. Snow and his deputies have been trying without success to persuade China to adopt flexible exchange rates. Though they have hedged their demands in public, administration officials have urged Chinese officials in private to let their currency float freely.
 Some experts have argued that Mr. Snow's seemingly tough stance was a mistake, because it was hopelessly unrealistic and might cause financial shocks to the Chinese banking system. 
 ''This is not an administration that is comfortable relying on market signals,'' said Morris Goldstein, a senior economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, referring to the Chinese government. 
 Even if China did announce a floating exchange rate, he added, it would continue to intervene heavily in currency markets to keep the yuan from rising too much. By contrast, he said, a big upward revaluation would be a ''large down payment'' that moved China's currency closer to what it would be in a free market.
 Mr. Snow adopted a new position last week, when he said it had been a ''misconception'' that the United States was calling on China to adopt floating exchange rates immediately.
 ''What we are calling for is an intermediate step that reflects underlying market conditions and allows for a smooth transition -- when appropriate -- to a full float,'' Mr. Snow said on May 17.
 That was the first time Mr. Snow had publicly mentioned the possibility of ''intermediate'' steps and the first time he had explicitly denied that the United States was demanding a floating exchange rate for China.
 Tony Fratto, a spokesman for Mr. Snow, said the softer line was a mere refinement. ''We've been pretty disciplined and precise in talking about flexibility,'' Mr. Fratto said. ''We've almost never talked about a float.''
 But industry lobbyists and policy experts said the shift was significant.
 ''They've come around to where we've been all along,'' said Frank Vargo, vice president for international economics at the National Association of Manufacturers, which has been demanding that China revalue its currency for years.
 But Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a critic of the administration's dealings with China, said Mr. Snow should push for more. ''China has to let their currency float,'' he said. ''The administration has now stepped into the batter's box. Now you need to swing at the pitch.''

HEADLINE: Chrysler and Union Face Crucial Talks in Canada

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: WINDSOR, Ontario, May 25 

 BODY:
Overtime is a familiar word to Chrysler workers in Canada, who build the Chrysler 300 sedan, the flagship of Chrysler's recent revival, at a plant near Toronto. And in this city, across a bridge from Detroit, they build a briskly selling crop of minivans known for their two rows of seats that fold flat. 
 So, the stakes are high for Chrysler in summer contract talks with the Canadian Auto Workers union. Executives of Chrysler, a division of the German automaker DaimlerChrysler, contend that their Canadian workers are fast becoming uncompetitive in the global economy. While Canada's nationalized health care helps Chrysler undercut labor costs at its plants in the United States, Canadian workers have in the last three years become more expensive than workers at nonunionized plants in the United States run by Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and other Asian automakers. Chrysler's Canadian workers are aware of both the competitive burdens that the company faces as well as its recent spurt of success. By contrast, both General Motors and the Ford Motor Company are struggling to keep customers and hold onto profits. 
 ''Everyone basically wants to keep their jobs, that's the biggest thing,'' said Dean Getty, a 37-year-old who works in the paint shop of Chrysler's Windsor plant. ''We make good money and we have good benefits. You can't ask for much more.''
 But Denis Caza, a 58-year-old millwright, wants more. Chrysler's sales in the United States, where the vast majority of Canadian-built vehicles are sold, are up 6.6 percent this year. 
 ''To me, they should be able to get more than they got last time because they have three hot sellers now up in Bramalea,'' he said, referring to the Toronto-area plant that produces the Chrysler 300 sedan, the Dodge Magnum and the Dodge Charger. 
 ''If you don't get any marbles now, you won't be able to give any back later, you know what I'm saying,'' he added, before heading to his car, blue Thermos in hand, to beat the traffic streaming from the plant. 
 Chrysler executives say a series of generous contracts granted to Canadian workers have offset the roughly $4-an-hour advantage over the United States resulting from Canada's health care system. One factor is that Canadian Chrysler workers get roughly 11 weeks of paid time off, compared with more than 8 weeks off for an American Chrysler worker and more than 7 weeks for workers at the nonunionized American plants of foreign automakers. 
 Chrysler contends that Canada should be compared with the plants of the Asian automakers because they are the fastest-growing competitors. The company would like overall labor costs to grow by no more than 2.5 percent annually in the new contract, compared with 5.8 percent in the last contract. 
 ''We need to craft an agreement that slows down the growth of these costs and contributes to the long-term viability of the auto economy in Canada,'' Dave Elshoff, a Chrysler spokesman, said.
 Buzz Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, is unmoved and says the financial woes of G.M. and Ford have less to do with labor costs and more to do with a trade policy too favorable to Asian automakers. He said he would like his workers to get even more time off and richer pension benefits. 
 ''My advice is not to get their expectations too high,'' he said in an interview this week. ''The Big Three have some serious problems but they aren't problems we can resolve in bargaining. We can work for nothing, and they'd still have the problems.''
 Jim Stanford, the economist for the Canadian union, said much of the shift since the last contract was simply due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which has moved from about 63 cents on the American dollar in 2002 to 80 cents now. ''In a way,'' he said, ''they should be telling this to the Bank of Canada.''
 Last year, Ontario passed Michigan for the first time to become the largest auto producing state or province in North America, though much of the increase has come from nonunionized plants producing brands like Honda. Still, the Canadian union covers 39,000 active workers, a fraction of the roughly 280,000 workers covered by the United Auto Workers union, which negotiated a separate four-year contract in 2003. Both unions pick out one of the three companies, negotiate a contract with it and use that as the pattern for the others. The talks open in mid-July. 
 Posturing ahead of labor talks is standard procedure, of course, and Canadian auto workers seceded from the United Workers union in 1985 because they wanted to take a harder line. 
 But the Canadian talks follow the recent downgrade of both G.M. and Ford by Standard & Poor's, which put their debt rating below investment grade for the first time. 
 In the 2003 talks with the U.A.W., that union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, struck an unusually conciliatory tone with the Big Three, indicating that the union and the American automakers were increasingly seeing companies like Toyota and other Asian automakers as their main adversaries. Now, G.M. is pressing the U.A.W. to take the unusual step of reopening contract talks on health benefits. 
 Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., said the C.A.W. ''can't ignore the reality of the industry.''
 ''The C.A.W. was formed as an anticoncession breakaway,'' he said. But ''they can't argue with the overall trends. It's very easy to make a case that it's time to break from the past.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Incomes Rose in April, Lifting Consumer Spending

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Incomes of Americans rose in April by the most this year, the government reported yesterday, giving consumers money to spend even with gasoline prices near a record.
 The Commerce Department said yesterday that incomes increased 0.7 percent last month after rising 0.5 percent a month earlier. Purchases increased 0.6 percent after a 0.9 percent March gain that was stronger than the government first estimated. 
 A report from the University of Michigan yesterday showed that consumer confidence rebounded in the second half of May as fuel prices started to decline. 
 Rising incomes suggest that spending will hold up and that consumer sentiment may improve after falling every month this year, economists said. 
 ''While consumers have been saying that they are worried, their spending patterns suggest otherwise,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn. ''Look for further improvement in attitudes in June, as gasoline prices have continued to come off their April highs.'' 
 The price gauge tied to spending patterns and excluding food and energy costs -- the preferred measure of Federal Reserve policy makers for tracking inflation -- rose 0.1 percent last month and was up 1.6 percent from April 2004. 
 The increase in prices is expected to keep the central bankers raising their target interest rate by a quarter percentage point in coming months, economists said. 
 The University of Michigan's final reading of May consumer sentiment was 86.9, compared with a preliminary reading of 85.3. In April, the index was 87.7.
 The government reported yesterday that incomes rose 7 percent for the 12 months ended in April, paced by a 7.6 percent gain in wages and salaries. The Commerce Department revised the increase in wages and salaries in the 12 months ended in March to 7.6 percent, compared with a 5.8 percent estimate last month. The acceleration reflects revisions to the income components in yesterday's report on gross domestic product. 
 ''That is as strong as we saw in the late 1990's,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital in New York. ''Wages are accelerating quite sharply here.'' 
 Disposable income, or the money left over after taxes, increased 0.5 percent in April after a 0.4 percent rise the previous month, the Commerce Department said. Adjusted for inflation, personal spending rose 0.2 percent last month after a 0.4 percent rise. 
 Adjusted spending on durable goods like autos, furniture and other long-lasting items rose 0.8 percent after surging 3.5 percent a month earlier. Purchases of nondurable goods increased 0.2 percent and real spending on services, which account for almost 60 percent of all outlays, increased 0.1 percent. 
 The personal savings rate, which weighs current income from wages, salaries, dividends, businesses and government payments against spending, fell to 0.4 percent, the lowest since October 2001, from 0.5 percent. It does not take into account borrowed money, income from investments, or withdrawals from prior savings.
 Consumer spending helped the economy expand at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, faster than the government previously estimated, a report from the Commerce Department showed Thursday. Spending rose at a 3.6 percent annual pace, also stronger than the government initially thought.

HEADLINE: Pataki Moves to Create Empire State Greenway by Developing 524-Mile Waterfront

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 27 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki offered a plan on Friday to transform the Erie Canal and the land along its shores into a waterfront greenway and link it with similar eco-friendly tracts to its east and west. The plan came months after the state Canal Corporation's deal to sell development rights along the canal was plagued by scandal. 
 At a news conference at a canal port in Little Falls, just west of Albany, Mr. Pataki said his plan to recast the 524-mile waterfront as a linear park dotted by tourist destinations, natural vistas and trails would unite the Hudson and Niagara greenways to form the Empire State Greenway, ''one of the largest greenways in the nation.''
 Environmentalists quickly embraced the idea of ''water-dependent development'' along the canal. They said it would improve the struggling upstate economy through which the all-but-forsaken canal flows, and lure visitors with the promise of biking, hiking, boating and fishing amid the panoramic corridors of New York's interior.
 ''It would really link New York City to Buffalo,'' said John Stouffer, legislative director for the Atlantic chapter of the Sierra Club. ''Potentially, you could bike to Buffalo, or, if you were willing to brave the Hudson River, you could paddle to Buffalo.''
 But hurdles remain before Mr. Pataki's vision can take root, Mr. Stouffer said, adding that he would watch closely to make sure that improving water quality, recreational activities and public access to the waterfront remained priorities over time.
 In outlining his plan, the governor called for a grass-roots approach to greenway development. He nominated Carmella R. Mantello, the executive director of the Hudson River Valley Greenway Communities Council, to serve as director of the Canal Corporation, a subsidiary of the New York State Thruway Authority, which oversees the canal system. 
 If her appointment is approved by the corporation's board, Ms. Mantello will lead a task force of representatives from several state agencies and localities along the canal who would solicit suggestions from federal, state and local planners before sending recommendations to the governor within six months. 
 Those recommendations would ''form the basis'' of legislation that Mr. Pataki would submit to lawmakers in Albany next year to create the canal greenway, said Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the governor.
 Depending on what the task force recommends, parts of the development plan itself could also require state lawmakers' approval, state officials said.
 An investigation by the state attorney general's office and the state inspector general's office found that the Canal Corporation's previous deal to sell development rights along the canal for $30,000 was fraught with favoritism and ethics violations. 
 While the Canal Corporation ''lost credibility'' in that affair, it is ''getting back on track,'' with the new plan, said Jeff Jones, a spokesman for Environmental Advocates of New York, a nonprofit group that monitors state government.
 The gathering of grass-roots input from communities along the canal in advance of developers' proposals is a reversal of state policy, said Michael R. Fleischer, the executive director of the Thruway Authority.
 Next, Mr. Jones said, the state should expand on the governor's plan by linking all of its canals and the St. Lawrence Seaway with its largest rivers. ''That would create a world class destination for eco-tourism that would rival the great waterways of Europe,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Billionaires Beware This Bubble

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
LOTS of magazine articles have focused on the real estate boom lately, but Worth's cover article this month makes a convincing case that there may be a bubble on the extremely high end of the market.
 Worth examines the private resort marketplace, which includes high-end ski condominiums, mass luxury golf communities and limited-membership gated communities with homes. 
 While owners of single-family homes -- especially on the coasts -- may be worried that they are in the midst of a real estate bubble, at the high end there are separate concerns, John Ferry reports in ''The Private Resort Home Market: An Investment Outlook.'' 
 Resort homes are valued well over $2 million, he says, and are bought by people who own additional residences. ''These multiple owners are often better insulated from economic downdrafts than less-affluent home buyers, so values in this sector are not tethered as tightly to the economic cycle or market conditions as are values in the broader real estate domain,'' Mr. Ferry says. 
 Instead, there are three factors that govern price: uniqueness of location, supply and level of service provided. And with builders believing ''that the growing number of affluent individuals in the U.S. will offset any potential downward pressure on valuations,'' it is easy to foresee oversupply.
 ''To the extent that these sites are reproducible, there's no reason for this stuff to be a great investment,'' William C. Wheaton of the Center for Real Estate at M.I.T. explained. ''You just go on to the next mountain or beach or lake.'' 
 Christopher J. Mayer, a professor at the Columbia Business School, went further, saying, ''The supply of resort homes will ultimately outstrip demand, depressing prices.''
 The (extremely) rich may be different from you and me, as F. Scott Fitzgerald said, but they are still apparently subject to market forces when it comes to valuing the price of their indulgences.
 Still, that doesn't mean we don't like reading about them. The premiere issue of VLife, an offshoot of Variety, features gushy write-ups on the home of the producer Mark Damon (''Das Boot,'' ''Monster'') with its ''verdant landscapes'' on a two-acre ''Benedict Canyon hilltop.''
 And it devotes a full page to the new home of the screenwriter David S. Goyer (''Batman Begins''). ''Goyer bought the property in the Hollywood Hills two years ago, tore down the existing 1970's-style structure and designed his own modernist refuge,'' according to the article. 
 Folks in Hollywood, it seems, aren't overly concerned about a real estate meltdown. 
 The other side of the economic spectrum attracts the attention of AARP The Magazine, which features four Social Security recipients who are living on their benefit checks alone.
 The article, by William R. Newcott, points out that the three women and a man profiled -- who range in age from 77 to 85 -- are not unique. There are ''6.6 million Americans 65 and older -- 22 percent of all older beneficiaries -- who have no income other than Social Security,'' he writes. ''The average monthly benefit for retirees is about $955.''
 How do they get by? One common theme is, ''if I can't afford it, I just don't buy it.'' 
 Consider Maxine McCormick, 83, who lives in a mobile home park in Concord, Calif. ''A world traveler until she retired, Maxine has settled into a pattern of diminished -- yet satisfying -- expectations,'' Mr. Newport writes. '''For 75 cents I can ride down to the airport, walk around the international terminal, and watch all the people headed for their planes. For me, that's enough of a travel fix.'''
 The AARP, which used to be the American Association of Retired Persons, has been critical of President Bush's effort to overhaul Social Security. Whether or not there was political motivation behind running the piece, it may get you to pay more attention to your own retirement planning.
 Final take. Numbers of a different sort intrigue the editors of Health magazine this month. Found within the ''vital stats'' section, subtitled ''Life by the Numbers,'' is this bit of trivia. People whose astrological sign is Gemini are most likely to file accident claims with their car insurers. Capricorns are the least likely. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: 2 Manhattan Poker Parlors Raided by Police

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE; Janon Fisher and Daniel J. Wakin contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The police raided two of the city's largest underground poker parlors late Thursday night, arresting 39 employees and charging them with promoting gambling. Police officials described the raid as part of a campaign to counter the growing number of illicit poker establishments in the city.
 In coordinated sweeps, more than a dozen police officers stormed two Manhattan poker casinos: Playstation at 4-6 West 14th Street and New York Players Club at 200 West 72nd Street. At the time of the raids, about 11 p.m., there were between 100 and 150 players at each casino, the police said. Only employees of the parlors, however, were arrested. Prosecutors said it was not illegal to play poker in New York State, only to profit from promoting it. 
 The casinos were members-only establishments that drew thousands of players weekly, among them men and women including cabdrivers, businessmen and actors. The management kept records of who came to play and new members could join only if they were referred by current members. 
 Neither establishment served alcohol. At Playstation, members were served Oreo and Chips Ahoy! cookies. New York Players Club offered its customers valet parking and massages. Games would go until 7 a.m. or around the clock on weekends, the police said. Tournament prizes could be as much as $10,000. The most popular game was Texas hold'em, a version of poker that many say requires the most skill and the least luck. The clubs were incorporated businesses that followed fire codes, the police said. 
 But the police and prosecutors asserted that the operations were nonetheless illegal, and the more than three dozen employees were charged with possession of gambling instruments as well as promoting gambling.
 Lt. Pasquale Morena, who oversees special investigations in the Police Department's vice squad, said the parlors would bring in between $20,000 and $30,000 a night in fees that they charged their players to play. The police, he said, recovered $100,000 in Thursday night's raids.
 ''We realized that this was the start of a problem because there is lots of money involved,'' Lieutenant Morena said. ''We don't know where the profits from the gambling are going.''
 Waves of police raids have followed the explosive popularity of poker across the country, including the arrests of 70 people in Passaic County, N.J., last month. 
 The decision to raid poker clubs walking a finer line with local laws has caused concern for lawmakers and individuals who believe that law enforcement authorities are overreaching and prosecuting legitimate recreational activity. 
 Many clubs, for instance, say that as long as they are simply renting space and not taking in a percentage of the money wagered, they are the equivalent of billiard halls.
 And some members and an employee of the two raided poker casinos in Manhattan made just that case, saying members paid to rent space by the half-hour -- $5 at Playstation and $4 at New York Players Clubs.
 ''It was done in every way like a legitimate business; you crossed your t's and dotted your i's,'' said an employee of Playstation, who was not among those arrested, but did not want to be identified. 
 People with alcohol on their breath were barred at the door, the woman said. The company had a payroll, deducted social security taxes and gave its employees health insurance, she said. ''I can get unemployment,'' she added. 
 But the police said even the rental fees the clubs charged are illegal and amount to promoting gambling. Lieutenant Morena said the clubs also took a percentage of the tournament proceeds.

HEADLINE: Local Wine Tasting

 BODY:
At an international wine competition in California this month, the winner for best white among 1,000 or so entries went to a rare early-American diamond variety from New York's Finger Lake region. When wine lovers wanted to know how they could get a few cases, they were told it was difficult to impossible unless they lived in New York State. For connoisseurs or even customers, this was distressing. (Imagine how Miles from ''Sideways'' would have taken such news.) For those who run a growing number of family vineyards across the country, such barriers make little sense. Now, a recent Supreme Court ruling gives New York and other states the best opportunity in years to ship their local vintages out of state. 
 Across the country, state wine laws are a complicated throwback to the end of Prohibition. Some states prohibit shipping directly to their customers -- in Florida it is a felony, for example. Some allow it with permits. Some -- like California -- allow direct shipping to other states that also allow direct shipping. The Supreme Court made it clear that the problem with New York's law was that it treated New York customers differently from customers in other states. Wineries should be able to ship directly to everybody, in state and out of state, or to nobody. 
 There are now nearly 4,000 family vineyards, some in every state, including Alaska. It makes no sense to hobble these wineries with arcane shipping rules. These vineyards and wineries can be lucrative tourist attractions. In New York, where wineries draw a million tourists a year and produce more wine than any other state except California, there are more than 200 vineyards, many in areas that need as much economic help as possible.
 In the past, big distributors and their friends in Albany have squashed any hope that these smaller farms could ship wine straight to tourists or customers outside the state. This year, thanks to the court, the hurdles seem much lower -- there is some disagreement between Governor George Pataki and the Legislature about whether to limit the number of cases of wine that can be sold to a customer directly. Here is a suggestion for legislators in New York and elsewhere: Break open a bottle from a good local winery and work it out.

HEADLINE: In Los Angeles, the Inevitable Is Reflected in a New Hispanic Mayor

BYLINE: By CAROLYN CURIEL

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
There is almost an air of bemusement among Latinos in Los Angeles over the fascination with the election of one of their own as mayor. They like the attention, and that also goes for the new mayor, Antonio Villaraigosa. But stories here about rising Latino power are nearly anticlimactic. Hispanics hold the offices of lieutenant governor, county sheriff, city attorney and the powerful head of the county board of supervisors. A Latino is president of the City Council and another is speaker of the State Assembly. Latinos hold more than one-fifth of the seats in the State Legislature. 
 The Los Angeles mayor's office was in many ways a domino waiting to fall. And the man who probably most helped the cascade is not Hispanic at all -- former Gov. Pete Wilson. 
 It was Mr. Wilson's success in the mid-1990's with the anti-immigrant Proposition 187 and the legal battles it provoked that propelled efforts by labor unions and community organizations to encourage new citizenship and create voters. California, which has the distinction of being the nation's first minority-white state, is home to nearly one in three Hispanics in the United States. Nearly half of Los Angeles is now Hispanic. The state has added nearly one million naturalized citizens from Latin countries, primarily from Mexico, according to figures from the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, which researches Hispanic issues.
 It hardly matters that in the Los Angeles mayoral campaign there was nary a mention of illegal immigration or the recent suggestion from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger about controlling the border. New citizens, as it turns out, quickly find that they have other worries, including the state of the schools, where their children and other Latinos fare especially poorly. Mr. Villaraigosa took the issue and ran, promising reforms and an end to school violence, winning about 80 percent of the Hispanic vote. 
 The mayor-elect also wants to redevelop downtown and expand the city's limited public transportation, which is used largely by blacks and Latinos who don't often own cars or have the money for gas.
 New Yorkers may draw some political parallels as their own mayoral election in November draws near. There are seemingly overlapping issues and constituencies and maybe even kinds of candidates. But New York is not Los Angeles, and it has not met its Pete Wilson or its Antonio Villaraigosa. 
 Even Mr. Villaraigosa's detractors admire his gift of gab, which he employed during the campaign to talk compellingly of his hardscrabble beginnings. The words ''charismatic'' and ''passionate'' were regularly used as shorthand to contrast him with his losing opponent, the merely life-size incumbent, James Hahn, who beat Mr. Villaraigosa in 2001.
 And while Mr. Villaraigosa is Latino, his heritage is more mainstream than novelty here. The fact that he did not stress his background as a candidate helped his nearly universal appeal. It also did not hurt that blacks were disappointed with Mr. Hahn, who won on the strength of their support last time, but raised hackles when he dismissed the African-American police chief, Bernard Parks. An already strong Jewish base was fortified by Mr. Villaraigosa's talk of a Jewish mentor who helped him continue his education.
 ''I will be the mayor for all of us,'' he promises, and he says that includes forming the city's most diverse administration. In urban politics, where multicultural strategies must be a part of any winning campaign, his victory has drawn attention, even envy. 
 On a recent morning, the mayor-elect noted that one of his early calls of congratulations came from New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, who has been ardently courting Hispanic voters as he seeks re-election. 
 As for Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, who is challenging Mr. Bloomberg: ''We've been playing telephone tag.''

HEADLINE: Sentence Cut for Student In Child Pornography Case

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Two years ago, a federal judge was forced by mandatory sentencing rules to send a young college student to prison for 10 years for swapping child pornography over the Internet. The judge admitted openly that he was wrestling with his conscience over the sentence, which he called ''unjust and harmful.''
 Yesterday the judge, Gerard E. Lynch, had a chance to sentence the student, Jorge Pabon Cruz, again. The judge reduced the sentence by more than half, to four years in prison and eight years of supervision. 
 Mr. Pabon, a shy and withdrawn student from Puerto Rico, had exchanged more than 10,000 images, including some of sex involving young children, through an Internet chat room. Since the first sentence, a defense appeal succeeded on a technicality and the Supreme Court did away with mandatory guidelines. In announcing the new sentence, Judge Lynch said he was still struggling to find the ''difficult balances'' between Mr. Pabon's young age and the gravity of his offense.
 Mr. Pabon has already spent 32 months in jail, and his defense lawyers said he would be free in 10 more months once his good conduct was factored in. He is in prison in the Federal Medical Center Devens in central Massachusetts. 
 Judge Lynch's experience with the case illustrated both the deep frustrations that many federal judges felt when they were compelled to impose tough sentences for certain crimes, and the new burdens they face now that they have more leeway to decide.
 Mr. Pabon, who was 18 when he was arrested in 2001, was convicted of advertising child pornography over the Internet. He posted announcements for pornographic photographs in a chat room and then sent the pictures to whomever responded. He had no criminal record, and there was no evidence in the trial that he had profited from the pornography or that he had sexually approached or abused a child.
 Before Judge Lynch announced the sentence in Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Pabon promised that he would never handle pornography again or commit another crime, after the experience of jail.
 ''I have not ever in my life had a thought of handling or touching or doing anything harmful to a child,'' Mr. Pabon said. He said he was eager for any psychological counseling the court would require. ''I don't know how to make friends,'' he said. ''I do need some help,'' he said.
 Mr. Pabon said he had no notion that he was committing a serious crime when he sent out the images under his e-mail name, BigThing. ''I know I'm not going to be one of those statistics the government keeps about those people who come back,'' he said. ''People change. I can prove that.''
 Last December, an appeals court threw out Mr. Pabon's 10-year sentence on the basis of a wording error in the text of the law on which he was convicted. In January, the Supreme Court decided that the federal sentencing guidelines would no longer be mandatory, but would be consulted only as framework.
 Mr. Pabon's lawyer, Jennifer Brown, a federal public defender, argued that he should be sentenced to time served and released.
 In remarks before he announced the sentence, Judge Lynch said that he had thought more about the case than any other he had encountered. He said he hoped to avoid acting ''on the basis of a slogan,'' on an issue that has provoked high political passions.
 Judge Lynch said he had been favorably surprised by a recent report by Dr. Robert A. Prentky, an expert in the psychology of sexual criminals. Dr. Prentky, who was originally selected as a government expert, found that Mr. Pabon presented no risk of pedophile behavior in the future, leading Judge Lynch to say that Mr. Pabon's prospects after jail seemed ''in all respects promising.'' 
 He also pointed to a different case in the same court where a young man who was better off economically had received a sentence of probation for a similar crime.
 But the judge also noted that the child pornography photographs that Mr. Pabon sent out were ''depictions of crimes against the innocent,'' showing ''illegal, horrific actions.'' He found that Mr. Pabon had lied to Dr. Prentky about some details of his pornography swapping.
 Mr. Pabon saw his family in the courtroom for the first time in three years. Five relatives came from Puerto Rico for the hearing, including his mother. Mr. Pabon asked Judge Lynch for permission to ''hug and kiss'' them in court.
 After the hearing, Mr. Pabon slumped against the courtroom wall and had to be held up by a marshal as he wept at the prospect of having to return to jail.

HEADLINE: New Terminal in Coney Island Rivals the Great Train Sheds of Europe

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Amid the bad news about the subway system -- fires, delays and deferred dreams like the Second Avenue subway -- one ambitious project, the spectacular European-style train terminal at Coney Island, reaches a milestone this weekend. 
 At 12:41 a.m. tomorrow, an N train will roll into the new station, at Stillwell and Surf Avenues, completing the restoration of full subway service to southern Brooklyn for the first time since late 2001. 
 Riders from four lines will converge below a soaring glass shed, the ocean sparkling in the distance. 
 But the terminal stands in contrast with the undeniably shabby precincts that border the beach and Boardwalk. City officials view the subway terminal as an attraction and a potential boon for tourism, much like KeySpan Park, a minor-league stadium that has drawn thousands of baseball fans to the area over the past four years. 
 In an era when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority seems unable to advance its aspirations for expansion, the $300 million terminal, produced on time and more or less within budget, provides a rare example of a beautiful addition to the transit landscape. Its signature element is a 75,000-square-foot glass canopy, made up of 2,730 solar-energy panels, which hover over eight tracks and four platforms, all completely rebuilt. 
 At night, the glass shed is illuminated by floodlights below, producing a soft glow that reaches out to the high-rise apartments nearby. 
 Officials compare the station, unabashedly, to the great train terminals of the industrial age, like Paddington Station in London or Gare St.-Lazare in Paris. 
 ''It doesn't feel like us,'' Cosema E. Crawford, the chief engineer at New York City Transit, said candidly during a recent tour of the station. ''It doesn't look like what you think of when you think of the New York City subway.''
 The project is especially significant for residents in neighborhoods in southern Brooklyn -- Coney Island, Brighton Beach, Sea Gate, Gravesend and Bath Beach -- who have endured more than three years of noise and dust, not to mention suspended or rerouted train service on what are now the D, F, N and Q lines.
 ''This has been so eagerly awaited that there will be, on the official day, I guarantee you, cheering in the streets,'' said Chuck Reichenthal, the district manager for Community Board 13. Although the terminal will be back in business tomorrow, not all its final touches are expected to be finished for another month or so. 
 The four subway lines that end at Coney Island -- known traditionally, and still marked on subway maps, as the West End, Sea Beach, Culver and Brighton lines -- are descendants of steam railroads that began in the 1860's. The terminal replaces one that was built between 1915 and 1919 and had all but crumbled away. 
 Except for part of a brick-faced signal tower, preserved for nostalgia's sake, all that is left of the old station is a terra cotta facade facing Surf Avenue, which was painstakingly taken apart, restored and reassembled. The letters on the facade, BMT, refer to the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation. 
 The project involved replacing a corroded steel structure, encased in crumbling concrete, with a new open-deck steel structure, typical of the transit agency's other elevated stations.
 But the project's size made it exceptional. New York City Transit asserts that the Coney Island terminal is the largest subway station in the world, although it has a far smaller ridership than Times Square or Grand Central Terminal. 
 At the northern end of the new complex is a new facility for train crews.
 At the southern end, a new, 34,000-square-foot Portal Building serves as the public gateway to the terminal. It includes a new station house, complete with holding cells, for the transit police; a signal maintenance facility, and a retail complex. 
 As riders approach the trains, they will pass a 370-foot-long mural, made of translucent glass blocks with images of the 5-cent hot dog, the Wonder Wheel and other Coney Island attractions embedded in the glass, by the artist Robert Wilson. 
 By next spring, five stores -- perhaps a clothing store, a bank branch, a fast-food restaurant among them -- will occupy the 7,600 square feet of retail space, along with a handful of seasonal concessions selling beach-related items. 
 Since late 2001, N trains have stopped one station away, at 86th Street in Gravesend. The bulk of the construction -- five of the eight tracks -- was scheduled so that service would be cut off for only one full summer, in 2003. During that period, Coney Island was served by only one line, what is now the D. 
 On May 23, 2004, service on the F and Q lines was restored. The final two tracks to be rebuilt are to open tomorrow. 
 A joint venture of two companies, Granite Halmar Construction and Schiavone Construction, built the main terminal and canopy, while a third company, Vertex Engineering Services, built the Portal Building. ''It looked like a war zone at one point,'' said Suhas C. Sheth, the construction administrator for the project.
 Ms. Crawford, the chief engineer, who oversees 1,600 engineers, architects and other employees who manage the transit agency's building programs, said she was particularly proud of the ''green,'' or environmentally conscious, aspects of the project. 
 Workers recycled 85 percent of the debris from the old terminal, including two million pounds of steel. The photovoltaic panels that make up the canopy will generate 236,000 kilowatt hours of power a year, enough to cover about 15 percent of the energy used by the station.
 Joshua Sirefman, the president of the Coney Island Development Corporation, a nonprofit entity that the city created in 2003 to encourage economic development, said he was particularly impressed by the project's faithfulness to the neighborhood's history. 
 ''It reflects the character of Coney Island, which for any new activity is a significant accomplishment,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Give Peace A Chance

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY. 
E-mail: tierney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You would never guess it from the news, but we're living in a peculiarly tranquil world. The new edition of ''Peace and Conflict,'' a biennial global survey being published next week by the University of Maryland, shows that the number and intensity of wars and armed conflicts have fallen once again, continuing a steady 15-year decline that has halved the amount of organized violence around the world.
 Those statistics are no solace for mourners in Iraq and Darfur. But so many other people are now living in peace that you don't have be a dreamer like John Lennon to take seriously the question raised by Gregg Easterbrook in this week's New Republic cover story, ''The End of War?'' 
 I posed that question nearly a decade ago to my favorite prophet, Julian Simon, the economist who spent his career refuting doomsayers' predictions. He was convinced that three horsemen of the apocalypse -- famine, pestilence, death -- were in rapid retreat, and he suspected that the fourth was in trouble, too. 
 ''I predict that the incidence of war will decline,'' he told me in 1996, two years before his death. He based his prediction on the principle that there is less and less to be gained economically from war. As people get richer and smarter, their lives and their knowledge become far more valuable than the land, minerals and natural resources they used to fight over.
 The Iraq war is sometimes described, by both foes and supporters, as a pragmatic venture to keep oil flowing, but not even the most ruthless accountant can justify the expense. Even before the war, America's military costs in the Persian Gulf were much greater than the value of all the oil it was getting from the region, and now it's spending at least four times what the oil's worth.
 Of course, wars are also fought for noneconomic reasons, but those, too, seem to be diminishing. The end of the cold war left the superpowers' proxy armies without patrons, and the spread of democracy made nations less bellicose. (Democracies almost never fight each other.) Mr. Easterbrook calculates that the amount of military spending per capita has declined by a third worldwide since 1985. 
 Meanwhile, the number of people fighting has plummeted, even though population has grown enormously. ''From what we know about war, we can only conclude that it's a much lesser problem today,'' said Monty Marshall of George Mason University, a co-author of the ''Peace and Conflict'' report. ''War between countries is much less likely than ever, and civil war is less likely than any time since 1960.''
 These benign trends may be hard to believe, especially if you've been watching pictures from Iraq or listening to warnings about terrorists acquiring nuclear weapons. One explosion could indeed change everything.
 But before you dismiss the optimists as hopeless naifs, you might ask yourself if you're suffering from the malaise described in a book by Mr. Easterbrook called ''The Progress Paradox'': the better life gets, the worse people feel. The more peaceful and wealthy the world becomes, the more time we all have to watch wars and warnings on television.
 The only antidote is to look at long-term trends instead of daily horrors. For a really long-term trend, consider that of 59 skeletons found in a Stone Age graveyard, at least 24 died from violence. Or that a quarter of the male population died fighting in some pre-agricultural societies. 
 In the 20th century, despite two world wars, humans had less than a 2 percent chance of dying in war or a mass killing, according to John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State. Today the risk is lower still -- about a quarter the chance of dying in a car accident.
 I mention these numbers not to minimize today's tragedies. I plan to be at a parade on Monday honoring the soldiers who have fallen, especially the more than 1,600 in Iraq. But I will also be thinking about the Progress Paradox and the origin of Memorial Day.
 It started after the Civil War as Decoration Day, an occasion for widows wearing red poppies to decorate graves and memorials in virtually every town. If a war of that scale happened now, there would be nearly five million graves to tend. Sixteen-hundred is still too many, but if the trend continues, Memorial Day may eventually become a memory itself.

HEADLINE: Japanese Expert Urges Chinese Shift on Currency; Beijing Still Hesitant

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Chris Buckley contributed reporting from Beijing for this article.

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 27 

 BODY:
China should let its currency appreciate ''sooner rather than later,'' the president of the Asian Development Bank said Friday, even as the governor of China's central bank and some senior Chinese government economists tried to damp speculation that any move would come soon.
 Haruhiko Kuroda, president of the Asian Development Bank, a multilateral lending institution, told reporters that China needed to let the yuan rise to keep control of monetary policy and prevent inflation. Mr. Kuroda is regarded as one of Asia's most influential currency experts from his previous role overseeing Japan's currency policy. 
 While consumer price inflation has slowed in China this spring, asset prices, especially real estate prices, have been rising quickly as strong foreign investment and a soaring trade surplus have produced large flows of money into China, Mr. Kuroda noted. 
 But he stopped short of endorsing calls in Washington by some members of Congress for a sharp revaluation of the yuan, saying that any appreciation should occur gradually.
 ''China's authorities are well advised to move quickly, sooner rather than later,'' he said, while later adding, ''The pace of exchange rate adjustment should be gradual to avoid any shock to the Chinese economy.''
 Mr. Kuroda declined to recommend a timetable for appreciation or a mechanism for managing a gradual appreciation. His comments buttressed the position of Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, who told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that the Bush administration wants to see an appreciation of the yuan, but not necessarily an immediate floating of the currency, which could result in sharp changes in its value.
 But Chinese officials have shown little enthusiasm in public lately for any appreciation in the yuan.
 Top officials at China's central bank, which has many Western-educated economists, have hinted at a need for appreciation over the past three years, even as other government agencies, with closer ties to exporters and real estate developers, have been more wary.
 But on Friday, the governor of China's central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, said in Seoul that China would move cautiously in adjusting the exchange rate. Some senior Chinese government economists were also quoted on Friday in the Chinese-language International Business Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Ministry of Commerce in China, as questioning whether appreciation would be good for the Chinese economy.
 It would be best for the yuan exchange rate to remain stable for another two years, said Zhang Yansheng, a senior trade economist with the State Development and Reform Commission, the influential agency that oversees Chinese economic policy. He was quoted as saying that China's financial system was unprepared for the possible turbulence that loosening the exchange rate system would bring and that China's tools for managing currency risk were extremely undeveloped.
 Zhou Shijian, an international trade economist with the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission and a former trade official, was quoted as saying China should wait until speculative bets on a yuan revaluation had tapered off and only then allow the currency to rise, by a maximum of 5 percent. By contrast, American officials have reportedly suggested an increase of 10 to 15 percent.
 Many currency experts outside China have warned that a gradual appreciation could invite increased flows of money into China from speculators seeking to profit on a continuing rise in the currency. But Mr. Kuroda dismissed this argument, saying that Chinese controls on capital inflows are effective, and that the incentive to bet on appreciation would dwindle as the currency moved closer to investors' perception of its true value.
 Mr. Kuroda declined to say how big an increase might be needed to balance flows of money in and out of China, but he noted that with Chinese trade surpluses now surging, the needed appreciation ''would be larger than people thought in the past.''
 Mr. Kuroda cited China's fast-rising foreign exchange reserves as evidence of the need for China to change policy. The People's Bank of China said on Thursday that these reserves grew by $49.2 billion just in the first quarter of this year, to $651.1 billion, as the central bank issued yuan in exchange for dollars in a successful effort to hold the yuan at 8.277 to the dollar, a peg maintained since the end of the Asian financial crisis in 1998.
 The Asian Development Bank, based in Manila, is primarily a lending institution, and usually leaves monetary issues to the International Monetary Fund. But Mr. Kuroda was for four years Japan's vice minister of finance for international affairs, overseeing government policy on the yen in particular, and then served as special adviser to the Japanese cabinet for many of the same issues for two years before assuming his current post on Feb. 1 this year.
 While the Asian Development Bank has previously endorsed currency appreciation in China in general terms, Mr. Kuroda's comments were the clearest, most detailed and most forceful by a top official of the bank so far. He started a lunch with a half-dozen foreign correspondents by making his remarks on the Chinese currency before taking any questions, and noted that he was speaking on the record.

HEADLINE: Judge Rejects Settlement of Suit Over Loans Tied to Tax Refunds

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
A federal judge yesterday rejected the $360 million settlement of a lawsuit accusing H&R Block, the tax preparer, and HSBC Taxpayer Financial Services, a consumer lender, of deceiving poor customers into taking out high-interest loans.
 Judge Elaine E. Bucklo of the United States District Court in Chicago said yesterday that the settlement did not offer enough value and that many potential claimants might never learn of their rights. 
 Her 12-page decision, dated Wednesday, means the seven-year-old class-action case could head for trial this fall. Judge Bucklo last year dismissed several counts, but left intact a racketeering claim. 
 The settlement would have covered more than 28 million customers who conducted more than 55 million individual loan transactions. The loans were given to people who expected to receive tax refunds, but wanted access to the money sooner.
 H&R Block, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., and the lender, a unit of HSBC Holdings of Britain, agreed to the settlement this month. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected an earlier settlement.
 An H&R Block spokeswoman, Linda McDougall; an HSBC spokesman, James Pieper; and Steven Angstreich, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, each said they were disappointed with the judge's decision.
 Ms. McDougall and Mr. Angstreich characterized the rejected settlement as fair to the plaintiffs.
 The settlement would have covered all refund anticipation loans made by lenders through H&R Block and many such loans made by lenders with which HSBC had agreements through other tax preparers from 1987 to 2005.
 Refund anticipation loans are short-term cash advances against an expected income tax refund. They are a quick way to get cash, but often carry high interest rates.
 The settlement would have provided a $110 million cash payment and $250 million in coupons, each with a $6 face value, redeemable for H&R Block tax services. 
 But Judge Bucklo said the coupons offered little value.''It seems likely that the $6 coupon fee would simply be lost in higher fees and it is at any rate too little to be meaningful,'' she wrote. ''The coupons here appear to be the classic free advertising, which Block is free to provide, but which cannot be given value in considering the reasonableness of a settlement.''
 Judge Bucklo also said there was no basis to include in the settlement millions of people not in the certified class. She was unconvinced that the settlement provided adequate notice to potential claimants.
 ''At the very least, counsel for plaintiffs, who should not need reminding that they owe a fiduciary duty to every member of the plaintiff class, need to obtain and present the best possible proposal for giving reasonable and adequate notice to the class, and to provide the court with a reasoned analysis of how many claims are likely to be made,'' Judge Bucklo wrote. 
 Mr. Angstreich, a partner at Levy, Angstreich, Finney, Baldante, Rubenstein & Coren in Philadelphia, said the remaining issues in the case involved a pooling arrangement for loans and a license fee that HSBC paid to H&R Block for facilitating loans on its behalf.
 Ms. McDougall of H&R Block said: ''H&R Block did not disclose the fee because it did not affect what the bank was charging, or impact the customers' tax preparation fees.''

HEADLINE: Is Your House Overvalued?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Four days after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, pronounced the nation's housing market frothy, a new report on home prices this week suggested that he might have been understating the situation. Even after one of the steepest run-ups on record, home prices have jumped another 15 percent over the last year. 
 While gleeful about their apparent riches, homeowners in many of the hottest areas are also growing concerned. How, exactly, does one know if the family palace is sitting atop a bubble about to burst?
 The answer might have less to do with the sale price of your neighbor's house and more to do with something most homeowners ignore: the local rental market. 
 The easiest way to gauge a home's value is to borrow a tool from the stock market. In the most basic method of analyzing a stock, investors look at its price-to-earnings ratio, a comparison of a company's share price with its annual profit. The higher the ratio, the more expensive a stock is relative to its underlying value.
 Houses have their own version of such a ratio. Take the price of a typical house in an area, divide it by the amount that house would cost to rent for a year and the result is what might be called a rent ratio, an imperfect but still telling measure of real estate. 
 That ratio today shows that housing is not nearly as overpriced as stocks were in the late 1990's. But many areas are showing signs of irrational exuberance.
 Rents act as a reality check of sorts for home prices, a way to see how economic fundamentals, rather than psychology, are affecting the market. In only a small number of areas -- including Washington, Baltimore, Las Vegas, Jacksonville and the Long Island suburbs of New York -- are rents rising at a decent clip.
 In the last five years, the rent ratio in many coastal cities has more than doubled, according to an analysis for The New York Times by Economy.com, a research company. In San Francisco and San Jose, Calif., it has spiked to nearly 35 on average -- or about equal to the price-earnings ratio Microsoft's stock reached in 2000. In West Palm Beach, Fla., and San Diego, the ratio is almost 30. In New York, Miami and Los Angeles, it is about 25.
 A typical three-bedroom house in Mill Valley, Calif., about 10 miles north of the Golden Gate Bridge, now costs about $1 million, said Vanessa Justice, a real estate broker with Cagwin, Seymour & Hamilton there. A similar home would cost less than $40,000 a year to rent -- for a rent ratio of more than 25. 
 Some of these regions seem to be the places Mr. Greenspan was describing when he said last week that there were ''a lot of local bubbles'' in housing. Speaking yesterday at a conference in Berlin, Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, said, ''Right now, housing prices in many markets in the United States are relatively high when judged by conventional valuation measures.'' 
 In the lands of rising rents, companies are adding jobs, giving workers more money to spend, and the population is growing. Near Logan Circle in Washington, for example, one-bedroom apartments at the Hudson, with stainless-steel appliances and dark-orange concrete floors, now rent for about $2,100 a month, up more than 5 percent since 2003. 
 But in places where rents have trailed inflation or even fallen outright -- the Bay Area of California and much of the New York region -- the case for soaring home values looks harder to make. More families in these places seem to be relying on aggressive mortgage terms to buy homes.
 ''Investors think housing prices are going to go up 15 percent, 20 percent, every year -- so they're not worried if it makes much sense in terms of intrinsic value,'' said Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has written about the price-to-earnings ratio of houses. 
 ''But assets have fundamental values,'' he said. ''That tends to be forgotten in these emotional surges that drive values up and down.''
 In the Washington area, the rent ratio remains just below 20, or almost exactly equal to the price-earnings ratio of the stock market today, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. More of the rise in home prices around Washington, in other words, seems to reflect economic changes than it does in other places. 
 The growth of the federal government, especially the Department of Homeland Security, has strengthened the local economy. With one of the nation's best-educated work forces, the region has also attracted high-paying white-collar companies. 
 Booz Allen Hamilton, the consulting firm, announced last year that it would add 4,600 jobs, paying almost $80,000 a year on average, in Herndon, Va., near Washington Dulles International Airport. 
 The growth has created more demand for rented houses and apartments, even as thousands of renters have used low mortgage rates to buy their own homes.
 Two years ago, Christopher A. Barson, a 40-year-old interior designer, moved out of the first floor of a row house on Capitol Hill that cost about $1,700 a month, he said. He now lives in a loft-style apartment at the Hudson and pays $2,300 in rent.
 But there is a Starbucks in the bottom floor of his building and a Whole Foods supermarket across the street, and Mr. Barson does not have to battle the traffic to get into the city. ''The convenience factor is fabulous,'' he said.
 A number of apartment buildings in northern Virginia have also recently been converted to condominiums, reducing the supply of rental units. Sandra Graves, an agent with Long & Foster, said she recently rented an apartment in Fairfax, Va., for $250 more a month than two years ago, largely because of a shortage of apartments in the area.
 In California, by contrast, tenant-protection laws are stronger, making conversions more difficult, said Howard Rubin, chairman of Oakwood Worldwide, which operates short-term corporate apartments. 
 Over all, rents for Class A apartments, which are newer and bigger than others, have risen 13 percent over the last five years in the Washington area, nearly equal to inflation across the economy. In Boston, they have increased just 3 percent, according to Global Real Analytics, a research company based in San Francisco that publishes the National Real Estate Index.
 Class A rents have fallen 12 percent in Atlanta and 22 percent in San Jose, even as home prices have soared. New York rents have been roughly flat over the last five years.
 ''The rental market has obviously become more tied to underlying economic conditions at this point,'' Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Economy.com, said. ''It's not necessary to have a strong economy to have booming house prices.''
 Rent ratios are hardly a perfect measure of a region's housing market. Comparable rental data exist for only about 50 metropolitan areas.
 And simply because home values have risen more than rents does not mean there is a bubble waiting to burst. For many reasons -- the long-term decline in interest rates, the fall in mortgage costs as the Internet has increased competition and the extension of credit to low-income families -- buying a home is easier for many families than it once was. It makes sense that house prices have risen in recent years, economists say.
 But rent ratios have many advantages. They account for many of the factors that people often cite as justifications for the surge in home prices, like the growth in incomes, population and house sizes. 
 If a region is booming, rents and home prices alike should benefit. If it is busting, both would seem vulnerable.
 In places like the Bay Area, south Florida and much of the Northeast, though, the two parts of the housing market have become unhinged. Even in Las Vegas and in Riverside, Calif., where rents have risen, home prices have gone up so much more quickly that local rent ratios have soared above 23, from less than 12 in 2000, according to Economy.com.
 This kind of analysis also helps explain why most economists, even the nervous ones, consider today's housing market to be a different beast from the 1990's stock bubble. Nationwide, the rent ratio of houses remains around 17. At its peak five years ago, the ratio of the S.&P. 500 hit 35. Yahoo's price-to-earnings ratio nearly hit 1,000 in late 1999.
 Yahoo stock has since lost more than two-thirds of its value. Not even the most dour real estate analyst expects a plummeting of that magnitude for houses in San Francisco.
 On other hand, some economists say even Washington is in the midst of a run-up that is likely to end badly. Dean Baker, who predicted the stock market's fall and now says the housing market is headed for its own troubles, sold his Washington condominium, not far from Mr. Barson's loft apartment, last year for $445,000, after having bought it for $160,000 in 1997. Now Mr. Baker rents a similar-size apartment nearby.
 ''I felt stupid not doing it,'' said Mr. Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal group. ''To me, there's no doubt about the direction. The only question is timing.''
 Housing bears like him often point to the growing disconnection between rents and house prices. They also argue that history shows what can happen when house prices get ahead of themselves.
 After soaring in the 1980's, average house prices in the New York region fell significantly in the early 1990's. Adjusted for inflation, they did not return to their 1988 peak until 2002. Since then, they have risen more than 40 percent.

HEADLINE: In New York, Fringe Politics In Mainstream

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
More than a decade ago, when Fred Newman and Lenora Fulani embraced Marxist ideology, they could not persuade even the Rev. Al Sharpton to run under the banner of their fringe political party in his 1992 Senate bid.
 Mr. Sharpton, seeking to gain legitimacy as a candidate, began distancing himself from the two and from their New Alliance Party, as questions about his past association with them threatened to undermine his campaign and his credibility.
 But in recent years, Dr. Fulani and Dr. Newman have found many of the state's top political leaders eager to court their latest organization, the Independence Party of New York. 
 Through the party, Dr. Fulani and Dr. Newman, who were once considered eccentric figures on the political fringe, have found new stature, to the point where Republicans like Gov. George E. Pataki to Democrats like Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and United States Senator Charles E. Schumer have courted their party's support. Today, the Independence Party is expected to endorse the re-election bid of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican.
 The rise of Dr. Newman and Dr. Fulani from outsider status -- with organizations that were as interested in psychotherapy and Marxist ideology as in electoral politics -- has been part of a strategy that has resulted in their dominance over the Independence Party. The party has emerged as a powerful vote-getter in many state and local races, knocking the Conservative Party off the third line on the ballot and giving Mr. Bloomberg his margin of victory in 2001.
 In recent years, Dr. Newman, a psychotherapist, and Dr. Fulani, who ran two Quixotic campaigns for the White House, have, according to the party's state chairman, became the dominant force in the Independence Party's New York City branch. 
 For politicians like Mr. Bloomberg, the Independence Party's backing is an invaluable asset in a city where the vast majority of voters are registered Democrats. It will give voters the option of casting their ballots for the mayor on the Independence line instead of the Republican line. But the party's support has come at some cost, with Mr. Bloomberg recently having to distance himself from Dr. Fulani after she refused to disavow remarks she wrote in 1989 in which she said Jews ''had to sell their souls to acquire Israel and are required to do the dirtiest work of capitalism'' and had to ''function as mass murderers of people of color'' to keep it.
 ''With Lenora Fulani, I don't agree with her despicable comments,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in a meeting with The New York Times. ''I've said so, other people have said so. But you know, you walk away from every party where one person in it said something that you violently disagree with, you wouldn't be a member of the Democratic Party, you wouldn't be a member of the Republican Party, you wouldn't be a member of any party.''
 Dr. Fulani's comments and the group's widening ties to the state's leading politicians have caused former Independence Party leaders and former followers of Dr. Newman to resurrect accusations that he uses his psychotherapy centers as recruiting tools for his political activities. And they charge that the reverse is also true: People who enter his world through his political activities are channeled into his therapeutic practice. 
 ''Fred Newman's organizations are nothing if not intertwined,'' Jeremiah Duboff said in an e-mail message, adding that he worked with Dr. Newman and his organizations from 1990 to 1997.
 There is no suggestion that Dr. Newman and his followers influence Mr. Bloomberg's governance of the city. As is often the case in politics, the alliance between the mayor, a self-made billionaire, and Dr. Newman appears to be one of political convenience. Officials like Mr. Bloomberg either choose to ignore or do not know of other activities -- past and present -- of some of the party's leaders, while Dr. Newman and his followers win credibility and validation for all of their work, both inside and outside government.
 But Dr. Newman and his followers have accrued benefits since the Bloomberg administration took over. Mr. Bloomberg has contributed $250,000 to the Independence Party; he appointed a lawyer who often works with organizations affiliated with Dr. Newman to a mayoral commission charged with revising the city charter. And city economic development officials granted $8.7 million in low-interest financing to a nonprofit group tied to Dr. Newman so that it could buy a Manhattan building that it then used to run several programs designed by Dr. Newman.
 Perhaps more important, though, is the credibility that Dr. Newman's other organizations gain through their association with the mayor. In offices of several organizations affiliated with Dr. Newman, there are pictures of Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg on the wall. When one of his organizations, the All Stars Project, has held galas, Mr. Schumer and other officials have attended.
 Equally important is how the mayor and other politicians have helped reinforce the idea that the Independence Party represents independent voters.
 ''What is fair is that the Independence Party is growing stronger, and I think there is a reason for that,'' the mayor said at a speech to Independence Party members. ''Independents are the fastest-growing group of voters in America.''
 That kind of mainstream acceptance has been achieved incrementally over the years. As Dr. Newman and Dr. Fulani have gradually built their political power, Dr. Newman and his colleagues have built a multimillion-dollar enterprise that involves counseling centers around the country and, among other things, a theater that produces his plays in Times Square.
 Such stature is a sharp departure from the past, but Dr. Newman says he still adheres to many of his original beliefs and principles. In the 1970's, he created something called the International Workers Party, which was identified as a Leninist-Marxist organization. Dr. Newman said that the party has been transformed into a ''core collective'' that is made up of people working in his political, psychological and theatrical ventures, and that helps set the agenda for most of his projects. He said members of the collective then team up with other people -- often unaffiliated with any of his organizations -- to carry out their plans.
 ''So there is this grouping of people who I have organized who have been with me for a very, very long time, and organized around the philosophical perspective that I put forth on this issue of enfranchisement and alienation,'' Dr. Newman said. ''I have written extensively about alienation. It is of great concern to me.''

Politics and Psychotherapy
 Dr. Newman, 69, began organizing in the 1960's, a time when young people challenged not only the Vietnam War and the United States government but also concepts of society, family relations and mental health. With a doctorate in philosophy from Stanford University, Dr. Newman fit in with the spirit of the time, challenging many conventional beliefs as he began a career that focused his revolutionary zeal on psychological practices and political organizing.
 ''I got to know Fred, and he said he wanted to politicize his psychotherapy practice and start a collective of liberation front,'' said James Retherford, who split with Dr. Newman.
 Dr. Newman's early work drew from his theories of social therapy, a practice that employed the language of the left -- patients were called revolutionaries -- and a vision of healing emotional problems by changing patients' relationships to their environment, at least in part through political activism. Some on the left criticized Dr. Newman, saying that he used talk of revolution to seduce young people into his organizations, though Dr. Newman says that the traditional left disliked his work because it presented a threat.
 In the 1970's, Dr. Newman and about 40 of his followers joined forces with Lyndon LaRouche, the perennial fringe presidential candidate. The marriage did not last, and Dr. Newman subsequently created the International Workers Party. 
 In some of his works, Dr. Newman's call for political empowerment is seamlessly intertwined with his ideas about psychotherapy. In his 1986 speech in Havana, Dr. Newman described his approach as ''Marxist therapy,'' adding ''that human beings are capable of radically reorganizing social structure.''
 Dr. Newman's social therapy has been criticized -- and praised -- for taking an unconventional approach, for focusing on group therapy and for blurring the boundaries between patients and therapists. 
 ''The social therapy group has been called a cult,'' said Rick Ross, who has extensively studied cults. ''It is a personality driven group, call it what you will, a philosophical sect, the Fred Newman fan club. It centers around, and is driven by, Fred Newman.''
 In the late 1970's, Dr. Newman disbanded the International Workers Party, but its leaders remained behind the scenes, as they do now, helping to create and direct the work of other organizations, like the New Alliance Party, according to former members of the party, and the cadre.
 Part of the strategy, a former member said, was to create organizations that would bring followers and credibility to their political agenda. One plan, for example, involved helping to promote Mr. Sharpton. When Mr. Sharpton was at a low point in his career as a public leader, Dr. Newman and his followers helped him build a following as he led marches through the streets of Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to protest the racial killing of a black teenager.
 Organizations affiliated with Dr. Newman gave Mr. Sharpton an office, organized bus loads of volunteers for his protest marches and helped him earn an income, according to people involved in those activities. But then Mr. Sharpton balked at running for office as a member of the New Alliance Party and instead joined the Democrats.
 Each step of the way, Dr. Newman and his followers refined their tactics, changing their language to reflect the times, aligning themselves with candidates as diverse as Ralph Nader and Patrick J. Buchanan.
 ''One of the things I learned in the course of this work, people can move -- can grow -- when people vote for candidates they aren't just voting for individuals, they are voting to empower political parties and machines,'' Dr. Fulani said in an interview.
 Michael Hardy, a lawyer who went to work for Mr. Sharpton after leaving the New Alliance Party in 1992, said that all of the organizations were created to serve as the more acceptable public faces for a group that was controlled by Dr. Newman.
 ''The New Alliance Party, Social Therapy, were all mechanisms by which the International Workers Party operated publicly,'' Mr. Hardy said.

A Growing Voice
 In 1994, a group of upstate New Yorkers moved to create a third party. Faced with the challenge of collecting thousands of signatures to place a candidate on the ballot, the group's early leaders reached out to Dr. Newman and Dr. Fulani, because their followers had been successful in organizing such operations, former and present party members said. The party's candidate for governor, the upstate businessman Tom Golisano, spent millions of his own money on the campaign, and his strong showing earned the party a guaranteed line on the ballot in elections around the state. 
 Over time, Dr. Newman's longtime colleagues -- including members of his ''core collective'' -- helped organize a revolt against the leaders of the party. The forces in line with Dr. Fulani and Dr. Newman eventually triumphed with a reorganization that gave the New York City branch of the Independence Party -- which they had the most control of -- autonomy from the state organization and the ability to decide who received the ballot line in city elections.
 Frank MacKay, the state chairman, said in an interview that the reorganization meant that Dr. Newman and his followers effectively controlled the city organization, and he said they were hugely influential in running the state party. 
 With its control of a crucial ballot line in New York City, the party teamed up with Mr. Bloomberg in 2001. The two agreed on one main issue: promoting nonpartisan elections, which would ultimately weaken the Democrats' dominance of New York City -- and empower a party that identified as independent. 
 Cathy Stewart, one of the leaders of the Independence Party in Manhattan and around the state and a longtime colleague of Dr. Newman, helped coordinate Mr. Bloomberg's petition drive to get on the ballot, and many of the people who had helped run some of Dr. Newman's other organizations also helped circulate petitions, records show.
 ''The Independence Party isn't a usual kind of party,'' Ms. Stewart said. ''That is because of the fight that we waged and won at the grassroots for local control.''

Pulled Into Politics
 But some former members of organizations affiliated with Dr. Newman say that one of the ways the Independence Party finds volunteers and draws support for its agenda -- including the mayor -- is through Dr. Newman's nonpolitical group.
 Erika Van Meir, of Atlanta, said she was training with Dr. Newman to become a social therapist when she found herself being pulled into his world. During her training, she said, ''I couldn't understand why they were talking about Bloomberg so much,'' adding in an e-mail message that she ''found it odd that one patient returned from a trip to New York talking about how they met up with Fulani and a bunch of her associates who were trying to get Bloomberg elected.''
 Dr. Newman and some of his present colleagues say that no one involved in any one of his groups is under any pressure to be involved in any of his other activities.
 In recent years, the All Stars Project has become more visible in the city, in part through its work with schoolchildren. The group's program helps introduce children to Dr. Newman's ideas and some of the practices he uses in social therapy.
 Many elected officials and high-profile artists, academics and businesspeople have lent their names and credibility to the organization because of its work with poor minority children, with whom they put on talent shows. But the All Stars Project also runs a theater project for adults, which often produces plays written by Dr. Newman. 
 At the same time, the All Stars Project has made grants to Dr. Newman's psychological institute to help pay for programs that seek to spread his ideas about social therapy and political engagement. Dr. Newman disputes the suggestion that he has designed his organizations to funnel people from one activity to the other. He also says that his work is about empowering people ''I think we have accomplished a little something, not very big,'' he said. ''We have managed to reach the disenfranchised.''

HEADLINE: Chief Sees Surge in G.E. Business in India

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, May 27 

 BODY:
Jeffrey R. Immelt, chairman and chief executive of General Electric, said Friday that he expected G.E.'s revenue in India to leap to more than $5 billion by 2010 from $800 million now.
 Describing India as a ''rising star,'' Mr. Immelt said on a two-day visit that General Electric would aggressively expand in India, one of the world's fastest-growing economies, with new investment in financial services and manufacturing. 
 ''We believe that India is at the beginning of a growth cycle,'' Mr. Immelt said in a statement. He also spoke at a news conference in Mumbai Friday at the end of his India trip.
 India is a crucial market for G.E., as over half of its global revenue this year will come from outside the United States. According to its annual report, G.E. expects 60 percent of its growth to come from developing countries in the next decade.
 Mr. Immelt said the company would look for opportunities in advanced materials, energy, health care, financial services, security and water treatment. 
 ''My intent is to bid on every new project and be a financial participant in almost all projects alongside offering our technology,'' he said.
 For instance, the emergence of discount airlines, the open skies policy, the growing number of fliers and the demand for new and upgraded airports offer opportunities to businesses like GE Commercial Finance, GE Infrastructure and GE Aircraft Engines. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Immelt announced in New Delhi that G.E. would join with an Indian health care company, MediCity, to build a $250 million medical center, modeled after the Mayo Clinic, in Gurgaon, a suburb of New Delhi. 
 G.E. India and MediCity would collaborate to create a medical institute in high-end medical diagnostics and clinical research. The center, which will include a 1,800-bed multispecialty hospital incorporating alternative healing therapies, will open in 2007.
 General Electric, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., has units and joint ventures in India spanning technology and back-office outsourcing, credit cards and banking. The company currently employs more than 20,000 people in India.
 In Bangalore, for instance, G.E. has its biggest research and development center outside the United States, the Jack Welch Technology Center, that employs hundreds of scientists.
 G.E. held a 10 percent stake in the much-disputed $2.9 billion Dabhol Power Company, set up by the Enron Corporation in the western state of Maharashtra. The plant closed in 2001 after a payment conflict with the state that escalated into an international arbitration issue. G.E. said it wanted to resolve the dispute over Dabhol in a ''constructive and flexible'' way.
 G.E. entered India in 1902, and in the mid-1990's set up software, research and development and back-office operations. It was among the first global corporations to tap India's inexpensive, educated labor pool by outsourcing.

HEADLINE: Relax? Not if You're FedEx

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Anyone who wants to know which way the economy is going can read the unemployment figures, the Consumer Price Index or other tea leaves emanating from Washington. Or call FedEx. 
 ''We know a lot about how the economy really is doing, and Federal Reserve officials call us all the time,'' Frederick W. Smith, chief executive of FedEx, said during a recent visit to The New York Times. Mr. Smith, of course, has more pressing business: running a $29 billion company. He expounded on FedEx's strategies and prospects. Following are excerpts from that conversation:

Q. Lots of pundits have said that the Internet -- and specifically e-mail -- would spell disaster for document-shipping companies like FedEx. Has it?

A. Not at all. The biggest part of our business has always been moving things, not paper. With the Internet, people in Mississippi can buy things from Macedonia, without regard to time or place or quantity.

Q. With cost-cutting so rampant these days, are companies migrating toward lower-cost services -- shipping by ground, say, instead of by air?

A. People use air when an item has a short shelf life or a high value per pound. When personal computers sold for $4,000, they went by air; PC's got to be $800, shippers sent them by ground. Items like semiconductors or iPods will still go by air, particularly since, increasingly, they are manufactured outside this country. When iPods get to be $40, maybe they'll go by sea.

Q. It seems that FedEx and United Parcel Service are chasing all the same markets. How do you differ?

A. We all respond to each other's successes. After all, they just bought Overnite, which is their attempt to play catch-up with us in the less-than-truckload market. They're more involved in low-margin businesses like air and sea freight and operating warehouses for customers. Their theory is that they'll get the small shipping business from the same customers at a higher rate. We don't think that fundamental premise is correct. But if they are successful, we will have to be more aggressive.
 But for now, we remain organized into four operating companies: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, which delivers parts to factories and such, and, of course, FedEx Kinko's. We think the advantages of focus trump those of consolidation. For example, FedEx Express has to be near customers to meet its promise of delivery by a specific time. So it operates several centers in Manhattan. But FedEx Ground's facility is in Queens, in less expensive space, because it doesn't promise to deliver by 8:30 or 10:30.

Q. Where will your greatest growth come from?

A. The biggest growth prospects are international. Our volumes coming off of China are up 50 percent year over year, and we've got a big and growing presence in India.
 And Kinko's will give us a lot of opportunities, too. It's no longer the corner copy shop, but a global digital printing system. If a Pfizer or an implement manufacturer wants sales material delivered to its 3,000-person sales force, bound a particular way, we can print it and distribute it in a couple of hours.

Q. If your growth is going to come from shipping goods made elsewhere and shipping documents via electrons rather than messengers, what does that say about the prospects for jobs in the United States?

A. A lot of the economy is indeed being supplied by goods that are produced offshore. And much of the reason for that is societal. We don't have national employment laws, which makes dealing with labor a real hassle. And there's a mismatch between our educational system and what the market needs. Universities in Hamburg and Yokohama still turn out people oriented to manufacturing; here, the few people attracted to that seem to go into the military-industrial complex. One reason we're such a litigious society is that we're producing lawyers at a vastly greater rate than our need for them. My son is graduating from law school. He's going to work in the FedEx sales department because he couldn't find a job as a lawyer.

HEADLINE: Buffett Steps Up; Another Step Down for G.M.

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
GOOD news abounded this week. Americans were all a bit wealthier, at least if they own homes; the economy grew faster, rebounding from a bit of a slowdown early in the year; and markets rose. 
 Yet there were developments to give one pause. Oil prices popped above $50 a barrel on news of low inventories ahead of the summer driving season. Analysts warned of weak auto sales. And, come to think of it, are endlessly booming house prices really such a good thing?

FROTHY EXUBERANCE? -- People who think the housing market is robust and those who think it is scary each had a little more evidence this week to make their case.
 The median price of existing homes in the United States jumped more than 15 percent, to $206,000, last month from April 2004. The median price of new homes also climbed 3.8 percent last month, to $230,800.
 Even at those prices, demand is strong. Existing-home sales surged 4.5 percent in April, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.18 million. 
 Good news about a strong market? Bad news about a bubble? Hard to say. But Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, did recently warn of ''froth'' in the market. 
 Was that, perhaps, a polite way of suggesting ''irrational exuberance,'' as he did about stocks before that market tumbled in 2001?
 Congress is moving to increase the size of mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which could make more money available for home loans and thus bolster prices. It is not acting on a White House request to reduce the agencies' lending limits, which could cool the market.

THE BEST POLICY -- The American International Group scandal, based as it is on suspicions of obscure balance sheet manipulations, has not yet generated the interest or outrage of other securities cases. But that may be about to change now that it finally entered its courtroom phase.
 New York's attorney general and its insurance superintendent sued A.I.G. and two former top executives in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The suit accused the former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, and former chief financial officer, Howard I. Smith, of having deceived investors by making the books of A.I.G., one of the world's biggest insurance companies, look stronger than they were.
 Criminal charges may yet be filed in the case, which is still being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Justice Department.

POWER PLAY -- After a long hiatus from deal making, Warren E. Buffett jumped back in, using some of the $44 billion in cash accumulated by his Berkshire Hathaway holding company. Through MidAmerican Energy, a big Iowa utility owned by Berkshire, he offered to buy PacifiCorp, an electric company with customers in six Western states, for $5.1 billion in cash.
 The offer came two weeks after Duke Power in North Carolina offered $9 billion for Cinergy, an Ohio utility. It also follows a decision by the Exelon Corporation, which owns utilities in northern Illinois and eastern Pennsylvania, to buy the Public Service Enterprise Group, the parent of New Jersey's largest utility, P.S.E. & G., for about $13 billion last December.
 For the deal to work, the federal government may need to repeal a 1935 law that requires utilities to operate in one contiguous area and forbids them to use their profits to subsidize unregulated businesses owned by a parent company.

WHAT'S BAD FOR G.M. -- Fitch Ratings was not the first credit agency to cut General Motors' debt ratings to ''noninvestment grade,'' or junk status, (Standard & Poor's did it on May 5). But Fitch's move, being the second junk-status rating among the big three credit services, got G.M.'s bonds kicked off some indexes and tossed out of some mutual funds.
 That is no small thing, for G.M. or the corporate bond market. G.M. will have to pay more to raise cash for its automaking unit -- and for its more profitable financial services unit.
 The bond market will have to cope with the fact that many institutional investors, including pension funds, are forbidden to risk their clients' money on junk bonds. G.M. had almost $300 billion of long-term debt outstanding as of March 31. 
 The downgrade increases G.M.'s incentive to spin off its financial unit. That business could raise capital more cheaply if it was not on the hook for part of the automaker's pension and health care obligations.

HEADLINE: Surf's Up, Tops Down: A Drive to Find California's Soul

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

DATELINE: OJAI, Calif. 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the Southern California of Jan and Dean, Sonny and Cher, woodies and lowriders? Remember the place where everyone was blond and young, and no one had to work on days when the surf was up? Most of all, remember when the freeways were free of traffic jams and the three most romantic words in the English language were Pacific Coast Highway?
 Well, neither do I. But growing up in Pittsburgh, where black ice kept traffic at a crawl in winter and soot-spewing diesel buses managed that feat in other seasons, I surely thought I knew what I was missing. 
 Three decades have passed -- all right, closer to four -- and I have finally made it to Southern California. Indeed, I really lucked out, pitching my tent in a quiet valley to the east of Santa Barbara, where the sun shines four days out of five and, more often than not, the breeze is scented with jasmine and orange blossoms. 
 Still, everyone knows that the Southern California of my youthful fantasies -- in particular, the California of limitless car-centered mobility -- has long been under assault. Unplanned growth has studded Los Angeles and Orange Counties with minicities and stuffed the spaces in between with housing tracts and strip malls. Indeed, the sprawl has burst its boundaries to the east, into the lemon groves and broccoli fields of Riverside County, an area that the cheery folks who sell houses and rent office space call the Inland Empire.
 According to the Texas Transportation Institute, a state research agency, traffic in metropolitan Los Angeles, measured in hours of delay per peak-hour traveler, actually declined a bit over the last decade. But road congestion there was still the country's worst: a typical rush-hour commuter lost 93 hours to traffic jams in 2003, compared with 47 hours back in the palmy days of 1982 (the first year that the data was systematically collected). Translating the lost hours and burned fuel into dollars, the hapless peak-hour traveler wasted $1,598 on traffic in 2003. 
 It would have been worse if traffic engineers had not employed several strategies to limit the congestion. But the countermeasures themselves are testament to the ever more hollow promise of being able to jump in your car and drive to Malibu or Pasadena in less time than it takes to play the Beach Boys' ''Little Deuce Coupe'' album. Stoplights enforce ramp metering, a system for rationing entry to the freeways in peak traffic periods; high-occupancy-vehicle lanes reward car poolers at the expense of less organized drivers; and the economists' favorite, state-owned roads in Orange County, impose tolls that increase during rush hours. 
 Thanks to rough terrain, scarce water and muscular antigrowth lobbies, areas to the north and west are not unbroken extensions of the Los Angeles sprawl, and not nearly as congested. Indeed, if the Southern California fantasy of mobility is alive anywhere (other than the desert and the central valleys dominated by agribusiness) it is here in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, where the time lost in rush-hour traffic is about one-third that of Los Angeles. 
 All I needed was an excuse to take some time off and wander the highways in search of the faded dream. It came with the deliveries of two test cars that have strong ties to a romantic past.
 While all sorts of vehicles are identified with the California car culture -- everything from the Ford Super Deluxe wood-bodied station wagons of the late 1940's to the tricked-out Honda Civics favored by street racers more recently -- my own yearnings growing up in Pennsylvania were more plebian. I drooled over Ford Mustangs from the 1960's and every generation of Chevrolet's Corvette. 
 In the mind's eye, at least, the true California driving experience requires a drop-top; serendipitously, dandy new Mustang and Corvette convertibles were recently introduced. 
 The 2005 Mustang offers young-at-heart drivers the pleasures of earlier versions, but leaves behind the coarse handling that made older Mustangs a chore to drive and cheap interiors that harked back to the car's origins as a Falcon economy car in a cowboy suit. Indeed, at around $32,000 loaded, the 300-horsepower Mustang GT convertible is a snazzy fire-breathing bargain.
 Like previous Corvettes, the sixth-generation model is muscular to the max. But unlike earlier incarnations, the car's steering and braking are fully a match for the 6-liter 400-horsepower V-8 under the hood. More surprising yet, the new Corvette has a polished interior design and its fit and finish approach that of European sports cars. One big disappointment is the price, which starts at $52,245 for the convertible (about $8,000 more than the coupe) and can hit $60,000 in the blink of an option.
 It was not hard to choose a place to drive. The Ojai Valley, in Ventura County, is just a dozen or so miles from California Route 101, a major north-south artery teeming with Home Depots, Marriott Courtyards and In-N-Out Burgers. But the steep mountains that enclose the valley offer only four ways out, limiting development and assuring that, save for the main link to Los Angeles, the roads are rarely crowded.
 The first destination was Ojai's upper valley to the east, where entertainment lawyers and management consultants have gradually replaced the modest abodes and scrubby gardens of longtime residents with picturesque barns, apricot orchards and the occasional exotic animal refuge. Alas, there was no one here to admire my red Mustang convertible aside from a few horses cadging carrots and a Crown Vic cruiser from the county sheriff's department, trolling for speeders and evidence of methamphetamine labs. 
 Route 150's climb out of the lower valley includes a series of tight switchback turns that offered a chance to test the car's versatility. The Mustang met the challenge handily, with just enough understeer -- a reluctance to turn when pressed hard -- to warn when the wide, grippy tires were at their limit. Yet the enormous torque available at low engine speeds from the 4.6-liter V-8 also made it possible to dawdle along the flats at 35 miles an hour in fifth gear.
 Making my way back to the village of Ojai, the Mustang did draw envious glances. Oddly, a visit here with the Corvette a few days earlier was met with less enthusiasm. This may be a subtle class issue. The new Mustang is an American icon, but the image has been softened by the playful retro design. The Corvette, by contrast, carries a whiff of steroids; its attitude is inconsistent with the self-image of a town whose claims to fame are assorted spiritual gurus and umpteen varies of massage therapy, not to mention the luscious pixie tangerine.
 Another drive took me northwest from the valley on California Route 33, a twisty two-lane that offers postcard views of gorges and arid peaks as it climbs into the Los Padres National Forest. I could drive only as far as the Rose Valley campground; the road was closed beyond that point because of damage from winter storms. The closing worked in my favor -- the usually sparse traffic was down to zilch -- making the return to Route 150 a painless drive. 
 Heading west from the valley, the road drops low to follow the shore of Lake Casitas, a gorgeous man-made body that fills the swimming pools of Ojai, before rising again to cross the Casitas Pass. From the crest, one can view 8,000-foot mountains to the east and see the Channel Islands to the south, some 20 miles beyond the Santa Barbara harbor. But drivers should not allow themselves to be distracted by the scenery, as this route conceals tricky turns that tighten before unwinding back into straight-ahead roadway. Still, it offers a nice opportunity to push a hot car like the Corvette. 
 Older models of G.M.'s sports car were always fun to pilot, but could be a bit scary because the handling was not always equal to its explosive power. The newest 'Vette, by contrast, drives as good as it looks, showing confidence-building poise as it accelerated through turns. The real proof of its competence, though, was how well it handled on pavement marred by debris from the storm runoff and how forgiving it was when I overestimated my own driving skills.
 On reaching the coast near the lazy beach town of Carpinteria, reality intrudes. Heading north on Route 101, the six lanes narrow to four; the bottleneck slows traffic to a crawl at rush hour and on weekend afternoons, when the road is choked with beach worshipers. 
 No wonder -- along this stretch to Santa Barbara, Route 101 tracks some of California's most beautiful beaches. On weekdays (except for the summer), it's just you, the gulls and the ever-present surfers waiting 100 yards out to realize their very different dreams of mobility.
 Driving in Southern California is not what it used to be, hardly a surprise when you consider that some 15 million people are almost entirely dependent on cars to move around metropolitan Los Angeles and another 3 million maneuver for bumper room in the San Diego metroplex. With highway improvement falling to a low priority in this flat-broke state, chances are slim that driving will become cheaper and easier. 
 Still there are pockets of easy living (and driving) hidden in the mountains. On second thought, forget I mentioned it -- paradise is definitely running out of room to maneuver.

HEADLINE: Karl's New Manifesto

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I was in the library reading room when suddenly a strange specter of a man appeared above me. He was a ragged fellow with a bushy beard, dressed in the clothes of another century. He clutched news clippings on class in America, and atop the pile was a manifesto in his own hand. He was gone in an instant, but Karl's manifesto on modern America remained. This is what it said:
 The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle. Freeman and slave, lord and serf, capitalist and proletariat, in a word oppressor and oppressed, stand in opposition to each other and carry on a constant fight. In the information age, in which knowledge is power and money, the class struggle is fought between the educated elite and the undereducated masses. 
 The information age elite exercises artful dominion of the means of production, the education system. The median family income of a Harvard student is $150,000. According to the Educational Testing Service, only 3 percent of freshmen at the top 146 colleges come from the poorest quarter of the population. The educated class ostentatiously offers financial aid to poor students who attend these colleges and then rigs the admission criteria to ensure that only a small, co-optable portion of them can get in.
 The educated class reaps the benefits of the modern economy -- seizing for itself most of the income gains of the past decades -- and then ruthlessly exploits its position to ensure the continued dominance of its class. 
 The educated class has torn away from the family its sentimental veil and reduced it to a mere factory for the production of little meritocrats. Members of the educated elites are more and more likely to marry each other, which the experts call assortative mating, but which is really a ceaseless effort to refortify class solidarity and magnify social isolation. Children are turned into workaholic knowledge workers -- trained, tutored, tested and prepped to strengthen class dominance.
 The educated elites are the first elites in all of history to work longer hours per year than the exploited masses, so voracious is their greed for second homes. They congregate in exclusive communities walled in by the invisible fence of real estate prices, then congratulate themselves for sending their children to public schools. They parade their enlightened racial attitudes by supporting immigration policies that guarantee inexpensive lawn care. They send their children off to Penn, Wisconsin and Berkeley, bastions of privilege for the children of the professional class, where they are given the social and other skills to extend class hegemony.
 The information society is the only society in which false consciousness is at the top. For it is an iron rule of any university that the higher the tuition and more exclusive the admissions, the more loudly the denizens profess their solidarity with the oppressed. The more they objectively serve the right, the more they articulate the views of the left.
 Periodically members of this oppressor class hold mock elections. The Yale-educated scion of the Bush family may face the Yale-educated scion of the Winthrop family. They divide into Republicans and Democrats and argue over everything except the source of their power: the intellectual stratification of society achieved through the means of education.
 More than the Roman emperors, more than the industrial robber barons, the malefactors of the educated class seek not only to dominate the working class, but to decimate it. For 30 years they have presided over failing schools without fundamentally transforming them. They have imposed a public morality that affords maximum sexual opportunity for themselves and guarantees maximum domestic chaos for those lower down.
 In 1960 there were not big structural differences between rich and poor families. In 1960, three-quarters of poor families were headed by married couples. Now only a third are. While the rates of single parenting have barely changed for the educated elite, family structures have disintegrated for the oppressed masses. 
 Poor children are less likely to live with both biological parents, hence, less likely to graduate from high school, get a job and be in a position to challenge the hegemony of the privileged class. Family inequality produces income inequality from generation to generation.
 Undereducated workers of the world, unite! Let the ruling educated class tremble! You have nothing to lose but your chains. You have a world to win!
 I don't agree with everything in Karl's manifesto, because I don't believe in incessant class struggle, but you have to admit, he makes some good points.

HEADLINE: Excuse Me, I'm Not Through Yet

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
WHEN Carleton S. Fiorina, Hewlett-Packard's former chief executive, gave a long-planned commencement speech this month at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, she commiserated a bit with the graduating students who were starting to look for jobs. ''I've been working on my resume,'' she said. ''I've been lining up my references. I bought a new interview suit.''
 Clearly, Ms. Fiorina, who was forced to resign in February in one of the most widely chronicled dismissals in corporate history, is eager to get back to work. But what are her chances of landing another job running a Fortune 500 company? 
 She can certainly take heart from the examples of others. America, after all, is the land of self-reinvention. Consider Donald J. Trump, who has weathered crushing debts and bankruptcy to become perhaps the nation's best-known businessman. Or Steven P. Jobs, who was booted from Apple Computer as its fortunes flagged, went off to found the successful computer animation studio Pixar and then was invited back to Apple, where he is leading its renaissance. 
 Even being convicted of a crime need not be a career-stopper. Martha Stewart, most famously, seems to have survived time in prison for having lied to government investigators looking into a stock trade. She returned to her company last March as shareholders applauded.
 But for all the success stories, corporate comebacks are by no means easy. In fact, a 1999 study of chief-executive turnover at the 1,000 largest American companies by market capitalization found that fewer than half of the C.E.O.'s dismissed for negative reasons had returned to leadership roles. (The study also included executives dismissed in the wake of mergers and for other reasons.)
 ''There is a cloud that hangs over you,'' said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, an associate dean at the Yale School of Management, who wrote the study with Andrew Ward, a professor of management at the University of Georgia. ''People are fearful of being associated with failure. You have to overcome that fear, and it is very difficult.''
 And the odds have become only longer since then. Corporate scandals of the last few years, and the governance and disclosure laws enacted in response, have made it more difficult for former chiefs to rebound.
 ''Corporate boards are more acutely aware of their responsibilities for oversight than ever,'' particularly after the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley anticorruption law, Professor Ward said, ''and they are more accountable to shareholders, so in turn they are holding chief executives more responsible.''
 BOARDS are also less eager to take chances or to give an unemployed C.E.O. the benefit of the doubt about previous performance. In the past, boards ''thought of the company as a sports team that had had a bad run,'' Professor Ward said. ''They viewed the chief executive as the coach who, over the long term, had had a good record, and so they were willing to give him another chance,'' he added. ''Now the hurdle is higher. The board is looking much more at the specifics of what happened in that particular case.''
 Nevertheless, executives can and do beat the odds. Some succeed by dint of their optimism, experts say, others by the skills that took them to the top in the first place. A few use connections made over the years. Often, they attain their goals simply because they refuse to give up.
 When Millard S. Drexler, then 58, was unceremoniously ousted from Gap Inc. in 2002, he could have just retired a wealthy man. Instead, he turned down the severance package because it came with a clause that would have forbidden him to work at another retailer. ''I wanted to get right back into the game,'' he said in a telephone interview.
 Less than a year after Mr. Drexler left Gap, the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group hired him to revive J.Crew, the preppy clothing retailer. For him, it was an irresistible second act. In his two decades at Gap, he had built the company into one of the most successful retailing brands in history, though by 2002 it had reported 29 consecutive months of declining same-store sales -- those for stores open at least a year -- an important industry metric. 
 Being handed the reins of the floundering J.Crew was an opportunity for Mr. Drexler to rebound without having to start a company from scratch. ''My skill is in taking an asset and expanding it in terms of its value,'' he said.
 James G. Coulter, a founding partner of Texas Pacific, said he never flinched at hiring Mr. Drexler, whom he called ''a legendary merchant'' who could ''walk into a room and pick out what would sell.'' Mr. Coulter recalled that when he introduced his sister-in-law to Mr. Drexler, ''the first thing he asked was where she had bought her skirt.''
 Mr. Coulter said Mr. Drexler's problem at Gap was that it had outgrown his hands-on approach to management. ''That style did not work in a chain with thousands of stores,'' he said. ''But it is perfect for us. J.Crew has about 160 stores.'' Early signs suggest that Mr. Drexler hasn't lost his touch: J.Crew's same-store sales rose 16 percent last year.
 Executives who rebound well are generally pragmatists, said Gerald R. Roche, the senior chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search firm. Who finds new jobs fastest? ''People who are realistic and whose egos are not out of sight,'' he said.
 Who has the hardest time recovering? People who take it personally when they are fired, said Graef Crystal, a compensation consultant. ''They are afraid that people will see them as damaged goods, regardless of the merits,'' he said. ''So they want to take all the severance they can get, on the assumption that their career is over and they are not going anywhere. Mostly they take the $30 million or $40 million and the next thing: they are appearing almost daily on your favorite local golf course.''
 Professor Ward agreed. ''A lot of people, when they are fired, have the reaction of hiding,'' he said. ''They stay away from the press and contacts. The ones that do well are persistent at using their networks and seeing that their side of the story is out.''
 Few have done better at that than Martha Stewart. When she was indicted last June, accused of obstruction of justice, she used her Web site to tell her side of the story and to elicit support. And in the months before she began her five-month prison term last October, she met with Mark Burnett, the producer of ''The Apprentice.'' By September, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia had struck a deal for a similar series, with her as the star. The television show will make its debut this fall.
 She was helped in these endeavors by the nature of her legal trouble: it had nothing to do with her job running her company. ''Nobody ever questioned the credibility of her product or her company because her crime was not connected to it,'' Professor Sonnenfeld of Yale said.
 STILL, even the most proactive executives can be stymied by a criminal record related to their work, said Bruce C. Greenwald, a professor at the Columbia Business School. ''What you have to sell is your talent and your presence,'' he said. ''The one thing they have to do is believe in it. If they can't trust that presentation, you will have a tough time.'' Business leaders with enough assets, of course, can just walk away from their old world, as the former Drexel Burnham Lambert financier Michael R. Milken did after he pleaded guilty in 1990 to six felony counts related to illegal securities trading and was barred from the securities industry. Without wealth, the challenge becomes much harder, although some professionals recover. In 1986, Ilan K. Reich, then a 32-year-old partner at the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, was convicted of supplying takeover information to the investment banker Dennis B. Levine. Mr. Reich was disbarred and sentenced to a year and a day in prison and five years of probation.
 The conviction, he said, ripped his world apart. He lost not only his job, but also many of his friends. ''So many relationships are built around business and the professional world,'' Mr. Reich said in a telephone interview. He had little time to mope after serving his time. ''I had a wife and three kids,'' he said. ''I didn't want them to suffer for my mistakes. And I am an optimist. If I weren't, I wouldn't be alive today.''
 When Mr. Reich got out of prison, he was hired as a vice president for business development by Richard Bernstein, a private investor who ran the Western Publishing Group, a publisher of the Golden Books and other children's literature. ''I had been on the opposite side of him in a major deal, '' Mr. Reich said.
 But Mr. Reich sought to return to the bar, a task that he self-consciously called ''the maniacal pursuit of the unattainable.'' He succeeded, with the support of Robert W. Sweet, the federal district judge who had presided in his initial case, and joined Olshan Grundman Frome Rosenzweig & Wolosky. 
 The law firm did work for the Inamed Corporation, which was the target of many lawsuits over its silicon breast implants, and in 1998 Inamed hired Mr. Reich as a vice president. He was promoted to co-chief executive in 2000, but he left a year later amid a dispute with the board.
 His business conflicts would continue. In 2002, a Delaware court blocked efforts by Mr. Reich and other investors to fire the founder and chief executive of SpectruMedix, a private company in State College, Pa., that makes tools to test for genetic mutations, and replace him with Mr. Reich. Only after the two sides settled did Mr. Reich join the company, where he is now chairman.
 Returning to business hasn't been much easier for Victor Niederhoffer. His first hedge fund business was crippled in 1997 by leveraged and unhedged speculations in the Thai stock market, and then finished off by a wrong bet on American stocks.
 Mr. Niederhoffer said he was severely depressed by the blow-up. To stay afloat, he had to sell his silver collection and take a mortgage on his 20,000-square-foot home in Weston, Conn. Friends ostracized him. ''People stopped inviting me,'' he said. ''I became persona non grata, and I think they were very disappointed in me. They thought of me as a winner and a prudent person. They had planned their retirement around their investments with me.''
 He did not get back in the game until 2002, when he founded the Matador Fund, an offshore hedge fund with $4 million. Today it has assets of $156 million, mostly, he said, from South Africa. ''The economy is so bad there that our problems look minor in comparison,'' he said, alluding to his previous misfortunes.
 The fund is up 147 percent since he founded it, including a 13 percent gain so far this year. The 2005 gain has come despite extraordinary volatility: for example, the fund lost 13 percent in just one month, April. 
 If such swings unnerve Mr. Niederhoffer, he doesn't show it. ''There is always the possibility of failure on the front burner,'' he said. ''You can't make money without risk. We believe we took appropriate risk.''
 Still, he knows that this may be his last chance. ''People are willing to give you a second chance in America,'' he said. ''I am still walking on very thin ice. And I am older. I am 61. I don't have the resilience to come back again.''
 Some business leaders, of course, do more than just recover from failure. They learn from it, too. One who has learned plenty is Isaac Mizrahi, the fashion designer. After gaining attention as the subject of a 1995 documentary, ''Unzipped,'' he built a couture business that was hailed by critics and retailers and was financed by Chanel.
 Sales, however, never matched the buzz, and by 1998 Chanel withdrew its support and he closed his business. He says he was hardly defeated by the turn in his fortune and simply moved on to other things, including a stint as a television talk show host on Oxygen, the cable network. ''I didn't feel like a flop,'' he said. ''Entrepreneurship is not at the core of what I do. What I do is art.''
 Unlike Mr. Niederhoffer's setbacks, Mr. Mizrahi's problems did not leave him under financial pressure. ''Isaac does not live large,'' said Marisa Gardini, his business partner. ''He is not a Puff Daddy kind of guy. He didn't have overhead to worry about.''
 Mr. Mizrahi is nothing if not a great showman, and after the crash he remained in the public eye. He continued to design clothes for friends and celebrities. In 2000, he and Ms. Gardini, a lawyer by training, produced an Off Broadway one-man show called ''Les Mizrahi,'' starring him. That same year, Target approached him about designing a low-cost line of clothing that by several accounts is now flourishing. He also started a small couture line at Bergdorf Goodman. 
 Mr. Mizrahi's experience affirms one theory of business comebacks. ''Your first chance can be luck and serving time,'' said Professor Greenwald of Columbia, ''but your second chance has to be based on some personal talent that separates you from the others.
 ''All the guys who do second acts have talent,'' he added. ''If they don't have it, they never come back.'' 
 So as Carly Fiorina lines up her references, she might remind them to emphasize her decisiveness, doggedness and exceptional public relation skills. A little luck wouldn't hurt her comeback chances, either.

HEADLINE: Another Million-Dollar House: There Goes the Neighborhood

BYLINE: By AVI SALZMAN

 BODY:
GOT a million-dollar home?
 Ho-hum.
 United States Census Bureau data released on Tuesday shows that Connecticut had the second-highest percentage of homes valued at more than $1 million when the survey was conducted in 2003. An estimated 29,270 homes in Connecticut had seven-figure price tags, compared with 12,926 in 2000. Fully 3.3 percent of Connecticut's homes were valued by their owners at more than $1 million, second only to California, with 4.1 percent. 
 More recent data also shows that fears of an imminent real estate bust may have been premature. 
 ''It hasn't dried up yet,'' said Michael Casey, a Realtor with William Raveis International in Greenwich.
 Nationally, median prices for existing homes, a category which does not include newly built ones, increased by 15.1 percent in April compared to last year, according to the National Association of Realtors. In Connecticut, prices rose about 7.8 percent in the first quarter of 2005, according to John Clapp, a professor of finance and real estate at the University of Connecticut School of Business. Dr. Clapp adjusts housing data based on variables such as the location and the size of the house to come up with what he considers a more accurate measurement. 
 The Connecticut Association of Realtors has not released data from the first quarter of 2005, but fourth-quarter median prices from last year were 16.2 percent higher than they were at the end of 2003.
 In select markets, million-dollar homes are becoming increasingly common. In Stamford, according to Dr. Clapp's first-quarter data, 20 percent of homes were priced for more than $1.3 million and 10 percent at more than $1.8 million. In Greenwich, about 55 percent of homes have sold for between $1 million and $3 million this year, Mr. Casey said.
 Fairfield County's median home prices ranked 17th in the nation for counties with at least 250,000 people, according to the Census survey.
 In some ways, the continuing price increases seem counterintuitive. At least in Greenwich, more houses are up for sale and houses have been staying on the market longer, but prices continue to go up. Because of interest rates, Mr. Casey said, deals are still good.
 Interest rates have hovered around 6 percent. Bob Fiorito, the president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors, said that is still far from the level that would deter buyers. ''As long as interest rates stay below 8.5 percent, I don't think you'll see an appreciable effect on the market,'' Mr. Fiorito said.
 Nonetheless, some think growth is slowing down from the consistent double-digit price increases of the past few years.
 ''I think what we're seeing is more of a leveling off,'' Mr. Casey said. ''Maybe we're going from 100 m.p.h. to 80 m.p.h., but we're still going forward.''
 Dr. Clapp expects some of the higher-priced markets to lose momentum. There may not be a widespread slide in prices, but certain areas that have boomed, such as Stamford, could get hit hard if interest rates rise, he said.
 ''There are certain areas where you might have some shakeouts coming up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Climb as Inflation Fear Recedes

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market rose last week on optimism that the economy would grow without setting off serious inflation. 
 The government reported on Thursday that economic growth in the first quarter was stronger than expected. 
That spurred a rally in shares of homebuilders and computer chip makers -- companies that often thrive during rapid economic expansion. The report also showed that personal consumption expenditures, excluding food and energy, were contained during the quarter, suggesting that inflation was under control.
 Exxon Mobil, with a gain of 5.2 percent, was the best performer among the Dow industrial companies for the week. Its shares rose in response to an increase in the wholesale price of crude oil, which has shaken the broader stock market in previous periods but evidently did not alarm most investors this time around.
 For the week, the Dow rose 70.64 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 10,542.55. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 9.5 points, 0r 0.8 percent, to close at 1,198.78. The Nasdaq composite index gained 29.31 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,075.73. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.07 percent from 4.12 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Tops in Per Capita Income; Debt, Too

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE

 BODY:
AS legislators continue to debate what programs to finance and what services to cut in a state budget that is anticipated to be more than $15 billion next year, a little-mentioned but startling financial statistic lurks in between the line items and the bottom line: Connecticut leads the nation in per capita debt, at $3,614.
 But hold off the hand-wringing. According to the experts, it's not as bad as it sounds.
 Despite having the highest per capita debt (and hardly a poster child for Yankee parsimony), Connecticut also has the highest per capita income, at about $45,400, of any state. Connecticut's debt service is $1.7 billion, about 11 percent of the total budget. They are payments, economists said, the state can afford because of the tax revenue from residents' high incomes. 
 ''People like to talk about Connecticut having the highest bonded indebtedness,'' said Fred Carstensen, a professor of economics at the University of Connecticut and the director of its Center for Economic Analysis, ''but that's the penalty for being the richest state in the country.''
 The Legislature approves capital projects and the state Bond Commission allocates the bonds to pay for them. The governor is chairman of the commission and sets its agenda.
 About 85 percent of the state's total operating budget comes from the general fund. Its revenues include taxes and federal grants. The remainder is financed through borrowing. The state borrows money for projects by issuing bonds that are financed by investors. The bonds are of two varieties: general obligation, where debt is secured by the state's ability to tax, and revenue bonds, where principal and interest are paid by a designated revenue stream. Economists and investment analysts calculate debt per capita as a measure of the state's outstanding debt relative to its population. In Connecticut, where tax-supported debt is $12.7 billion, said Nicole Johnson, a senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, one of three agencies that rate Connecticut's bonds. Nationally, the debt per capita median is $703.
 The state's bonded debt has been in the billions since the 1980's, said Steven P. Kitowicz, the principal budget specialist for the state Office of Policy and Management. In 1994, the state's debt was $10.1 billion; 10 years later, it was $13.8 billion, he said.
 When it comes to borrowing, some legislative leaders expressed ''an end justifies the means'' philosophy. Martin M. Looney, a Democrat who has been Senate majority leader since 2003, said that the state's high bonded debt is justified because the bulk of the money is used for education. Each time a municipality builds or refurbishes a public school, the state pays for 20 to 80 percent of the cost. Magnet schools are almost completely funded by the state. In New Haven alone, the state contributed $800 million for a 10-year, $1.3 billion school construction project, said Mr. Looney, whose district includes New Haven.
 Mr. Looney, who was chairman of the legislature's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee for six years, also pointed to the $2 billion the state committed to building and renovation projects at the University of Connecticut as an example of a sound investment.
 ''When you look at how the profile of UConn has been elevated in recent years, how it is attracting the finest students, you realize that this was a worthy investment,'' he said.
 In addition to the $793,987,146 that remains for the UConn projects, Connecticut is also paying down debts that include $229 million in economic recovery notes (from 2002 and 2003, when the state bonded a portion of its deficit) and more than $8 billion for projects that include the convention center at Adriaen's Landing -- scheduled to open on Thursday -- new prisons, parks and local and state school construction.
 Robert L. Genuario, the governor's budget director, echoed Mr. Looney when he described projects like UConn and the state funding of technical schools as investments in the state's future. He also described some investments as not so wise, such as the $57 million Connecticut Juvenile Training School that opened in 2001. The state is still paying off $18 million that it borrowed to build a fuel cell plant that supplies power to the school, which has been disparaged by Gov. M. Jodi Rell as being more prisonlike than educational.
 After Connecticut, Massachusetts ranks second in per capita debt, with $3, 372 per resident. Hawaii is third with, $3,343, next are New Jersey with $2,901 and New York with $2,593, Ms. Johnson said.
 The highest rating a state assigned to a state is Triple A. Connecticut's current rating of ''Aa3 stable,'' represents a fourth place ranking. Two years ago, Connecticut's rating was downgraded from Aa2 to Aa3 because of fallout from the recession in the 1990's, Ms. Johnson said. In addition to depleting its $600 million Rainy Day Fund, the state issued deficit bonds of about $200 million in both 2002 and 2003 to cover budget deficits.
 ''The revenue from income tax had plummeted,'' she said. ''They were not able to rein in spending and they had to draw off reserves. We'd like to see a rebuilding of the Rainy Day Fund and we'd like to see the state get back to a structural balance, where the revenues coming in are enough to pay ongoing expenditures without resorting to one-time solutions.''
 Mr. Genuario said $302 million was deposited in the Rainy Day Fund three months ago and the governor proposed an additional $300 million for the end of fiscal year 2005 in June.
 Connecticut has the highest debt per capita, but it does not have the highest debt in the nation. According to Moody's, California is first, owing $55 billion. New York is second, with $50 billion. Connecticut is in seventh place.
 Robert M. Ward, a Republican who is House minority leader, said he is less concerned about where the state ranks in the debt it owes than what percentage of the state budget is absorbed by the debt.
 ''We need to rein in the amount we borrow each year,'' he said. ''When you retire some debt, you shouldn't borrow more. Paying 11 to 12 percent of the budget on principal and interest payments for the debt makes it harder to fund the operating expenses of the state.''

HEADLINE: Amid Dents, Diamonds?

BYLINE: By RON BROWNLOW

 BODY:
A VISITOR to the Queens Museum of Art at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park is almost certain to linger over its prized possession, an enormous scale model of New York. 
 A close look at the model's depiction of Willets Point, on the northeastern edge of the park, shows a space that is mostly empty in the immensely crowded borough. But this is no park. This is the Iron Triangle, a desolate, 13-block peninsula where a gritty collection of small businesses eke out a living with intermittent electricity, unpaved roads and long-broken sewer mains.
 David Oats, the former editor of The Queens Tribune, often visits the model, laser pointer in hand, with people to whom he is trying to sell his dream for Willets Point. 
 ''Here's my favorite part,'' Mr. Oats says as his pointer circles the green patch of parkland before settling on the triangle between the bowl-size model of Shea Stadium and the fanciful blue of Flushing Bay. ''You can see how it's one contiguous park. Shea Stadium's there. The marina's there. There's La Guardia. Then all of a sudden, a non-green area. It's as if you took Central Park and carved a huge corner out of it.'' 
 Mr. Oats has nothing against the business owners in Willets Point. What bothers him is that the land on which they operate was supposed to be part of Flushing Meadows, home of the Mets and the U.S. Open tennis tournament and the site of two world's fairs. But because of the machinations of the master builder Robert Moses and the oratorical skills of a young lawyer named Mario M. Cuomo, a strategically located part of Queens one-tenth the size of Central Park became a junkyard, a veritable wall of concrete, oil and scrap metal that prevents development along the Flushing waterfront.
 On a clear day, the stretch of car repair shops, scrap metal depots and waste treatment plants resembles nothing so much as a scene from ''The Road Warrior.'' The thoroughfares are blistered with holes like the surface of the moon, and the wind churns up clouds of dust that blow through 70 acres of scrap metal, mounds of contaminated earth and abandoned cars of every description.
 For nearly 40 years, successive waves of developers, dreamers and neighborhood activists have been drawn to Willets Point, eager to tame the frontier and make it their own, perhaps because the challenge it represents is so awesome.
 Now another wave of interest is on the horizon, a reflection of Mayor Bloomberg's plan to develop regional economic centers in the boroughs outside Manhattan as soaring real estate costs in Manhattan have led developers to look outside the city. The city has already spent millions on Downtown Brooklyn and Jamaica, Queens. Then, earlier this year, it took out advertisements in real estate magazines touting the potential of Willets Point and began courting potential developers for it. 
 Mr. Oats also sees an opportunity for Willets Point in the form of the city's 2012 Olympic bid, specifically the Olympic stadium that Mayor Bloomberg has been seeking to build on the West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Oats envisions an Olympic stadium that would transform Willets Point, though the clock is ticking on such a dream. While the stadium remains mired in the politics of the current mayoral race, an International Olympic Committee delegation is scheduled to make a nonbinding recommendation from among the five competing bids early next month, and the full committee will select the host city on July 6.
 Downtown Flushing is the city's fourth-largest retail hub, and in a city starved for waterfronts, the Flushing River might be expected to draw developers like a magnet. Instead, its vista of Willets Point repulses them. Though Willets Point business owners describe the Iron Triangle as a flourishing business district, developers and politicians say the area is an eyesore and a warren of illegal activity. 
 ''Are you going to go to the bankers and say, 'Mr. Banker, I want you to invest some money in a property that has a view of a pile of junk'?'' asks Wellington Chen, senior vice president at TDC Development, a company that owns land across the river. ''No one's going to invest a dime in this area unless there's hope that something better will be on the horizon.'' 

Messy, Necessary
 Since 1951, three generations of the Sambucci family have run an auto salvage business in Willets Point. Their office, a two-story prefab building on 36th Avenue with a view of Shea Stadium, is decorated with bumper stickers, pinup cartoons of 1960's models and an autographed photo of the first President Bush. 
 Customers, many on a first-name basis, walk in and announce the makes and models of their cars and the parts they need; Sammy Sambucci Jr., who possesses what customers describe as an encyclopedic knowledge of cars, searches for them in his computer. If he doesn't have a part, he sends the customer to a garage down the street.
 The Sambuccis also salvage usable parts from cars; a luxury-model engine, for example, can fetch more than $2,500. The rest goes to scrap-metal dealers. Danny Sambucci Jr., a cousin, says the shop makes $2 for every 100 pounds of scrap metal.
 ''Our business is a messy business, but it's a necessary evil,'' Danny Jr. says. ''There are cars all over the streets. You need people to get rid of them.''
 But less and less is this an easy place for the Sambuccis to conduct a business, even one like this. The roads have become so bad that a garbage truck once became stuck in a pothole. Now the only time the garbage truck comes is before the Mets' opening day; junkyard operators often get rid of garbage by throwing it into stripped cars. They pave their own sidewalks, and plow snow themselves, and their phones go dead when it rains. Although the Sambuccis pay nearly $80,000 a year in property taxes, the area lacks sanitary sewers -- try finding a bathroom -- and the storm sewers on Willets Point Boulevard have collapsed. 
 Among the bumper stickers that decorate the Sambuccis' counter, several indicate their view of government. ''If it ain't broke, fix it 'til it is -- the government's philosophy,'' one says. Another: ''Don't steal, that's the government's job.''
 ''Put it to you this way,'' Danny Jr. says. ''If this property were anyplace else -- I have an acre and a half -- what do you think an acre and a half is worth in Flushing? Millions. What about in Corona? Millions. So we're in between Flushing and Corona.'' But despite a decade of soaring real estate values in New York, the Sambuccis say, the appraised value of their land has remained stagnant, around $300,000.
 ''We are an asset to the city, and they don't know it,'' says Danny Sambucci Sr., who began the business. ''Anywhere else you could borrow probably millions. We wanted to borrow $500,000; we couldn't get it.''
 ''This land has a stigmatism,'' Danny Jr. says. Then he adds with a laugh: ''We're not against them developing property. Just not our property.''
 Besides, he adds, if the city gave Willets Point to someone who wanted to build a shopping mall, where would the current businesses go? ''This is M3-1 zoning, heavy industrial,'' Danny Jr. says. ''There's none left. Go on a map. Look. They say you're going to move me. I tell you what, tell me where you're going to move me. If I like the spot, I'll move right now.''

The Land of Fishhooks McCarthy
 The saga of New York's last frontier began in the early 20th century, when a Tammany Hall politician known as Fishhooks McCarthy gained control over 1,200 acres of swamps and meadowlands on the banks of the Flushing River, an area known as Flushing Meadows. McCarthy turned the land into a giant dump for his Brooklyn Ash Removal Company, which filled it with so much garbage that in one area the trash formed a 90-foot high mountain of ashes, nicknamed Mount Corona.
 F. Scott Fitzgerald immortalized the dump in ''The Great Gatsby,'' using it as the symbolic dividing line between the masses of New York and the grandees of Long Island. Fitzgerald called it ''a valley of ashes -- a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens.''
 Moses conquered the dump in stages. In 1935 he drove part of the Grand Central Parkway straight through Mount Corona. He then paved over the dump to build the grounds for the 1939 World's Fair, although not until the 1960's, with the arrival of a second World's Fair, was the park completed.
 But when Moses moved to incorporate Willets Point into his plan, the junkyard owners pooled their money and hired Mr. Cuomo to defend them in court. Mr. Cuomo argued eloquently on their behalf, and Moses was barred from using state money to buy the land.
 In 1991, the city's Public Development Corporation released a plan that called for rezoning parts of the triangle to lure new businesses and, implicitly, drive out the junkyards. A decade, two more planning studies, and an international brownfield remediation workshop later, the city government finally got involved and invited developers to submit plans for redeveloping 48 acres of Willets Point. (The rest of the peninsula, owned by the Long Island Rail Road and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is currently off the table.) 
 The timing may be opportune. This attempt at development has the support of a broad consensus of city officials and Flushing community leaders. And in a change from the past, Willets Point's businesses are not united in their efforts to fight it.
 The first stage of the process is a Request for Expressions of Interest, or an R.F.E.I., in which the city seeks ideas from developers before it asks a select few of them to submit more detailed proposals. In January, the city played host to an information session at Flushing Town Hall to explain the R.F.E.I. to developers. About 90 people from 53 organizations attended, among them Tiffany Lau, a land acquisition analyst from Pulte Homes, a developer with offices in Jersey City. Ms. Lau didn't know much about the point, but she was intrigued by ads the city had placed in a real estate journal promising developers a chance to build on what seemed like a prime piece of real estate, 48 acres in the heart of Queens. It sounded too good to be true.
 It was. Perhaps most important, the quality of the environment in Willets Point had deteriorated significantly over the past half-century because of its use as a waste transfer station and the frequent dumping of petroleum and other auto-related chemicals; a study the city released the following month showed potential contamination at nearly every site, mostly in spilled petroleum, paint and cleaning solvents.
 The solidity of the land under the junkyards was another issue. Beneath the layer of compacted trash and coal ash that was bulldozed for the first World's Fair sat a layer of swamp, which meant that anything constructed in Willets Point would have to sit on steel piles driven deep into the ground, to keep foundations from buckling as the ground shifted below. 
 Most distressing of all for the developers, officials of the city's Economic Development Corporation told them not to count on using the principle of eminent domain, which allows the government to acquire property if a public purpose is involved, to wrest the 48-acre parcel from its current owners and occupants.
 Although daunted by the area's obvious drawbacks, Ms. Lau was eager to get a closer look. So right after the presentation, she hopped on the No. 7 train and took it to the Willets Point/Shea Stadium stop. She saw no sign of the van that the city had promised to send to ferry potential developers to the site this day, but she did see David LeFevre of Beacon Properties, another interested developer, and together they headed along Roosevelt Avenue.
 Willets Point is a two-minute walk along Roosevelt Avenue, underneath the thundering tracks of the el. The main thoroughfare, Willets Point Boulevard, which originates at Roosevelt Avenue and 126th Street, was intended to be a grand avenue, like Broadway in Manhattan or the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, running continuously to Fort Totten, four miles northeast. 
 Today, the mouth of the boulevard is flanked by G&A tire shop on one side, and AA Auto Glass and the Naciones Unidas muffler and tire shop on the other. Farther along, on both sides of the street, are stacks of shiny wheel rims on metal shelves, followed by more rim shops, body shops and auto glass dealers, all operating out of metal shacks, many bearing signs painted in bright primary colors. The whir of pneumatic tools, the clang of metal parts and the shouts of workers drown out the techno blasting from a garage further up the road.
 The modern-day Willets Point Boulevard is many things -- a parking lot, an outdoor conference center, a place for fixing cars, a place where you can nap on a milk crate -- but it is no grand avenue. Motorists guide their vehicles gingerly across its gutted tarmac. 
 Dodging puddles and oil slicks in her dress shoes and long, cream-colored wool coat, Ms. Lau found it slow going. She managed to cover about 100 yards before she and Mr. LeFevre stopped and stared, dumbstruck, at the scene around them. It looked as if a chunk of a third-world city like Calcutta had been scooped up -- workers, dusty cars, chickens and all -- and then deposited thousands of miles away next to Shea Stadium. Intimidated, they decided to head back, though they said they would return, wearing boots and jeans, and, they hoped, riding in a car.
 ''I definitely felt worse about it than my initial impression,'' Ms. Lau wrote in an e-mail message recounting her brief visit. ''Seeing just how bad the roads were, and how haphazardly the various 'shops' had been set up, as well as the number of men just hanging around looking for business, I definitely didn't want to stay there, nor could I envision 'tree-lined streets' or 'pedestrian-scale residential and retail development' there. It is not a welcoming place, especially for a pedestrian. Or a woman, for that matter.'' 
 It was, she wrote, ''almost as if you were walking into gang-controlled territory.''

The Sputtering Pace of Progress
 Two months later, Ms. Lau had not returned to Willets Point. Although 10 or so developers represented at the January meeting had submitted proposals to the city, her company was growing wary of spending the several thousand dollars necessary to produce a master plan.
 On Thursday, Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the Economic Development Corporation, wrote in an e-mail message that her organization had ''received a number of very exciting and dynamic proposals'' from developers in response to the R.F.E.I., adding that ''the quantity and quality of these responses are good indications of the area's development potential.''
 Even once a developer is selected, a process the E.D.C. said will take several months, the tasks ahead will be formidable. Some developers have predicted that simply acquiring the land and cleaning up the site could take 10 years and cost more than $100 million. Studies in the 90's by the Queens borough president's office and what is now the E.D.C. estimated that repairing the streets and sewers could cost $26 million to $36 million.
 To many of those who have been following the decades-long debate over the future of Willets Point, all this talk represents a kind of kabuki theater. The Sambuccis seem resigned to the fact that the threat of condemnation will hover perpetually over their heads, depressing land values and denying them basic services. 
 ''To tell you the truth, it's not going to happen that quickly,'' Danny Sambucci Jr. says of the prospect of redevelopment. ''And, to tell you the truth, if it doesn't happen soon, I don't think it's going to happen at all.''

HEADLINE: An Indicator That's Almost as Good as a Time Machine

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
AN investor's fantasy might be to glimpse stock or bond market prices for a trading session yet to come, perhaps next month or in 2010.
 Sorry. That kind of prescience can't be arranged. But there's another forward-looking resource, albeit less certain, to aid in financial decision-making, one that has the virtue of being not only readily obtainable but free as well. 
 It is the market's up-to-the-minute forecasts on the future monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. 
 Even beginning investors know the Fed's importance, because the interest rates it influences affect the financial markets, the economy -- from housing to incomes to tourism -- and even national elections. Knowledge of the Fed's likely moves may help you to decide whether to use an adjustable-rate mortgage or a conventional one, whether to shift money into stocks or bonds, and even which kinds of stocks or bonds to buy. 
 The course of Fed policy is foreshadowed by various market indicators, the most revealing being the price of futures contracts on federal funds -- overnight loans among financial institutions whose rate the Fed itself closely controls.
 The futures contracts send clues about what is usually the most important single issue facing the markets: What will the Fed do next? And the specific question on everyone's mind these days is this: Is the Fed, which has been raising rates for nearly a year and has five more policy meetings scheduled for 2005, about finished? 
 The answer, judging from the consensus reflected in the futures contract for December, is: We're getting close.
 ''The funds market is telling us they're going to pause at at least two of these meetings,'' said John Augustine, chief investment strategist at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati.
 Mr. Augustine points to the current federal funds rate of 3 percent and notes that a quarter-point increase at each meeting -- the pattern that has lifted the rate in eight steps from 1 percent in mid-2004 -- would put it at 4.25 percent by year-end. The December contract, however, is now trading at 3.72 percent. He said he believes that the Fed is likely to stop its credit-tightening in meetings toward the end of the year.
 These contracts, settled on the basis of the average rate for federal funds during the month, are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. The August contract ended one recent session at 96.60, meaning that the market believed the funds rate for that month would be near the difference between that figure and 100, or 3.40 percent. 
 You can follow the action online at www.cbot.com by clicking on ''30-day fed funds.'' 
 Sometimes, analysts portray their readings of funds futures prices as odds or probabilities. For example, if you assume that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter point at both the June and August meetings, bringing the level to 3.50, then a reading of 3.72 would imply there was about an 80 percent chance of an increase at the next meeting, in September -- 3.72 being about 80 percent of the distance from 3.50 to 3.75. 
 Not surprisingly, the shorter the time period, the more accurate these forecasts have turned out to be.
 ''So far as predicting the funds rate over the next several months, the federal funds futures dominate other instruments,'' said Brian P. Sack, senior economist for Macroeconomic Advisers in Washington.
 Investors can use such readings of market expectations as a benchmark for evaluating the general investment climate as well as predicting movements in the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates.
 If, for example, you think the consensus is correct for modestly higher interest rates this autumn, and you have not already made an adjustment, you may want to cut back on your fixed-income investments. If you're in real estate, a conventional mortgage may seem a better bet than an adjustable one. If you are convinced that the Fed will stop raising interest rates by early fall, you may be more comfortable buying longer-term bonds.
 The stock market implications are tricky. Rising rates are generally not good for stocks, but if investors become confident that the Fed has inflation under control, they could start pouring money into stocks, setting off a rally. An optimist may want to buy metals or other industrial stocks, while a pessimist may want to consider food or tobacco or other so-called defensive stocks. 
 Of course, the futures contracts merely reflect current market sentiment, and if you're a contrarian who thinks that the Fed may have already made its last move, you may want to lock in today's rates and load up on bonds or certificates of deposit. 
 In any event, knowing the consensus is a good starting point.
 ''The federal funds rate serves as an anchor for the financial system and other interest rates key off its current level and expected changes in it,'' said a 2001 study by Raymond E. Owens and Roy H. Webb of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. ''Accurate predictions of changes in the federal funds rate are, therefore, of great value to persons engaged in a wide variety of business activities.''
 Although Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and other Fed officials tend to speak opaquely about monetary policy, the central bank since 1994 has increasingly managed to guide the markets along an intended path without surprises.
 Thus its formal statements after each of its eight meetings a year are scrutinized for the smallest nuance of intentions, currently whether the Fed sees itself continuing to nudge rates higher at a ''measured'' pace. The next meeting is June 29-30.
 THE funds market can also move sharply on unexpected news about the economy. For example, after the government announced on May 6 a surprisingly big increase in payroll jobs for April, the October funds futures contract jumped to 3.59 percent from 3.49 percent in just a half-hour.
 ''There had been hopes that the Fed might be able to take a breather'' in its persistent credit-tightening since mid-2004, said Ward McCarthy, managing director of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. ''The April employment data, I think, dashed a lot of such hopes.''
 But while the funds rate is the best predictor in the short run, Mr. Sack and other researchers have found that for periods longer than six months, other market instruments, including Treasury bills, display comparable predictive power.
 For this, Macroeconomic Advisers favors eurodollar futures, which trade very actively on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and pay out at quarterly maturities based on the three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
 Movements in Treasury bills can be misleading because yields can be depressed by a panic-driven flight to quality, analysts said. 
 For the past year, there have usually been just two realistic choices for the policy makers -- raising the funds rate by either one-quarter of a point or one-half a point. 
 Sometimes there is a third choice, and when the situation seems complex, analysts at times seek supplementary information from other markets, such as options on funds futures, a relatively new and underdeveloped contract with rich potential as a provider of information. These options are also traded on the Chicago Board of Trade.
 The main complication in deriving the expected policy path from the funds futures rates is adjusting for the premiums that investors require for bearing the risks of going long or short the contract.
 The size of this premium, which needs to be subtracted from the futures rate, can be big enough to lure speculators with no firm view on the direction of Fed policy. 
 (A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research last year found that the Fed itself makes only a minimal adjustment of just six-hundredths of a point for the premium on a six-month futures contract. That compares with an adjustment of 25 hundredths of a point that the bureau's researchers consider more accurate.)
 Even without refinements, knowing the likely course of policy is useful, with movements in funds futures especially revealing in reacting to fresh developments. 
 ''Investors' exposure is not so much to what the Fed does,'' Mr. Sack said, ''but to unexpected things the Fed does -- to changes in the market's expectations.''

HEADLINE: Mirror, Mirror, Who Is The Unfairest?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ROOTING out conflicts of interest on Wall Street has become a full-time job for securities regulators in recent years. Thankfully, some long-needed changes have been made to research and sales practices at brokerage firms, banks and mutual fund companies.
 But one conflict lives brazenly on, safe from even the most assiduous reform efforts. That enduring unfairness is related to, of all things, the fairness opinion. 
 Fairness opinions are produced by Wall Street banks and are intended to assure the directors of companies involved in a merger, acquisition or other deal that its terms are fair to shareholders.
 But the opinions can be problematic. That's because the bank affirming the fairness of the transaction is often the same one that proposed the deal -- and that stands to reap millions in fees if it goes through. When J.P. Morgan Chase paid $58 billion to acquire Bank One last July, the fairness opinion was supplied by -- who else? -- J.P. Morgan Chase. 
 However laughable they may be, fairness opinions continue to be used to justify transactions and to provide legal cover for directors fearful of being sued if a deal goes bad.
 At least some regulators are beginning to awaken to the conflicts that fairness opinions pose. The NASD has asked its members and the public for comments on the practices surrounding the opinions and may propose new rules related to their use.
 In Massachusetts, William F. Galvin, the secretary of the commonwealth, is investigating the fairness opinions supplied by Goldman Sachs and UBS, the two investment banks advising Gillette, which is the subject of a $57 billion offer from Procter & Gamble. Merrill Lynch provided the fairness opinion to Procter. 
 Mr. Galvin said he had subpoenaed documents relating to these fairness opinions out of concern that the deal might not be, well, fair to Gillette shareholders. ''For us here in Massachusetts, this is a very big deal because many of the shareholders are residents,'' he said. ''The fairness of the valuation is at issue. In the proxy statement, Goldman was credited with bringing the deal together. When one of the fairness opinion providers brought the deal together, how objective could their opinion be?''
 A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. UBS's spokesman said, ''We are confident in the advisory services provided to our client.''
 As a part of his investigation, Mr. Galvin asked Rajesh K. Aggarwal, a professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in corporate governance and executive pay, to analyze the fairness opinions.
 Professor Aggarwal wrote in his study that the opinions were reasonable and valid but that there were ''substantial discrepancies'' between the public and private statements the companies have made estimating the merger's value.
 For example, the companies' public projections on the revenue and cost ''synergies'' they expected to achieve as a result of the merger were about $14 billion to $16 billion. But internal company documents, Professor Aggarwal said, put the estimates at $22.1 billion to $28.1 billion.
 In addition, he said, there seemed to be errors in the way the merger's value synergies were calculated -- mistakes that underestimate the value of the deal. He concluded that by underestimating the value of the synergies, the deal would be more beneficial to Procter & Gamble shareholders than to Gillette's owners.
 Eric Kraus, a Gillette spokesman, said the company had no comment on Professor Aggarwal's analysis. ''Virtually no financial expert thinks the deal is anything but excellent for Gillette shareholders,'' Mr. Kraus said, adding that Gillette was cooperating with Mr. Galvin's inquiry.
 Procter & Gamble said it believed that the opinion provided by Merrill Lynch was fair.
 Shareholders of both companies will have the last word. They are scheduled to vote on the merger in June. 
 Speaking generally, Professor Aggarwal said: ''There's a sense that whatever the two parties agree to must be fair. But management has no interest whatsoever in having independent third parties looking at the details of any transactions, and boards historically weren't going to question the judgment of management. So the issue here is the one party that doesn't participate in the negotiations -- the shareholders.''
 But shining the spotlight on fairness opinions, as Mr. Galvin has done, is indeed a public service. 
 And surely, in a time when corporate directors are being held increasingly accountable for their actions, they ought to be concerned about the conflicts that make many fairness opinions so dubious.
 ''I think we're going to see more boards hiring independent parties to evaluate transactions, to evaluate the performance of management and to evaluate compensation contracts,'' Professor Aggarwal said. ''I think that if one of the high-profile deals that are in process now were to blow up because it looked like the board didn't do enough investigation on behalf of shareholders, you would absolutely see a lot more use of third parties to make sure the deal is good for shareholders.''
 When it comes to hiring firms that can conduct truly independent reviews of deals, directors have had few choices.
 But a new firm, set up by two experienced Wall Street bankers, hopes to change that.
 The firm, Pirie, Goldsmith & Associates of New York, offers independent fairness opinions on mergers and acquisitions, as well as on asset sales, executive compensation and other issues, said Robert S. Pirie, a former partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and, from 1987 to 1992, the chairman of Rothschild Inc., an investment firm. ''To be able to look the lawyers in the eye and say, 'We hired someone who had nothing to do with the deal, who looked at it and said in their opinion it's fair,' if I were a director I'd be very happy to have that,'' Mr. Pirie said.
 Gerald Goldsmith, a former top executive at Rothschild, is the firm's other founder; its advisory board members are Paul W. MacAvoy, professor of economics at Yale, and Peter Scanlon, former chairman of Coopers & Lybrand.
 While the established Wall Street firms may snicker at the creation of such a firm, Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, applauded the idea of an organization devoted to the issuance of unbiased fairness opinions. ''If there was ever going to be a market for this kind of thing it will be now,'' he said. ''It strikes me that it would be very valuable. A lot of mergers are promoted for the benefit of those involved.''
 And all too often, shareholders are the last on that list.

HEADLINE: The Antidote to Sticker Shock

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
''WHEN we first started looking for a house in Westchester, we were in sticker shock,'' said Stephanie Seymour, who moved to the village of Ossining from Dallas last summer with her husband, Bill, and two young sons. ''Every time we came to the county to look for a place, we had to raise the amount we were willing to spend by $100,000.'' 
 So discouraged were they by the cost of real estate in Westchester County that Mr. Seymour, a senior director for a telecommunications firm, was about to refuse his company's offer to relocate to White Plains. 
 But then they discovered pockets of relatively affordable real estate in the village of Ossining, 40 miles north of New York City, and agreed to forge ahead. They eventually bought a five-bedroom Tudor for about $600,000, twice what their three-bedroom ranch house in Texas sold for. 
 Looking back, they said, they are pleased with their decision. Almost a year later, the couple and their sons, Alexander, 3, and Max, 21 months, have settled into their charming 77-year-old home and have made friends in their new neighborhood. 
 Located on the eastern shore of the Hudson River, the three-square-mile village is home to some 24,000 residents, with the population reflecting a diverse ethnic mix, according to the 2000 census. About 28 percent of Ossining's residents are Hispanic, a fact mirrored in the robust mix of businesses along Main Street. 
 There, along a retail strip that wends its way down a steep incline to the river, colorfully painted establishments like Mitad del Mundo and Quimbaya Colombian Coffee House are thriving beside the longstanding places on the street. 
 And harking back to the village's 19th-century roots, old bank buildings and churches that are on the National Register of Historic Places provide yet another counterpoint in the quaint downtown.

What You'll Find
 Some of Ossining's housing stock, on both sides of Route 9, which runs along a north-south axis in Westchester, dates back to the early 1800's, with Victorians next to Cape Cods and ranches. And the charm found along Main Street extends throughout many of the village's tree-lined residential neighborhoods. 
 Not all of them, though. An imposing watch tower at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility casts a dark shadow along the shoreline, where lower-priced and some run-down residences are located.
 But Marcene Hedayati, a branch manager for Prudential Rand Realty in Briarcliff Manor, a nearby high-end Westchester village, said, ''Ossining's prison isn't as much of a negative as some might think, although its existence is a bit of hindrance.''
 Ms. Hedayati observed that Ossining's main draw is its small-town feeling. ''A lot of people buying houses in Ossining want a main street they can walk along, where they can say hello to their neighbors and feel like they are part of a real community,'' she said. 
 Still, Sing Sing is not going away, and the future of the waterfront has long been a subject of public debate. One company, Cappelli Enterprises of Valhalla, N.Y., has been seeking village approval for several years to build a $45 million complex on 4.6 acres with luxury residences and commercial space along the river. 
 The proposal has been met with intense opposition from residents and environmental groups that claim the plan would concentrate too much housing in a relatively small area.
 The village's mayor, Eugene Napolitano, described the Cappelli project as ''a work in progress,'' but he could not predict when it might move forward.

What You'll Pay
 The median sale price of a single-family home in the village of Ossining is $412,000, 33 percent less than the median for the county, which is $615,000, said Janet Brand, a real estate agent with the Houlihan Lawrence office in Briarcliff Manor. In 2000, the median sale price of a single-family home in the village was $232,500, she said.
 Recently, a two-bedroom 1924 ranch that was listed at $274,999 sold for $295,000 after multiple bids; a four-bedroom 1927 colonial, listed at $499,000, sold for $490,000 in less than two weeks; and a six-bedroom Tudor listed at $869,000 sold for $836,500 after two months, according to listing data. 
 Matthew and Cinthia Gullotta recently found a bargain: a 42-year-old fixer-upper with three bedrooms for $357,000. Because the Gullottas -- he is a salesman, she a fuel buyer for the New York Power Authority -- were willing to oversee the renovations and wait to move in, they were able to buy in a neighborhood near the high school, where most homes sell for far more. 
 In addition to its single-family homes, the village also has a large stock of apartments, co-ops and condominiums. The village assessor's office lists 1,078 apartments, 905 condo units and 763 co-ops. The median sales price of a two-bedroom co-op is $125,000, up from $58,000 five years ago, said Ms. Brand of Houlihan Lawrence. The median price of a two-bedroom condo is $369,000, up from $211,250 five years ago. 
 Ms. Brand said the average price of a one-bedroom apartment -- many in private homes -- is $1,300 a month; two-bedroom apartments go for $1,550. ''But lots of times, we never see them come on the market,'' she said. ''The owners rent them out themselves.''

What to Do
 Families like the Gullottas and the Seymours said they appreciated the many local activities available to residents. ''There are a ton of events, like carnivals at local churches, bake sales, the Fourth of July fireworks, even oldies music at the river,'' Mr. Gullotta said. 
 The village also has a youth soccer league run by volunteers, along with summer camps and other sports programs and clinics. Earlier this spring, village firefighters, police officers, high school students, members of the village's board of trustees and other groups held an outdoor concert and car wash at the waterfront to benefit families displaced by a fire at a local condo complex. 
 Also, Mr. Gullotta and his wife often visit local parks and Teatown Lake Reservation in Ossining with their two children, Amilia, 4 1/2, and Matthew, 21 months. The privately owned, nonprofit Teatown encompasses 784 acres, including a 33-acre lake, streams, a gorge, hardwood swamps, forests and meadows, along with 14 miles of hiking trails.

The Schools
 The Ossining Union Free School District has 4,420 students in prekindergarten to Grade 12. Joshua Mandel, principal at Ossining High School, reported that 30 percent of the students are Latino, 20 percent are African-American, and the rest fall under the category of Caucasian.
 ''We're very proud of our diversity,'' Mr. Mandel said. ''It gives our hallways a real-world feel. SAT scores are often tied to social and economic status, but education is really about a lot of different things.''
 When it comes to some standardized measures of achievement, Ossining's performance in some categories falls below neighboring communities like Briarcliff Manor and Pleasantville. For example, 82 percent of Ossining High School students passed the state Regents exam for English Language Arts last year, compared with 100 percent in Briarcliff Manor and 97 percent in Pleasantville.
 SAT scores last year for the senior class in Ossining were slightly above the state average. They were 513 for verbal, 531 for math, Mr. Mandel said, compared with state averages of 496 and 510, respectively.

The Commute
 The trip by Metro-North Railroad to Grand Central Terminal from Ossining during peak hours is about 50 minutes. Monthly tickets cost $208.74; round-trip, peak tickets are $18.52. The village is also less than 30 minutes by car to businesses and shopping in White Plains.

The History
 Before the 17th century, the area that is now the village belonged to a group within the Mohegan Tribe called the ''Sint Sinck,'' which translated to English means ''stone upon stone'' and refers to extensive beds of local limestone. The area became part of the Manor of Philipsburg, which extended from Spuyten Duyvil Creek north to the Croton River, but at the end of the Revolution, local plots were sold to farmers who had leased them. 
 Sing Sing became the first incorporated village in Westchester to be chartered by the state in 1813. Twelve years later, construction of Sing Sing Prison began, but over time, villagers tried to distance themselves from it and changed the name in 1901 to Ossining.

What We Like
 Ossining is one of the few Westchester communities where residents from all walks of life can feel at home, not pushed aside on the roads by those driving large and expensive vehicles, or priced out by rows of elite boutiques that crowd out more affordable shops.

What We'd Change
 It would be a shame if Ossining could not devise a plan to improve its waterfront that would be agreeable to all parties involved.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn's Technicolor Dream Quilt

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The new face of New York City is taking shape among the graceful Victorian houses and stout apartment buildings of Ditmas Park, Brooklyn.
 This softly shaded patch of Flatbush is one of the city's most polyglot and polychrome, what city demographers like to call a melting-pot neighborhood, because no one ethnic or racial group is dominant and many are represented. Moreover, the neighborhood's population of 8,243 is not cut up into distinct ethnic swatches like Williamsburg in Brooklyn -- where Hasidim, Italians, Poles, Latinos and white bohemians live in distinct pockets -- but is significantly intermingled. Residents proudly reel off a multitude of races and nationalities that flank their porches and backyards, and interviews with two dozen residents indicate that the ethnic mix is not merely cosmetic, it is thorough and strong.
 The outlook for such neighborhoods, according to a new analysis by the Department of City Planning, is bullish. Data from the 2000 census indicates there were 220 melting-pot census tracts among the city's 2,217; in 1970 there were 70. In 2000, they were found in neighborhoods like Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Flushing in Queens. The ranks are growing as a result of immigration and the apparent comfort level long-rooted New Yorkers feel in cosmopolitan milieus. 
 ''People are living side by side in a way that 100 years from now we may take for granted,'' said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the City Planning Department's population division in a speech last month at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. New Yorkers, he added, are more ready to say, ''I'm going to live next to the guy even though he's five shades different than me.''
 In part, this is the result of a wave of newcomers from two dozen countries since 1965, when a revised immigration law began to shape the city into one in which immigrants or their American-born offspring account for 55 percent of the populace. The decline of crime, the city's liberal tradition, and the sheer habit of encountering different cultures on a daily basis has made New Yorkers more open. 
 ''Anybody who rides the subway is going to have a multicultural experience,'' said John H. Mollenkopf of the City University of New York. ''One senses that people who can't handle that sort of thing moved out of New York.''
 The analysis by the Planning Department showed that New York stands atop the world in its ethnic variety. Los Angeles has more people born abroad -- 40.9 percent compared with 35.9 for New York -- but most are from Mexico. A handful of world cities rival New York in its proportion of the foreign-born -- Toronto's is 49.4 percent; Sydney, 33.4 percent; London, 27.4 percent -- but the ethnic stew is not as varied, said Mr. Salvo. 
 It is true that for residents who use words like utopia and United Nations in describing Ditmas Park, friendships seldom extend across class lines. ''I notice that the people who live in the apartments and rent and are of a lower income tend to keep to themselves and the homeowners who live in the albeit diverse community of homeowners also tend to be exclusive,'' said Claire Beckman, an actress who has lived in the neighborhood for four years.
 Then too the neighborhood is fairly self-selected, drawing people like Graham and Chelsi Meyerson, restaurant owners, and their 20-month-old daughter, Olivia, who are willing to tackle the discomforts that might arise out of cultural differences. 
 ''When Chelsi and I had Olivia,'' Mr. Meyerson said, ''we wanted her to know a lot of different people.''
 Still the two census tracts that make up Ditmas Park are remarkable for their ethnic palette. The racial breakdown was 40 percent black (almost half from the Caribbean), 23 percent white, 17 percent Hispanic and 16 percent Asian. There are Jews who were born in Russia and others who just moved over from Park Slope, third- and fourth-generation Irish and Italians, and significant smatterings of Bangladeshis, Mexicans, Pakistanis, Chinese, Tibetans and more. 
 In a neighborhood where in 2000 the median household income was $37, 670 -- slightly lower than that of the city as a whole -- there are houses owned by lawyers and executives, yet a fourth of the residents live below the poverty line. 
 ''The reason why this works is there's no majority of one -- there's a majority of many,'' said Susan Miller, a mother of four who lives on a block of Victorian houses with people of Indian, Pakistani, Polish, Italian, Jamaican, and Orthodox Jewish backgrounds and a group she describes as ''Caucasian left-wingers.'' 
 Others speculate that Ditmas Park is so varied because it is wedged among more monotone enclaves: Caribbean East Flatbush, the neighborhoods of professionals surrounding Prospect Park, Chinese and Latino Sunset Park, and Orthodox Jewish Midwood and Borough Park.
 ''This area belongs to no one, so you have a lot of everyone,'' said Fred Siegel, an urban affairs professor at Cooper Union and a longtime resident. 
 The ethnic variety is evident on a stroll down Cortelyou Road, the main shopping area, where within seconds a recent visitor passed a black man with cornrows, a Muslim woman with a head scarf, a white mother in Birkenstocks, and a man wearing a skullcap. Vladimir Popov, 67, the clerk at a local video store, can wax effusive on the varying ethnic tastes in film. Cinco de Mayo is a restaurant that has lots of actual Mexican construction workers, not just food enthusiasts. Karali Pitzele, a teacher, is 33 and white. But she considers herself a mix, albeit of religious background: Jewish, Christian and Buddhist. She tells of borrowing spices from her Pakistani neighbor after the neighbor borrowed her table for an evening's dinner. 
 Ms. Pitzele chose the neighborhood eight years ago in part because her boyfriend then was Jamaican and they felt that as an interracial couple they would not stand out. They didn't. In fact many residents remark on the large number of interracial couples in the neighborhood.
 Joe Wong, a 28-year-old grandson of Chinese immigrants, who is married to Ellen, a white native of Virginia, grew up in Ditmas Park and went to Public School 139, which he described as a ''mini-United Nations.'' 
 ''As you're growing up you're getting exposed to the diversity and this becomes second nature,'' he said. 
 Cross-cultural friendships are run-of-the-mill. One of Ms. Pitzele's closest friends is Dawn Eddy, a 25-year-old teacher born in Trinidad, who herself tells of her Japanese and Italian friends. 
 Mavis Theodore, a publishing administrator who is also from Trinidad, said she had been friends with Hynda Lessman Schneiweiss, a retired Jewish engineering assistant, for 10 years. They have both lived in the neighborhood for a quarter-century, and they recall when it was largely filled with Jews, Italians and blacks. 
 ''This neighborhood is going to demonstrate what Rodney King said, 'Can't we get along?''' said Mrs. Schneiweiss. 
 Daniel Shaw, a senior at Cornell University, went to the neighborhood's schools and nearby Midwood High School and has been friends since kindergarten with Panamanian and Moroccan boys and a Chinese girl. They have all visited him at Cornell. While he told of some unpleasant consequences of the economic diversity in the neighborhood -- he has been robbed at knifepoint and his father was beaten by young men trying to steal his briefcase -- Mr. Shaw said he was glad he had been raised there.
 ''I've been thankful even for the muggings,'' he said. ''It keeps me in check because as much as I grew up in a comfortable house, I know I'm lucky. I can't get too cocky. There are people out there who struggle.''
 But some, like Paul Feldman, a Web site editor, contend that the neighborhood is so fragmented that ''its diversity works against a strong sense of community.'' 
 ''A mix is happening but there's no personality that is asserting itself,'' he said.
 Ditmas Park did not just fall out of an idealist's dreamscape; neighbors work hard at sustaining the mix. Around Christmas, the neighborhood holds progressive dinners, where courses are served at a succession of homes encompassing a range of ethnicities. On Thanksgiving, a black minister holds an open house flapjacks-and-bacon breakfast. Dan Shapiro, a data consultant who has lived in a 15-room Victorian for 25 years, said everyone is invited for funerals and bar mitzvahs and ''everyone shows up.'' 
 Ms. Beckman, who directs Brave New World Repertory Theater, is putting on a production of ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' on Sept. 18, using her porch and five of her neighbors' porches as the stage. A four-year-old organization, Friends of Cortelyou, sponsors ethnic tastings and pairs recent immigrants with fluent English speakers as ''conversation partners.''
 At his year-old restaurant, Picket Fence, Mr. Meyerson intentionally hires a diverse staff, like Justin Alexander, a waiter from Trinidad, and Dana Nagler, a Jewish cook. Vox Pop, a combination coffee house, book store and print shop, holds open-mike evenings, when rap performers, poets and activists of a variety of ethnic backgrounds express their views.
 There are some who worry that a diverse Ditmas Park may be fleeting. The 1970 census showed a neighborhood that was 95 percent white; Rugby Road was known as Doctors' Row for the professionals who lived in its handsome Victorians.
 Ditmas Park started changing dramatically in the late 1960's, said Mr. Shapiro and others, partly because the city, struggling with a mushrooming welfare population, dispatched troubled families to Ditmas Park's empty apartments. Some middle-class whites fled in response, allowing middle-class blacks to buy Victorians at fire-sale prices, effectively integrating the neighborhood. 
 The upsurge of crime throughout the city in the 1970's and 1980's and a shaky economy meant more departures for the suburbs, but groups like the Flatbush Development Corporation managed and repaired hard-pressed buildings and evicted difficult tenants. Stability soon led to an upswing as the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani demanded and got stronger police enforcement, said Mr. Siegel, who was a policy adviser for Mr. Giuliani's 1993 election campaign.
 Now, with prices of some homes surpassing $1 million, people like Ms. Beckman fear that only affluent buyers will consider the neighborhood and that Ditmas Park's multicultural character could dissolve.
 ''What's scary,'' she said, ''is that it could change.''

HEADLINE: U.S. SET TO TEST MISSILE DEFENSES ABOARD AIRLINES

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
In an airplane hangar north of Fort Worth, technicians are preparing to mount a fire-hydrant-shaped device onto the belly of an American Airlines Boeing 767. It is an effort that could soon turn into a more than $10 billion project to install a high-tech missile defense system on the nation's commercial planes. 
 The Boeing 767 -- the same type of plane that terrorists flew into the World Trade Center -- is one of three planes that, by the end of this year, will be used to test the infrared laser-based systems designed to find and disable shoulder-fired missiles. The missiles have long been popular among terrorists and rebel groups in war zones around the world; the concern now is that they could become a domestic threat. 
 The tests are being financed by the Department of Homeland Security, which has been directed by Congress to move rapidly to take technology designed for military aircraft and adapt it so it can protect the nation's 6,800 commercial jets. It has so far invested $120 million in the testing effort, which is expected to last through next year. 
 Yet even before the tests begin, some members of Congress, and several prominent aviation and terrorism experts, are questioning whether the rush to deploy this expensive new antiterrorism system makes sense.
 Homeland Security officials have repeatedly cautioned that no credible evidence exists of a planned missile attack in the United States. But there is near unanimity among national security experts and lawmakers that because of the relatively low price and small size of the missiles, as well as the large number available on the black market, they represent a legitimate domestic threat. 
 The concern is not just for the lives that would be lost in the shoot-down of a single plane, proponents say. It is for the enormous economic consequences that would result if the public were to lose confidence in flying. 
 ''We are long overdue for a passenger aircraft to be taken down by a shoulder-launched missile,'' said Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, who is pushing for the systems to be installed. ''We have been extremely, extremely lucky.''
 But a significant contingent of domestic security experts say the administration's focus on these missiles may be misdirected. They cite the broad range of ways that terrorists might strike next and point to studies showing that shoulder-fired missiles -- the most popular of which are American-made Stingers and Soviet-made SA-7's -- present less of a threat at airports than do truck bombs or luggage bombs.
 ''People have probably assumed that these kinds of weapons would work with much greater certainty,'' said K. Jack Riley, the director of the public safety and justice program at the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit research organization that has studied threats from shoulder-mounted missiles. ''This is not as big a threat as people might think.''
 Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems are competing to build the devices, which rely on plane-mounted sensors that detect heat-seeking missiles and then automatically fire infrared lasers to jam or confuse the missiles' guidance systems. The defense would be used for about a 50-mile area around airports, while planes land or take off.
 The American Airlines Boeing 767 and two jets owned by Northwest Airlines and FedEx will be tested to determine whether they remain as airworthy with the new technology aboard and to figure out if, in simulated attacks, the defense system is reliable. For now, no passengers will be aboard.
 Shoulder-fired missiles were introduced by the Americans and the Soviets in the 1960's to protect ground forces. A recent Congressional study found that more than 350,000 existed in government arsenals worldwide. But they also are a favorite of rebel groups and terrorists. At about six feet long and 50 pounds, they are easy to transport, and older models can cost only a few hundred dollars.
 Calls for putting the defense systems on commercial planes took on new urgency in 2002. That year, two missiles were fired at a Boeing 757 in Kenya that had been chartered by an Israeli airline. Both missed. 
 And in November 2004, an Airbus A300 cargo plane flown by DHL was struck by a missile on takeoff from the Baghdad airport. The plane lost hydraulic power but was able to land.
 ''This is one of the greatest dangers we face in the air,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who has helped lead the push in the Senate for the deployment of missile defense systems. 
 Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems have briefed members of Congress, urging them to invest in the systems, and Northrop has commissioned a poll in an effort to demonstrate public support for the program. One Northrop briefing featured photographs of men in long, loose robes taking a missile launcher out of a car and firing a round into the air. 
 As the tests proceed, Homeland Security officials are looking for ways to lower the price tag. It has been estimated that it could cost $10 billion to install the systems on all commercial jets and as much as $40 billion over the next two decades, once maintenance and operational costs are added in. By comparison, the entire budget proposed for aviation security in the United States is $4.7 billion for the coming fiscal year.
 Homeland Security has asked BAE and Northrop Grumman to design systems that would cost no more than $1 million per plane, rather than the roughly $1.6 million some industry experts had expected. And the devices must work without need of repair for 3,000 hours, instead of the 300 hours required for military jets, according to specifications set by Homeland Security. 
 But even if the contractors can lower the costs, airline industry representatives and some terrorism experts say the price is hard to defend. 
 The Air Line Pilots Association, Boeing and the Air Transport Association of America are urging that more emphasis be placed on alternative defenses, like controlling areas around airports, limiting the international supply of missiles and making less expensive changes that would allow an airplane to fly even if its hydraulic system was lost. 
 ''The cost versus the benefit here does not play out,'' said Jim Proulx, a spokesman for Boeing. The presumption is that the government would pay to install the systems on existing planes, but the airlines would assume the ongoing maintenance and fuel costs, which could exceed $1 million a year per plane. 
 In a recent study by Rand, which examined security threats at Los Angeles International Airport, a shoulder-mounted missile was characterized as a ''lesser threat'' in terms of potential deaths than a truck bomb or a luggage bomb. In fact, the study suggested that the threat posed by a shoulder-fired missile was not much greater than that of a sniper who might fire a .50-caliber rifle at a plane from outside the airport.
 A separate study, financed by Homeland Security in 2004, said that the infrared systems would be useless or only marginally effective against several types of shoulder-mounted missiles.
 Part of the reason for the relatively low ranking of missiles among threats is that large passenger airliners are designed to fly after the loss of an engine, even if that engine explodes, industry experts said.
 Even before the current tests are complete, the Bush administration and Congress are moving to set aside $110 million for the next phase. Mr. Schumer and Mr. Mica also want to require that the devices be installed immediately on certain new commercial jets.
 And others, including Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, and Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, want Congress to set aside $10 billion to install the systems on existing planes, perhaps first on the 1,000 aircraft that make up the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, which transports troops in times of war. The cost could be great, they said, but most likely smaller than the damage to the economy that would result from a single shoot-down. 
 ''We have been warned over and over again by the people who know,'' Ms. Boxer said, referring to classified briefings by the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. ''It is a race against time.''
 Yet Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican who is chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said the missile defense program was being driven too much by politics and lobbyists. 
 ''This is not the result of considered analysis of potential threats, terrorist capabilities or intentions,'' Mr. Cox said. ''It should be.''

A front-page article on May 29 about plans by the Department of Homeland Security to test a defense system aboard airliners to locate and disable shoulder-fired missiles misstated the year that an Airbus A300 cargo plane was struck by a missile on takeoff from Baghdad. It was 2003, not 2004.

HEADLINE: Treading In the Shadow Of Bill Moyers

BYLINE: By TERRY GOLWAY

 BODY:
DAVID BRANCACCIO has inherited Bill Moyers's office, his job and his PBS program on Friday evening. It remains to be seen if he also will inherit Mr. Moyers's enemies.
 Mr. Brancaccio, a 45-year-old Maplewood resident, succeeded Mr. Moyers -- icon of the left and lightning rod of the right -- six months ago as the anchor of the public affairs program ''Now.'' 
 The transition was proceeding smoothly enough until several weeks ago, when it came to light that the chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting had ordered an analysis of the program's content after conservative critics charged that it was hostile to the White House. The chairman, Kenneth Y. Tomlinson, was appointed to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting by President Bush. 
 Suddenly, Mr. Brancaccio and his colleagues on ''Now'' were not just reporting news. They were in the news, an uncomfortable position for most professional journalists.
 For his part, Mr. Brancaccio -- who started his journalism career at age 15 as a reporter for a small radio station in Maine -- said he welcomes the scrutiny, if not the attention.
 ''I feel it is only fair that people with connections, apparently, to the White House would watch our show very carefully, because after all, we don't shrink from scrutinizing them,'' he said. ''Turnabout is fair play. The biggest fear we have is not that the White House may object to something we say. The biggest fear is getting something wrong, and there are many people who would love for us to get stuff wrong.''
 Mr. Brancaccio has been associated with the program since the fall of 2003, when it was known as ''Now with Bill Moyers.'' With Mr. Moyers's retirement in December, the show's name was changed to reflect its founder's departure, and Mr. Brancaccio was promoted from co-anchor to sole anchor. 
 But those were not the only changes. Because of financing issues, the show was cut from an hour to 30 minutes, and once a month the show features all interviews, which are less expensive to produce than heavily reported pieces from the field.
 "I'm agnostic on the change from an hour to half an hour, but one beautiful thing has happened as a result," Mr. Brancaccio said. "Even now, six months into the change, we are getting cascades of e-mails complaining about the shorter show. But that means that nobody is complaining about me -- we're not getting those letters that say, 'You're no Bill Moyers.'''
 When and if that charge is made, Mr. Brancaccio is fully prepared to concede its truth.
 ''Bill was a lightning rod because his life experience allowed him to put things together in a way that my life experience, which is shorter and different, doesn't,'' he said. ''I was not the deputy director of the Peace Corps. I did not work for Lyndon Johnson. Oh, and here's something else: I am not a Baptist minister. I'm the product of two parents from Brooklyn, one who was Jewish and grew up in Coney Island, and the other an Italian from Gravesend. And no matter how you add those up, you don't get Baptist.''
 But in acknowledging that he is no Bill Moyers, Mr. Brancaccio is quick to note that he is hardly seeking to distance himself from his former boss, mentor and friend. ''We still see each other,'' Mr. Brancaccio said, adding that Mr. Moyers still has an office down the hall on the sixth floor of Channel 13 headquarters on the far West Side of Manhattan.

How Moyers Chose Brancaccio
 Mr. Brancaccio came to the attention of Mr. Moyers and his wife and producer, Judith Moyers, through National Public Radio. Both were fans of Mr. Brancaccio's reports on the program ''Marketplace,'' which covers finance, business and globalization. ''We listened regularly in the kitchen and before we knew it, Brancaccio seemed to be there at the table with us,'' Mr. Moyers said. ''He made the news important without trying to sell us on his own importance. He was not a news announcer, but a storyteller.''
 Indeed, Mr. Brancaccio put his personal stamp on ''Marketplace'' in much the same way that Mr. Moyers did with ''Now.'' He broke in as the show's London correspondent in the early 1990's, covering economics and trade as the market-driven European Union came into existence. In 1994, Mr. Brancaccio moved to California and became the program's host and senior editor as its audience grew to more than 3 million, and its reach extended to nearly 300 stations. 
 ''Marketplace'' was not the usual business show, avoiding rote recapitulations of the market's ups and downs and sound bites from the practitioners of the two-handed science known as economics. 
 ''It was not all that different from what I do now,'' Mr. Brancaccio said. ''We covered issues from a human perspective, a populist version of business coverage. We were almost like anthropologists, on the outside looking into this alien culture that is business. We did it that way because while a third of our audience was made up of business professionals, two-thirds were not. So we had to make the show work for them.''
 Ken Kurson, a resident of Cedar Grove and business writer for Esquire magazine in the 1990's, said the appeal of ''Marketplace'' was that Mr. Brancaccio and his contributors ''seemed to love business.''
 ''They didn't cover business because it was a duty,'' said Mr. Kurson, who has become friendly with Mr. Brancaccio. ''They covered it because it was interesting and exciting, and seemed to have the correct sense that business can be a force for good.''
 The show certainly worked for Bill and Judith Moyers. ''When I started talking about finding a co-host to help me out on 'Now' and also be a potential successor when I retired,'' Mr. Moyers said, ''it was Judith who said, 'What about Brancaccio?' Ping!''
 ''We wanted to find a younger person for the show,'' he said. ''There weren't many younger people hosting shows in public broadcasting, and at the time the three network anchors were all veterans.''
 Mr. Brancaccio fit the bill.
 He had already broken into television, somewhat tentatively, with a public affairs program about California, a job he juggled along with his duties on ''Marketplace.'' Bill and Judith Moyers asked for tapes of the show. 
 ''Despite a set that swallowed the anchor and the guests, there was something there,'' Mr. Moyers said. ''And you have to keep this point in mind: One either has 'it' with the camera or one doesn't, and by 'it' I mean that chemistry which dissolves the distance between you and the viewers. I could see David had 'it.'''
 The Moyerses offered Mr. Brancaccio the post of co-anchor and heir apparent in the summer of 2003. But Mr. Brancaccio had more than just ''it.'' He also had a wife, Mary, a high school English teacher, and three school-age children. Accepting the job as Mr. Moyers's co-host would mean uprooting his family from California. What's more, Mr. Moyers told Mr. Brancaccio that ''Now'' was financed only through the end of 2004, and that the job could be very short-lived.
 ''People said, 'How could you think about leaving a show like Marketplace? You're identified with it, and it's a popular show hitting on all cylinders,''' Mr. Brancaccio said. ''That was absolutely true. But then I thought, 'Brancaccio, what would you pay to do a postdoctoral fellowship with Bill Moyers?' I'd say that I'd pay tens of thousands of dollars for that opportunity. But the offer on the table was that they would pay me.''

Needed to Live Near Trees
 But Mr. Brancaccio had to make a promise to his children: wherever they ended up in the New York area, they would live near trees. He and his wife found a house in the leafy town of Maplewood, which was recommended by a friend. Promise fulfilled.
 The adjustment to the East Coast in general -- and New Jersey in particular -- has not always been easy. Though he has Brooklyn roots, Mr. Brancaccio was reared in Maine, attended Wesleyan University in Connecticut (where he majored in history and African studies), and has lived in Ghana, Madagascar, London and Los Angeles.
 New Jersey is something new.
 ''It took me a while to come to grips with allowing other people to pump my gas,'' he said. ''And it took a while before I realized that all those restaurants that don't have liquor licenses are happy to have you bring your own wine.''
 He also had to adjust to the language change. ''I went into an Italian specialty store and asked if they had a particular kind of cheese, a white, firm ricotta,'' he said. ''And the answer was, 'Yeah, what do you think?' What I have come to realize is that this is Jersey-speak for, "Why, yes, I have the item that you are inquiring about and I am here to meet your customer service needs.'''
 Serving as anchor of a serious-minded, nationally broadcast television show has required adjustments of another sort. He noted that ''Now'' attracts staff rooted in the tradition of documentary filmmaking, while he is rooted in the faster pace of radio news. ''We have a great staff, but they don't always know what to make of this obstreperous radio guy,'' he said. ''There's also an earnestness that this show carries with it, and earnestness is not something that I do well. So we're learning from each other.''
 If earnestness is not his strong suit, explanation is, according to John Siceloff, the program's executive producer. 
 ''We live in an age of information overload, but David has the ability to cut through all of that and explain what's important,'' he said. ''And he does it with a twinkle in his eye.''
 Many reviewers say the show has not missed a beat since Mr. Brancaccio took over from Mr. Moyers -- including Mrs. Moyers. ''We're thrilled the way things have turned out,'' she said. But Mr. Kurson, Mr. Brancaccio's friend from Cedar Grove, thinks ''Now'' is ''still trying to find its legs'' in its new incarnation. 
 ''Television is a lot more of a collaborative effort than radio,'' he said, adding that so far he finds that the program lacks some of the spontaneity Mr. Brancaccio brought to ''Marketplace.'' Still, ''Now'' attracts about 1.5 million viewers, not to mention the ire of powerful people in Washington. A recent segment focused on the fate of terrorism suspects who have been jailed in Guantanamo Bay since the United States-led assault on the Taliban in Afghanistan. 
 ''This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue,'' Mr. Brancaccio said. ''Here's what is not in dispute -- these detainees have been there for three years, and are not being given access to what a normal American would view as due process. Are we O.K. with that? That's the question our journalism posed to viewers.''

Bristles at Conservative Critics
 Mr. Brancaccio said he would be disappointed if the show did not provoke sharp disagreement, but he bristled at the suggestion from conservative critics that ''Now'' has an ideological or partisan point of view. A recent program, he noted, featured Janeane Garofalo, the actress and Air America Radio personality who is active in liberal causes, and the former Representative Robert Barr, a conservative Republican from Georgia. 
 And he pointed to a recent ''Now'' report about the Veterans Administration, which suggested that the agency may not have the resources to help soldiers returning from the Persian Gulf or Afghanistan suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome.
 ''I don't want somebody pointing to a story like that and saying, 'Oh, of course he's saying that. He's a Trotskyite,''' he said. ''I just want people to look at what we've found out about the V.A. and not have my voting behavior, or lack of it, entering into the discussion. That's the kind of journalism I do. It's not the kind of journalism that wins you many friends in high places.''
 Well, he has at least one admirer who used to work for the White House: Mr. Moyers. ''David is doing something no other broadcast does on Friday night -- real reporting of stories instead of just talking about the news,'' Mr. Moyers said. ''He's far more of a natural at this than I was, and he's way ahead of where I was at his age. If television journalism survives, he will be one of its leading lights.'' 
 Mr. Brancaccio recently learned that ''Now'' has been renewed through 2006, which means that its version of television journalism will survive for at least the next 18 months. After that, who knows? Uncertainty is the nature of television, particularly public television, particularly controversial public television.
 ''I've got to believe that whatever happens to us,'' Mr. Brancaccio said, ''that people will look back at 'Now With Bill Moyers' and 'Now' and say, 'Wasn't that a great moment in television news, when they were doing what they were supposed to be doing: Going out and finding important stories.' 
 ''It's a funny time in the world that it almost seems radical that we're doing this stuff.''

The Dark Side of Paradise
 Never mind first acts in American life; F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, are about to get their zillionth. 
 The tempestuous marriage of the Fitzgeralds -- perhaps literary America's favorite unhappy couple -- has been transformed into a musical that its producers, being producers, hope is headed for Broadway. ''Waiting for the Moon: An American Love Story'' is scheduled to have its world premiere in July at the Lenape Regional Performing Arts Center in Marlton. Frank Wildhorn, composer of ''The Scarlet Pimpernel'' and ''Jekyll&Hyde,'' wrote the music and Jack Murphy the book. ''Waiting for the Moon'' is scheduled to open July 20 and run through July 31. 
 ''This is the first time there has ever been a premiere like this in southern New Jersey,'' said Vincent Marini, the Lenape Center's artistic director. ''It's absolutely a new thing for down here.'' 
 As the Fitzgeralds look backward on their difficult life together, the musical will shift among Alabama, New York, Paris and Hollywood. ''One of the things that turned me on was that a lot of the show is from her point of view,'' Mr. Wildhorn said. ''She is the belle of the ball, the best the South has to offer. She falls under his shadow. They live on the edge. Somewhere along the way she has lost herself and struggles to find her own identity. It's given me wonderful themes.'' 
 Mr. Wildhorn has already been associated with several concerts at the Lenape Center, which is where he met Mr. Marini.
 ''Vince is so smart, such a good producer and a good guy,'' Mr. Wildhorn said. ''We became friends and talked about doing things.'' 
 Last summer, Mr. Marini produced a concert version of ''Jekyll&Hyde'' there that will go on tour nationwide this fall. 
 ''We will invite the world to Lenape to see it,'' Mr. Wildhorn said of the Fitzgerald project, noting that all of his musicals started out at regional theaters and gave him a crucial ''laboratory outside of New York.''
 He said he is proud to bring the new musical to the Lenape Center. ''The people there have been great to me,'' he said.

Virtually a Movie
 When John Belton watches a ''Star Wars'' movie, it makes him think about the future -- the future of the digital film.
 Mr. Belton, a professor of film and English at Rutgers, thinks he knows what that future holds and plans to write a book about digital cinema, using the time he bought by winning a Guggenheim Fellowship last month. 
 Digital cinema is leading film in two directions, Mr. Belton said: ''Fantasy films in utopian space,'' and an expansion of experimental and independent cinema.
 Though digital cinema has yet to take over the film industry, Mr. Belton, who has written five books about movies, believes that it will.
 ''I think the economic powers are looking for a direct connection from the studios to the home,'' he said. ''Film exhibitors will resist, but eventually movie theaters will be replaced by video on demand.''
 George Lucas led off the digital trend with his ''Star Wars'' movies, Mr. Belton said. Now more and more movies are using the technology. ''Sin City,'' the noir film released last month starring Bruce Willis, ''has that sort of digital look where the entire space veers toward some kind of abstract fantasy.''
 Technological change has its downside, he warned. ''Film has been around for 100 years or more, and if you found a film from 1905 and put it on any projector in the world, you would be able to play it,'' he said. ''Digital technology has been with us a shorter period of time and has run through different standards.'' Years from now it may be hard to screen old digital films, he said.
 And what about the quality of the digital image? ''I think that there is a psychological experience that is very unique to light being projected through film through silver haloid suspended in the emulsions,'' Mr. Belton said. ''There is a grain structure to the film that is random, little bits and pieces of information are stored on the grain. But the grain itself is naturally occurring, not a pixel.''
 In the end, ''it's going to be sad,'' Mr. Belton said. ''So much great material has been made on film, and the idea that somehow we are going to end up converting 'Citizen Kane' and 'Casablanca' to digital is sad. It's not as bad as colorization, but it's going to be a different experience.'' Margo Nash

HEADLINE: Across Iran, Nuclear Power Is a Matter of Pride

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: TEHRAN, May 28 

 BODY:
From nuclear negotiators to student dissidents, from bazaar merchants to turbaned mullahs, Iranians agree: the right to develop nuclear power is a point of national pride. 
 ''For a country to have nuclear energy means that it has made progress in all other fields as well, so other countries have to respect its technology,'' said Nilufar, 29, a graduate student in energy management at the prestigious Sharif Industrial University. Nilufar, covered in black so only her face was showing, agreed to be interviewed on such a delicate topic only if her family name was not used. 
 Ehsan Motaghi, a 26-year-old seminary student in Isfahan, cited a parable from Imam Ali, the Prophet Muhammad's son-in-law and the inspiration for the Shiite branch of Islam, which most Iranians follow. ''They can offer me everything from the earth and heaven, but in exchange if they want me to so much as take the food from an ant's mouth that is his right to eat, I won't do it,'' he said. ''Achieving the peaceful use of technology is really a matter of pride and we will not stop this for anything.'' 
 Such passions were echoed in two weeks of conversations with Iranians across all walks of life. Virtually all supported Iran's defying the West and moving ahead with its uranium enrichment program, which carries the threat of further United Nations sanctions. 
 This widespread sense of national pride complicates any attempt to persuade Iran's leaders to give up parts of the nuclear program, as European negotiators have been trying to prevail upon them to do in talks over the past few months, offering various incentives. 
 A monthlong United Nations conference on the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which Iran has signed, ended Friday, having failed to address the kinds of loopholes that the Americans and Europeans fear Iran is using to pursue nuclear weapons under cover of developing nuclear power. 
 That issue aside, it is clear that Iran's attachment to nuclear development is rooted in its own tumultuous history. The Islamic republic is trying to use its nuclear program as a bargaining chip to end the varying degrees of international isolation it has been forced to endure since the Islamic revolution in 1979. 
 The nuclear standoff also echoes an older fight: Iran's colonial struggle to control its oil resources, which it eventually wrestled away from the British. Some reach further back, reflecting a desire to revive the glory of ancient Persia. Others want to claim Iran's future, to prove that the Islamic revolution can overcome its reputation for abysmal management.
 ''It is a symbolic thing for Iranians,'' said Mohammad Saeidi, the vice president for planning and international affairs at the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. ''Our people are very clever, very smart and they want to use all the advanced technology in the world--nuclear technology, biotechnology, internet technology.''
 But for all the passion in the air, there are many nuances in Iranian positions, according to Iranian officials, scholars and foreign diplomats. In fact, they say, Iranian backing for nuclear development indicates neither automatic support for the government nor hostility to the United States. 
 Only a small group, mostly hard-core revolutionaries, wants Iran to resign from the treaty and try to develop nuclear weapons, they say. ''It would be 100 percent better to have nuclear weapons, but only to use them against anyone who tried to attack us,'' said Reza Jaedi, a 24-year-old interviewed in Isfahan who has little sympathy for the government. ''Iran should develop them as soon as possible.'' 
 It is rare to hear such views voiced in Iran, since they contradict the official line that Iran wants the technology only for peaceful means. 
 Another group opposes nuclear development as entirely too expensive, unnecessary given the vast oil or gas reserves and not worth the international political headache. In fact, say some scholars who have interviewed ordinary Iranians, some back off their support for nuclear development if they are told it might bring further economic hardship and international isolation to Iran. 
 But most Iranians, the experts say, fall into two other groups. One believes Iran should use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Another wants Iran to master the nuclear enrichment cycle both to avoid depending on foreign suppliers for nuclear fuel and to be able to move quickly to weapons development if Iran were threatened, either by Israel, the United States or a regional rival. That group sees nuclear power as an insurance policy against a forced change in the government. 
 Unquestionably most Iranians would like to find a way to end economic sanctions so the country could use its vast oil wealth -- an estimated $10 billion surplus this year -- to fix the country's infrastructure, among other ills. Their second-hand jets crash with alarming frequency, their cellphone network is so overburdened that practically every conversation is a torturous series of half-heard sentences, and investment in the prized oil industry is problematic.
 Some of the Iranians interviewed argued that having access to American technology would be worth abandoning the nuclear program, but many others say no economic incentives would be enough to persuade Iran to abandon its rights under the treaty. The surplus provides a cushion against outside pressure. 
 ''At this time, God wants us to make what we need!'' thundered Yousef Tabatabai, the Friday Prayer leader, in his sermon last week at the main mosque in Isfahan. ''Other countries now feel threatened because we have advanced in our technology.'' 
 If Iranians were asked whether the mullahs should have missiles, many would say no because that would help cement the power of a repressive government, foreign diplomats and scholars who have studied the issue say. 
 But if asked if Iran should master nuclear technology, most Iranians point out that it is the country's right under the nonproliferation treaty. (It is not hard to find Iranians who can refer directly to Article 4 of the treaty, which codifies signatories' right to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes.) 
 ''Western countries are not recognizing Iran's legitimate right to use nuclear energy because of this government's hostile attitude toward the United States and its lack of legitimacy,'' said Mehdi Aminzadeh, one of the leaders of the student protest movement. ''The U.S. should not use the animosity it has toward our government to take away our rights as a people because any government will change sooner or later.'' 
 Government critics would like any deal to be tied to improved civil rights.
 In talks on Wednesday in Geneva, Iran and the European Union agreed to continue Iran's freeze on uranium enrichment, a step toward making nuclear fuel, for a few months while the Europeans develop proposals on cooperation in security, economics and other matters. On Thursday, the World Trade Organization agreed to accept Iran's application for membership, after United States dropped its decade-long opposition. 
 Many Iranians say the West should not worry about Iran developing nuclear missiles because Islam forbids such weapons. But Iran hid some of its nuclear preparations from the International Atomic Energy Agency for two decades -- including its enrichment of low levels of uranium in a Tehran suburb, prompting deep suspicions in Western states that Iran's goal is a weapons program. 
 The ruling mullahs are galled that the United States, which treated Iran under the shah as the natural leader of the region, blocks any such role for the current government. Nuclear technology might make them players again -- as might the bargaining to limit it. 
 Iran's capacity to produce electricity is more than 30,000 megawatts, mostly from oil-fired plants, but demand is expected to top out around 110,000 megawatts. That alone, along with uranium deposits in the central deserts, makes nuclear power viable in Iran, scientists say. There is no reason they should be forced to import fuel, which is one of the Western proposals to limit its nuclear capacity. 
 The officials all deny that Iran would try to develop weapons and say international inspectors would have full access. ''They can come and see for themselves, and they will find out that there is no room for suspicion,'' Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the front-runner in the June 17 presidential election, said in an interview this week. ''I say we do not want them at all, and that means we do not want to be close to producing them.'' 
 Nuclear experts estimate that weapons development is still some years away, especially because Iran has yet to master the technology for uranium enrichment.
 Some Iranians worry that Western governments, in pressuring the government hard to abandon any nuclear development, will win the day for the hard-liners. ''Just asking Iran to stop enriching uranium is not going to work, and the alternative is much worse; the alternative is weapons,'' said Nasser Hadian, a political science professor. 
 The ultimate solution would be for the Europeans to work alongside the Iranians, ensuring that nothing is diverted into a weapons program, some Iranians argue. They say broken contracts for nuclear energy after the revolution also justify their drive for self-sufficiency. 
 But all that would be impossible without American approval, because it holds the licenses for most nuclear processes. Ali Salehi, a professor at Sharif University of Technology, notes that early in the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988 the Iranian military asked scientists at his university to develop mortars. The first few prototypes exploded, but eventually researchers mastered the metallurgy. So it went with radar and a host of other equipment that the Iranians could not buy. He expects that it will be the same with nuclear energy. 
 ''They're not as good as the ones that are built in the West, but we have acquired a lot of expertise and more than that we have acquired a lot of self-confidence,'' said Professor Salehi, a former Iranian ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Organization. ''Nuclear research is a natural extension of that.''
