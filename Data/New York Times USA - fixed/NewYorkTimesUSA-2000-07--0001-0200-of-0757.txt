HEADLINE: Debating How Best to Love Your Country;
Do You Fight Off Assaults on the System or Fight to Make the System Better?

 BODY:
Norman Podhoretz is the editor at large of Commentary magazine, a senior fellow of the Hudson Institute and the author of "My Love Affair With America," to be published on Tuesday. Victor Navasky is the publisher and editorial director of The Nation, the Delacorte professor of magazine journalism at Columbia University and the author of "Naming Names," a study of the Hollywood blacklist. For many years they have disagreed, often vehemently, about the issues that shape American life. For this Fourth of July weekend, The New York Times asked them to discuss patriotism. The moderator of the discussion was Barry Gewen, the editor of Arts & Ideas and an editor in the Book Review of The Times.
Q. Norman, you begin your new book, "My Love Affair With America," with the quotation from Samuel Johnson: "Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel." This is probably the single most famous quote about patriotism, and it prompts the question: Has patriotism gone out of style? 
 PODHORETZ. Well, I think Johnson was wrong and this was a most uncharacteristic remark for him, a fervent Tory, to have made, since conservatives, generally in Europe anyway, had been associated with patriotic sentiment and the nationalist sentiment.
Has patriotism gone out of style in America? The answer is certainly yes, as of very recently. But my own feeling is that it's slowly coming back. We see signs of this resurgence of patriotic sentiment in various sectors of the culture. The most salient, I suppose, would be the enormous success of Tom Brokaw's two books on the World War II generation. I think the success of a movie like "Saving Private Ryan" is another sign, a sign of a new respect for the kind of virtues that were traditionally associated with patriotism or love of country.
NAVASKY. Well, about Samuel Johnson: Ambrose Bierce had an amendment to Johnson. I think he said, "I beg to submit, sir, it is the first." In other words, patriotism is not the last refuge of scoundrels, it's the first.
I don't agree with that. But I think it depends what your definition of patriotism is. I would suggest that in the Vietnam era the people who were protesting the war included a large number of patriots. My definition of patriotism would involve fighting to make sure your country lives up to its highest ideals. And from that perspective even those who burn the flag -- not all of them but some of them -- may have been as patriotic as those who wrapped themselves in the flag.
So the word may be coming back in some way, but the struggles to make America the best it can be have been going on, it seems to me, since the Revolutionary War.
PODHORETZ. I would like to take issue with the definition that Victor is offering. To define American patriotism as struggling to make the country live up to its best ideals has in practice generally meant denigrating the country for not doing so. The ideal is very often the enemy of the real.
The conditions under which Americans have actually lived in one generation or another is the country that one either loves or does not love. One can be critical of the country while loving it, just as one can be critical of one's wife or husband or lover in personal life. But I would submit that the people who burned the flag during the Vietnam War or people who spelled the name of the country with a K to suggest an association with Nazi Germany or people who saw no difference between America and the Soviet Union during the cold war, morally or politically, were not patriots.
NAVASKY. I guess I don't pretend to know the motives of the folks who chose the burning of the flag as their way of protesting the Vietnam War, but I do know that going back to the beginning of our history, and right up through the abolitionist movement and the movement for labor rights in the 1920's and 30's and the movement for civil rights in the 60's, those people who fought to achieve the American dream of equal rights for all were scorned at the time as, in effect, unpatriotic and later on as Communists.
Q. Let me ask Victor a question about patriotism and liberals and the left. In the period around World War II, there was no embarrassment on the left about engaging in traditional patriotic activities -- flag waving, Fourth of July celebrations -- but these symbols of patriotism seem to have disappeared from the left. Do those symbols now totally belong to conservatives and the right, or does the left have some call to them also?
NAVASKY. Sure, there was a shared symbology that went across the ideological board. Irving Kristol has written an essay, which Norman cites in his book, where he said that there is a holy trinity associated with American patriotism and it includes the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the flag. I would say two out of three isn't bad. To me, the authentic symbols of our country start with the covenants, the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The flag is important only for the principles that it represents.
Q. Next question: is there a good patriotism and a bad patriotism?
PODHORETZ. Yes, though my own view is that patriotism has been so ridiculed and has been so out of fashion that spiritual and moral balance require an emphasis on patriotism as a good thing. I mean, most people would say that when patriotism becomes chauvinistic or jingoistic or even simply nationalistic, it becomes aggressive and dangerous. But the heritage that we fight for is not merely one of rectifying wrongs of the past, such as slavery or discrimination, and trying to create conditions that are more in consonance with what is promulgated, both in the Declaration and the Constitution; it's also to fight off assaults on the system of government that was designed by the Founding Fathers.
Q. Victor, is there a good patriotism and a bad patriotism?
NAVASKY. Stephen Decatur, who said, "Our country right or wrong," said first, "May she always be in the right." And that's a good part of patriotism -- to fight to have your country be in the right. A destructive part of patriotism is when it slips into a kind of nationalism which makes you hate other countries, put your country's interests first when you think it's behaving in an immoral and unjust way. So that confusing patriotism with unconditional support for a government policy, it seems to me, does damage, and core damage, to the meaning of citizenship in our democracy.
PODHORETZ. But to denigrate the country, to call it foul names, to desecrate its symbols, should not be given the name of patriotism. People who want to do that are free to do that in this country. But I don't think they ought to then wrap themselves in the flag that they've just burned.
NAVASKY. When Frederick Douglass made his famous speech where he said that freedom requires rain and thunder and lightning, what he was talking about was that you have to do a lot of nasty and uncomfortable things to bring the plight of folks who don't have freedom to the national attention. And that is a part of a patriotic America-loving act. It's not an America-hating act to try to bring the African-American community to its entitlement.
PODHORETZ. In the civil rights movement, the early civil rights movement in the late 50's and early 60's, the most effective means blacks employed happened to be not nasty, whatever, but nonviolent resistance. Which was perceived by everybody in this country as noble and admirable and which made the sheriffs who were attacking them with water hoses look ignoble and evil. So I don't agree that nasty things necessarily have to be done.
Q. A great deal of the historical scholarship of the last few decades has examined and brought to light the negative aspects of American history -- slavery, the treatment of American Indians, the detention of Japanese Americans during World War II. How do we fit these negative aspects of American history into education programs for our children?
PODHORETZ. Well, I think they have to be faced up to honestly. Children have to be taught that these things happened. They also have to be taught that many -- in fact, I think all of the ones you mentioned -- were acted upon, were corrected. And that they were corrected through the resources of the American constitutional and institutional structure.
It's very important to teach children that the history of this country is on the whole a glorious one, not an inglorious one. That this is a country to be proud of, including for the way it has dealt with what I would say are the inevitable blemishes and warts. I think that we as a socio-political-economic system rank with such great civilizations of the past as fifth-century Athens and Elizabethan England. Not, as I say in my book, in the production of artistic monuments, though we haven't done so badly in that department either, but in the provision of more liberty and more prosperity to more people than has existed anywhere else on earth, whether present or past. And this, too, has to be taught to our children and should be emphasized.
NAVASKY. I think the way you teach the abolitionists, for instance, is that you make clear that, in terms of your own values, the abolitionists were greater patriots than the plantation owners against whom they were fighting. That the folks who were organizing the workers, in my judgment, were greater patriots than the mine and mill owners who were exploiting them. That the real patriots during the Vietnam War were the folks who resisted it. And the patriots during the civil rights movement were indeed, as Norman said, the folks who adopted passive resistance. And it worked to a degree there.
PODHORETZ. I have nothing against the abolitionists, but I would say that my hero in the Civil War is not John Brown but Abraham Lincoln. They were very different and they were not on the same side. And it makes a big difference whether you think it's Abraham Lincoln who should be celebrated or John Brown.
NAVASKY. I think they both should be celebrated, as should Frederick Douglass.
PODHORETZ. Well, I agree with you about him.
Q. What impact, if any, has multiculturalism had on our idea of patriotism?
NAVASKY. I think it requires a revision to this classic notion of my country right or wrong, first of all, depending on when your own group became part of the tradition and entitled to the rights that other folks got.
Secondly, I think the real contribution of multiculturalism to our culture today is the right of people to establish their own identities and define their own identities.
And thirdly, multiculturalism suggests that we have a series of competing allegiances. One of them is love of family. A second is love of tribe or culture or whatever it is. A third is love of country. And a fourth is one's relationship to the international community. And it seems to me the most valuable kind of patriotism is one which honors the other relationships rather than competes against them.
PODHORETZ. Well, here we go again. I think multiculturalism is a perversion of the traditional American idea of pluralism. The ideal was that in the public sphere -- in the public schools -- the rule of assimilation prevailed. That is, if an immigrant came to this country, he was expected -- and, indeed, wished -- to learn English and to absorb the traditions of his new country, to become an American, to be Americanized. Nothing prevented that individual from remaining loyal, within the private sphere, to the tribe and the family. You were free as an individual to live in both worlds if you chose. But what you were not free to do was to refuse to assimilate to the culture of this country. Nobody was going to arrest you or anything of that sort, but you would certainly limit your opportunities for employment, for advancement and for participation, including civic participation.
I think that multiculturalism doesn't so much help to give people the power to define their own identities as it keeps them apart from the rest of the community. So I think it's a bad thing and I think it is not -- does not -- contribute to a healthy patriotism.
Q. Now each of you, if you want, can take a minute or two to say something in summary. Norman?
PODHORETZ. Yeah, why not. I'll take a crack at it.
I think intellectual honesty requires us to recognize that we have emerged from a period during which America-bashing, as some call it, or denigration of America, has prevailed, particularly among intellectuals, not so much among most people, but among the elites. I believe this has begun to change. I hope it has begun to change.
NAVASKY. I guess patriotism is best expressed in the struggle to make this a better place. And it is not best expressed in saluting the flag or in parades down Fifth Avenue but in writing, in marching, in suing, in voting, in going to court, whatever it takes to fulfill the promise of the Bill of Rights.

HEADLINE: Encyclopedia Raises Veil On Ancient Saudi Culture

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
In a culture of silence, words can be weapons. In perhaps no contemporary state has the written word proved more threatening than in Saudi Arabia, where sins, sources of shame and sometimes even accomplishments tend to be hidden away.
So it was with a determined lack of fanfare nearly a decade ago that Prince Khaled bin Sultan, the Saudi media baron and former co-commander of the military coalition against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, opened a front in the cultural war against silence in his country, even as he prepared to lead the multinational forces into battle to free Kuwait. 
 In September 1990, the prince quietly agreed to finance an ambitious project by a group of Saudi scholars to document the country's rich cultural heritage and traditions before they disappeared. Ten years and several million dollars later, the Encyclopedia of Folklore of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a 12-volume, Arabic-language compendium of a vanishing way of life, has just been printed in Belgium. Its authors say that the series, which includes 5,000 drawings, illustrations and graphs, is the largest body of secular scholarship ever produced in Saudi Arabia. It includes separate volumes on topics like historical and archaeological sites, traditional medicine, geography, even children's games. And there is an entire volume devoted to the camel.
While Prince Khaled said he had contemplated such a project for two years before the gulf war, the conflict was the project's main catalyst. "The widespread ignorance of Saudi Arabia and its cultural heritage, not just among foreigners but among younger Saudis made me determined to try and document and preserve our traditions before it was too late," he said in a telephone interview.
Thanks to oil wealth, lifestyles have changed faster and more dramatically in Saudi Arabia than in almost any other country. Fifty-year-old Saudis can recall baked-mud hovels, with neither electricity nor running water, in which most of them were raised, but young Saudis today can barely imagine life without the Internet, cellular telephones, vacations abroad, air-conditioned suburban homes, sport utility vehicles and fancy shopping malls. Few have ever even ridden a camel.
Yet Saudi contributors to the volumes say that a work of this nature could probably not have been undertaken as long as tribal and regional divisions continued to plague the kingdom. Oil wealth has helped unify Saudis politically and culturally, said Sa'ad al-Sowayan, an anthropologist with a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley and the encyclopedia's chief editor. Until Saudis spoke the same Arabic dialect and tribal and regional cultural differences diminished, a project examining the country's heritage would have been too contentious to be approved by the censors.
In addition, he observed, until recently many Saudi scholars viewed folk culture as academically dubious. They believed that attention to traditional ways of life emphasized backwardness. But after the gulf war, Mr. Sowayan said, "people realized that our old civilization was dying out, and that we had a limited window to capture what was being lost, mostly through memory. It gave us a renewed sense of urgency."
Some 75 leading Saudi scholars and writers contributed to the encyclopedia. Their texts were then vetted by older, often uneducated Saudis who still remembered many of the nearly extinct customs.
Consider the 547-page volume on the camel. The volume notes that it was the domestication of this amazingly adaptive, aggressive, often crotchety creature that made Bedouin nomadic life possible. Saudis rarely tired of extolling the camel's endurance, forbearance, fortitude and other virtues in chants, conversation, lore and song.
Bedouin poetry likens the swishing of the camel's tail to the swaying of the unbraided plaits of a beautiful young woman dancing on her wedding night. Without the camel, Mr. Sowayan said, nearly a third of the Arabic language would disappear.
Legend has it that the Arabs stole camels from the Jews. Because in Saudi lore the Jews are said to be still longing for their animals, the Bedouins describe any false hope by likening it to the hope of the Jews for the camels' return.
Ultimately, the volume asserts, the camel was superseded as the major symbol of Arabia by the palm tree, the emblem of the sedentary farmers, merchants and traders who were the Muslim prophet Muhammad's first and most enduring followers.
This community, which loathed and feared the warring Bedouins, imposed its written, settled culture on nomadic culture, said Abdulaziz Fahad, a lawyer and an early champion of the project. As a result, Saudi society remains deeply ambivalent about the desert and the traditional Bedouin life.
Some of that traditional culture has already vanished beyond memory and retrieval. The encyclopedia, for instance, includes no volumes on folk songs or traditional dancing because Mr. Sowayan could not find qualified authorities to write them. Nor is there a volume on Islam or any of Arabia's pre-Islamic religions. Religion is not folk culture, he asserted.
Still, the volumes may stir controversy among some of the kingdom's more rigid, literal-minded clerics.
As one contributor said, conservatives won't like the discussions of "un-Islamic" traditions and beliefs, or the books' many representational photographs and drawings, which they say are prohibited by Islam.
But so far, the encyclopedia has had no problem winning official blessing.
Because the Saudi government decided some two decades ago that any genuine encyclopedia would not be censored, the Ministry of Information, which routinely blacks out with felt-tipped pens magazine photographs considered too licentious, approved the encyclopedia with its pictures and drawings in less than 10 days.
"This work will not only help us preserve our vanishing past, but by examining the past, will emphasize our new cultural and political unity," Mr. Sowayan said. "In that sense, it is a truly nationalist project."

HEADLINE: Slight Rise In Spending By Consumers

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Americans, whose buying binges have powered economic growth, spent cautiously in May for the second consecutive month, another tentative sign that the robust economy might be slowing.
Consumer spending rose by just 0.2 percent in both April and May, the Commerce Department said today. Personal spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity. 
 The spending increase in May matched many analysts' expectations. The figure for April was revised down from an increase of 0.4 percent.
"It appears as if there really is some caution developing in the spending habits of consumers," said Joel Naroff, an economist at Naroff Economic Advisers.
The latest report also showed that Americans' spending on durable goods -- like cars and other costly manufactured goods expected to last at least three years -- fell 1 percent in May. That followed a drop of 0.7 percent the month before.
"Consumers are rediscovering the virtues of thrift, at least for a couple of months," said Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association.
Spending on nondurable goods, like food and fuel, rose a slim 0.2 percent after a decline of 0.2 percent in April.
Americans' incomes, which include wages, interest and government benefits, rose 0.4 percent in May, slightly faster than the gain of 0.3 percent that many analysts were forecasting.
In April, incomes rose 0.6 percent, a little slower than the government previously thought.
The personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- rose to 0.6 percent in May from 0.4 percent the month before. May's rate was the highest since 0.8 percent in January.
Other recent economic data suggests that the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases are working to slow the economy, economists said. The unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent in May from a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in April. Economists said people might feel less inclined to spend if they were not working. And retail sales were lackluster in April and May.
But another report today offered a conflicting sign on where the economy is headed.
The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its index of business activity in the Midwest rose to a higher-than-expected 56.8 in June, from 53.9 in May. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector. Analysts had expected a decline.
The Chicago report is considered a precursor of the closely watched national purchasing managers report, due out Monday.

HEADLINE: Downturn in Underwriting As Markets Show Volatility

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
On Wall Street, the second quarter roared in like a wildfire then fizzled to a campfire.
A sharp downturn in the Nasdaq stock market in April doused the market for new issues of stock that had been strong in the first quarter. By late June, dozens of companies had shelved plans to go public, and some that tested the market were sorely disappointed. And rising interest rates depressed the market for all sorts of new corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, which are issued by companies with poor credit ratings. 
 All told, the amount of money raised in the United States by investment banks -- $451 billion -- was down 24 percent from the second quarter of 1999. The total of stock and bond offerings in American markets fell to 3,823 in the second quarter from 5,047 in the second quarter of 1999. Measured by money raised in the United States capital markets, last quarter ranked eighth, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data in Newark.
The slump hit investment banks just as they were rushing to hire new bankers and were raising pay and improving benefits to keep their employees from leaving for Internet start-ups. Disclosed fees for underwriting new issues sank about 45 percent, to $2.64 billion, from $4.8 billion in the first quarter of 2000, and about 20 percent from $3.29 billion in the second quarter of 1999.
"The first quarter was as heady a market as we'd ever seen," said Jeff Edwards, co-head of stock capital markets at Merrill Lynch & Company. But after the stock market swooned in mid-April, he said, "there was a general pullback of all investors, retail and institutional."
Despite the newfound reluctance of investors to buy shares of untested companies, underwriters managed to float some landmark new issues. Most notable was the $10.6 billion spinoff of shares in AT&T Wireless, the biggest initial offering by an American company.
The $9 billion of that total raised in the United States accounted for more than one-third of the $24.5 billion raised through first-time stock offerings in the quarter and it accounted for the bulk of the initial offering proceeds raised by two of the biggest investment banks, Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup. Each of those firms was a lead manager, along with the Goldman Sachs Group, of the AT&T Wireless offering, and received credit for one-third of the United States proceeds, or about $3 billion.
Aside from that deal, Merrill raised about $900 million in initial offerings and Salomon raised about $750 million, according to Securities Data.
An initial offering is the most lucrative type of underwriting, leaving investment banks with as much as 7 percent of the money raised from investors.
Goldman Sachs again was the leading underwriter of initial offerings and all issues of common stock, commanding about 25 percent of the market so far this year.
Goldman managed several huge offerings during the rockiest period of the quarter in April, including the $4.6 billion initial offering of the insurer MetLife and the $3 billion spinoff of the T-Online subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom of Germany.
Looking back over the quarter, Mark Tercek, co-head of Goldman's stock underwriting business, said, "While market conditions were more difficult, we were still able to get a lot of deals done for companies of all stripes."
But, he added, investors are taking a more disciplined approach than they were during the I.P.O. frenzy that ran through much of last year and into the first quarter. "That was a very ebullient, extraordinary period of time and it largely is over," Mr. Tercek said.
After a weak May, the market for new stock started to recover in June and companies rushed back in to sell stock. Still, the market for new stocks was significantly stronger than the market for debt issued by corporations. As the Federal Reserve continued to raise short-term interest rates, investors were wary of buying bonds, especially those that mature in 10 to 30 years.
Investors showed a distinct aversion to risky bonds promising high yields. There were only 66 junk bond offerings in the quarter, down almost two-thirds from 178 in the second quarter of 1999. They raised just $7.5 billion, down from $32.2 billion a year earlier.
The virtual shutdown of the junk bond market came at the worst time for many young Internet companies that found that they could not finance their growth plans either by issuing stock or by borrowing in the public bond markets. That situation left some Internet retailers and other electronic-commerce companies no choice but to be acquired or go out of business.
For blue-chip companies, the borrowing was easier at the end of the quarter, after the Labor Department's report on employment in May eased fears of further rate increases by the Fed.
After that report hinted that the economy might be cooling, investors showed more interest in high-grade corporate bonds that mature in 10 years or more, said Randy Snook, head of corporate bond underwriting at Goldman Sachs.
"Much of the year has been unusual in that the amount of short-term issuance has been quite high," Mr. Snook said. "You can count the number of 30-year bonds issued from corporations on two hands."
Underwriters were encouraged by the reception for a $9.5 billion sale of bonds in the United States by Deutsche Telekom, which was split almost evenly among 5-year, 10-year and 30-year securities.
"We're not expecting an avalanche of activity," Mr. Snook said. But, he said, "We feel we have entered a period of much better market conditions than we've had in much of the first and second quarters."

Rescue of Retail Chain May Threaten Recovery in Japan

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 30

 BODY:
Japanese financial authorities bailed out a highly indebted department store company today, averting a major corporate bankruptcy but reigniting concerns about Japan's economic future just as it is showing signs of breaking out of a decade-long malaise.
The Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency charged with overseeing reform in the banking system, said the government would spend 97 billion yen, or $924 million at current exchange rates, of taxpayer money to help rescue the store chain, the Sogo Company. 
 The agreement paved the way for Sogo's other banks to forgive more than 630 billion yen in loans, or roughly $6 billion. The banks had wavered for weeks on whether to grant Sogo's request for the debt forgiveness, one of the largest loan write-offs in Japanese bank history.
But the agreement may have created bigger problems for the government, which faces heightened scrutiny of its use of taxpayer money.
The decision to rescue the company -- and ease pressure on the banks to which Sogo owes a total of $16 billion -- raises questions about where the government will draw the line on the use of public money. The precedent set today could mean that thousands of companies will press for debt forgiveness.
More important, the government's decision casts doubt upon its commitment to a serious overhaul of the economy, which has yet to decisively rebound from a decade of decline. "It suggests that every time the Japanese government looks over the precipice and sees what it means to clean up this economy, it's just too scary," said Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities in Tokyo.
Japan is not the first country to aid a private company. The United States rescued the Chrysler Corporation 20 years ago, and South Korea used public money to prop up businesses during its economic crisis.
But Japan has taken the concept further. The government has spent a minimum of 7.7 trillion yen, or more than $80 billion at current exchange rates, to restore the banking system. The government has offered small and midsize businesses 30 trillion yen in loan guarantees to keep them afloat -- only to see a large number of them fail anyway.
At the height of the banking crisis in early 1998, the Bank of Japan bought corporate debt securities to keep companies from suffering a short-term cash crisis. The Japan Development Bank was permitted to extend emergency credit lines to struggling companies like the Nissan Motor Company.
But Sogo is not Nissan, never mind Chrysler. "I think it is sensible to forgive some debt as we go through the process of restructuring the economy here, but is this the right company?" asked James P. Fiorillo, senior banking analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo. "I think not."
Sogo's restructuring plan envisions a return to positive net worth more than a decade from now. And there is widespread doubt whether Sogo can entice shoppers back into its dowdy stores.
The government had hoped to avoid a very public bailout of a private company. But it was pushed into that position by Shinsei Bank, the former Long-Term Credit Bank, which the government sold last year to a private group led by an American investment firm, Ripplewood Holdings L.L.C. Under the terms, the government must buy back for the next three years any loans made by Long-Term Credit Bank whose book value falls by 20 percent or more.
Sogo's loans fell into that category, and on Wednesday, Shinsei asked the Deposit Insurance Corporation to buy back 97 billion yen of the 200 billion yen Sogo owes it. Shinsei had already set aside 103 billion yen in reserves against a potential default on the loans. Once it became clear that the government would be holding the loans, not Shinsei, Sogo's other large creditors threatened not to forgive Sogo debts unless the government did the same.
While the government was worried about destroying Sogo and putting its 9,900 employees out of work, it was more concerned about the impact of Sogo's failure on the banking system, according to officials: Many of Sogo's creditors had not adequately reserved against potential default.
The fact that the government must still worry about the stability and soundness of banks that have already received public assistance and are supposedly in the process of seriously revamping their business practices suggests that the financial crisis is not really over.
"We're still in crisis management mode in Japan," Mr. Fiorillo said.

AT&T Considers Spinoff Of Long-Distance Business
AT&T is considering spinning off its long-distance telephone operation, the largest in the nation, as a separately traded tracking stock, people close to the company said this week.
One reason AT&T may want to issue a new stock to track the long-distance unit is that its shares have languished recently. AT&T hit a new 52-week low during trading yesterday and closed at $31.8125, down 31.25 cents. Management is eager to bolster the stock price and believes that issuing a tracking stock might accomplish that if the shrinking consumer long-distance unit was separate. Page C14.
 
E-Signature Bill Is Signed Into Law
President Clinton signed legislation giving legal weight to electronic signatures. At a ceremony in Philadelphia, the president used both the traditional felt-tip pen signature and the more high-technology method of inserting a signature card into a computer. C3.
 
Oracle's President Steps Down
Oracle, the world's second-largest software publisher, said that Raymond Lane, its president and chief opperating officer, had abruptly resigned. Mr. Lane, at Oracle for eight years, had held the post of president since 1996. C3
 
Doctors Seek Antitrust Exemption
Elated with a victory in the House, doctors opened a campaign to persuade the Senate to give them an exemption from antitrust laws so they could bargain collectively with insurance companies over fees and other issues. But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said he would stand in their way. A1.
 
Personal Spending and Income Rise
Consumer spending rose by 0.2 percent in May, the Commerce Department reported, matching expectations. Americans' incomes, which include wages, interest and government benefits, rose 0.4 percent in May, slightly more than expected. C3.
 
2nd-Quarter Slump for Underwriters
The amount raised in the United States by investment banks in stock and bond offerings -- $451 billion -- was down 24 percent from the second quarter of 1999. Fees for underwriting new issues sank about 20 percent from $3.29 billion in the period a year earlier. C14.
 
$765 Million Investment in Italtel
Cisco Systems and the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice agreed to acquire 80 percent of Telecom Italia's computer network equipment unit, Italtel, for $765 million. The two investors hope that by forging an alliance with Cisco and by making the company independent from its Italian parent, it will become more competitive. The investors said they hope to sell shares of the new company to the public soon. C4.
 
Russia Exerts Control Over Gazprom
Russia's government strengthened its influence over Gazprom, the natural gas giant. Shareholders voted in a new board, tipping the balance to favor the government, which controls 38.4 percent of the company. The vote greatly reduced the influence of Gazprom's chief executive, Rem Vyakhirev, who had wielded tremendous power. C2.

Weak 2nd Quarter Drags Stock Indexes Down for the Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks plunged in the second quarter of the year, leaving all the major indexes down for the first half as the Federal Reserve continued to try to slow the economy.
The Nasdaq composite index lost 13.3 percent in the quarter, its first loss since the third quarter of 1998. The decline more than wiped out its January-March advance and left it down 2.5 percent for the first six months of the year. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 4.3 percent in the second quarter and is now down 9.1 percent so far this year.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slumped 2.9 percent in the quarter and closed out the first half down 1 percent.
Investors also decided that many high-technology and Internet shares were overpriced and that it was time to cash in some profits, sending many issues plummeting. Amazon.com, the cyberspace retailer, closed midyear at 36 5/16 after trading as high as 106 11/16 during the Christmas shopping season.
"We clearly did deflate a good portion of the speculative bubble called the Internet," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisers in Boston. "A number of investors finally recognized that there is risk in the risk-reward equation."
But investment money has to go somewhere and this time the beneficiaries tended to be drug and other health care companies, real estate investment trusts and utilities. Stocks of semiconductor companies also climbed.
And technology was not a one-way street. After hitting a record 5,048.62 late in the first quarter, March 10, the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite fell as low as 3,164.55 on May 23 before recovering to 4,064.01 on June 21 and then tailing off again. It closed yesterday at 3,966.11.
"The Federal Reserve's 50-basis-point tightening was a bit of a watershed," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager for the Dreyfus Corporation, referring to a May 16 increase of half a percentage point in the overnight lending rate.
"In mid-May, things suddenly reversed" in the stock market, he added. "Interest-rate sensitive stocks went out of favor and tech came back in."
Still, investors shied away from fledgling companies, many of them with no profits and scarcely any revenue. A flurry of 18 initial public offerings reached the market this week to lift the quarter's total to 104, but this was far short of the 141 companies that went public in the first three months of the year.
"The world changed," said Richard Peterson, market analyst at Thomson Financial Securities Data, which tracks initial public offerings, noting that 52 of the 104 deals were marketed at prices below the range projected in their original filings. In the first quarter 91 of these issues were priced above the filing range.
Nevertheless, the quarter's biggest Nasdaq stars were technology companies, led by the Ixys Corporation, a semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, Calif. With a 3 3/8-point surge yesterday. to 53 3/8, the stock nearly quadrupled from its March 31 price of 13 9/16. Adept Technology, up 6 11/16 yesterday, ended the quarter at 46 3/4, up from 12 on March 31. The biggest loser, excluding companies that filed for bankruptcy, was Fidelity Holdings of Kew Gardens, Queens, which lost 94 percent of its value, closing at 1 1/4.
On the New York Stock Exchange, Keithley Instruments, which makes electronic measuring equipments, soared 264 percent followed by Lilly Industries, up 142 percent.
Entrade, a Northfield, Ill., business-to-business Internet company, plunged 77 percent, to 7 1/16. The Chyron Corporation and Dynex Capital also lost more than 70 percent of their market value.
The average technology mutual fund fell about 13 percent during the quarter, according to Christopher Traulsen, an analyst for Morningstar. This contrasted with an 18 percent advance in the first three months of 2000. Last year, the average tech fund soared 135 percent.
"There was some flight to quality, into bigger, steadier companies" within the technology stock group, Mr. Traulsen said.

Share Prices Climb
By Bloomberg News
Stock prices rose as investors bet the decline in technology shares on Thursday was overdone.
Cisco Systems and Microsoft led the Nasdaq composite index higher, even as the gauge completed its first losing quarter since 1998.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 88.88 points, or 2.3 percent, to 3,966.11, after dropping 1.6 percent Thursday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 12.21 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,454.60. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 49.85 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,447.89.
Treasury bond prices were mixed. The 10-year note rose 2/32, to 103 16/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.01 percent from 6.02 percent. The 30-year bond fell 9/32, to 105 1/32. Its yield rose to 5.89 percent from 5.87.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Are a Billion Chinese Grapefruit Compliant?;
U.S. Citrus Growers Are Early Winners In Two-Way Agricultural Trade Accord

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 30

 BODY:
At the Sidaokou wholesale market they have been snapped up, these strange golden orbs bedecked with American flag stickers and the name Ocean Spray.
Some people have driven two hours to purchase them. But most just regard these fruits with curiosity -- are they oversized oranges? -- and read the poster that explains: "Grapefruits from Florida . . . Famous Brand Name . . . Healthy and Tasty . . . Good for Your Blood and for Beauty." 
 "It's my first imported product, and sales are very very good," said Rong Zhifang, a saleswoman, hovering behind her cartons.
When China joins the World Trade Organization, probably later this year, it will be forced to allow a huge range of foreign goods greater access to its vast markets. But a few American agricultural items -- including citrus fruit and pork -- have already attained sharply improved entry in the last few months, under a recent United States-China agricultural agreement.
And, in Beijing, the fate of the invading oranges and grapefruits is seen as a glimpse of China's future, presaging the sudden new opportunities and problems that free trade will bring.
"The arrival of American agricultural products is just a start," said The Beijing Morning News, in one of many articles that have appeared recently about the American fruit. "Once China joins the W.T.O., the story about the boy crying wolf will soon become a reality."
Indeed, Western companies are drooling at the prospect of China's potentially huge market, aggressively promoting their products.
At the annual Food China 2000 Exhibition last week in Beijing, American producers of chicken, ice cream and fruit juice -- to name a few -- turned out in stands decorated with red, white and blue bunting to give buyers from Chinese restaurants, supermarkets and hotels a taste of the future. There was even a booth promoting American pork, to a country where a surplus of pigs has driven pork prices to near record lows this year.
But it was the citrus booth -- with its free fruit slices and drinks -- that commanded the longest lines. "This will certainly open up new business opportunities for me," said Ding Yong, a food distributor for cafeterias. "The juices are great."
Price, of course, is something of an issue. Imported oranges are about three times the price of Chinese products. Grapefruits here cost about $1.50 each, compared with about 10 cents for somewhat similar Chinese fruits, called youzi (pronounced yo-zuh) and huyou (pronounced hoo-yo).
These price differentials will narrow somewhat when China enters the W.T.O., since the fruits now carry an average import tariff of 40 percent. But even as tariffs are cut, imported fruit is likely to remain quite a bit more expensive.
And other hurdles are likely to remain for a long time, as China's slow-moving bureaucracy adjusts to the realities of more imports. The Florida grapefruits that arrived in China on April 20, for example, were stuck in quarantine for the next four weeks, their release blocked by a series of logistical problems.
First, the inspection documents provided by the Florida producers were considered invalid by Chinese customs authorities. Then the quarantine inspectors sealed the warehouse after noticing that some cases contained dead insects. The inspectors ultimately cleared the fruits, but not before Chinese distributors had paid them thousands of dollars in storage fees.
"I have met with so many troubles from these fruits, and I still have many grapefruits in the ports waiting to be inspected," said Zhang Zhimin, the sales manager for the China Cereal Import and Export Company, which is handling the citrus imports. "Although sales are good now and I am quite optimistic, there are still many problems."
The citrus fruits are coming in under the United States-China Agricultural Cooperation Agreement signed late last year. Under the accord, China said it would drop barriers that had previously prevented the import of some American agricultural products.
China agreed to recognize the American pork inspection system, for example, which it had called inadequate. It also dropped what had previously been a near-blanket ban on citrus imports, put in place to protect against infestation by the Mediterranean fruit fly, or medfly.
Under the new agreement, the United States promised not to send fruit to China from counties experiencing medfly infestations.
Since April 20, more than six huge shipments of fruit have arrived here, including 16 tons of Sunkist oranges in the northeastern part of Dalian and 60 tons of grapefruit in the coastal city of Tianjin. By the end of May, they could be found in upscale markets in Beijing, where the press has provided detailed analyses of their flavor, appearance, breeding and value.
In Shanghai, the 1,800 cartons of oranges that arrived on May 11 sold out within two hours. In Dalian, they lasted just three days. Tens of thousands of grapefruits have sold in Beijing since they arrived on May 20.
"Will the high prices affect sales in China?" asked The Beijing Morning News. "It seems not. The Chinese people have showed unexpected enthusiasm for these fine-quality oranges." Chinese experts urged their compatriots to carefully observe the invasion and learn from American farmers.
Of course, the initial burst of enthusiasm for the fruit may not be surprising in a country where consumers worship all things American. American fruit growers and distributors are determined to maintain the momentum.
Calling grapefruit the "No. 1 Fruit in the U.S.," material from the Beijing Shiyi Futai Trade Company says its grapefruits help "protect your heart, blood vessels and kidneys." The fruit "has the natural anticancer element of folic acid, and natural fruit colloid, which can lower cholesterol."
A series of flashy television ads, featuring a popular music TV host named Ke Lan, is planned to promote American oranges.
There is still much work to be done. At the China Food 2000 Exhibition, Sunny Chen, an executive chef from a hotel in Xian, declared that consumers there were "not ready" for the flavor of grapefruit, as he threw a rind into the trash can -- even though he personally liked the fruit and predicted success with the more worldly palates of Beijing.
But at the huge Xidan Market in the capital, six flag-festooned grapefruits sat forlornly on the shelves one recent day, more museum pieces than comestibles.
"Look! Fruit from America," said Gui Shufeng, a retiree who was strolling in the market with his wife.
"I like them -- a little tart and a little sweet," said Mr. Gui, who had tasted grapefruit while visiting his daughter in New York. "But I'm not sure if Chinese will buy them. They're expensive."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE GREEN CANDIDATE;
Unlike '96, Nader Runs Hard in '00

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., June 28

 BODY:
It was nearing 10 o'clock at night, but in the sweltering lecture hall that served as the stage for this political rally, the Green Party's nominee for president of the United States was still going strong.
He sharply criticized an "apartheid economy" that was benefiting only the rich, and he bemoaned the state of affairs in a country with "far more problems than it deserves and far more solutions than it applies." And he scoffed at the notion that he might be a spoiler, drawing enough votes away from Al Gore to tip the election to George W. Bush. 
 "You can't spoil a system," the candidate, Ralph Nader, said, "that's spoiled to the core."
The audience of 300 people or so loved it, repeatedly breaking into applause and giving the 66-year-old Mr. Nader a standing ovation coming in and heading out.
It is impossible to know whether, as current polls suggest, Nader's Raiders will have more impact on the race than the Buchanan Brigades of the likely Reform Party nominee, Patrick J. Buchanan. But one thing is clear on the campaign trail with Mr. Nader, the country's best-known consumer advocate: he is running an exceedingly more energetic race than he did four years ago, when he essentially stood in as a protest candidate, spending less than $5,000, speaking rarely and taking 1 percent of the vote.
"This is the difference between a person running and a person standing still," he said by way of comparison to his 1996 White House bid.
He has campaigned in every state this year -- flying commercial coach class, frequently using his senior-citizen's discount -- and appears well on his way to his goal of raising $5 million, with the help of the direct-mail network he has built over the years and plugs from several big Hollywood names.
He may wind up as a passing phenomenon in this campaign, like former Senator Bill Bradley or Senator John McCain. But for now, Mr. Nader is attracting a lot of attention -- among the news media, among left-leaning voters who see him as a more reliably liberal voice than Mr. Gore, and among leaders of organized labor, who agree with his stands on trade. Mr. Nader is a staunch critic of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization, both of which he depicts as evidence of a "corporate globalization" that harms worker rights and the environment.
Polls in recent weeks have put him at 5 percent to 10 percent of the vote.
It would be a stretch to call Mr. Nader a natural politician, and his one-and-three-quarter-hour nomination acceptance speech on Sunday in Denver may have been a tad long. But he seems highly animated, and has a lot of sound bites down. He even claims to be enjoying his life as a politician, though he chooses a rather grim analogy to explain why.
"Oh, I have programmed myself so that if something is important to do, it's enjoyable," he said in an interview on Monday, after speaking at a women's center in the Mission District of San Francisco.
"I mean, there are some professional people who do that, too," Mr. Nader continued. "A good doctor, if he believes it's important to treat people, he'll enjoy treating people, even though outsiders may say, 'Oh, my God, what horrible tragedies and near misses, what pain you're dealing with.' "
In Mr. Nader's depiction, most of the country is in pain.
"At no time in our history have the children of America been in such crisis," he said in San Francisco the other day. And most wage earners, he told the crowd here, are working harder and longer than ever but have less purchasing power than they had in 1968.
Mr. Nader sees the West Coast -- with its mix of liberals, radicals, environmentalists and others who lean to the left -- as a fertile ground for his campaign. And indeed in California, where Mr. Nader has been involved in tort initiatives and has campaigned for so-called "patient protection" and H.M.O.-reform initiatives, polls show his support in the 5 percent to 7 percent range.
Though the number is small, much of that support comes at the expense of Vice President Gore, who most analysts believe has to carry California to win in November. But even with Mr. Nader campaigning hard in the state, Democrats here profess to be little concerned about his impact.
Rather than reaching out to Mr. Nader and his backers, they have so far been dismissive.
"Ralph Nader is a 66-year-old Corvair in this race ready to be rear-ended," said Bob Mulholland, campaign adviser to the California Democratic Party. "This is the most serious vote of people's lives and they're not going to throw it away."
Mr. Mulholland said his party would not "waste one ad" campaigning against the Green candidate.
"Nader became famous because of the Corvair and he's been doing college campuses ever since," he said. "And now he wants to be president? It's a joke; it's ridiculous. Only in America can someone completely irrelevant run for president."
Politically, Mr. Nader's message is a bit complicated. He says that he hopes his candidacy will energize turnout for Democratic candidates in close races for the House of Representatives, and thus help turn power over to House Democratic leaders, and away from the Republicans in the House leadership whom he calls "beyond the pale."
But at the presidential level, Mr. Nader has nothing but venom for Mr. Gore and President Clinton, whom he accuses of offering "some of the most intensive demonstrations of political cowardliness in American history." He says the race offers voters two "Republicrat" candidates, barely distinguishable.
"The only distinction between Bush and Gore is the velocity with which their knees hit the floor when big corporations knock on the door," Mr. Nader said the other day in Los Angeles, campaigning outside a public housing project.
A seasoned political strategist might suggest that while Mr. Nader remains so hot, he should be barnstorming the country. He did follow up his nomination acceptance in Denver with the swing here, and he said he plans many such swings. But afterward, he headed back to Washington, D.C., where aides said he planned to spend the rest of the week.
Here in Oakland, speaking on Monday at a downtown school called the University of Creation Spirituality, Mr. Nader elicited hisses of agreement from the crowd when he blasted several big-name Democrats in California, including Gov. Gray Davis and Senator Dianne Feinstein.
Among the central planks of his campaign are pledges to enact universal health insurance, to change labor laws to make it easier for unions to organize and to eliminate corporate welfare.
If there was any good news for Mr. Gore out of the rally here, it would seem to be that Mr. Nader's crowd was, by and large, so left-leaning that many voters there were not even the vice president's to lose. Several people in the audience said they had voted for Green or Libertarian Party candidates in the past.
What seemed to resonate with them most was Mr. Nader's "honesty -- just the sense that nobody is going to own him," as Corine Thornton, a 77-year-old retired waitress, put it. She voted for Mr. Nader four years ago, Ms. Thornton said, because "I just was no longer satisfied with voting for the lesser of two evils."
Mateo Williford, a 28-year-old self-described "traveling activist," rejected the idea that a vote for Mr. Nader was a wasted vote. "If we're ever going to have the possibility of three, four, five political parties," he said, "we have to make the choice to start bringing those in."
Still, some people were not even sure about the whole electoral effort on Mr. Nader's behalf.
"I'm disappointed that all this energy is being put into the political system," said Jonah Zern, 22, a recent Cornell University graduate with a degree in environmental policy. "I mean, the idea that one person can represent 250 million people is absurd."
Mr. Nader is not without potential vulnerabilities. Eyebrows were raised recently when the financial disclosure statements of Mr. Nader, America's most famous corporation-basher, revealed that he was worth nearly $4 million, in large part because of some savvy stock investments in high-technology companies.
Mr. Nader scoffed at the notion that there was anything untoward about reaping such gains. He said that he lived on about $25,000 a year, giving away 80 percent of his after-tax income, and that any of his gains represented a "de facto philanthropic fund" for his favorite causes.
No one really expects it, but what if Mr. Nader wound up in "that corporate prison we used to call the White House," as he describes it, dealing with the lawmakers "who have turned Capitol Hill into Withering Heights"?
Would he find it all daunting? Mr. Nader thought about the question for a while, and replied no: "First of all, I've been in Washington too long, I've seen what kind of characters were in power, who should have been daunted but weren't."
So, no, 'daunting' was not the right word.
"I would find it challenging to be president," he said. " 'Daunting' has almost a stuck-in-the-headlights, taken-aback sense, that maybe you're surprised by what you find yourself having to cope with. I don't think that would be the case."

HEADLINE: Leading Candidates in Mexico As Close on Issues as in Polls

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 30

 BODY:
The race for the Mexican presidency has been a show such as Mexico has never seen. The leading candidates have slugged it out on television, calling each other names and wrangling fiercely over the merits of change in a country governed by the same party for 71 years.
But as the dust settled in the final days before Sunday's election, it was hard to find much difference on the major issues between the leading candidates, Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the governing party and Vicente Fox Quesada of the right-of-center opposition, who have been running neck and neck. 
 On economic issues, the most deeply felt by Mexicans, the two were so close that they used the same slogan: "An economy with a human face."
Both candidates played down the nationalism that used to be a campaign mainstay and favored good relations with the United States -- although they did not say it too loudly. They even agreed on what not to bring up, so the crucial national security issue of narcotics was largely absent.
The candidates reflected a consensus among Mexican voters, who have embraced the global economy but want a fairer share of it, and seek better government through peaceful, orderly reform. And with Mexico linked to the United States more firmly than ever, the room in which its politicians can maneuver has been reduced considerably.
A leftist contender, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, contrasted with his rivals, calling for a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and more confrontation with the United States. But the latest polls show that although Mexicans admire his honest zeal, they will not elect Mr. Cardenas president.
Both Mr. Labastida and Mr. Fox were strong supporters of Nafta, which has transformed Mexico into an export powerhouse, creating millions of jobs in sectors that supply the booming United States market. Both criticized government policies that catered to the markets but did little to close the widening rift between rich and poor and between northern Mexico, where the export industries are based, and the south, where unemployment is rampant.
Mr. Labastida, the candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, distanced himself from President Ernesto Zedillo, even though the government's tight fiscal policies generated a recovery and growth surge without which the PRI campaign would have been doomed. He criticized his party's president for neglecting the purchasing power of working class Mexicans. He proposed to double or triple current subsidies to farmers in regions hurt by American competition through Nafta.
Mr. Fox stood on his experience as a former Coca-Cola executive and his record of boosting Mexican entrepreneurs when he was governor of Guanajuato state. He said he would create a cabinet ministry, separate from the Finance Ministry, to create jobs through private investment, promote "aggressive policies" on behalf of small businesses and send "massive resources" to the poorest regions.
"No one among the analysts can make out whose proposals are better," said Damian Fraser, the head of Latin American research for UBS Warburg. "Labastida has more experience in government and represents continuity. Fox has a somewhat greater commitment to free market policies."
The final polls showed Mr. Labastida and Mr. Fox in a tie, with Mr. Cardenas well behind. Mr. Fox comes from the moderate conservative National Action Party, known as the PAN, but spearheaded a diverse group of Mexicans who want a change from the ruling system.
Despite the similarities, Mr. Labastida did score one propaganda coup against Mr. Fox. In a much-discussed television commercial, he showed a video clip of Mr. Fox speaking in English during a visit to the United States, describing a program he set up in Guanajuato to train gardeners for skilled jobs in the United States. Mr. Labastida comes in at the end to say that he planned to create jobs for Mexicans in Mexico.
Even though relations with the United States have never been closer, Mexicans retain a gut wariness of their neighbor. Nationalism was unusually dormant through much of the leading campaigns, but in the final days the PRI revived it with accusations that Mr. Fox received illegal donations from across the border. Mr. Fox denied the allegations.
The two candidates both promised a harder line in defense of Mexican immigrants. Mr. Fox stressed a proposal to make a free labor market in the hemisphere in the coming years to parallel the free trade market, opening the border to the millions of Mexican migrants who now risk their lives to cross it illegally.
Education was another hot-button issue, where Mr. Fox and Mr. Labastida diverged. Mr. Fox made a risky pitch to Catholics, who make up more than 90 percent of the population, suggesting that he would make more room for the Roman Catholic Church in public education. The idea drew a furious response from the PRI, whose anti-clericalism and commitment to nonreligious public schools date back to its founding. It was not clear how the overture played among the voters.
Mr. Labastida also gambled, with a nationally broadcast radio commercial saying he would bring English and computer courses to all public schools. The opposition ridiculed the proposal as impractical and elitist. But PRI media experts found that the advertisement was popular with working class voters, and they kept broadcasting it for an extra two weeks.
One issue too explosive for either candidate to dwell on was Mexico's No. 1 national security concern: the narcotics trade. One PRI state governor, Mario Villanueva, is wanted by the Mexican authorities on charges of laundering drug money. But Mr. Fox's party also had a bleak record on combating traffickers in Baja California and Chihuahua, two border states it governed in recent years.
Both candidates said they would fight crime and corruption by overhauling the justice system. Mr. Labastida said he would dissolve the attorney general's office, the central federal justice institution, and create a new justice system more like that of the United States, where the fight against drugs would be isolated in one agency, federal prosecutors in another and federal police in a third.
Many sparks in the campaign flew from the friction between two very different men. Mr. Labastida is an institutional man who served 37 years in government without making a big wave or a big mistake. Mr. Fox handily outperformed him in both debates because Mr. Labastida seemed noncommittal.
Mr. Fox's forcefulness and populist informality both helped and hurt him. In a survey by Consultores y Marketing Politico, a public opinion research company, more of those interviewed liked and trusted Mr. Fox, but thought Mr. Labastida had "the personality to be president."
The split that has made the contest so intense is over the record of the PRI, tarnished by corruption and repeated economic crises. Mr. Fox appealed to voters to abandon their deep-set risk aversion and throw off a system of rule that has dominated their entire lives.
From a podium high above a huge crowd in Mexico City's central square, Mr. Fox boomed out the slogan that summarized his crusade: "Don't stop now, Mexico!"

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Praises The 'Values And Virtues' Of Hispanics

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Mixing praise for Latin American culture with appeals to Hispanic "values and virtues," Vice President Al Gore asserted this evening that his approach to education, health care and the economy would "unleash the promise of every brave young Latino in this nation."
"The values and virtues that are at the heart of the Latino experience -- honor and responsibility, faith and family, caring and community -- are the same values that are most important in keeping America strong," Mr. Gore said in a speech before the League of United Latin American Citizens. "I want to give all hard-working Americans of all backgrounds the chance to live out their values and reach for their dreams." 
 In a 30-minute speech liberally salted with Spanish phrases, Mr. Gore made a handful of policy pledges specifically intended for Hispanic voters, including affirming his support for bilingual education.
"I say to you tonight, 'Todavia no han visto nada,' " Mr. Gore said. "You ain't seen nothing yet."
But he focused more heavily on the broad themes that are central to his candidacy and that he repeatedly suggested have special value for immigrants and their children: improving education, safeguarding the booming economy, extending health care to all children and strengthening the Social Security system.
"We can create a future where new Americans and all Americans can open the doors to their own homes and swing open the wrought-iron gates to education and opportunity and live out their lives in peace and plenty," he said.
Mr. Gore's speech came at the end of the organization's weeklong convention, which opened on Monday with a speech by the vice president's likely Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush. In a much shorter address, Mr. Bush called for splitting the Immigration and Naturalization Service into two agencies and for making it easier for relatives of permanent residents to enter the country.
The competition between Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush for Hispanic voters has stepped up in recent days, when some recent polls have shown Mr. Bush cutting into the Democrats' historical domination among Hispanic voters.
In a poll from interviews with 2,721 likely Hispanic voters released today by The San Jose Mercury News, Mr. Gore was shown winning 50 percent of the Hispanic vote, compared with 34 percent for Mr. Bush. In 1996, President Clinton won more than 70 percent of the Hispanic vote.
Nationwide, Hispanics are projected to represent 5.4 percent of the electorate. But their numbers are significantly greater in the states with the most electoral votes: California, New York and Texas.
Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said polls showing Mr. Bush making inroads among Hispanic voters are meaningless so early in the campaign. "You can't compare poll numbers this far out from an election with results of previous elections," he said.
"Hispanic voters see that Al Gore is focused on issues they care deeply about, like education and health care," he continued. "And the more they learn about both candidates the wider this margin will grow."
Mr. Gore was accompanied tonight by several Hispanic members of the Administration, including Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and Aida Alvarez, the head of the Small Business Administration.
Mr. Gore did not mention Mr. Bush in his remarks. But he criticized Senate Republicans for holding up the nomination of Enrique Moreno to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
"I believe that it is time to call upon Congress to stop playing politics with judicial nominations and confirm Enrique Moreno," he said to loud applause.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
It Isn't Working

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The state of our political system the depressing state -- was illuminated by a report in The New York Times last week. The story, by Michael R. Gordon with Steven Lee Myers, showed how petty domestic politics had imposed heavy costs, financial and diplomatic, on plans for a U.S. missile shield.
The Clinton administration thought of building the antimissile system at Grand Forks, N.D., where an exception written into the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty allows a U.S. installation. But then computers showed that the single system would not cover the far western end of the Aleutian Islands, with a population of a few thousand. 
 That discovery killed the plan. Why? Because the Senate Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee is headed by Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska. No one was willing even to ask him about the idea of leaving those few constituents of his unprotected.
So the plan now being considered by President Clinton would put a huge radar installation on a remote Aleutian Island and deploy 100 interceptors in central Alaska. The change will add $2 billion to the cost of the system -- and require problematic negotiation with Russia about amendment or abandonment of the ABM treaty.
That tale illustrates a curious aspect of contemporary American life. In business, we expect hard-nosed leaders to make decisions based on cost and comparative advantage -- and we thrive economically as a result. But in public policy, fewer and fewer decisions are made on the substantive merits.
The so-called missile shield is an example in another sense, even more profound. President Clinton is considering a "thin" system, designed to deal with the possibility of long-range nuclear missiles coming from such countries as North Korea. Republicans in general, and Gov. George W. Bush in particular, are arguing for a much bigger and more expensive system that would also cover American troops abroad and our allies.
The thin system is a halfway measure. It reminds one of what Winston Churchill said about the name of a fellow M.P., Sir Alfred Bossom: "It's neither one thing nor the other."
The purpose of the thin idea is plainly political. President Clinton wants to protect himself -- and Vice President Gore -- from Republican charges that they are weak on defense.
Ironically, it seems doubtful that the tactic will succeed. Despite enormous scientific doubts about the workability of antimissile devices, and extravagant cost, Americans have liked the dream of an invulnerable shield since President Reagan floated it. Governor Bush is likely to score with his call for an all-out system.
Nor would the limited plan now being considered by President Clinton obviate the diplomatic and security dangers of any antimissile system. Forty-five China scholars and diplomats, including President Reagan's ambassador to Beijing, have warned that an early decision to begin building any new system would provoke China into "negative steps that would undermine American security."
Politics also underlies another dangerous decision: the proposal, just approved by Congress, to send more than $1 billion in aid to Colombia to fight drugs. Here again President Clinton embraced an idea whose ramifications have hardly been thought through in order to protect himself from being called soft on drugs.
Drugs are a subject that has paralyzed American political leadership for a generation and more. The war on drugs fills our prisons without reducing drug use. But only a few politicians have been brave enough to say that the emperor has no clothes.
The other day the chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals, Judith S. Kaye, ordered the courts to begin offering treatment instead of jail time to nonviolent criminals who are addicts. It took a judge to do what every study has shown is more effective and far less expensive.
Our sluggish democracy has always depended on courageous political leadership. It took a strong president and dedicated Congressional leaders, working together, to end American isolationism after World War II -- and to act on civil rights in the 1960's. When will we get the leadership to deal forthrightly with today's problems?

HEADLINE: Whitman Trims $21.4 Billion Budget Before Signing It

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 30

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed a $21.4 billion state budget into law today after using her line-item veto to carve $50 million in spending proposed by the Legislature.
The budget, buoyed by windfall tax revenues generated by New Jersey's surging economy, represents a 10 percent increase over last year's spending, and includes a $45 million tax cut for 240,000 low-income families, and FamilyCare, the Governor's plan to use part of the tobacco settlement to help provide health insurance for 125,000 New Jerseyans. 
 The budget also includes increased spending for towns, preschools, public schools, colleges, nursing homes and charity care for indigent residents unable to pay hospital bills.
But the spending package still provides an $870 million surplus, the largest in state history.
"There's a lot of new policy initiatives in this budget," said Assemblyman Richard Bagger, a Republican from Westfield. "From health care and education to tax cuts. This is one of those years when there's something for almost everyone."
Governor Whitman and the State Senate have also agreed on two other huge spending programs not included in the budget: the $3.75 billion Transportation Trust Fund to finance road improvements and a $12 billion plan to rebuild the state's aging public schools. But both measures must still receive the approval of the Assembly, which is expected to pass them when it reconvenes for a special session on July 13.
Mrs. Whitman said she was grateful that she had the good fortune to govern during comfortable economic times, but said she felt obligated to make the $50 million in line-item-veto reductions.
"It's very difficult during flush times to say no," Mrs. Whitman said, "but we have a responsibility to spend tax dollars as if they were our own."
Among Mrs. Whitman's vetoes were $300,000 in spending cuts intended to send a blunt message to one of the governor's political adversaries, State Senator John A. Lynch, a Democrat from Middlesex County. Mr. Lynch was the lone dissenter in the Senate's 38-to-1 vote in favor of the budget, because, he said, the state should use its prosperity to reduce New Jersey's debt and offer more aid to its struggling cities.
Mrs. Whitman retaliated against Mr. Lynch by denying financing to three programs he had requested in his hometown, New Brunswick: a $100,000 community shuttle bus program, $100,000 for a housing rehabilitation program and $100,000 for street lighting. To make sure her reasoning for those vetoes was clear, the governor's written budget message, distributed to reporters, included this explanation: "The sponsor of this appropriation has indicated his lack of support for the fiscal 2001 budget. Therefore it would be inconsistent with the sponsor's intent to approve this appropriation."
When asked about those cuts, the governor flashed a smile. "He didn't think this budget was good," she said with a chuckle. "So if the budget isn't good, it isn't good in a lot of ways."
Mr. Lynch and Mrs. Whitman have clashed in the past, and Mr. Lynch was a prime political backer of a fellow Democrat, Jim McGreevey, who nearly defeated Mrs. Whitman, a Republican, for governor in 1997.
Mr. Lynch did not return calls for comment after the cuts were announced.
Other line-item cuts by the governor included spending reductions for several hospitals, a variety of road projects and $1.5 million intended to help New Jersey teachers pay for continuing education.
But Leonard Lance, chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee, said most legislators were able to secure money for projects in their districts. "The budget is 99.8 percent of what the Legislature delivered to the governor," said Mr. Lance, a Republican from Hunterdon. "The governor and the Legislature cooperated extremely well."

HEADLINE: New Cinema And New Hope In Harlem

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
A milestone in what some people have called the miracle of 125th Street was reached yesterday when the long-awaited Magic Johnson Theaters opened, bringing Harlem its first multiplex, with amenities like stadium seating to rival any movie house in the city. For the first time in many years, local residents will no longer have to travel to the Bronx or the Upper West Side to take in a first-run movie.
But long before the first screening of "Shaft" yesterday afternoon, ripples from the nine-screen movie theater and the new $66 million Harlem U.S.A. shopping and entertainment complex of which it is a part were already spreading up and down the broad street that serves as Harlem's main thoroughfare. The six-level shopping center at 125th and Frederick Douglass Boulevard is home to several national chain stores, including an HMV record store, a Disney Store, an Old Navy store and a Modell's Sporting Goods store. 
 National chain stores, fearful of crime and skeptical of whether enough buying power existed in low-income and minority neighborhoods, have long shunned communities like Harlem. Now retailers across the country are closely watching Harlem U.S.A. to see if the ambitious project will succeed.
One regional retailer that has responded to the new shopping center is the aptly named Lazarus, a 40-year-old children's clothing store one block east of the new shopping center. Last year, the owners spent $500,000 to renovate the store, which has a new multicolored sign, a brightly lighted interior and a clean and up-to-date appearance. Harlem U.S.A. had a lot to do with the store's makeover, said George Adams, the general manager for 20 years.
"The street came back alive," he said. Mr. Adams said he was not worried about competition from Old Navy because his store had catered to the same families for three generations and emphasized personal service.
Signs of vitality are everywhere on 125th Street, from the recently added bright red paint on the KFC outlet across the street from Harlem U.S.A. to the new or spruced up clothing stores like Ashley Stewart, Scheme and Avenue. Pedestrians crowd the sidewalks, and there are long lines at the cash registers.
Some shoppers said they could scarcely believe the transformation. "I used to think, maybe it's all talk, talk, talk," said Julie Duncan, a retired telephone service clerk who has lived in Harlem all her 53 years, "but then it came to light."
Vacant spaces began disappearing and rents began climbing about three years ago when it became clear that the shopping center would actually be built, said Barbara Askins, the president of the 125th Street Business Improvement District. Annual rents in the area around the shopping center have doubled and now average $60 to $70 a square foot, she said.
But even with the new facades, no one would mistake 125th Street for the shopping corridor along Third Avenue in the 60's. Rhythm and blues and salsa music permeate the air and street vendors peddle a wide range of goods, from books and compact discs to hand-painted tiles and flavored ices.
There is much more to come. A complex with national retailers is planned for a site between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and a section of Lenox Avenue known as Malcolm X Boulevard, and excavation has begun for a building on Lexington Avenue that will house a Seaman's furniture store and a Duane Reade drug store. That site is cater-cornered to a Pathmark -- Harlem's first full-service supermarket in three decades -- which has flourished since it opened in April 1999.
The last large remaining unoccupied parcel on 125th Street recently changed hands for the unheard-of price of $5 million, said Geoffrey Canada, the chief executive of Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families, a nonprofit agency whose board members include Stanley Druckenmiller, an associate of the financier George Soros. Mr. Canada said the Rheedlen Centers will move its headquarters to the new 26,000-square-foot site from 107th Street and Broadway.
Farther west, the food purveyor Citarella is planning a 100,000-square-foot warehouse on 124th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and a store in the old Tastee Cake factory at 126th Street and Amsterdam.
After years of disappointments, development in Harlem is proceeding with breathtaking speed, generating many hundreds of jobs and changing people's lives in small ways as well as large ones. For example, Ms. Askins said, Harlem residents previously had to leave the neighborhood to find the weight-lifting equipment that Modell's carries or a gym like the branch of the New York Sports Club that recently opened at Harlem U.S.A.
Not every recent development project in the neighborhood has succeeded. East River Plaza, an East Harlem shopping center that would be anchored by a Costco warehouse store and a Home Depot, has stalled because of a lack of financing for a $30 million parking garage.
A plan to build a 10-screen multiplex on 125th Street and Lexington Avenue was scrapped after United Artists backed out. The developer, Blumenfeld Development Group, was unable to find a replacement because the movie theater industry is retrenching after several years of rapid expansion. Loews Cineplex, which owns half of the Magic Johnson Theaters in Harlem, is closing theaters in other markets. But Marc J. Pascucci, a senior vice president of Loews, said that in contrast to the rest of the country, Manhattan remains underserved by movie theaters, based on population.
Tickets at the new multiplex will cost $9.50, the same price Loews charges at its other Manhattan theaters. "This is an expensive city to do business in," Mr. Pascucci said.
Randy Dillard, an unemployed brick mason who has five young children, said, "It's a little steep." But even though he does not expect to patronize the new theater very often, Mr. Dillard said he thought the changes in Harlem were "very good for the community."
Others were less restrained. Laurence Jennings, the development director for Harlem Congregations for Community Improvement, an interfaith organization representing 75 churches and mosques, said the new movie theater had vast symbolic importance to the neighborhood. "It sends a message of upliftedness and a sense of pride and well-being," he said. "I don't think you can encase it in a few words."

HEADLINE: Doctor's Antitrust Hopes Face a Roadblock From Lott

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
Elated with a big victory in the House, doctors opened a campaign today to persuade the Senate to give them an exemption from antitrust laws so they could bargain collectively with insurance companies over fees and other issues.
But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said he would stand in their way. 
 The House passed a bill to exempt doctors from major provisions of the antitrust laws early today. The final vote, at 2 a.m., was 276 to 136, with a two-thirds majority heeding the doctors' pleas for relief.
The chief sponsor of the bill, Representative Tom Campbell, Republican of California, and his allies at the American Medical Association said the lopsided vote in the House would give them momentum in the Senate.
But Mr. Lott expressed opposition, saying: "I don't think we need more lawsuits in America. And I don't think we need more, you know, labor unions in America. And that's basically what they're trying to do. So I certainly don't look on it favorably. And I won't be trying to find a way to pass it, I'll tell you that."
Mr. Lott's position reduces the chances that the bill will get through the Senate this year. No senator has introduced such legislation, though Mr. Campbell and the A.M.A. are trying to find a senator, preferably a Republican, to take up the cause.
Senate Republican leaders are in no hurry to help the association. Indeed, the Republican leaders are upset with the group because doctors have worked closely with President Clinton and Democrats in Congress to pass a Democratic bill defining patients' rights in a much more expansive way than Republicans want.
The Campbell bill would exempt health care professionals from provisions of the antitrust laws when they negotiate with health maintenance organizations and insurers over fees and contract terms.
In the last 20 years, doctors have often been accused of violating the seminal antitrust law, the Sherman Act of 1890, which prohibits contracts, combinations and conspiracies in restraint of trade. The law applies to doctors as it applies to vitamin manufacturers and road construction companies.
In a typical case, the Federal Trade Commission asserted that patients and employers had been forced to bear more than $1 million in increased costs because of a price-fixing conspiracy by surgeons in Austin, Tex., in 1998 and 1999.
Doctors who are employees -- at hospitals, for example -- can join labor unions and collectively negotiate with their employers under existing law. The House bill would grant similar immunity from the antitrust laws to independent doctors.
Doctors said they needed more leverage to negotiate on working conditions, the quality of care, the number of patients they must see in a day and similar issues.
"This bill helps doctors help their patients -- nothing more, nothing less," Mr. Campbell said. "Medical professionals should be allowed to provide care for their patients as they think best, and today Congress empowered them to do so."
House passage of the Campbell bill has set off a titanic battle of lobbyists that mirrors the struggle between doctors and insurance companies to control patient care.
The A.M.A. has a formidable team of lobbyists. Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, a trustee of the association, said he sent e-mail messages to hundreds of doctors in the course of the House debate, and they flooded Congressional offices with phone calls urging passage of the Campbell bill.
In an e-mail message sent to doctors at 3:15 a.m. today, Dr. Palmisano said: "Wow! We had an impressive win. Now on to the Senate and the president. We must continue to push hard and not accept the naysayers' view. They have been 100 percent wrong so far."
Insurance companies, H.M.O.'s and business groups like the United States Chamber of Commerce have waged an even bigger campaign against the bill. They said they would press their arguments next week in meetings with senators home for the Fourth of July recess.
The bill is opposed by groups representing nurses, nurse practitioners and midwives, who fear doctors would demand that health plans restrict the role of such nonphysicians.
Antitrust officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department also opposed the Campbell bill, saying it would enable doctors to raise their fees. As a result, the officials said, employers and individual purchasers of health insurance would have to pay higher premiums, and spending for Medicare and Medicaid would increase.
The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have filed numerous cases alleging that doctors boycotted H.M.O.'s, tried to fix prices or conspired to thwart the cost-control efforts of managed care organizations. Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the commission, said the Campbell bill would legalize such conduct.
The Consumer Federation of America opposed the bill. But dozens of liberal Democrats, who take pride in being consumer advocates, voted for it, saying the bill would correct the imbalance of power between doctors and insurance companies.
Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, a staunch ally of organized labor, said the bill "reinforces the value of collective bargaining in our society."
Doctors said they needed the Campbell bill so they could serve more effectively as advocates for their patients in negotiations with insurance companies.
But Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, said, "When doctors express such concerns, it's often merely an attempt to improve their economic position in the guise of quality of care."
The Campbell bill does not give doctors any new right to strike, or to withhold services from patients. But Mr. Pitofsky said it would give doctors "coercive power" because they could back their demands for higher fees by collectively refusing to deal with certain health plans.
Mr. Campbell is running for the Senate against Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat. She has not taken a position on the bill, but has suggested that patients would be better served if Congress simply passed the patients' bill of rights.

HEADLINE: The No. 2 Executive at Oracle Resigns Abruptly

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 30

 BODY:
The Oracle Corporation, the world's second-largest software publisher, said tonight that Raymond Lane, its president and chief operating officer, had abruptly resigned.
Mr. Lane, 53, had been at Oracle for eight years and had held the post of president since 1996. Though he was the second-ranking executive in one of Silicon Valley's most powerful companies, he has always been overshadowed by Oracle's flamboyant chief executive and co-founder, Lawrence J. Ellison. 
 Mr. Lane's departure came just days after the company admitted that it had orchestrated a surveillance campaign against its archrival, the Microsoft Corporation, in an effort to prove that Microsoft was secretly financing groups that were lobbying in its defense in the federal antitrust lawsuit against it.
The spying operation led to several exposes based on documents that were supplied to reporters at The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.
In a short statement announcing Mr. Lane's departure, Oracle gave no indication why Mr. Lane had chosen to resign. Mr. Lane made no public statement today and could not be reached tonight.
Mr. Lane will continue to serve on Oracle's board of directors, the company said.
"I am grateful to Ray for all of his efforts," Mr. Ellison said in a statement. "He will be missed. We wish him nothing but the best."
An Oracle spokeswoman, Jennifer Glass, declined to comment on why Mr. Lane was leaving his post. But she said his departure was not due to the Microsoft controversy.
"It is absolutely unrelated," she said, to the events that exploded this week when Oracle executives admitted the company had hired the Washington detective firm of Investigative Group International in an effort to link Microsoft to public relations efforts in its behalf during the trial.
Mr. Lane's departure has been rumored for months. Tonight, several people familiar with the company's internal strategy said that Mr. Lane's role has decreased in the past year and that Mr. Ellison has increasingly guided the company in a direction different from the one advocated by Mr. Lane.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 7, 2000, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies of Business Day on Saturday about the resignation of Raymond Lane, president of the Oracle Corporation, referred imprecisely to press reports that Oracle's software rival, Microsoft, had underwritten groups backing Microsoft's antitrust defense. The error was repeated on Sunday in the Economic View column in Money & Business, about the exchange of invective between Oracle and Microsoft. The accounts of Microsoft's financial support, in The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, focused on two groups that are now known to have been targets of an Oracle-sponsored investigation. But none of the newspapers have said the documents cited in their coverage came from the Oracle operation; they have not identified the sources of their information.

HEADLINE: POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT;
That Spit and Polish Can Come at a Cost

BYLINE: By STEVE STRUNSKY

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
Eight hours before a $1,000-a-person fundraiser for his nascent campaign for governor, Mayor Bret Schundler stood before reporters and posed a question that to him was simple: "Should police officers get overtime for shining their shoes, doing their laundry?" he asked. "I don't think so."
The question was by no means hypothetical. Indeed, it may be precisely what a federal judge ends up asking jurors if the mayor and 625 of this city' police officers -- two-thirds of the state's second-largest police department -- cannot come to terms in a labor dispute. 
 In what experts say could significantly expand the scope of what public employees -- and perhaps any employees -- are entitled to be paid for, the officers are suing the city under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, seeking overtime for hours spent, in part, shining shoes, buffing brass buttons and otherwise polishing their appearance before leaving home to protect and serve the public.
If the officers win the suit, which was filed in United States District Court in April 1999, it could cost Jersey City taxpayers up to $50 million, including $25 million in estimated overtime, plus another $25 million in penalties the officers would be entitled to under a provision of the 62-year-old labor law if they demonstrate that the city willfully defied its obligations.
The cost of sprucing up uniforms: an estimated $5 million of the total overtime bill, plus another $5 million in penalties. The claims date back three years before the suit was filed, the period allowed under the law, said Steve Hunter, the attorney for the officers.
The case is being closely watched because of its implications for public and private employers not only in New Jersey, but around the country.
"I think that this will, in fact, establish a very dangerous precedent for other municipalities," William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities. "One thing we have learned in labor matters like this, it does not stop at one union's doorstep."
Beyond a potential liability that would amount to about 15 percent of Jersey City's $313 million annual budget, the issue has implications for the political future of Mr. Schundler, the 41-year-old mayor who became a darling of Republicans nationwide after his landslide victory in 1993 in this traditionally Democratic stonghold.
Mr. Schundler -- whose star has faded somewhat as he has stumbled while trying to deal with the political complexities of running an economically and socially diverse city of a quarter-million people -- plans to run for governor next year. One reason he summoned reporters to his office last Wednesday morning was to ridicule the suit as frivolous and to head off the city's two police unions from holding a demonstration outside a fund-raiser that night at the Liberty Science Center.
"The police are asking us to sell out the taxpayers for our political peace," he said.
Tom Bell, president of the city's 710-member Police Officers Benevolent Association, and Lt. Ron Bounocore, president of the Police Superior Officers Association, which has 160 members, made no secret of their strategy to pressure Mr. Schundler into settling the suit by demonstrating in front of his supporters.
"We are going to follow him throughout the state on the road to the governership," Officer Bell said.
The union officials said it was typical of Mr. Schundler to manipulate the situation by focusing on the shoe-shining element of the suit, even though it was only one of several issues. For example, they said, the department regularly denies compensatory pay to officers forced to skip lunch.
"You are eating a doughnut on the run because you can't sit down," Lieutenant Bounocore said.
The suit also claims that $4.5 million is owed to 125 police cadets because they were denied overtime despite working 18 days during six months of training. In addition, the suit seeks compensation for the time officers spent learning law-enforcement policies. Nor, the suit claims, have officers have been compensated for appearances on behalf of Drug Awareness Resistence Education (D.A.R.E.) for children.
In the past, officers had accepted that the time spent taking care of their uniforms was part of the job, and never sought compensation, the union officials said. It was only after the mayor had failed to address the other grievances, the officials said, that they filed the suit and included the spit-and-polish issue.
The suit comes after years of steadily eroding morale in the department -- almost from the start of Mr. Schundler's tenure -- stemming from such moves as the appointment of a civilian police director, Michael Moriarty, a former federal drug prosecutor, and an attempt to have civilians take over desk jobs in the department.
After the mayor's news conference, the union officials threw their own public relations counterpunch by welcoming reporters into the aging North District station house, where they were shown dingy bathrooms, cramped lockers, flickering light fixtures and collapsing ceilings.
In the end, however, it was the mayor who seemed to win the day's public relations battle. Reporters were clearly more interested in the shoe-shine story. After a conciliatory phone call from Mr. Schundler that afternoon, Lieutenant Bounocore called off the demonstration and agreed to meet with the mayor this week. "He's extending the olive branch," Lieutenant Bonoucore said, "so our sign of good faith was that we would not demonstrate."
But the lawsuit is still very much alive, and a hearing is scheduled for September before a federal magistrate in Newark.
Mr. Hunter said he was confident he would prevail -- even on the shoe-shine claim. He cited a ruling by Judge Alfred A. Wolin in Federal District Court in Newark last year in favor of officers in the Bergen County sheriff's K-9 unit who had sought overtime for the home care of their canine partners. He contended that Judge Wolin also suggested officers could put in for overtime related to other tasks, including the care and maintenance of their uniforms.
Nonetheless, the city's labor lawyer, Martin Pachman, was unfazed.
"We believe Judge Wolin was wrong," Mr. Pachman said, although he declined to cite legal precedent contradicting the judge.
Spokesmen for the state and federal Departments of Labor said they had never heard of an overtime claim for time spent spiffing up uniforms. Neither had William J. Kearns Jr., president of the International Municipal Lawyers Association. Mr. Kearns, a former mayor of Willingboro, who is also general counsel for the state League of Municipalities, said the Jersey City suit "is certainly pushing the envelope" for overtime claims, almost to the point of the absurd.
"Where are we going to draw the line?" Mr. Kearns said. "Are we going to pay them for taking their shower in the morning?"

HEADLINE: SENIORITY;
A Madison Avenue Fantasy

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each month.
E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE hit television show "Survivor" is credited with rejuvenating CBS, attracting loads of those coveted viewers between 18 and 49. That means the network, which mature Americans have long called their own, can now sell more ads at higher prices.
What remains difficult to understand is why Network Row and Madison Avenue think young eyeballs are worth more to them than older ones. 
 Consider these statistics:
* Seven baby boomers will turn 50 every minute until 2014, according to American Demographics magazine.
* People over 50 have half the nation's disposable income, and those over 65 enjoy twice the discretionary income of people 25 to 34, according to Theodore Roszak, the author of "America the Wise: The Longevity Revolution and the True Wealth of Nations."
* The net worth of households headed by people over 60 grew by 30 percent over the last decade, double the national average, according to a recent survey by the University of Michigan.
So what's going on? Why are advertisers acting like a bunch of anti-Willie Suttons, aiming where the money increasingly isn't?
Mr. Roszak suggests that corporate America and its media are at war with the Census Bureau. In a 1998 article in Civilization, the magazine of the Library of Congress, he put it succinctly: "The young are a vanishing breed. The future lies with the old."
While war may be too strong a metaphor, and the young aren't really about to vanish, there is little doubt that the advertising industry is generally well behind the curve of America's changing demographic landscape. And the reason may lie in the demographics of the advertising business, where many decisions are made by people in their 20's and 30's who have only the vaguest notion of, or interest in, life past 50.
Ann A. Fishman, 58, the president of the Generational-Targeted Marketing Corporation in New Orleans, recalls a meeting she once had at an ad agency in New York. "I was struck by the fact that every person I met except one was young," she said. "But you can't have one age group watching the store. You wind up not being sensitive to the various generational groups."
Nowhere is the disconnect between Madison Avenue and demographic reality more obvious than inside the covers of Modern Maturity, published every other month by AARP. The magazine has two versions, for working and retired subscribers, and a total circulation of 20.5 million, the largest of any magazine and almost double each of its two closest competitors, Reader's Digest and TV Guide, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. By further comparison, Ladies' Home Journal and Good Housekeeping have a circulation of 4.5 million each; Time magazine's is 4.1 million.
But you would never guess the circulation of Modern Maturity from its advertising volume. Publications aimed at younger people -- like women's fashion magazines, or Maxim for young men, or Fast Company or Red Herring, which focus on technology, business and the Internet -- attract so much advertising that they can be as fat as phone books. But not Modern Maturity.
Some of this youth-market myopia, however, is likely to fade as the 80 million baby boomers and their money decamp into the golden years.
Bill Novelli, associate executive director of public affairs for AARP, says Modern Maturity is trying to position itself to rise with the boomer tide. In 1998, the organization ditched its old name, the American Association of Retired Persons. Surveys and focus groups show that boomers hate words like "retired" that remind them of "old." And a lot of people in their 60's and 70's don't think of themselves as old, either.
"There are big changes coming in the magazine," he said. "It's going to become more of a lifestyle magazine, more vibrant and youthful in its aim. We think we have enough elasticity to appeal to both the 55-year-olds and the 75-year-olds." Recent covers, featuring celebrities like Paul Newman, Judge Judy and Cheryl Tiegs, are signals of the changes, he said.
He also said executives are considering a switch to monthly publication, the addition of newsstand sales and, perhaps, a change in name.
The repositioning will make the magazine more boomer-friendly just as the advertising industry is about to be jerked into reality by that aging group and its buying power.
"Media buyers and media planners are young," Mr. Novelli said. "A mind change has to take place. But they are awakening."
And yet: Modern Maturity, which already charges advertisers about one-third as much per subscriber as Time does, is considering cutting its ad rates.

HEADLINE: AMERICAN SONG;
Emotion's Value

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Anthony Tommasini's article about the facile, pandering, pop-influenced, non-intellectually rigorous, sentimental new generation of American art song composers "A Sudden, Facile Flowering of American Song," June 11 has left my heart pounding in my chest.
Mr. Tommasini's compliments fall to composers whose work he describes as "abstract," "economical," "astringent," "complex," "knotty," "rigorous," "jagged," "pungent" and "lean and spiky." Ricky Ian Gordon is influenced by pop music. Horrors. Because his music is accessibly lyrical, he is seen as trying "to bridge popular and concert styles." Horrors again. Because Emily Dickinson's "Will There Really Be a Morning" is, as described by Mr. Tommasini, an "acute, unflinching poetic" reflection, it therefore suffers from the song's lack of knots, jags, spikes and astringencies. 
 "Will There Really Be a Morning" is set in a breathtaking sweep of sadness and longing by Mr. Gordon, written, undoubtedly, in a burst of emotion that disqualifies it from Mr. Tommasini's high regard. That Mr. Gordon's sophisticated and original songwriting is beautiful, and moving, and a product in part of its times is O.K. with this little pilgrim. A song need not be inaccessible, "knotty," "spiky" or "jagged" to be challenging -- or to be art.

Kristina Putalik, Amos Klausner

 BODY:
Kristina Lee Putalik and Amos Joseph Klausner were married last evening in Tarrytown, N.Y. Rabbi Abraham J. Klausner, the bridegroom's father, performed the ceremony at the Castle at Tarrytown.
The bride and bridegroom, both 28, have known each other since grade school and began dating at Byram Hills High School in Armonk, N.Y., where they grew up. They now live and work in California and are developing a Web site for entertainment and research for pre-teenage children. The bride teaches the third grade at the Park School in Mill Valley, and the bridegroom is the director of the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Graphic Arts, a professional organization. 
 The bride graduated from Connecticut College and received a master's degree in elementary education from the Bank Street College of Education. Her parents, Ann and Thomas L. Putalik, live in Armonk, where the bride's father is a management consultant and her mother is a broker for Vannier Real Estate.
The bridegroom graduated from Boston University. His mother, Judith Klausner, and father now live in Santa Fe, N.M. The bridegroom's mother is a sculptor in bronze. His father retired from Temple Emanu-El in Yonkers.
The couple became engaged last summer while hiking in the Dolomite Mountains in Italy. The bridegroom picked a bouquet of wildflowers and then presented the bride with a diamond ring that came into his father's hands at the end of World War II, when he was a United States Army chaplain in Europe.
"I was really skeptical about having an old ring, because I didn't know who had had it prior to me -- I was nervous that maybe it wasn't a happy marriage," Ms. Putalik said. "But when I heard the story of the ring, I felt so blessed, because the story to me means that two lovers were able to be together, and it brought a family back together."
The ring was originally given to Rabbi Klausner by a woman in Munich to be used in lieu of bail to obtain her husband's release from the Army Detainment Center. The rabbi secured the man's freedom without having to give up the ring, but before he could return it to the woman, the reunited couple had disappeared from Munich.
Rabbi Klausner later gave the ring to be used as a black-market payment in helping a survivor of the Holocaust find his daughter. Years later, in Israel, the man and his wife met the black marketeer who had accepted the ring as payment and bought it back from him.
In 1966, Rabbi and Mrs. Klausner, just married, traveled to Israel and visited the couple. Their hosts presented the ring to the new bride.
"It just seems that it fits," Ms. Putalik said. "This ring has survived, and our relationship has survived, and it makes sense."

TIME flies when you're having fun. Zip-zap, and suddenly the year is halfway over.
Trouble is, for most investors the last six months have not been a lot of laughs. All three major market indexes are under water for the year. 
 The last time that happened was in 1994, according to Birinyi & Associates, a stock market research firm. And the midyear tally stands in sharp relief to the first six months of 1999, when the Dow Jones industrial average was up nearly 20 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 was up almost 12 percent and the Nasdaq gained 22.5 percent.
But that's old news. The issue now is what happens from here to New Year's Eve.
Byron R. Wien, chief United States investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, took some time last week to revisit the recent past and to talk about the next six months. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. Did the market pan out in the first half as you thought it might?
 
A. From the beginning of the year, I thought the market was going to have a rough time of it. The first six months haven't been as rough as I thought they would be, but it has been a difficult market. This is the first year in the last six that it has had a difficult time.
I also thought that people would begin to take a tougher look at technology stocks. And I anticipated that the price of oil would go up to $30 a barrel and stay there. I thought that would benefit energy and oil and service stocks, and it has, but not as much as I thought.
 
Q. Some people think the Fed is about done tightening, and that the market is poised to do better when it stops. Do you agree?
 
A. I think it is naive to think the economy will slow down enough for the Fed to indicate publicly that they are done.
The Fed might move to a neutral policy position. The economy is clearly slowing as it responds to a deceleration in money supply growth, and that will take some near-term pressure off interest rates.
I don't think a recession is anywhere in sight, but I do think we are going to have slower growth and a deceleration in profit growth. But inflation is going up. So I don't think the Fed will tell investors to relax.
 
Q. Does that mean the market will remain under pressure for the balance of the year?
 
A. Since the market's performance in the first half was a bit better than I had anticipated, it means the second half will be a little worse than I had hoped. By the end of the year, I expect the major averages will be within 10 percentage points of where they finished in 1999. Basically, this is not going to be a big money-making year.

Q. Do you expect more market volatility?
 
A. I don't know if conditions will be as volatile as they were, but I expect volatility to stay high.
The volatility we have seen is not due to the Fed, which is doing what is expected. It has to do with the fact that people are trying too hard. They are used to making a lot of money in the stock market, and they are impatient. They tend to migrate to where the action is, which is what creates the volatility. But there will not be a lot of discernible trends over the next six months.
 
Q. Has the correction we have seen in technology stocks made them attractive buys?
 
A. I own a lot of technology stocks, and I like a lot of technology stocks, but it is hard for me to say there are a lot of outstanding values here. Even the technology stocks I bought recently, JDS Uniphase and Brocade, are not cheap. Intel, another favorite of mine, is not cheap.
 
Q. Are there stocks you think should do well over the next six months or more?
 
A. I still think energy stocks will do well. I think there are some opportunities in old-economy stocks, including financials. Biotechnology and health care companies intrigue me. And hospital management companies are undervalued, even though they have come back a bit.
As far as individual names are concerned, in hospital management I like Columbia/ HCA HCA -- the Healthcare Company , Tenet Health Care and Health Management Associates. Immunex is a biotech company I like. And in energy I like Tosco, Exxon Mobil and BP Amoco.
 
Q. Will the results of the November election matter to the stock market?
 
A. The only way the election could have an impact is if the same party wins control of both the White House and Congress. If that happens it would be bad. The status quo has been fine for financial markets.
It would be bad because if Gore wins and the Democrats take the House, his spending programs will be negative for the market. And if Bush wins and the Republicans keep control in Congress, his tax program will go through. But it will be too stimulative and result in additional tightening.

Off the Managed-Care Treadmill

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Jennifer Steinhauer covers health care for The Times. Her column on the economics of health care appears the first Sunday of each month.
E-mail: jestei@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
JOSEPH HADDAD, a pediatric ear, nose and throat doctor in Manhattan, said he realized how dropping out of managed care was paying off for him as he sat watching his son's preschool graduation. Dr. Haddad's workload has shrunk markedly -- 20 percent fewer surgical cases, a similar decline in office visits -- since he stopped abiding by the insurers' fee scales last year.
Now he is home for dinner most nights and can attend his older son's activities. "You realize how important that is when your kid keeps waving at you the whole time," he said, recalling the graduation ceremony. Ditching managed care, he said, "was really a quality-of-life issue." 
 A number of doctors around the country have taken the same calculated risk in the last few years, by deciding to stop settling for what insurance would pay. They cite low reimbursement rates that forced them to make up revenue in volume, crowding their waiting rooms with patients and rushing their care. The pace and the paperwork stole too much time from their personal lives, the doctors say. And frankly, some just disliked making less money.
Most of these rebel doctors practice in cities where there are plenty of affluent patients who can pay cash or who have access to old-fashioned indemnity insurance that simply reimburses the patient for most of the bill. Doctors in suburbs where managed care has all but cornered the health insurance market have less scope to drop out.
Barney Softness, a pediatrician on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, decided last year to tell his managed-care patients -- who made up about one-third of his busy practice -- that he would no longer accept their insurance. Half left immediately, and he finished the year on a sour financial note. But he was happy.
"A great benefit was, it was much quieter," Dr. Softness said. He and his partners were able to reduce the number of patients each saw in an hour to just four, from five or six under managed care. "We had time to do it right," he said.
Then something happened: The lost patients started coming back. "Some said, 'It is worth it to us,' " Dr. Softness said, "the implication being that they were getting mill-like treatment." Now, he said, "we are back to being as busy as we were." If it gets too busy, he said, he may have to stop accepting new patients.
As it happens, I have firsthand experience of the changes in Dr. Softness's practice: My own baby has been seen by his partners since shortly after they dropped the plans. Care was great, service speedy at first; lately, I've been kept waiting from 10 to 40 minutes, though once we get into an examination room, I still feel that my child is the only one the doctor is seeing that day. I'm a loyal fan.
And yet, my own primary-care doctor, who accepts many insurance plans, never makes me wait, and never rushes me either.
In fact, few patients feel that their doctors neglect their care as a result of insurance company pressures, according to a new survey by the Center for Studying Health System Change, an independent research organization in Washington. The study, based on interviews with 59,000 Americans, found that while 44 percent thought that the companies do influence doctors' care decisions, only 7 percent said they believed doctors put insurers' interests ahead of patients' needs. The center got similar results in 1997, before the backlash against managed care had gathered steam.
The response may mean that patients are simply not aware of how stressed-out their doctors are. Or it may signal that patients do not agree with their doctors' view that quality erodes as revenues rise. Even if they do agree, most patients have little choice: few earn enough to afford doctors' fees on their own, and doctors say they have had to turn away patients for financial reasons. "There are a lot of interesting cases that I might want to do, but can't, because the families are constrained by their choice of insurance," Dr. Haddad said.
JONATHAN SHELDON, a family doctor in Denver who opened a no-managed-care office after working for a managed-care company in Vermont, said he has found a way around the problem. He charges patients $4 a minute. If he sees them for 10 minutes, they pay $40, which, he said, is cheaper than an office visit at most nearby clinics. "It is a win-win," he said. "I have patients who are rich and poor, and they come because they love the service."
At a clinic, a patient might pay $60 for a 10-minute visit -- or the same for an hour, making it hard to say if Dr. Sheldon's approach really optimizes care and cost for patients.
Most doctors do not have the chance to test such theories. Peter Shutkin, an internist in New Canaan, Conn., recently decided that he had had enough of Aetna. But while he may fantasize about extending the take-a-hike message to the other four plans he accepts, he knows it's no use. "Practically, I don't think it would work," Dr. Shutkin said. "I wouldn't have any patients left."

Brazilians Shine
 
Q.: Is it true that most shoeshine men around town are Brazilian?
 
A.: Actually, yes. Though the study of employment patterns in immigrant communities is an imprecise science, a study by Maxine L. Margolis, a professor of anthropology at the University of Florida, estimates that 90 to 95 percent of the shoeshine men working in the city are Brazilian. 
 Many, in fact are from the same town: Governador Valadares, a city of 250,000 in Brazil's arid interior that since the 1960's has seen a large percentage of its population migrate to New York to escape that country's economic chaos and hyperinflation. Many work long days at menial jobs like washing dishes, cleaning houses or driving livery cabs, then return home after several years with what amounts to a small fortune.
In "An Invisible Minority: Brazilians in New York City" (Allyn & Bacon, 1998), Ms. Margolis writes that in the 1960's, two brothers left Governador Valadares and found jobs shining shoes in Midtown. "Word filtered back of the money to be made, and by the end of the decade a small contingent of Brazilians were shining shoes in the vicinity of Grand Central Station," she writes.
"Their numbers slowly increased as networks of friends and relatives found shoeshine jobs for new arrivals in the city, and by the early 1980's this job sector, once the domain of African-Americans, was monopolized by Brazilians."
 
Getting Rid of Grit
 
Q.: What goes on inside the low, 30's-style industrial building at 110th Street and the F.D.R. Drive? The words "Manhattan Grit Chamber" are carved above the door.
 
A.: In communities like New York City, where glass, sand and gravel wash into the sewer along with storm water, a grit chamber is sometimes used to allow heavy, abrasive materials to settle before they can damage pumps or clog pipes at a water treatment facility.
Geoffrey Ryan, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection, said in the mid-30's, planners worried that grit would clog the deep underground tunnels linking sewers in Manhattan and the Bronx to the new water pollution control plant at Wards Island.
The city built two grit chambers, this one and a Beaux-Arts gem designed by McKim, Mead & White on Bruckner Boulevard in Mott Haven, the Bronx. The chambers are emptied every few days and their contents trucked to out-of-state landfill sites. They function today exactly as they did in the 1930's, Mr. Ryan said, but grit chambers were not deemed necessary for the city's 13 other water treatment plants.
 
Why Time Stands Still
 
Q.: What happened to the clock on the steeple of St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery? I used to consult it on my way to and from work, but it's been stuck at 6:05 for ages, and I wonder if it will be repaired before I retire.
 
A.: The clock was hit by lightning late last summer and hasn't ticked since, said Joan Coddington, administrator of the church. St. Mark's, built in 1799, is the city's second-oldest church building, after St. Paul's Chapel on lower Broadway (1766). The steeple wasn't added until 1828 and the carillon clock, which unlike the rest of the church is not a city landmark, dates from a renovation after a catastrophic 1978 fire.
The church still awaits an estimate of repair costs, and an insurance settlement has not been negotiated, Ms. Coddington said.
"We are a very poor church, with a congregation of about 60 people," she said. "We have no idea what it will cost. We might have to put together a public appeal."
The carillon still chimes on the quarter hour, she said, though one note sounds off key. DANIEL B. SCHNEIDER

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE;
A Plea for an 'Emerald Necklace,' But State Prefers Basic Blacktop

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY

 BODY:
A new waterfront esplanade along the East River?
Some residents see it as a possibility when the state renovates part of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive beginning next year and engineers build a temporary floating highway along the river from 53rd to 62nd Streets. 
 The state says that will not happen, but residents and politicians are demanding some kind of access on that stretch of river along with the highway project as part of the long-promised "emerald necklace" of parkland that is eventually supposed to encircle Manhattan.
Last month, Community Board 6 approved a resolution urging the State Department of Transportation, which will rebuild the deteriorated section of highway, to include "some form of waterfront esplanade that considers community concerns."
"We do badly need waterfront access in this area," said Carol Pieper, the board's district manager. She added that the City Planning Department and the New York City Economic Development Corporation had a long-stated-goal of ringing Manhattan with a seamless pedestrian and bicycle route along the waterfront. There are now many gaps along the East River, including the area in question.
The state will begin building two lanes of highway for northbound traffic on the river in 2001 so work can begin on the highway, which is capped by a overhanging structure that is leaking and needs repair, said Alex Dudley, a spokesman for the State Department of Transportation. The floating highway will be used for northbound traffic, and the existing northbound lanes will be used for southbound traffic to permit repair of the current southbound lanes.
Some community leaders think that when it is time to remove the temporary highway, many people will ask why it cannot stay.
"Personally, I'd love to see an esplanade, but not everyone agrees," said Mary Clare Bergin, president of Sutton Area Committee. She said residents of the east side of Sutton Place, directly over the river, opposed an esplanade for privacy reasons.
Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis said he doubted that the temporary roadway would become permanent, "though it would be the best of all possible worlds."
"But you never know," he said. "Many so-called temporary things, like community gardens, have become permanent fixtures after turning into a cause celebre."
Mr. Dudley said the Coast Guard and other agencies would issue permits only under the condition that the roadway be temporary, adding that it would create environmental and navigation safety hazards.
"One day, we could possibly build an esplanade there," Mr. Dudley said. "But for now, it will have to be the clasp in the emerald necklace." DAVID KIRBY

HEADLINE: Don't Get Out Much? You'll Love This Store

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
THE sight of the couple draped across the bed engaged in cozy pillow talk was more than a little disconcerting. Stumbling on the scene, one wasn't sure whether to eavesdrop, look the other way or join the lovebirds on the sheets.
Convincing as it was, this slice of life was in fact a performance, enacted by models and staged at a party last Wednesday night at the Apartment, a strenuously hip fashion and home furnishings store masquerading as a private residence. 
 A 3,000-square-foot duplex at 101 Crosby Street, where SoHo meets NoLIta, the Apartment is a showcase for furniture, cooking equipment and bathroom units by European design specialists like Boffi and Duravit. But it's also a site for vanguard fashions and accessories by the British label Not Tom Dick and Harry, and the French design team Marithe & Francois Girbaud.
The store, which feels like an animated version of Wallpaper, the British shelter magazine, represents the latest variation on retailing as theater, one in which the shop is a stage, the products props and the shopper both performer and spectator.
The concept of themed, interactive retailing was pioneered in the 90's when innovative retail operations like Niketown started staging multimedia happenings, and Recreational Equipment Inc., or R.E.I., in Seattle, offered a trail loop for bicycle test drives and a "rain room" to try out Gore-Tex slickers.
But the owners of the Apartment, Stefan Boublil and Gina Alvarez, who are married to each other, took the idea of consumer participation and refined it into an art form. Every item in the store, from the Phillipe Starck notepads on the desks and the Girbaud suede slippers at the foot of the bed to the bed itself, a walnut platform priced at $5,900, will be for sale July 1, when the store opens to the public.
At the preview party, visitors were encouraged to try things out on the spot, including the Boffi shower.
Even so, the wares seemed incidental, playing a supporting role to the action unfolding throughout the store. In the bathroom, some people removed their shoes, massaging their soles on the pebbled floor. In the kitchen, a chef from Le Gamin, a cafe in SoHo, flipped crepes in a pan. And across the room, a pair of actors staged an all-out brawl, hurling invective, along with papers and objects, to lend the evening, one supposed, a touch of gritty naturalism.
"Our idea," said Mr. Boublil, a Parisian who also maintains a career as an independent filmmaker, "was to introduce the idea of voyeurism right from the start."
The Apartment has a Web site where with a click of the mouse one can rearrange furniture on a small floor plan or look in on Chloe and Rebekka, fictional residents. But Mr. Boublil and Ms. Alvarez envisioned the store less as a partner of an Internet site and more as a variation on so-called reality entertainment. It was modeled, they said, on popular television shows like "Cops" and "The Real World," whose protagonists are ordinary people living their lives in front of the camera.
With its interactive, imitation-of-life approach to retailing, the store recalls -- and improves on -- the static model rooms of the 1970's created by Bloomingdale's and other stores to help customers envision products in a context. But in some ways the Apartment has more in common with theme parks and restaurants in exploiting consumers' fascination with simulated reality. Sniffing, tasting and touching the wares, chatting with staff and other customers, the shopper becomes an actor.
When you walk into such a store, "you take on a role in front of other individuals who are now watching you," said B. Joseph Pine II, the co-author with James H. Gilmore of "The Experience Economy" (Harvard Business School Press, 1999). The book, subtitled "Work Is Theater & Every Business a Stage," argues that in the future consumers will likely place greater value on the experience of shopping than on goods and services. "Creating an experience, by encouraging customers to act out their fantasies in a store, much as they would at a Renaissance fair, draws the customer right in," Mr. Pine said.
Some designers and merchants view the Apartment as altogether novel. But Lee Peterson, the creative director of retail strategies at Chute Gerdeman, a Columbus, Ohio, retail design company, explored the notion of store as stage a year ago, before Mr. Boublil and Ms. Alvarezdreamed up the Apartment.
At the time, Wolverine World Wide, the maker of Hush Puppies and other footwear brands, asked for a fresh concept for UP Footgear, its new mall-based stores. Chute Gerdeman responded with a Web concept called "I See Me." The idea, Mr. Peterson explained, is that you can watch yourself walk into the door of the store on the computer screen. "What's more," he said, "you can call up your friends, they can open the Web site at home, and there you'll be."
The strategy is evidently aimed at a generation for whom nothing is real until it is on television. The store's design serves to heighten the sense of reality. UP Footgear's prototype, at the new RiverTown Crossing mall in Grandville, Mich., is a loft-like setting complete with sofas, chairs, framed photos and a breakfast bar, a place that the cast of "Friends" or "Real People" might call home. "This setting goes beyond conventional lifestyle retailing," Mr. Peterson said. "It perfects the illusion that you are already living the life."
The experiment seems to be working. Blaine Jungers, the president of Hush Puppies' retail division, said, "At the Grandville mall, UP Footgear, one of eight shoe stores, ranks third in sales, just behind value-oriented retailers like Payless."
The store, he noted, "encourages people to congregate." At a second store, scheduled to open July 22 in Grand Rapids, the checkout area will be in the kitchen. "That's where people gravitate at parties," he said. "We want them to hang out, just the way they would at home."
Mr. Boublil and Ms. Alvarez would like customers to feel just as comfy at the Apartment. "We want this to be a meeting place absolutely," Mr. Boublil said, "where people lose track of the world outside."
During the Apartment party, people did just that. One couple became so absorbed in checking out the merchandise, watching other guests and being watched themselves, they seemed to forget they had left a stroller parked outside just beyond the plate-glass window. In it, their twins slumbered peacefully, attended by a security guard.
So inclined were guests to dream and loiter, one wondered how the store might shoo them out. "We're working on a strategy for that," Mr. Boublil said.
But until they have perfected it, the owners say they'll fall back on a time-honored ploy for disposing of guests. "I'll just tell them," Ms. Alvarez said brightly, "that I'm going to take a shower."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Toffs and Machiavels;
In Sports and On Screen, the British Don't Get No Respect

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IN its understated way, Britain is the Edward I. Koch of nations, endlessly wondering "How'm I doing?" But unlike Mr. Koch, the self-congratulating former mayor of New York, Britain rarely expects a positive answer. And lately, a nation that is always sensitive about perceived slights to its international status has found more than usual to be upset about.
Not only did CBS News recently report that some crime in England is far worse than in the United States, but England's soccer team ignominiously lost to Romania (Romania!) in the Euro 2000 tournament. Then, the country's No. 2 tennis player, Greg Rusedski, was blown out of Wimbledon on opening day by Vincent Spadea, an American known to British newspapers as "the world's biggest loser" because he had lost 22 of his last 22 matches. 
 And now along comes "The Patriot," a film about the American Revolution that presents the English as effete war criminals with snobby accents who herd families of fledgling Americans into barns and set them on fire, just for fun. To Britons sick of being pushed around, this obnoxious affront to retrospective pride may be the last straw.
The film hasn't even opened here yet, but the newspapers have been full of outrage at what they see as wanton disregard for the historical record. Maybe the war was dirty and violent at times, they say, but their soldiers certainly never shot children or minced around in the creepy manner of Nazi generals. And it's no accident that Mel Gibson stars in the film, they say -- he's Australian.
"As every Hollywood casting agent knows, the devil speaks with an English accent," Neil Norman wrote in The Evening Standard, deploring how "to a man, the dastardly English are presented as heartless toffs and Machiavels, war criminals and child-killers."
Why do the British persist in casting everything in terms of national pride? Shouldn't they just lighten up?
"We have a significant pride in what we achieved in the past with regard to the British empire, and we don't like to see it unfairly traduced," explained the British historian Andrew Roberts. This puffed-up feeling about the past, he said, is inextricably linked to a sadly deflated view of the present.
"What is there to be proud of?" he asked, musing crossly about the European Union. "What are we doing now? We're getting sucked into some amorphous European superstate, largely against our will. As a nation we haven't achieved much since 1945, and the things that we are rightly proud of are being taken away from us by the distortions of a foreign entertainment industry."
"The Patriot," of course, is just one in a recent series of Hollywood slights perpetrated on the British -- and more specifically, the English. There were the Englishmen in "Titanic," who battened down the hatches to prevent the declasse, mostly Irish, lower-deck passengers from escaping. Then there was Anthony Hopkins, the repellant hissing villain in "The Silence of the Lambs." And don't forget Mr. Gibson's "Braveheart," in which the English are shown raping, slaughtering and pillaging their way through 13th-century Scotland.
More worryingly, Britons don't figure in "U-571," a recent film starring Matthew McConaughey as the leader of a band of Americans on a submarine who capture the German Enigma code-making machine in World War II. In real life, the Americans didn't capture the code -- the British did.
It wasn't always this way. Before the Communists, when the Nazis were still the worst villains, World War II movies regularly showed the British and Americans working together to repel the heinous Germans.
"Up until quite recently, films made in America were on the whole quite admiring of the British and British history," said Jeffrey Richards, a professor of cultural history at the University of Lancaster. Since then, he said, the British film market has virtually disappeared, and Hollywood no longer cares whether it alienates British viewers.
THE British are feeling alienated a lot these days. But no matter what other people say about them, it's not as bad as what they say about themselves -- particularly when they lose at sports.
"We have this absurd obsession with sport," Mr. Roberts said. "Even though, since 1967, we've been beaten at all the sports we invented, after 30 years we still get into great emotional upsets. The things we should be looking at seriously are things like Britain's great economy, but instead we get into a huge tussle about whether Greg Rusedski has a good day at Wimbledon."
When the unfortunate Rusedski lost to Spadea, the hapless American who had been touring the world losing one match after another for eight months, The Times of London just couldn't control itself.
"When you are on a 22 match, world-record losing streak," it wrote, "there is only one person capable of ending your misery: a British sports star."

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD;
For a Brazilian Banker, The Highest Perch

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
THERE are the investment bankers who talk of things like deficit figures and inflation targets when discussing Brazil, Latin America's largest economy. Then there are the bankers, like Francisco Gros, who talk of Miss Piggy.
As a high-ranking executive at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Mr. Gros wrote in an online newsletter late last year that "we Brazilians suffer from what could be called 'Miss Piggy' syndrome -- we believe ourselves to be wonderful, while others, unfortunately, do not see us quite that way." 
 As one of Brazil's leading figures on Wall Street, Mr. Gros developed a reputation for talking tough. Now, however, he is toning down his approach after being named in February to one of the most coveted posts in Brazil's government, the presidency of the country's powerful development bank.
"I hope that stuff doesn't come back to haunt me," said Mr. Gros, who is 57.
He probably does not have much to worry about, given his reputation as a consummate insider among the coterie of Ivy League-educated economists, bankers and academics who have run Brazil for much of the past decade. But many other Brazilians question whether their interests are best served by a group of bankers bent on globalization.
Mr. Gros says he wants the bank to temper its worldly investing approach with a renewed emphasis on lending to small and medium-sized companies. But the bank still concentrates on supporting major companies in industries like steel and telecommunications.
Among Brazil's worldly group of financiers, perhaps no one is worldlier than Mr. Gros. The son of a French diplomat, he grew up on three continents, in Brazil, France and the United States, and attended Princeton as an undergraduate. After graduate school in economics at Columbia, he returned to Brazil and began a career in the high-flying financial circles of Rio de Janeiro.
Soon, he began playing the game of musical chairs that is familiar in Brazil, in which leading figures from the private sector accept high-profile jobs in government, then return to the private sector.
Between stints as an executive at Unibanco, one of Brazil's largest banks, and as president of Aracruz Celulose S.A., a large manufacturer of eucalyptus pulp used in paper products, Mr. Gros served twice as president of the country's central bank. He was also a partner in a small investment bank, Banco BFC S.A.
After his last term at the central bank, which ended in 1992, he returned to the private sector. He joined Morgan Stanley as its chairman for Latin America, helping to build the institution into a leading investment banking presence in the region.
Jetting between his homes in New York and Rio, Mr. Gros became a fixture on network television here, discussing the direction of the world's ninth-largest economy. His candid assessment of Brazil's challenges made him a favorite among journalists.
So few people were surprised by his appointment by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to head the National Bank for Economic and Social Development, a multilayered institution that rivals international lending organizations like the World Bank in its size. It is known as the B.N.D.E.S., its initials in Portuguese.
With the exception of Banco do Brasil S.A., another institution controlled by the government that focuses more on consumer banking, the development bank is probably the most powerful financial institution in Brazil.
"It is a banker's dream to run the B.N.D.E.S.," said Edmar Bacha, a former president of the development bank who now heads the New York office of Banco BBA-Creditanstalt. "It is the only domestic provider of long-term capital, and its size makes it one of the most powerful institutions, financial or otherwise, in the country."
The bank has the largest lending budget of any Brazilian bank, at nearly 24 billion reais, or $13.2 billion. During the Cardoso administration, which began in 1995, a fivefold increase in its government support transformed the bank from a financier of infrastructure projects into the main arm of economic policy.
As Brazil opened its economy to foreign investment and competition, the bank was there at every step. The bank guided the world's largest privatization program in the 1990's, selling some $90 billion of state assets. Often, this role put it in touch with the world's leading investment banks, which competed to handle the sales.
Under Mr. Gros's tutelage, Morgan Stanley won one such contract, serving as co-manager with Salomon Smith Barney for the $21 billion privatization of Brazil's telecommunications monopoly in 1998.
Through its investment banking unit, modeled on the International Finance Corporation, a subsidiary of the World Bank, the development bank financed many of these takeovers.
In fact, the freewheeling use of its funds, which it provided to companies regardless of their national origin, has been a major source of criticism by opponents of the government's privatization program. Last week in Brasilia, left-wing congressmen moved to limit the bank's financing capabilities in privatization deals.
"I don't see why a public institution in a poor country like Brazil is providing money to foreign companies that have cheap access to borrowing overseas," said Aloizio Mercadante, a Sao Paulo congressman from the Workers Party.
Because of the bank's big role in guiding policy, Mr. Gros will have to mitigate the tension resulting from a government seeking to rapidly modernize the economy and an opposition questioning whether Brazil is bending too far in its rush to globalization.
"Brazil is at a stage in which it needs something more than people who see the country as a balance sheet," said Clovis Rossi, a columnist for Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil's most widely read newspaper. "It may be that neo-nationalists don't help the economy to grow further, but a collection of bankers does not seem to be the best alternative."
TO be sure, Mr. Gros is not alone among high-ranking officials in having a background in international finance. The central bank president, Arminio Fraga, a close friend, is a former hedge fund manager for George Soros. Another former banker, Development Minister Alcides Tapias, is Mr. Gros's immediate superior.
"We're a cosmopolitan bunch, but that alone is not enough," Mr. Gros said. "Accepting the inevitability of an open economy and preparing Brazil for a growing global role are the challenges ahead."

HEADLINE: Business;
Renault Pins Its Survival on a Global Gamble

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
LOUIS SCHWEITZER does not look like a gambler.
Tall and lanky, a kind of Gallic Abe Lincoln, Mr. Schweitzer, 57, is a grandnephew of Albert Schweitzer and a distant cousin of Jean-Paul Sartre. Like many of the business elite of France, he is a product of L'Ecole Nationale d'Administration; he was chief of staff in the 1980's for Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, now the finance minister, and still enjoys good political connections. Mr. Schweitzer is, in short, the very model of French establishment probity. 
 Yet he now finds himself chairman and chief executive of the auto giant Renault, which likes to boast that it was built on a bet. In company lore, its founder, Louis Renault, started by winning a wager in 1898 that a Renault with an innovative crankshaft could beat a car with a bicycle-like chain drive, common at the time, up a winding road in Montmartre. Renault won.
So Mr. Schweitzer has become a gambler of sorts, too. Last year, he flew to Japan to sign a $5.4 billion deal to acquire a controlling stake in Nissan Motor after DaimlerChrysler had rejected the carmaker as unsalvageable. Mr. Schweitzer is wagering that a restored Nissan will become a solid partner in a globe-circling alliance.
Nor is Nissan his only high-stakes wager. In 1996, he ventured into Latin America, building a $1 billion factory in Brazil, the first that Renault had built anywhere in 20 years, to make its successful Megane sedan. Last year, he paid $50 million for 51 percent of the Romanian carmaker Dacia, to gain a steppingstone into Eastern Europe. He also struck a deal to manufacture Renaults in an idle factory near Moscow. And this year, he bought a controlling stake in Samsung, the bankrupt South Korean carmaker.
In the process, he has focused Renault on cars. First, he unloaded the company's foundry, bus-making divisions and Renault Automation, which makes auto factory equipment, to Fiat. In April, he sold the industrial vehicles division to Volvo, while taking a 20 percent stake in that company.
What is sobering, however, is that Renault has often lost on its biggest bets. In 1987, not long after Mr. Schweitzer joined the company, a strategy to enter North America by acquiring American Motors went sour. Six years later, after Mr. Schweitzer had become chairman, a marriage he had arranged with Volvo collapsed.
Never before, moreover, has the company had more at stake. If Mr. Schweitzer's bets do not pay off, Renault risks falling prey to a takeover, or being forced into a humiliating surrender of independence. Renault was nationalized after World War II, and while part of it was sold to private investors in the 1990's, the government retains 44 percent. Would the government stay neutral if the independence of such a national institution were threatened?
Renault once believed that the future belonged to the swift, not to the big. Today, Mr. Schweitzer says the world auto industry will one day be dominated by a half-dozen giants, like General Motors, Ford Motor, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen and DaimlerChrysler. He wants Renault to be one of them.
"If Renault survives, it will be one of the great world carmakers," said Elie Cohen, a leading French economist. "If it fails, it will disappear." Mr. Cohen, echoing other experts, said Renault was, in a sense, "condemned to take important risks, if it wanted to have a chance at survival."
The challenges are enormous. In Romania, economic progress has been dismal; at Samsung, Renault's reorganization has yet to begin. But the biggest test, most experts agree, will be in Japan. If Nissan, a stumbling, debt-ridden company, fails to revive in Japan and in the United States, the burden on Renault could prove unsustainable.
"The future of Renault is being played out in Tokyo," Mr. Cohen said.
FEW people would have predicted all this when Mr. Schweitzer took over in 1992. Then, Renault was struggling with bad quality, a narrow product line and an overreliance on the French market. A few years before, without huge infusions of taxpayer money, Renault would have gone under or been taken over -- if anyone had wanted to buy it.
Today, the company is among Europe's leaders in building cars cheaply and has largely overcome its quality problems. Models like the Scenic minivan are among Europe's most reliable. "They are looked upon much more seriously today by the German manufacturers," said Stephen Reitman, who follows Renault at Merrill Lynch in London.
The changes have meant profits. Renault's operating profit, before absorbing Nissan's losses, is strong, reaching 1.48 billion euros, about $1.4 billion, in 1999. It faced a loss of 330 million euros from Nissan last year, and that will hit 376 million euros just in the first half this year. Renault's stock price has gyrated accordingly. After soaring in January to a 52-week high of 54.95 euros, it fell to 38.60 in February and recovered to 51.80 in late May. But it has since slipped to 47.6 euros. Most analysts, not surprisingly, have adopted a wait-and-see attitude about the company's prospects.
Still, the transformation of Renault reflects deep changes in France. As the government privatizes industries, executives like Mr. Schweitzer, steeped in traditional business practices, have learned to compete in a brasher, riskier climate.
Mr. Schweitzer's analysis of Renault's situation was simple: The breakdown of his proposed marriage with Volvo resulted in large part from continued government control of Renault, which Volvo shareholders felt was a threat to independence in making business decisions.
Moreover, with Renault factories running at low capacity, cars were pricey; the slightest market downturn led to losses, as happened in 1996, three years after the Volvo breakup, when Renault had a net loss of just over $1 billion.
Mr. Schweitzer began by pushing the government to slash its stake. Helped by the election in 1993 of a conservative prime minister, Edouard Balladur, Mr. Schweitzer induced the government to cut its holdings to 52 percent, then to relinquish control by dropping to 44 percent.
That was only the beginning. In 1996, to bring down costs, Mr. Schweitzer hired the man who, if all bets pay off, will probably be his successor: Carlos Ghosn.
Mr. Ghosn, now 46, had been the boy wonder at Michelin, the tire maker. When he was still in his 20's, he built Michelin's business in Latin America amid volatile national economies and, in Brazil, a soaring inflation rate. In 1990, he steered the merger of Michelin in North America with Uniroyal Goodrich. Though his methods earned him the title of "le cost-cutter," colleagues recall human touches. When a Goodrich factory in Ardmore, Okla., was switched to multiple shifts, Mr. Ghosn (rhymes with loan) contacted local ministers, patiently explaining why some Sunday school teachers might not be available every week.
Asked recently why he joined Renault, Mr. Ghosn showed his hunger to be tested. "Renault, in Europe, is a prestigious name, with a very good history," he said. "But I have always had an intuition that you don't join a company when things are good. You join when there are challenges, to earn your position."
MR. GHOSN'S recipes are classic. In purchasing, he cut the number of suppliers, to reduce administrative costs. In engineering, he created teams to develop products. In manufacturing, he reduced the number of models per plant and negotiated more flexible shifts. His plan was to save 20 billion francs -- $2.8 billion today -- in three years. "We delivered it," he said.
Nigel Griffiths, an analyst at Standard & Poor's DRI in London, said one of Renault's greatest strengths was its use of manufacturing capacity, which he put at over 90 percent, close to American levels. "Far better than the average in Europe," Mr. Griffiths said.
Mr. Ghosn's arrival signaled to workers and shareholders that "this company has changed," said Philippe Martinez, head of the leftist labor union at Renault, Confederation Generale de Travail. "It was good for the owners, but the message was political. It was a culture shock."
It was Mr. Ghosn who provoked the first test of Renault's independence. In 1997, he decided to close a factory at Vilvorde, Belgium, cutting 3,000 jobs. Renault workers in France and Belgium took to the streets, and the recently elected Socialist prime minister of France, Lionel Jospin, begged Mr. Schweitzer to reverse the decision. Mr. Schweitzer said no.
For many people, Vilvorde reflects just how much Renault has changed. Once a union stronghold, the company by 1997 had stopped being a social laboratory where politicians tested labor reforms before introducing them nationwide. Mr. Schweitzer's predecessor, Raymond Levy, signaled the change in 1992, closing Renault's oldest plant, at Billancourt, on an island in the Seine near Paris. The plant had long been a symbol of French labor militancy: in 1968, when students protested in Paris, Mr. Schweitzer's cousin Jean-Paul Sartre stood at Billancourt's gates to call auto workers to join them. But at Vilvorde, the unions ultimately accepted the inevitable. It was Renault's last major labor unrest.
THE changes at Renault say much about Mr. Schweitzer's own evolution. His experience has enabled him to manage both politics and business. Mr. Cohen, the economist, says a peculiar blend of French culture and Protestant ethic enabled him to make painful decisions. "He lost friends on the left," Mr. Cohen said, adding that "he is a man totally identified with Renault."
A French executive who has known Mr. Schweitzer since college days calls him a "quintessentially French mind: conceptual, yet not lost in fantasies; able to decide."
Indeed, Mr. Schweitzer and the Brazilian-born Mr. Ghosn worked hand in glove, despite enormous personal differences. Mr. Schweitzer is an expert in numbers; Mr. Ghosn received his degree from L'Ecole des Mines, a top engineering school, though he later earned a doctorate in economics at the University of Paris. While Mr. Schweitzer had been chief aide to a Socialist prime minister, Mr. Ghosn had always been in business. And the cerebral strain in Mr. Schweitzer contrasts with Mr. Ghosn's Latin exuberance.
 Yet the success of the two men would probably have been impossible without the artistic flair of a third.
In 1987, when Mr. Schweitzer was chief financial officer, Renault hired a new chief designer, Patrick Le Quement, whose talent shaped the education of Louis Schweitzer -- and the transformation of Renault.
Born in France and educated in Britain, Mr. Le Quement earned a reputation as one of Europe's most daring designers while working in the 1980's for Ford and Volkswagen. He joined Renault, he said, because of its tradition of risk taking. "When you're a kid, you have your favorite Dinky toys," he said in an interview, referring to the toy cars known by generations of young English boys. "Mine were Renault."
His first task was to complete the design of a diminutive model, later dubbed the Twingo. Mr. Le Quement took an earlier design, widened it and gave it headlights like frogs' eyes and a snoot that made it look, he said, "like a pet: in winter you don't want to leave it outside; you place it next to the fireplace."
The design polarized management. Some, like Mr. Schweitzer, hated it, though he now says his objection was to the way the project was financed. In a desperate appeal to the chairman at the time, Raymond Levy, Mr. Le Quement said he wrote that "the biggest risk with the car was to take no risk." Mr. Levy agreed.
By 1994, Renault was selling little Twingos about as fast as it could make them, nearly 20,000 a month. Under Mr. Le Quement, other remarkable models followed, including the Scenic, a micro-minivan that has also been a big seller.
By the mid-1990's, when Renault decided to revive its luxury car line, Mr. Schweitzer was easily won over to a daring design based on a concept car called the Avantime, a futuristic sedan with an oddly truncated rear end and wraparound rear window.
Not only are Renault's designs changing, but so is the way they are put together. Mr. Le Quement's office, adorned with bright canvases, has for two years been in Renault's new $785 million Technocentre, which opened in 1998 on former farmland west of Paris. In its central wing, La Ruche (the hive), and adjacent wing, Le Diapason (the tuning fork), experts from design and research, vehicle engineering, purchasing and product cost analysis -- once scattered over 50 sites -- work jointly to bring down costs and development time. Renault's successful subcompact, the Clio, took 40 months to develop before it was introduced in 1991; recent models have taken 36 months, and the target is 20.
As for shopping for a partner in Asia, Mr. Schweitzer says the idea was born during the Asian economic crisis. "We saw an opportunity," he said. Nissan "was fundamentally a sound company, with good products."
The process was accelerated in 1998 when Daimler-Benz announced its takeover of Chrysler. "This was an electric shock in the industry," Mr. Ghosn said. "It was obvious for us that we had to connect fast."
The next year, Renault took its stake in Nissan, and Mr. Ghosn was dispatched to revive it. Now chief operating officer at Nissan, he will become president this summer, the first foreigner to assume such a prestigious role at a major Japanese corporation.
At Nissan, Mr. Ghosn has set clear goals, and his record for meeting objectives is enviable. By the end of 2002, he said, 22 new models are planned, including four in Japan later this year. By the end of 2003, he wants to cut Nissan's debt by half, from $16.8 billion at the end of March. And he expects the company to be profitable in the current fiscal year, which ends next March, after losses in seven of the last eight years.
Change is also apparent elsewhere in the global operations. Today, Mr. Schweitzer says Renault is focusing on distribution. It is the European leader in shrinking order-to-delivery times, building about half its cars to order and delivering them in six to eight weeks. The goal, at least in Europe, is to make three-quarters of its cars to order and to deliver them in 14 days, matching what the Japanese often do in their home market. In April, to cut purchasing costs, it joined Covisint, the online marketplace set up by G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler to consolidate the search for parts and services.
Mr. Schweitzer said he wanted to emphasize different Renault brands in different markets, making Renault strongest in Europe and Latin America; Nissan (and its Infiniti luxury division) in North America; Nissan and Samsung in Asia; and Dacia in Eastern Europe and emerging markets. It is not a novel recipe. Volkswagen supplemented its VW and Audi brands by snapping up Skoda in the Czech Republic and Seat in Spain. Yet unlike Volkswagen's cars, Renault's brands do not compete with one another. "Why buy a Volkswagen at German prices," Mr. Cohen said, "when you can get a Skoda, the same car, at Czech prices?"
Mr. Schweitzer says Renault's plans are on track, though much work remains. In Europe, Renault and Nissan have begun melding their sales organizations, but the bulk of reorganization is still ahead at Dacia and Samsung. In Latin America, Nissan models will be produced at Renault plants, and Mr. Ghosn says that by 2010 he wants 10 common platforms, or underbodies, so that the companies can build Renaults and Nissans everywhere, while maintaining the look, feel and identity of their separate brands. Nissan alone currently has some two dozen platforms, none of them shared with Renault or other brands.
THE investment in Nissan has already paid off handsomely. Mr. Reitman of Merrill Lynch calculates that Renault's stake is now worth roughly 8.25 billion euros, or $7.8 billion, 65 percent more than Renault paid for it.
One bottleneck could be finding managers to run all the operations. Mr. Reitman says one reason for selling the industrial-vehicles division to Volvo was to free up Renault management. To replace Mr. Ghosn when he left for Nissan, Mr. Schweitzer lured a senior Volkswagen executive, Pierre-Alain De Smedt, a Belgian who was chief executive of VW's Seat division.
But that was an exception. Local talent is crucial to Mr. Schweitzer's concept, for despite all of Renault's globalization -- the common language of executive meetings and reports is now English, which Mr. Schweitzer speaks fluently -- he misses no occasion to stress his appreciation of national qualities.
"I think car companies need roots," he said, since "there are links between products, company culture and the nationality of the group."
The heart of his vision is the link with Nissan. "We are talking about a binational group," he said, adding that such a structure could be "clearly only fully productive if the two companies are working well."
"An alliance," he said, "is not a substitute for bringing your house in order."

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY;
The Invisible Hand of Uncle Sam

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
FOR the stirring announcement that scientists have more or less succeeded in mapping the human genome, the private sector deserves a lot of the credit. The energy and innovation of one company, the Celera Genomics Group, a unit of the PE Corporation, transformed a plodding effort run by a public consortium into a feverish race. The job got done faster than expected, and lives may be saved.
But another important conclusion must be drawn from this milestone, one that is crucial to business people lately inured to such heresy. It is that Uncle Sam is not the consummate bumbler he's made out to be. 
 Forget all that stuff about Washington's irrelevance and ineptitude, slumbering bureaucrats and leaden regulations. The United States government is very good at some things, and directing the consortium that did this great deed has proved to be one of them.
That this is news testifies to the apotheosis of private enterprise in our age. To hear people talk, you'd never know it, but the federal government has played a vital role at almost every important juncture in the nation's economic development. When it has erred, it has mainly been by bending over too far backward for the private sector.
Washington didn't build the great railroads, but it did secure the continent and donate the land that made them pay. To the extent that the atom has been harnessed (and despite all that no-nukes business, it's been harnessed plenty), Uncle Sam's role was central, from the Manhattan Project to manufacturing nuclear fuel. The G.I. Bill helped create the graduates -- and the universities -- that fuel a modern technological economy. And the Interstate System of highways opened up the suburbs, for better or worse.
Even the Internet, this transforming technology, this spawner of endless cant about the heroism of entrepreneurship, was cooked up by Washington bureaucrats to connect far-flung universities working on military projects.
And now our genes.
Did Celera play an important role? Sure. It brought to bear all the hallmarks of its breed: it was nimble, smart, innovative and daring. It did things faster and cheaper. And it had the benefit of its rival's data: The government-sponsored Human Genome Project posted its results on (there it is again) the Internet, where Celera could use it to check its own work and to bridge gaps.
Now that the human genome is more or less cracked, the great puzzle is why so many Americans in business seem to think their government is good for nothing but squandering tax money. I think it is because Uncle Sam, feeling his postwar oats, dove into a series of quixotic battles that were better left unfought. The war on drugs, after all, is no more successful than the war in Vietnam or the war on poverty (though civil rights legislation has surely helped on that front). Covert intervention overseas, Watergate, the savings and loan debacle, partisan paralysis in Congress -- at every turn, it seems, our kinsman by the Potomac has worked hard to waste his accumulation of midcentury good will.
ON top of that, government by nature tends to monopolize things, and the evils of monopoly have never been more apparent. Competition works: FedEx and the United Parcel Service have surely forced the Postal Service to do better, and the mere threat of vouchers has improved many a public school. Celera's aggressive approach lit a fire under the government-backed consortium, and we are all better off for it.
Yet the idea that government can't -- or shouldn't -- do anything is hubristic nonsense, and was recognized as such by no less than Adam Smith. If Washington is smart (stop laughing), it will both learn from and build on its genome success -- redirect farm subsidies into agricultural research, say, or expose Amtrak to competition from private passenger services, or use people's natural self-interest to construct a universal health insurance plan with built-in incentives to hold down costs.
The trick is being sensible, not dogmatic, about which things government can do and which it should leave to business. With the genome project, at least, Uncle Sam reminded us that he is capable of being more than just an expensive umpire.

Long Shots, on the Court and Off

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
FOR Terry Mollner, a pillar of socially responsible investing who made a run at acquiring Ben & Jerry's Homemade this spring, the triumph of the United States and its economic system remains incomplete. "It's been more than 10 years since the end of the cold war, and there's been no bright light shone on how to improve capitalism," he said in a recent interview on the upstairs porch of his tidy frame house here. "It's about time we got around to it."
For him, the answer is to make capitalism more cooperative. Instead of rival corporations, he envisions a business world in which companies band together to push for legislative changes and to raise standards -- for workers, for the environment. For many people, Schumpeter or Adam Smith are economic role models; Mr. Mollner brings up Mahatma Gandhi. "We live in denial that a strong cooperative context is essential in our society," he said. 
 Ben & Jerry's is a rare example of a company that cares about such things, says Mr. Mollner, a onetime Jesuit seminarian who is now president of the Trusteeship Institute, an economic think tank in this Massachusetts college town. For him, trying to rescue the company from the capitalist maw wasn't a business decision or an ego move. It was a mission. And though he failed to buy it, he still won a seat on the board.
Mr. Mollner led a late-starting charge to preserve the company and all that it stood for beyond Cherry Garcia. Mr. Mollner wanted to hold on to the socially responsible aspects of the company -- ideals like helping the world's disenfranchised by making them suppliers or partners -- that he feared might disappear if Ben & Jerry's was consumed by a large corporate suitor.
When he heard that the company was considering offers, he swung into action. With bids from ice-cream behemoths like Unilever and Dreyer's already being considered, Mr. Mollner thought an alternative was needed. "I heard the board was going to vote to sell the company to Dreyer's," he recalled. "I had to stop it."
No latecomer to the world of finance, Mr. Mollner was born in 1944 in Omaha, where his father ran a butcher shop on the south side of town as Warren E. Buffett's father was running one on the north side. He helped formulate investing strategy for the Calvert family of mutual funds and remains a director of two funds.
He is also a notoriously nervy basketball player, with a style that epitomizes his willingness to embrace huge odds. Seth Goldman, who worked with Mr. Mollner at Calvert before becoming a co-founder of Honest Tea, a two-year-old iced-tea company in Bethesda, Md., recalled one game. "He would make these shots from beyond the three-point line, almost midcourt," he said. "And they went in more than they went out."
Mr. Mollner began his quest to buy Ben & Jerry's by appealing directly to Ben Cohen, a co-founder. Then, with Mr. Cohen's blessing, he put together a group of investors that included Anita Roddick, president of Body Shop, and Bob Barton, chief executive of the Catalyst Financial Group, a Vermont venture capital firm.
Judy Wicks, vice chairwoman of the Social Venture Network, a group of entrepreneurs and investors concerned about social justice and the environment, was the first person Mr. Mollner called. "Terry has an exceptional ability to bring people together around shared values and move toward a common goal," Ms. Wicks said. "He can see and articulate the big picture."
Eventually, Unilever, Mr. Cohen and Meadowbrook Lane, as Mr. Mollner's group became known, joined to offer $38 a share for Ben & Jerry's. Ben & Jerry's board members viewed Mr. Mollner's group variously as a white knight or a fly in the ointment, but the board approved the offer. Then came complaints and lawsuits from shareholders, who felt that money had been left on the table in the interests of perpetuating the Ben & Jerry's way. Finally, on the night of April 7, all the competing groups were told to put their best offers forward. Mr. Mollner and his group, gathered around the huge conference table in Unilever's New York headquarters, decided they were through.
"There was a beautiful moment when I said, 'It's an auction, and we can't compete', " Mr. Mollner remembers. "We called our partnership the Hot Fudge Family. So I said, 'Let's all put our hands on the table and let go of the Hot Fudge Family.' And we did. The partnership was dead."
Unilever agreed on April 12 to pay $326 million for the company. Although Ben & Jerry's partisans, especially Mr. Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, his co-founder, feared they had sold out their principles, all was not lost. Unilever offered seats on the board to Mr. Mollner and another person, still to be named, from the Meadowbrook Lane partnership. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Greenfield will remain on the board. Unilever is setting aside money to help develop minority-owned businesses, and Mr. Cohen has been put in charge of conducting "social audits" of Unilever's businesses worldwide. That job got a lot bigger with the company's $20.3 billion purchase last month of Bestfoods.
"We're all in this together," said Mr. Mollner, who feels that he lost the battle for Ben & Jerry's but won part of a larger war. "Cooperation is fundamental. You can't not be doing it."

New Questions About Block's Lucrative Tax Loans

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
THE carefully constructed image of H & R Block as America's trusted tax preparer was marred a decade ago, when consumer advocates accused the company of marketing advances on customers' tax refunds at usurious interest rates.
Critics said flat fees for the two-week loans disguised annual rates as high as 250 percent. Plaintiffs' lawyers filed a host of class action lawsuits. 
 Block is on the verge of resolving the litigation this month without admitting any wrongdoing. But critics of the proposed settlement call it a sham, saying Block has effectively hired lawyers to sue it on the company's own -- extremely favorable -- terms.
And the court proceedings have brought to light details of Block's business practices that the supreme courts of two states, and other judges, found sufficiently egregious to warrant trials on whether the company had betrayed its clients' trust.
A Maryland state judge, for example, found that Block deliberately confused customers by training its tax preparers to never use the word loan and instead to sell "two-day refunds." Indeed, company documents and testimony by Block officials in various lawsuits show that Block, whose 9,000 offices prepare one in seven income tax returns each year, was far more deeply engaged in the high-cost loan business than its customers or even its critics realized.
Block, for example, has always emphasized that rather than make the loans itself, it helps customers obtain them from lenders -- now exclusively Household Bank, and before that mainly Beneficial Finance, which Household's parent company bought last year. Federal law prohibits income tax preparers from making loans to customers, a rule intended to prevent collusion between taxpayers and tax preparers.
But the court records show that Block since 1992 has had an ownership interest in the loans; last year, it retained a 49.9999999 percent interest -- ownership, in other words, of just one penny shy of half of every $10 million in loan profits. By holding less than a 50 percent interest in the loans, Block complies with the anti-collusion rules.
Plaintiffs' lawyers say that stake, which was not disclosed to customers until earlier this year -- when Block began acknowledging an unspecified interest in the loans -- may explain why the company did not solicit bids for lower rates on its clients' behalf.
Instead, the costs increased starting in the 1995 tax year, when the Internal Revenue Service, worried about fraud tied to refund loans, suspended its system of providing early notification to lenders on whether it would honor a taxpayer's refund request. That increased the risk of unpaid loans, Block says, forcing the company to raise fees to as high as $89, from what had been as little as $29, depending on the size of the loan.
Effectively, that increased the interest rate on many refund advances to more than 500 percent on an annualized basis -- roughly what Mafia loan sharks in New York charge their best customers, according to a senior official in the New York Police Department. In some cases, processing delays raised the effective cost of loans to as much as 1,500 percent.
THIS year, with the I.R.S. again providing early indications on refunds, Block says that loan fees were cut by 40 percent over all, and that it experimented in a few areas with no-fee loans.
The court records show some customers receive their loan proceeds only a few days faster than if they had waited for the I.R.S. to deposit the money directly into a checking account -- at no charge.
In one of the lawsuits, Jenny Lillis, a Block executive who at the time was in charge of placing advertising, testified in 1995 that "it's the client's choice, any individual's choice, to spend whatever amount of money they want in order to get their refund money back from the government."
Besides its undisclosed half-interest in the loans, Block also secretly collected fees from its banking partners on each loan, according to the court records, beginning at $3 in 1989 and rising to $9 by 1997. That year, the company began disclosing the $9 fee in fine print, after a Texas court ruled that the banks' payments to Block, if hidden, could violate the state's commercial bribery statutes.
The refund loans produced 8 percent of Block's total profits last year, their peak contribution in the three years that the company has broken out such results. Block, based in Kansas City, Mo., reported net income of $19.1 million from the loans -- a profit margin of 21.1 percent. Refund loans accounted for 3.5 percent of 1998 profits and 5.5 percent of 1997 profits.
Block says it always acted properly in arranging the refund anticipation loans. Clients, many of them repeat borrowers, have taken out 30 million of the loans since 1989 -- proof, the company says, of customer satisfaction.
The court cases, the company added in a statement, "are typically driven by a small group of aggressive lawyers, not by dissatisfied customers."
But Block has defended itself aggressively, too, and the company has never lost a lawsuit over the loans.
For instance, its chief litigator, N. Louise Ellingsworth of the Bryan Cave law firm in St. Louis, obtained court orders barring lawyers in one case from sharing knowledge with the lawyers in other cases, which meant long delays as testimony was taken and re-taken from the same Block and Household executives.
Both Ms. Ellingsworth and a spokesman for her law firm repeatedly declined to comment on any aspect of the lawsuits.
In September 1997, efforts began to settle the litigation -- but not with the lawyers who had been in hot pursuit of the company.
That month, testimony shows, lawyers for Beneficial met with three Chicago area attorneys, one of whom was suing the lender over refund advances it made for clients of Jackson Hewitt Tax Services, a Block competitor that was subsequently acquired by the Cendant Corporation.
Seven months later, these lawyers filed two new lawsuits, one against Beneficial and Block, the other against only Beneficial. The cases against Beneficial went nowhere, and in January 1999, Block's lawyers persuaded Judge William B. Zagel of the United States District Court in Chicago to dismiss the suit against it.
Within days, though, Block and Beneficial resumed talks with the Chicago lawyers. None of the lawyers on either side would say what prompted the conversations, but they occurred soon after a series of decisions against Block.
Among the most important were rulings by the supreme courts of Maryland and Texas that loan customers' claims could be tried as class actions. Ms. Ellingsworth had argued that each customer should have to sue Block individually -- a procedure that would have discouraged lawyers from pursuing the cases, because filing fees alone would exceed the damages that could be recovered by any one customer.
In addition, a New York judge ruled that Ms. Ellingsworth had engaged in "patently deceptive" and manipulative conduct that obstructed judicial proceedings. Block's lawyers had to pay almost $41,000 in damages to lawyers suing the company for time they spent fighting this conduct; later, a New York appeals court barred Ms. Ellingsowrth and a colleague from representing Block in the case.
In court, Ms. Ellingsworth argued that she had always acted in good faith and that the actions that offended the New York judges were Block's, not hers.
By last July, Block and Beneficial had reached agreement with the Chicago lawyers on the outlines of a settlement intended to resolve the refund loan cases around the country. One of the plaintiff's lawyers, Daniel Harris, agreed to revise his pending case to serve as the vehicle for the agreement -- though Block, which had already been dismissed from that suit, had to ask the court to reinstate it as a defendant.
Soon after, Mr. Harris sent a copy of his draft to Ms. Ellingsworth. She faxed him a response, saying she would be making her revisions in red ink.
"It struck me as out of line for her to do that," said Mr. Harris, who described that the sequence of events as "kind of weird." Nonetheless, he said, he adopted some of his adversary's changes -- though Ms. Ellingsworth, he added, angrily complained that he had not incorporated them all.
LAST December, Judge Zagel gave preliminary approval to the settlement. In February, he issued an order freezing all the other cases around the country, several of which were about to go to trial.
Under the proposed settlement, Block and Household each have agreed to put up half of a $25 million fund that would pay $15 to each individual or married couple who took out a refund loan, so long as no more than 1.67 million claims were filed. If there were more claims, the size of each payment would be reduced. Any unclaimed money would revert to Block and Household.
So far, more than one million claims have been filed, though lawyers critical of the settlement say the number would be greater if the window for filing claims was not restricted to a period when most people are not thinking about taxes: from April 17, the last day of the most recent tax filing season, till Dec. 17, which is before the next season begins.
Block and Household also agreed to pay a total of $4.25 million to Mr. Harris and the three other law firms that ultimately negotiated the settlement.
Judge Zagel has scheduled a hearing for July 11 to hear objections to the settlement and could issue his final O.K. of the plan then.
Of the lawyers with suits pending against Block, at least 13 are opposing the settlement, arguing that the company had essentially hired counsel to sue on the terms it wanted. Roger Kirby, a New York lawyer with cases pending against Block in Brooklyn and Manhattan, said the company "held a silent auction with only one bidder."
Edward M. Carstarphen, a Houston lawyer with a class action case awaiting trial in Texas, said that under the state's commercial bribery laws, Block was at risk for $1.2 billion in his case alone. Block lawyers dismiss such figures as wild fantasy.
John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor retained as an expert by the lawyers opposing the settlement, calls the proposed deal "pathologically flawed" and contrary to two recent United States Supreme Court rulings on fairness in class action settlements.
Mr. Coffee, in an affidavit, said that since Block had won dismissal of an earlier lawsuit brought by Mr. Harris's three co-counsels, those lawyers were not hired guns representing clients but instead had been "disarmed to the point that they resembled pacifists."
Judge Zagel has said he sees no merit in Professor Coffee's argument.
Household Bank, in court papers, has said that the proposed settlement resulted from "extensive and difficult arms-length negotiations that spanned nine months."
"These protracted negotiations, conducted in utmost good faith, entailed considerable give-and-take on both sides," said the bank, a unit of Household International of Chicago, "and ultimately yielded a settlement that confers a substantial benefit on the class."
Block, in a statement, said the settlement is a good deal both for its shareholders and its refund anticipation loan customers, because it "will include all R.A.L. customers, end all current R.A.L. litigation and discourage future litigation."
Initially, Mr. Harris, the Chicago lawyer, twice refused to be interviewed about his discussions with the company's lawyers. "I have to ask Block," he explained each time. Then Mr. Harris called a reporter back and said he wanted to be interviewed about the reasons that the settlement "is a good deal" for refund loan customers, given "how weak the claims are."
"This litigation has been going on for years, and it has not been very successful," Mr. Harris noted.
He said his client, DeCarlo Turner, a municipal worker in Dolton, Ill., was wronged when she was told that a refund loan would cost $29 and Beneficial later tacked on a $20 paperwork fee at the loan closing. "It was a bait-and-switch," Mr. Harris said. But he added that it was unclear how many people were damaged in this way and if they could be identified -- which made pursuing a class action case problematic.
Nor, he said, was it clear that Block had done anything wrong by collecting fees from the banks.
"Is it illegal for Beneficial to pay Block a portion of the finance charge?" Mr. Harris said. "Is that a kickback? That depends," As for other lawyers who pressed the argument, "it was an issue that was frequently, often, generally, lost, because it is about a relationship between Block and its customers," he asserted. "It is not a lawyer-client matter that is a fiduciary relationship as a matter of law, so trying to prove that on a classwide basis would be kind of impractical."
MR. HARRIS said there were other weaknesses in the plaintiffs' cases, too, including questions about whether some cases were too old to be eligible for recompense. But he acknowledged that until Beneficial initiated the settlement discussions, he had not questioned anyone under oath about the refund loans and had not examined any internal bank documents.
The settlement of the lawsuits over refund advances would come as Block is trying to transform itself into a full-service financial company selling investment advice, retirement plans and accounting to the mainly working-class and middle-class Americans who are the prime market for its tax preparation services.
Last year, Block acquired Olde Financial, a brokerage firm, along with a mortgage company and the nation's seventh-largest accounting firm. The company's chairman and co-founder, Henry W. Bloch, 77, plans to retire in September; active leadership of the company is scheduled to fall to its president, Mark A. Ernst, a former American Express executive who has championed the full-service strategy.
The refund loan business, Block has said in securities filings and court papers, is aimed at low-income people. While Block and its banking partners describe the loans as a benefit to their customers, an internal memo filed in court showed that at Beneficial, at least, there had been debate about the propriety of the loans.
ELAINE KUNTZ, who at the time worked for Beneficial, recounted in the 1995 memo how she had dressed down a colleague for describing the refund anticipation loan clients as "one step above pond scum." The true picture, she wrote, was of a person "one step away from financial disaster."
"The entire concept of this R.A.L. program is appealing to the poor, the destitute and the desperate," Ms. Kuntz wrote. "Even the most desperate customers I have interviewed have expressed dismay at the prices" charged for the loans, "but they have resignedly acquiesced because of their financial plight."
Household Bank said it had no comment on the memo.
Ms. Kuntz wrote that the "average fiscally sound person" would not take out a high-interest loan to get his own money back from the government.
Indeed, the refund loan business depends on people ignoring a truism of financial planning: Avoid tax refunds, because they represent interest-free loans to Washington.
Documents in the court records show that when President George Bush lowered payroll withholding rates in 1992, Block contacted its refund loan customers to show them how to increase their withholding back to the old levels. Linda MacDougall, a Block spokeswoman, explained that many customers want large refunds, regarding them not as a lost opportunity to use their money sooner, but as "their annual bonus check" from the government.
Mrs. Lillis, the Block advertising executive, testified in one of the lawsuits that Block's research found that many customers judged the company's competence by the size of their refund.
Block has continued looking for ways to increase profits from its refund loan customers.
This year Block began its Refund Rewards program, offering a prepaid Mastercard to customers due tax refunds. Refund Rewards also offers discounts on automobiles, air travel and other goods and services that Ms. MacDougall, the Block spokeswoman, described as "valuable benefits" to help people stretch their tax refunds.
Like debit cards, the prepaid charge cards allow customers to draw down their refund loan proceeds as they make purchases. But if the balance slips below $50 for 60 days, Block closes the account and refunds the balance -- after deducting a $19.95 fee.
Steve Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit advocacy group in Washington, said the prepaid card was a bad deal and appeared to be designed to create status for people who could not otherwise qualify for a credit card.
"It would be far more sensible for taxpayers to take the refund and deposit it in a checking or savings account," he said, "than to let Block earn interest on their money."
 
The Cost of Getting a Rapid Refund
NANCY L. HAESE of Kingsville, Tex., and Lynn Carnegie of Manhattan are each suing H & R Block on behalf of everyone in their states who took out a loan through the company's Rapid Refund program.
Block says its Rapid Refund slogan refers to the electronic filing of income tax returns; people who want their money even sooner can also obtain a Refund Anticipation Loan for an extra fee.
But the two women say Block tricked them into paying for loans they did not want or need. Their cases are among those that are frozen under an agreement that Block reached in Chicago to settle all claims over its loan business.
Mrs. Haese, a nurse, had her family's taxes done at a Block office near her workplace in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Her understanding, she testified, was that "Rapid Refund" meant that "Block had computers and they put it into their computer and I thought it went directly to the I.R.S.'s computer."
Block says the word "loan" appears on the documents that she and her husband, Ronald, signed each year. So it is hard to believe, the company contends, that they did not know they were taking out short-term loans for fees that in 1995 reached $89 of the couple's refund.
Mrs. Haese said she never read the documents, but just signed her name at each place that the tax preparer indicated.
In her case, Ms. Carnegie, a hospital office worker, testified that she had heard about how electronic filing of an income tax return could speed a refund. So in 1995 she went to a Block office on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to have her tax return prepared, intending to use her refund to pay her tuition at Pace University.
Ms. Carnegie said that when she returned home, she read over her papers and realized that Block had sold her not only electronic filing, but also a loan that would put her tax refund in her hand before she needed it -- and only a few days before she would have received it even without the loan.
Eager to avoid an unnecessary expense, Ms. Carnegie said she called Block to cancel the loan less than an hour after leaving the company's office. She was told, she said, that it was too late. Block ended up with $110 of her $500 tax refund.
In court papers, the company says Ms. Carnegie's awareness of electronic filing showed that she was sophisticated enough to know while she was still in Block's office that she was taking out a loan. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

HEADLINE: The World: Missile Wars;
What America Calls a Defense China Calls an Offense

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
A HUGE superpower and you say you're afraid of tiny little North Korea?" snorted Sha Zukang, China's chief arms-control negotiator, in a recent interview. "We think that's ridiculous."
In truth, it's hard to find any foreign-policy expert here, in or out of government, who believes the stated American rationale for a continental anti-missile defense: that it's merely intended to stop the likes of North Korea or Iraq. 
 President Clinton has said he will decide in coming weeks, after a crucial test scheduled for July 7, whether to start building radars and 100 missile interceptors in Alaska, the first phase of a grander project.
Even westward-leaning scholars here think the new push for missile defense in Washington reflects an underlying conviction, in the American military and a strong faction of the political elite, that the United States must better prepare for battle with China.
Just as Washington has a growing coterie of politicians, ex-officials and experts who warn of an emerging "China threat," China has an even broader group of officials and scholars who think the United States is trying to hem their country in. They portray the United States as a power-drunk bully, determined to preserve its post-cold war status as the world's dominant power.
China's leaders almost certainly share suspicions about the "American threat," but they also know that their ability to shape events will remain limited until China becomes far richer and more technologically advanced. So for now they are putting more emphasis on revamping the economy than on pursuing a costly arms race.
Taiwan is the obvious flashpoint, the place where American promises and China's core goals most obviously could collide. But many experts here see American support for Taiwan as part of a broader, unstated program of containment.
"China faces an elementary reality: the United States is steadily encroaching on China, and China's means for counterattack and room for maneuver under American pressure have shrunk," wrote Wang Weiguang, an international relations expert at Beijing University, in an essay in the current issue of Strategy and Management, a mainstream policy journal.
Beyond Washington's guarantees to Taiwan, these experts point accusingly at recent American-Japanese defense guidelines that seem designed to draw Japan into any Pacific war; at American military ties elsewhere in Asia; at American use of human rights and trade disputes to keep China on the defensive, and now, at the seeming rush toward missile defenses that would neutralize China's nuclear forces and could be extended over Taiwan.
FOR the last year, as the missile defense proposal gained popularity, Washington's attention was largely on Russian objections and the need to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Only belatedly have officials seriously considered the depth of China's objections and the possible truth of its warnings that a dangerous arms race could be set off.
If Washington ignores Beijing's protests, some scholars here privately say, the always shaky support for friendly relations with the United States will be eroded. For from here, American assurances that the system is not intended to counter China simply will not wash.
"The United States has used North Korea as an excuse to build missile defenses, but now the two Koreas have improved their relations and the risk of war has dramatically declined," said Yan Xuetong, a scholar at the Chinese Institute of Contemporary International Relations, which has close ties to the government. "If the United States continues to develop a missile defense anyway, it's difficult for us to believe that it's not aimed at China," said Mr. Yan.
For the foreseeable future, the proposed missile defenses would be useful against only one country and that is China, said Shen Dingli, an expert in arms control and American studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. Russia's missile forces will remain large enough to overwhelm the system, he noted, and, realistically, no other potential enemy will have effective intercontinental missiles for many years.
Pentagon planners say that for reliable defense, three interceptors should be launched toward every incoming missile. So the 100-interceptor plan seems tailor-made to cancel out China's small force of long-range missiles, estimated by Western intelligence agencies at no more than 18 or 20.
"Even if the United States says the system is not aimed at China, the capability is aimed at China," Mr. Shen said.
China is already developing more accurate and powerful intercontinental missiles and officials here say they will do what is necessary to protect China's nuclear credibility. They would likely multiply the number of new missiles they build or put multiple warheads on new missiles, as well as deploy decoys to outwit the American defenses.
Whatever their suspicions about American goals, President Jiang Zemin and other Communist Party leaders continue to stress their desire for cooperation, and they are taking the politically risky path of further opening their economy to global competition.
LIKE American counterparts who advocate building ties between the two nations, China's leaders may hope that frictions can be contained and overwhelmed by the two nations' shared interests in prosperity.
China's leaders also know how much their power over international affairs remains constrained by China's relative backwardness, economic and military. And they seem to believe that "economic power is the most important and most essential factor in comprehensive national power," as the latest Pentagon assessment of China's military described the Chinese credo.
After the shock of the Kosovo war, which the Chinese saw as a terrible sign that the United States can take drastic measures while ignoring China, there was serious debate here about whether to accelerate the growth in military spending, which remains far below American levels. But at a key leadership meeting last summer, the senior leaders reaffirmed their priority emphasis on economic and technological development, according to the Pentagon report.
China does seek great power status and especially to become the preeminent Asian power, strong enough, in the words of the Pentagon analysis, "so that no major action will be taken by any other international actor in Asia without first considering Chinese interests."
Through sheer size and assertiveness, if not yet weaponry, China may be almost there. But America's apparent readiness to pursue a missile shield despite the evident harm to China's security would be, for many people here, one more stinging reminder of why they must make China stronger.

Mexicans Get a Chance to Define Democracy

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
CARMEN SALINAS, a popular television talk show host, was warming up a huge crowd for the party in power before a speech by its presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa. She did not emphasize his views or personality. "Labastida is the man, the good one, the winner," she said. It was all the crowd needed to hear.
In most democracies, parties nominate candidates they hope will win by persuading citizens to vote for them. But this is Mexico. And the party was the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which has governed since its founding in 1929. In that party, things work differently. 
 During the decades when the PRI held a virtual political monopoly, its insiders picked the candidate they knew would win and then instructed citizens to vote for him. Today, the monopoly has waned. But even so, PRI voters still expect to be told who is the likely winner. Their party is still driven by patronage, and they want to be on the right side of whoever will dole it out. And so the thing is to know who is "el bueno," the good one, the winner.
It is a facet of a political culture that sets the PRI apart from parties born of pluralistic democracy. And that is the all-important issue at stake today as Mexicans vote.
For the first time, the PRI is going into a presidential election in which there is a real possibility that it could lose. It promises to be the most fair and open election the country has ever had. Polls show Mr. Labastida running even with a moderate conservative, Vicente Fox Quesada of the National Action Party or PAN (A leftist, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, is trailing.)
All of the candidates call themselves democrats, but Mexicans are nevertheless making a fundamental decision about the kind of democracy they want. The question is, what do you have if there are free elections and an autocratic party wins?
On one side of the contest is the PRI, a party accustomed to top-down control whose most consistent ideology has been its commitment to staying in power.
On the other is an opposition that arose from popular movements for citizens' rights and a balance of powers between the president and Mexico's legislature. The opposition is democratic in the way that most United States voters understand the term. The PRI is not. Yet millions of Mexicans flock to the PRI as the party that represents their interests the best.
Mexicans recognize that the central dispute in the election is over "la alternancia" -- the idea of parties alternating power.
PRI leaders argue that actual alternation isn't needed -- that it is enough for them to reform their party's values from within. They point to the first competitive primary that nominated Mr. Labastida as proof of a new PRI. "As long as we have the option of alternating power, we have democracy," said Sandra Fuentes Berain, a top official in the Labastida campaign. "Alternating power is not a requirement."
But Mr. Fox and Mr. Cardenas hold that their country will not become a democracy until the PRI is removed. Denise Dresser, a political analyst, puts it this way: "Mexicans have truly never had the chance to throw the bums out. Tasting that experience would be extraordinarily empowering. It would inject a whole new fresh air into the process."
PRI leaders make no bones about the authoritarian nature and genius of their party. "In this election, you are going to see the machinery of the PRI, like few parties in the world have," said Emilio Gamboa Patron, one of Mr. Labastida's top campaign managers. "I'll bet not even the party in China has a machine like the one we have built up over the years."
The PRI, in fact, was created by Mexican strongmen determined to impose order on the chaos of the 1910 Mexican Revolution. To this day, Mr. Gamboa said, its work to forge national unity and spread services like clinics and schools and other political largesse throughout the land still cements its followers' loyalty. "Our party kept the social peace," Mr. Gamboa said.
M ANY PRI supporters who turned out to cheer Mr. Labastida knew little about him, other than that he was their man. But his rallies turned into dense crushes as followers pressed to shake his hand or, with luck, have a picture taken with him that they could display in transactions with the government.
While the opposition scorns busing people to rallies and giving them free lunches, PRI voters would not have it any other way. Mr. Labastida campaigned with massive hand-outs to voters and networks that pressured government employees to vote for the PRI.
Wary of change, PRI followers have been forgiving of its corruption scandals and long-term economic policies that have failed to lift the poor. "I'd rather have an old devil I know than a new devil I don't," said Cristina Luna Flores, 42, a rural homemaker.
Mr. Fox's party, the PAN, has deeply conservative Catholic and business-oriented roots. But its rightist ideas were tempered as it evolved into a a resistance movement against the PRI, battling to defend electoral victories against PRI fraud.
Mr. Fox, to be sure, evokes another anti-democratic figure in Mexican politics, the caudillo or political warlord. He is a strong-willed, hard-driving candidate who overwhelmed and sometimes even ignored his party. But he forced the PAN to modernize its platform and endowed it with a new organization for getting votes. In doing so, he mobilized millions who are not PAN militants but want something new.
They range from young people to the wealthy elite and even the military. "We need change," said Fernando Antonio Reyes, 49, an active duty army lieutenant who was in a Fox crowd. "The PRI has taken away all our buying power. We can't take its corruption anymore."
Whoever wins, the closeness of the race means Mexico will face new conflicts. If Mr. Labastida wins, it will probably be with less than 50 percent of the vote, the first time a PRI president will not have a majority mandate.
If Mr. Fox wins, his battles to govern with a legislature controlled by his adversaries may sorely test the assumption that change at the top is the soul of democracy.
Either way Mexico will remain a strange hybrid - an electorate in pursuit of democracy with an authoritarian force at its very core.

Writing the Bill For Global AIDS

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

 BODY:
THE question is: How much would it cost to contain the global AIDS epidemic? The short answer is: Well, how much have you got?
How much would it cost to banish ignorance, to deaden lust, to shame rape, to stop war, to enrich the poor, to empower women, to defend children, to make decent medical care as globally ubiquitous as Coca-Cola -- in short, to get rid of all the underlying causes of the epidemic in the third world? 
 The latest global survey of the epidemic was released last week by Unaids, the United Nations agency dealing with AIDS. It estimated that more than one-third of all 15-year-olds in the worst-affected countries are still destined to die even if infection rates somehow drop.
In the United States, AIDS is usually addressed as a medical problem with to be solved with health care or public health policy. Overseas experts say that even seeing the epidemic that way is a luxury that reflects American thinking: any germ can be killed if it is hammered long enough with a big enough wad of dollars. But AIDS in the third world, said Anthony Kinghorn, a South African consultant to governments and businesses facing the epidemic, is "really a welfare and education issue rather than a medical one."
In Zimbabwe and India and Haiti, one cannot tackle AIDS the way it has been fought in San Francisco and New York. One cannot simply put baskets of condoms in all the gay bars and clean needles in all the methadone clinics or even send speakers to all the high schools and plant scary articles in the press.
For one, much of the world at risk of AIDS can't read. Most of the world at risk has never used a condom. Most of the world at risk has never heard of Act Up and wouldn't dare heckle a president. And most of the world with AIDS thinks it doesn't have the disease and doesn't know anyone who does, because 95 percent of those infected in the third world have never been tested. (Most estimates come from anonymous testing at pre-natal clinics.) And most of the world cannot afford the drugs that Americans can.
With such verities in mind, then, how is one to think about containing AIDS -- say, in Africa, the continent most dramatically affected so far?
If there was money, what might be done with it?
Certainly, estimates are bandied about. The Unaids survey mentioned a need for $2 billion a year for sub-Saharan Africa, of which about $300 million has been committed, said Dr. Peter Piot, head of the agency.
But that figure seems negligible, given the scope of the disease. And it is, because Unaids estimates are painfully conservative. The $2 billion was only for prevention -- not care -- and only to bring standards up to the level of Uganda or Senegal, the only two African countries that have cut their numbers of citizens living with AIDS. It envisioned modest goals: condom handouts, blood testing, counseling for prostitutes and students, routine treatment for venereal diseases, and so on.
WHEN Unaids tries to calculate the theoretical additional cost of medical care, "it gets more difficult," said Bernhard Schwartlander, the agency's chief epidemiologist. The calculations are pared down to what realistically might be done. They include treating only people with access to medical systems that can do easier things like tuberculosis treatment and pre-natal care reasonably well. Most of the money would go for the cheapest drugs, like the antibiotic Bactrim, which prevents only simple infections. Some money is allotted for more sophisticated drugs to fight drug-resistant tuberculosis and fungal infections, and for an "AIDS cocktail" of anti-retroviral drugs -- but in these cases, only enough to reach a fraction of those infected because those therapies must be closely supervised and the medical resources to do so are scarce.
In addition, the calculations assume that the cocktail will cost only $1,400 a year (as opposed to the $12,000 a year or more that an American AIDS patient might spend). To get the cost that low, Western drug companies would have to cut their prices by 90 percent or the drugs would have to be purchased from Brazil, India or other countries that ignore patents.
If that could all be arranged by 2005, Mr. Schwartlander said, the cost would be about $1.7 billion a year to get the cheapest care for the dying to 40 percent of all infected Africans and the AIDS cocktail to 10 percent -- an inadequate, but realistic, goal. "If the drugs are more expensive or you increase the coverage rate, the costs explode accordingly," Mr. Schwartlander said.
Nobody calculates what it would cost to give Africans and Asians the kind of health care that Americans -- even American welfare recipients -- receive. That would run into hundreds of billions, because one would have to start from ground zero, building the hospitals and importing the doctors.
To put this in perspective: There are an estimated 34 million HIV-infected people in the world, at least 30 million of them poor. Poor not just by American standards, but by world standards: living on less than $2 a day. AIDS specialists rarely say this bluntly, but the truth is that most of those 30 million people have simply been written off, because the first priority for the first few billion dollars is prevention, not treatment.
Not that it is possible to talk so straightforwardly about the terrible cost of AIDS -- at least not until more political leaders in Africa realistically confront the dimensions of the problem, and more governments overseas mobilize to help Africa.
Alan Whiteside, an economist who studies AIDS in South Africa, which has the world's fastest-growing epidemic, puts it this way: "You can't give up on the infected because of the message it sends." But if he had $1 billion to spend most wisely, he would spend it on "giving women more power, caring for orphans and getting them education."
Then there is the overwhelming problem of poverty. An HIV-positive American can focus on his T-cell counts; an HIV-positive African in a rural village still has to focus on finding clean water and food.
"In Uganda," said Mr. Kinghorn, the South African consultant, "there are lots of kids who are aware of AIDS now. But they're simply not able to protect themselves. They have to do high-risk things to put bread on the table."
Once poverty is factored in -- especially when the dying young can no longer build an economy -- the question becomes: How much can be done with the least money? But that, too, is problematic. The cheapest form of prevention is condoms. The United States Agency for International Development is the biggest condom customer in the world. With its European counterparts, the total bill for Africa and Asia runs to Tens of millions of dollars. But distribution is the difficult part, along with overcoming prejudices against them. When, for example, will grown men in Soweto stop teasing young men by asking, "Oh, do you shower with your raincoat on too?"
A vaccine would also be a cheap countermeasure. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has put up $250 million for the hunt, and the Clinton administration has offered $1 billion in tax credits to any company that invents one. But a vaccine, like a cure, remains elusive. Optimists say one might be found and approved in 10 years.

HEADLINE: Controlling Drugs in Colombia

 BODY:
Congress has granted the Clinton administration the $1.3 billion it sought to help Colombia fight drug cultivation and trafficking. But before final passage of the legislation, Congressional conferees stripped away some of the important human rights and environmental safeguards added by the Senate. Without these restrictions on the use of American aid, the United States could find itself drawn into the long war between the Colombian government and leftist guerrillas, a war that neither side can expect to win by military means. It will now be up to the White House to make sure that American involvement neither prolongs war nor weakens democracy.
Colombia produces more than 90 percent of the cocaine and about two-thirds of the heroin that reaches the United States. In recent years, Bogota's American-aided effort to eradicate coca plants by aerial spraying has been losing ground, in part because much of the crop is grown in areas where government control is weak and the guerrillas are the most powerful military force. The close intertwining of drug-control efforts with the army's war against the guerrillas means that unless Washington proceeds with care, it could find American prestige and even American support troops at risk in a prolonged and open-ended military entanglement. 
 Most of the new money will go to arm, train and support Colombia's army and police. The army, in particular, has an abysmal human rights record. The Senate bill would have halted aid if Colombia failed to punish abusive officers. But the conferees authorized the White House to waive this provision by claiming that America's national security requires action against drugs. Also eliminated were Senate restrictions on the use of pesticides that harm human health or the environment.
Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, has worked hard to start peace negotiations with the guerrillas. Successful talks could allow more settled conditions in Colombia's drug-growing regions and give their inhabitants economic alternatives to coca farming. This would do far more to fight drugs and bring stability to Colombia than would expanded military operations. The Clinton administration must ensure that American aid reinforces democracy and contributes to a negotiated peace.

Wall Street Cheers the Fed's Decision Head

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
The stock market ended a difficult first half on an upbeat note last week as investors breathed a sigh of relief after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged during its latest policy meeting.
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished the week at 10,447.89, up 43.14, while the Nasdaq composite index closed at 3,966.11, up 120.77. 
 The Fed acted precisely as everyone had expected, which is pretty unusual, said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W Baird & Company in Milwaukee. The feeling now is that if inflation stays under control and we have a soft landing, maybe we won't see any more rate increases for a while.
The Fed has raised short-term rates six times in the last year to slow the economy. Last week, while noting that inflation risks persist, the central bank decided against more increases for the time being.
 With that decided, investors focused on leading technology companies that are expected to post strong second-quarter profits, including Hewlett-Packard, whose stock price rose.
 Scattered earnings disappointments, though, dragged other stocks lower, including Goodyear and American Financial. VIVIAN MARINO

HEADLINE: RECKONINGS;
Going For Broke

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Whenever I start to get blase about today's amazing business world, I pull out my copy of John Kenneth Galbraith's "New Industrial State," published in 1967. It's a reminder of how thoroughly the economy has defied the old conventional wisdom.
Not that Mr. Galbraith was expressing the consensus of the economics profession. On the contrary, throughout the book he expressed contempt for his colleagues, with their naive belief that market forces still mattered. But his message -- that planning by huge corporations was increasingly supplanting the chaos of the market system, that capitalism was becoming indistinguishable from socialism -- found wide favor. When Mr. Galbraith wrote that "the entrepreneur no longer exists as an individual in the mature industrial enterprise," when he spoke of the "euthanasia of stockholder power," many people -- living, let us remember in Mr. Galbraith's defense, in an era when General Motors was the very model of a major modern manufacturer -- nodded their heads in agreement. 
 Which brings us to Amazon.com.
Over the last couple of weeks questions about the prospects for the world's most visible e-tailer have once again roiled the markets. An analyst at Lehman Brothers has warned that Amazon may run out of cash early next year; other analysts have leapt to the firm's defense. I'm not going to get into the middle of this fight. Isn't it amazing, though, that Amazon has become a household name, that last year Time named founder Jeff Bezos Person of the Year -- and that we still don't know whether Amazon, or for that matter any dot-com, has a viable business model?
But that is actually the point. Amazon's business strategy -- to lose money for an extended period while building a market position -- is not all that unusual. In fact, it's exactly what Japanese companies did in their export markets during the 70's and 80's, when Japan's economy seemed an unstoppable juggernaut. Information technology, with its powerful increasing returns -- the more people who use a product, the more useful it becomes -- may have made it even more necessary than it used to be to lose money now in order to make it later. But the strategy per se isn't new.
What is new is the sight of Amazon and other companies pursuing a full-scale go-for-broke strategy right from the start, losing hundreds of millions before anyone is even sure that there is money to be made in their businesses. When Mr. Galbraith was writing, it seemed obvious that only large, well-established companies with plenty of profits from their existing businesses could afford to make big bets on the future. When people thought about private-sector innovation, they had in mind I.B.M.'s development of the 360 series of computers, or Boeing's development of the 747. In fact, as little as six or seven years ago the common view was that Japanese companies would steadily gain the technological upper hand over their American rivals because only the Japanese -- not faced with annoying pressure to satisfy the financial markets -- could afford to take the long view, and ignore short-term losses.
But in the last few years our stock market has proved willing and eager to finance brand-new companies with highly speculative business plans that require years of losses before anyone will know whether they make sense. In fact, even companies that could afford to finance their innovations out of profits on older businesses prefer to spin off the sexiest projects as semi-independent companies, in order to benefit from that enthusiasm.
How did this happen? I suspect that the emergence of our innovation-friendly finance markets was less inevitable than many people imagine. And it is by no means certain that the new era will last. For a while almost every I.P.O. was enthusiastically welcomed by markets willing to imagine that every new company might be the next Microsoft. That euphoria has faded; but will it eventually be replaced by cynicism, by the demand that new businesses show an actual profit before they can raise large sums of money?
Amazon may be the test case. If the company proves the pessimists wrong, the golden age of the individual entrepreneur will certainly go on for a while longer. If Amazon really does go under, we may be headed back to the era when only big companies could afford to make big innovations.

HEADLINE: U.S. Helps Colombian Leader, But His Woes Pile Up at Home

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, July 1

 BODY:
He has just received a vote of confidence from the United States in the form of $1.3 billion in emergency military aid. But as President Andres Pastrana nears the midpoint of his term, his standing is sinking, and even his supporters fear that his position will continue to deteriorate.
Vowing to end decades of guerrilla war, Mr. Pastrana took office in August 1998 with the highest vote total of any candidate in Colombian history. But he has been steadily hurt by a lack of progress in peace talks with the Marxist rebels, economic recession, a crippling feud with Congress and now accusations of corruption. 
 The result is what Semana, the country's leading news magazine, has called "a crisis of governability without precedent." A recent cover showed two rebel leaders with big grins and warned that "while the establishment wears itself out in futile clashes, the country is collapsing and the guerrillas gain ground."
The United States Congress's approval of an emergency antidrug aid package this week appears to afford Mr. Pastrana only marginal respite. The plan will do nothing to eliminate the sparring with his own Congress or the complaints of corruption. Nor will it help to end the recession, as the bulk of the aid will go to the military, not into the economy.
For economic relief, Mr. Pastrana has been counting on the other side of what his government calls "Plan Colombia," nearly $2 billion in aid from European and other donors due to meet Colombian officials in Madrid in coming days. But Mr. Pastrana continues to face skepticism about his carrot-and-stick approach with the rebels and the American military aid has added to those anxieties.
"Nobody wants Pastrana to come home empty handed, and every effort will be made to prevent that from happening," said a European diplomat here. "But there is a feeling that this is a primarily military plan and that we are being asked to clean up the mess that the Americans are going to make."
Popular support for the peace effort is now "precarious," Jorge Humberto Botero, head of the country's bank association, cautioned earlier this month. "The country is sickened by blood," he said. "It is intimidated and terrorized."
Mr. Botero's warning came after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the main insurgent group, announced a plan to tax all wealthy Colombians and kidnap those who refuse to pay. Since the rebels are already taxing businesses and carrying out summary executions in the sizable demilitarized zone Mr. Pastrana handed to them in late 1998, the new demand has added to the impression they see themselves as a parallel government.
"How much longer is our government going to keep treating these subversive criminals with such deference?" asked Jose Manuel Tovar Jimenez, an accountant. "I'm sick of constantly making concessions to them and getting nothing in return but new and more outrageous demands."
Mr. Pastrana's political problems mounted this spring when he called for a referendum that would shut down the Congress, widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, and replace it with a more streamlined and accountable body. Legislators counterattacked, saying that Mr. Pastrana's own job should also be put to a vote, and the president was eventually forced to withdraw his proposal.
"Pastrana is in dire straits as a result," a diplomat here said. "No matter how things turn out, he has poisoned relations with Congress for the remainder of his term."
Charges of corruption in Mr. Pastrana's administration have also emerged, fed by the opposition Liberal Party, whose own image was permanently tarnished by evidence that drug traffickers contributed to its 1994 presidential campaign. Suspect donations to the Pastrana campaign from a dredging company have been the focal point of the allegations, with members of Mr. Pastrana's cabinet and staff said to have been involved.
"With the certainty that nothing will be found, I'm not going to slow down to dedicate further time or space to such infamies," Mr. Pastrana complained in a recent speech.
None of the accusations have been proved. But the simple perception of irregularities has weakened the "white knight" image that has been about the only trump card remaining in Mr. Pastrana's deck.
"I wanted a change, and what we are getting is the same old way of doing things at the time we can least afford it," said Mercedes Ardila Ochoa, a secretary
Mr. Pastrana's declining popularity is also part of a broader institutional breakdown in Colombian politics. As in neighboring Venezuela and Peru, the population here is growing increasingly disgusted with the traditional party system, in which power alternates between Liberals and Conservatives.
"The people perceive the parties as not representing their interests," said Myles Frechette, who was the United States ambassador here in the late 1990's. "And they are just not doing what the people need. They equate the political class with corruption, and they see a lot of cheap populist talk but nobody really doing anything."
For now, with any progress in fighting either the war or the recession seemingly a long way off, Mr. Pastrana is trying to reverse his sagging political fortunes by making over his image, which a diplomat here described as "slick and cold."
Dressed casually in a sweater and open-necked shirt and speaking in an unusually colloquial manner, Mr. Pastrana went on television June 21 to urge Colombians to "adopt a new attitude" and be more optimistic.
"I'm tired of pessimism always winning out over hope," he said, "of negativism over the positive, of the bad over the good, the individual over the collective."
Afterward, the country's leading newspaper, El Tiempo, said that even though "the new Andres" might seem "frivolous or irrelevant," it was best to withhold judgment. "The success or failure of the strategy," it noted, "is tied to concrete actions of the government," and those have yet to be seen.

HEADLINE: Boom in Economy Skips Towns on the Plains

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN, N.D.

 BODY:
From above, the state of North Dakota is a quilt of wheat and prairie grass stitched by rows of cottonwood, ash and elm trees, two-lane roads, many dirt, and railroad tracks. Every seven or eight miles beyond the few big cities, the tracks link 100-foot-tall, century-old clapboard or galvanized metal grain elevators. Alongside the elevators are towns, laid out in five or 10-block grids, and beyond, farms and ranches.
But little moves down there. In every second or third town along these tracks, the school, the city hall, the elevator, the bank, the American Legion Hall, the farm tool dealer, the general store of the 30's and the convenience store of the 80's, birds are the only tenants. In many of these communities, only a bar and a church hang on, along with a few homeowners who are too old, too poor or too proud to move, or, who simply prefer the solitude. 
 Like towns of the West that turned to shells once they were stripped of their gold, new ghost towns are sprouting over much of the Great Plains.
In North Dakota and well beyond, across thousands of old rural towns in the broad belly of the Plains from Eastern Montana and Western Minnesota and the Canadian border down through Nebraska into Kansas and Oklahoma, the nation's long run of growth and prosperity has blown right by.
The contraction is most pronounced in North Dakota, one of only three states, with Connecticut and Rhode Island, to lose population in the 90's. In Ardoch, N.D., population 49, the city hall is padlocked, its windows boarded, its electricity meter still, its clapboard facade unpainted for decades. The bar closed a year or two ago.
Headstones in the cemetery commemorate Yankee settlers until the early 1900's, when the harsh climate chased the survivors west. Newer headstones mark the deaths of Polish settlers and their heirs until the 1990's. The Poles, too, have moved on. Ardoch's only new inhabitants are sugar beet workers from Mexico.
In Pisek, a largely Czech town with 113 people, 17 fewer than in 1990, the bank is no bigger than a one-car garage. A notice on the door, posted a year ago, announces new hours. It is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. The Jelinek family's general store survives, though it loses money and has stopped selling clothing and shoes. "Just your older people reside in these small towns," said Elaine Swartz, the assistant postmaster.
All that remains for Warsaw's 40 or 50 citizens, descendants of Polish immigrants, is the one bar, Tork's Polski Dom, and at the corner of two county roads, the surreal 100-year-old St. Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church, an opulent red-brick, gothic edifice with a 143-foot spire, a gilded cross on top. Visible for miles, it rises from the prairie like a cathedral, taller than any tree or grain elevator.
The church can seat 700, and once it did. "We're holding our own at 345 parishioners," said the pastor, the Rev. Damian Hils, but only because he draws them from as far as Fargo, 110 miles to the south. He worries about more losses. "Almost all my parishioners are farmers," he said, "and some have had to sell out."
It is true that many western Plains communities, in Colorado, Nevada and Utah, are bustling with the fervor of Silicon Valley. Towns outside growing cities are reawakening as they join the transition to the next ring of suburbs. Still other once-sinking towns along major highways, like Interstate 80 that slices east and west through Nebraska, have revived with convenience stores, gas stations, motels and restaurants.
But the population of the core Plains states of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and the Dakotas, grew at half the 9.6 percent increase of the nation as a whole in the 1990's. Growth of most cities far exceeded state averages while the rural population shrank.
Funerals in many of these towns outnumber baptisms two to one. Accelerating a process that started decades ago with the mechanization of farming and the depletion of oil fields and mines, the livelier economy elsewhere has shunned investment in the towns and drained off the young to jobs and opportunity in Omaha, Fargo and Pierre and beyond, to Denver and Minneapolis.
"There is a sorting out going on," said Alan Barkema, economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City, Mo., and at the bank's Center for the Study of Rural America. "Across a vast sweep of the heartland, rural communities are not keeping up. The sad truth of the matter is that some are not going to survive."
In hardest hit North Dakota, which lost 5,000 people in the 90's, to 634,000, visits to a score of communities in the northeastern corner yield stubborn survivors and inspired boosters. For $1 each and two years free of local taxes, the city of Minto (population 560 in 1990 and 519 in 1998) is selling 90-by-150-foot housing lots that a developer abandoned provided buyers put homes on them within a year. Six of about 40 lots are left.
But throughout the four-county area, only the city of Grafton grew, about 5 percent to 5,117, from 1990 to 1998. In North Dakota, said Curtis Stofferahn, a rural sociologist at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks, "There's a real concern that we're probably seeing the last generation on the land."
In Nelson County, one of four counties in the northeastern area and 45 miles west of Grand Forks, the population shrank 17 percent in the 90's, and more would be gone were it not for federal largess. Last year, the North Dakota State Data Center at North Dakota State University in Fargo reports, the government dispensed $11,858 per capita in Nelson County, $6,246 above the national average, for defense, farm, flood, retirement and other programs.
One worn-out Nelson County town is Whitman, population 89 in 1998 and 63 in 1990. Whitman looks crisp and orderly, with the 10 or 15 homes of Norwegian descendants with small gardens and weed-free lawns. But unpaved Main Street is dead. Silent at one end stands the old gray elevator. On one side of the street is an open lot, long cleared of its stores. On the other is an abandoned one-truck firehouse and a shut-down strip of three weathered, one-story shops.
Just up from Main Street, a high-spirited yellow dog, the only creature in view one afternoon, guards a one-story brick structure, the Whitman Community Center. A window has been broken, and inside, ceiling tiles rot in puddles on a linoleum floor. Across a dirt path from the center is Sarnia United Lutheran Church, immaculate and white.
Leland Skjervem, 75, a retired farmer whose Norwegian immigrant grandfather settled in Whitman in the 1880's, said the community center shut down about four years ago, the elevator eight years ago, the school 10 years ago and long before that four bars and two general stores. He cannot buy anything close by any more. "Everything gets to be farther away all the time," Mr. Skjervem said. "The need isn't there for these towns."
But Mr. Skjervem (pronounced SHER-vem) can still go to the church. A sign out front says that Pastor Sue Mackey performs a service there three of four Sundays a month. From 1992 through last year, its annual report shows, the church buried 11 members and christened four. Twelve people attend services now, he said, compared with 35 eight years ago.
The towns' demise matters, their advocates say. With safe streets, dawn-to-dusk work, and large and stable, church-going families, they became a model of the American self-image.
"They are who we are," said Bonnie Turner, director of a Lutheran organization in Grand Forks that counsels the rural poor and distributes food boxes. "And they're blowing to dust."
Even now, says Father Hils in Warsaw, "the kids have a wholesomeness about them, a goodness. They invite us to the prom. You know they wouldn't do that if they were up to anything bad."
They are healthy places, too. In predominantly rural North Dakota, the Department of Health and Human Services reports, 63 percent of people 85 and older can still get around and take care of themselves, the highest level in the nation. North Dakotans also have a lower incidence of the nine leading causes of death than the national averages, with one exception -- suicide.
What growth there has been in North Dakota has been almost entirely confined to Fargo and Bismarck. All but six of the state's 53 counties lost population in the 1990's, Census Bureau and state estimates show, and five counties lost more than a fifth of their people.
The decline feeds on itself, said Richard Rathge, director of the state data center. "It reduces your potential for renewal," he said. Faster cars let people bypass Main Street to shop at far-off discount stores. Better roads and buses let counties close schools and whisk children out of town to consolidated schools farther and farther away.
The state's widely scattered population, with fewer than five people per square mile in 26 counties, makes it all the harder to rally local economies the usual way, by courting employers with assurances of work forces.
Here and there, communities have invested in telecommunications to help new businesses exploit the Internet. But the tide of decline is overpowering. "Most people recognize what is going on," Mr. Rathge said. "The frustration is how you deal with it."
Well to the north of Nelson County, against the borders of Minnesota and Canada, is Pembina County and this village of Mountain, where the population has slipped from 134 a decade ago to about 120, including 40 residents of the town's only new institution, a home for the elderly. Mountain is and remains entirely Icelandic, the largest Icelandic settlement outside Iceland. Headstones outside the still-vibrant Vikur Lutheran Church bear names inscribed in Icelandic.
After Gene Gudmundson, 50, finished Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., he resurrected his father's and homesteader grandfather's farm in Mountain, bought more land and raised wheat, barley, pinto beans and sunflowers on 990 acres. He and his wife, Helen, 42, a contract administrator at the Cavalier Air Force Station, built a home in 1978, expanded it six years ago and have four daughters.
But buffeted by debt, the lowest wheat prices in 30 years and seven years of ruinous drought and floods, the Gudmundsons are considering leaving Mountain for new jobs once their two younger daughters, now teenagers, finish high school.
In the dreary, daylong drizzle of a few days ago, they auctioned off their farm gear -- plows, swathers, cultivators, combines, planters, herbicide tanks, loaders, five tractors and six trucks. "You get tired," Mrs. Gudmundson said. "It's not worth it."
Among the Gudmundsons' neighbors, Leslie and Delores Geir own 1,000 acres where Mr. Geir's great-grandfather began with the 160 he was given under the Homestead Act. They have two girls, Diane, 16, and Laura, 10, and a son, Chris, 15. To make ends meet, Mrs. Geir is an aide in the home for the elderly, and Diane works there part time.
All the Geirs still have hope. Chris intends to be a farmer, and Diane hopes to settle on a farm. "There is no better place to raise a family," said Mr. Geir, 47. "When my kids were little," Mrs. Geir said, "I could let them play alone outside. The dog would stay with them. I would call the dog to find out where they were."
But the inertia of decline has begun to intrude. Mr. Geir went to school in Mountain, and there were 10 children in his class. As the population fell, the school was closed and students were sent by bus to school in Edinburg, 16 miles to the south. With further decline, that school, too might go. "Laura had seven kids in her fourth-grade class," he said.
In Mountain, the forces of decline have chased away the optimistic spirit of America. "The future is pretty dim right now," said the mayor of Mountain, S. Douglas Hanson, a gravel truck driver.
Marabeth Hunter, the postmaster, said: "We don't have anything now. Just the one bar, the cafe that's open half days, the old folks home and the church. I wish we had stores here, at least one. You have to run 16 miles to get milk."

HEADLINE: CROSSING BORDERS: The Trade in Humans;
Europe Tries to Turn a Tide Of Migrants Chasing Dreams

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: DOVER, England

 BODY:
This was once a quiet port town famous above all for its white cliffs. It is now notorious for the corpses of 58 Chinese immigrants that lie, unclaimed and unnamed, in large meat lockers -- and for the likes of Tara Muhammad roaming its streets.
Like the desperate Chinese travelers found dead here on June 19 in an airtight container, Mr. Muhammad entered Britain in June concealed in the rear of a truck. From his native town of Kirkuk in Iraq, he walked into Iran. From Iran into Turkey, five days on foot, moving at night. A 24-hour bus ride to Istanbul followed. 
 "Then I went to a parking place for trucks," Mr. Muhammad, 22, said. "And I found this man and I told him, 'I want to go to Europa. Yes, anywhere in Europa.' And he said, 'O.K., no problem.' " After paying $4,000 in cash, changing trucks three times and traveling for 11 days, Mr. Muhammad reached Dover, where he requested asylum.
"Europa," the old continent, persistent source of hordes of migrants to the New World, has become the ersatz United States of modern asylum-seekers. Where just 30,000 people applied for asylum in America last year, down from 127,000 in 1993, more than 365,000 did so in the 15-nation European Union.
This shift is troubling to a Europe that tends to see more problems than promise in alien blood. But its causes are not about to disappear. The collapse of the Soviet Union has opened up new land routes to Europe from Asia and turned once-closed cities like Moscow and Kiev into nodal points of migrant travel from Afghanistan and China.
Increasingly well-organized criminal groups trading in human freight -- a less risky but scarcely less lucrative commodity than drugs -- have emerged to coordinate smuggled passages into a Europe largely closed to legal immigration.
"The penalties are far less severe than for drugs, the up-front investment much smaller, and the evidence has legs and tends to run away," explained Brunson McKinley, the director general of the International Organization for Migration.
Europe is also relatively cheap. Tan Wah Piow, a London lawyer close to the Chinese immigrant community, put the cost of being brought to Europe from China at $25,000, perhaps half the cost of transport to America. "People have turned from the United States as it is more difficult to get into it," he said.
On his desk sits a fax from China. It shows a blurred photograph of a young man. His name is Lin Liguan. He weighs 136 pounds. He was born on Nov. 30, 1979. He comes from China's southern Fujian province and, a few months back, he departed for Europe.
The message pleads: Do you know where my son is? Could he be among the dead in Dover? Can you help us? Mr. Tan points angrily at the paper. "It is good for China to join the World Trade Organization because we support the free movement of global capital," he said. "But what about the free movement of labor?"
What indeed. Think of the anonymous Dover dead, piles of flesh unclaimed by any relative because those relatives may themselves be in Europe illegally and fear deportation, as so many units in a grim global equation.
The richest fifth of mankind earns 86 percent of the world's income while the poorest fifth earns 1 percent. The riches are ever more visible through global communications; options for travel are ever greater; millions of sealed containers make an ever growing exchange of goods even easier.
So an opulent Europe, even one with high unemployment, glimmers as a land of opportunity. More than 70 million migrants are thought to be on the move at any one time. And, on the whole, Europe looks relatively accessible to them.
The European Union has now eliminated most internal borders, making Athens to Amsterdam a passport-free passage, but the pan-European police force to control a growing flux of people scarcely exists. Europol, the fledgling F.B.I. of a united Europe, has all of 220 employees in its Dutch offices.
Yet this "Europa" is profoundly uneasy at its emergent role of magnet to the world's dispossessed. Unlike America, no mythology exhorts the embrace of "your tired, your poor, your huddled masses."
Rather, the national psyches of Spain, Italy, Greece and Ireland are shaped by tales of emigration. Even a country like Germany, whose population is now 9 percent foreign, and whose postwar education system has relentlessly pushed ethnic tolerance as a central tenet, remains agonized over whether it can ever become "a land of immigration."
"There is a deep sense that we are full up, that we have no room, and that we are being exploited," said John Salt, a migration expert at London University. "No European country has voted for a multicultural society, or thought of itself as such, yet now we are all told we live in one."
Certainly Dover looks like one. Many of the bed-and-breakfasts have been converted into impromptu hostels for asylum-seekers. Signs advertise English lessons given by speakers of Czech, Slovak, Russian, Polish, German, Finnish, Kurdish, Arabic, Turkish, Farsi, Pashto, Urdu and Hindi.
In this world, six days into his English existence, Mr. Muhammad of Kirkuk, Iraq, makes his way. Installed in Room 12 of one hostel, proud possessor of the upper bed on a bunk, he has a television to gaze at and is given three meals a day. "I don't need money at the moment," he said. "Money for what?"
Earlier this year, the British government, responding to growing criticism of "phony" asylum-seekers, cut back on benefits. But the likes of Mr. Muhammad are still given enough for basic needs pending a decision on their status, even as the local press laments that Dover has become "a hole."
"What happens to the care-worn citizens of this once-proud port now cursed by association with a problem the government seems unable to deal with?" thundered the Dover Express in a front-page "Editorial Comment" three days after the Chinese corpses were found.
Such exasperation is driving European attempts to make borders less penetrable and, in countries from Denmark to Switzerland, fueling a revival of rightist and nationalist parties symbolized by the success of Jorg Haider's party entering the Austrian government.
"Politically, the government wants to be seen as tough," said Annie Ledger, the chief executive of Migrant Helpline, a state-financed charity handling registration of 1,000 asylum-seekers a month in Dover. "But personally I don't believe we are so generous that people leave countries thousands of miles away in search of our handouts."
Certainly, that is not what drove Wu Xueping, who left Fujian province in April after paying $25,000 to the smugglers who provided him with a fake passport.
His journey to London, he said, initially took him by plane to Belgrade (China has close relations with Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia). From there, he traveled by bus to Hungary, then on into the Czech Republic, before entering the European Union by crossing the mountains into Germany on foot -- a three-day hike.
"After Germany, we were taken to Belgium, where we were locked in a small room in a house for about a month and fed on bread and water," he said. "Then I was put into the back of a truck with eight other people, arriving in England on May 17." Mr. Wu, who has a wife and 9-year-old child back in Fujian Province, said that, as a member of the Falun Gong group banned last year, he had been persecuted in China. But the reality is that economic and political motives blur when seeking a better life in Europe.
"One week's pay here can support a family for two or three months in China," said Chew Beng Lan, a lawyer in London. "I know one girl working in a restaurant in Chinatown who told me one year worked here was equivalent to eight at home."
The pattern in Chinese immigration is now clear: families pool resources and borrow money to finance the dispatch of one member, who then helps others come. Debts to the people smugglers are paid off over three to seven years, when other relatives follow. Money is earned mainly in restaurants and housing is either above the restaurants or with other local Chinese.
Working long hours, six days a week, an immigrant can earn as much as $2,400 a month in London, Mrs. Chew said. The immigrants, who have destroyed any documents in order to make removal back to China more difficult, live in a protracted limbo, working illegally or with temporary papers repeatedly renewed.
It was a dream of just such an existence that prompted 60 Chinese to take their places beside cartons of tomatoes in a sealed container in Rotterdam on June 18. How they reached Europe's largest port, transit point for 6.5 million containers a year, remains uncertain, but the Dutch police say they believe that they traveled overland through Moscow.
Wim de Bruin, a judicial official, said a Rotterdam warehouse had now been identified as the place where the would-be immigrants boarded the stifling truck and a ring of eight people suspected of involvement in the human smuggling have been arrested.
The emerging picture of the crime fits the pattern of adaptable criminal networks that the police say now run an international business in illicit human cargo that turns over at least $3 billion a year.
Professionals, often from the so-called "source countries," interact with local "amateurs" recruited ad hoc to act as couriers. The operations are often hard to penetrate because of language difficulties and the very closed nature of Chinese, Albanian or other gangs engaged in trafficking, said Bjorn Clarberg, a Swedish police officer who specializes in illegal immigration.
This particular tragedy began in the unlikeliest of places: a leafy Rotterdam suburb where Arie van der Spek, 24, lived in a small apartment with his parents above the Piet Hordijk bicycle store. The young man had a small decorating company but was struggling to make ends meet.
"He was quiet, a bit naive, and there were rumors that he had got involved in gambling," said Dennis Hordijk, 32, his neighbor. "But like his parents, who have now moved away for a while, I was incredulous at what happened."
Willy Bruggeman, the deputy director of Europol, based in The Hague, suggested that Mr. van der Spek, who has been arrested, probably became a front man for Chinese operators after incurring gambling debts in Chinese circles. To pay them off, the police theorize, Mr. van der Spek agreed to establish the "transport company" he registered three days before the truck departed for Belgium.
The driver, Perry Wacker, also of Rotterdam, may have met Mr. van der Spek in the same gambling circles, the police said. Mr. Wacker has been charged with 58 counts of manslaughter in Britain. Just two of the people in his truck survived.
"In such cases, the owner of the truck company and the driver may be paid a total $750 per person," said Poel van der Molen-Maesen, a Dutch prosecutor. "That is a lot of money. But the people who have contracted them are getting much more."
This sort of trafficking is happening on a very large scale. In May, Dutch authorities found a Czech van at the German-Dutch border "with 20 people from China sitting in back surrounded by their own excrement," said Geert Pieglage of the Defense Ministry.
On April 5, on board another ferry from Zeebrugge, 50 desperate Chinese immigrants were let out of the back of a truck after hammering on the sides of its sealed container, said Peter Hillman, a spokesman for the British Home Office. They are now in Britain as asylum-seekers.
"The pressure fueling migration is such that European governments will not be able to control this movement," said Professor Salt of London University. "Their best strategy is try to manage it."
The Dover deaths have spurred renewed talk of a coordinated immigration strategy across Europe and of the possibility of following Canada and the United States in permitting more legal immigration.
"Europe does need workers in certain areas, so why not put policy together in a way that takes the wind out of the sails of the traffickers?" said Mr. McKinley of the International Organization for Migration.
But in the current European political climate, making more immigration legal will be arduous. Mr. Muhammad, who says he was persecuted by the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein but declines to say how, has an engagingly open smile. His ambition is simple and apparently inoffensive: "To live in England just like English people."
He is, however, among those who cause the resentments that led to a pitched battle in Dover last year between rightist youths and immigrants. Mr. Bruggeman of Europol was blunt: "There is a problem of saturation in Europe," he said. "The differences between rich and poor countries are such that people are going to move and we cannot stop them. But open borders amounts to mission impossible."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION;
Telecommunications Show May Eclipse G.O.P.

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
When the Republicans gather here this month for their national convention, to some it might be hard to tell the difference: Is this a political convention or a telecommunications trade show?
While the main event at the convention here -- and the Democratic convention to be held in August in Los Angeles -- is, of course, nominating a presidential candidate, a big corporate sideshow is being planned as well. And in that effort, no single industry is better represented than telecommunications companies. 
 The companies are writing seven-figure checks to local civic host committees. They are spending millions more laying hundreds of miles of telephone, cable, fiber-optic and high-speed Internet lines at the conventions. They are handing out hundreds of telephones, pagers and walkie-talkies to important politicians. And they are doing this to promote their products to a captive audience of power brokers -- along with their views on how Washington should decide a number of issues.
"The issues facing the industry are huge," said Reed Hundt, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. "Whether it is Bush or Gore, there will be a whole new crop of decision makers in government in 2001, and these new people will shape the industry."
More than most industries, telecommunications companies are affected by Washington. Since the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act deregulated the industry, telecommunications has been transformed from a stodgy industry to one of the fastest-growing segments of the economy. Among the issues before the government: A debate over open access to high-speed Internet networks, the fight over local telephone companies entering the $80 billion long-distance market, the future ability of huge telecommunications companies to pursue still more acquisitions and the rules governing which companies can compete for the wireless spectrum.
In addition, the political conventions give the companies a chance to showcase their latest technologies and wares, in real time and in real life, to lawmakers and journalists. From a marketing perspective alone, it hardly gets better than this: In Philadelphia, there will be 30 governors, the Congressional leadership, local elected officials, fellow business leaders and 15,000 national and international journalists -- all chatting on phones, using computers and transmitting information.
The failure of this dazzling technology is not an option. Telecom companies have built extensive redundancy and backup to prevent any embarrassing technological troubles.
"Every four years, we have the opportunity to showcase our technological prowess before an important audience," said Tony Cellucci, AT&T's director for the Republican convention. "To do that with such a large captive audience in one location is quite an engineering feat."
AT&T has given more than $1 million to the Philadelphia 2000 host committee and a similar amount to the Los Angeles committee. AT&T is also spending $8 million to $10 million to build new cellular towers at the Philadelphia convention site. The company will also provide 500 cell phones -- with Republican Party logos -- to Republican officials.
A front-burner issue for AT&T is its $58 billion acquisition of MediaOne Company, just approved by federal regulators, making AT&T the nation's largest provider of cable, long-distance and high-speed Internet access. In coming months, regulators will take actions affecting how these companies unite.
Of course, telecommunications companies are not the only ones jumping on the promotional bandwagon. Companies like US Airways, McDonald's, Microsoft and Pepsico provided the bulk of the $40 million in goods and services raised by Philadelphia's host committee -- all tax deductible.
For instance, General Motors, as it has for every convention since 1978, will lend 400 cars -- full-size models and sport utility vehicles -- to shuttle around the powerful. "These are thought-leaders and opinion shakers," said Bill Noack, spokesman for G.M. "We turn our vehicles over to them because it's a good way to expose our products to a diverse and influential audience."
For telecoms, however, all this is more than promotion. Conventions are a way to make money, too. With so many people talking on phones and using computer modems, telecom companies plan to turn a profit.
"It's some combination of civic pride and economic self-interest," David Cohen, co-chairman of Philadelphia 2000, said of the telecom companies. "We give them a direct opportunity to make money. That makes it easier for them to be a significant contributor."
Telecom participation in these conventions comes on top of campaign contributions the industry has already made to the two parties -- a total of $16.9 million in contributions to federal candidates and the two parties in this election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group in Washington. Two of the biggest corporate players at these conventions are the biggest soft-dollar donors as well: AT&T ranks No. 1 with $2.2 million to both parties, SBC Communications comes in sixth with $1.1 million.
Civic pride, too, plays a role since telecom companies tend to be prominent players on their local scenes. In Philadelphia, Comcast and Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania, both with headquarters here, have given $1 million each to the host committee, and so has AT&T.
In Bell Atlantic's case, the company is spending another $4.5 million to create a telecommunications network at the convention site that equals that of a small city: 8,000 traditional phone lines and a variety of cutting-edge transmission and Internet-access lines with names like DSL, DS-1 and ISDN. An additional $200,000 is going for promotional materials.
"The exposure of Bell Atlantic to the media has tremendous value as we become a national and international presence," said Daniel J. Whelan, chief executive of the company. Just last December, federal regulators allowed Bell Atlantic to sell long-distance services to its New York customers. Moreover, Mr. Whelan added, Bell Atlantic "expects to turn a profit" from convention-related telephone use.
In Los Angeles, host city for the Democrats, the local phone company is SBC Communications, which is seeking federal approval to enter the lucrative long-distance market and sell long-distance calling to 15 million of its Texas customers.
SBC, the parent company of Pacific Bell, is a convention veteran. It used the 1996 Republican convention in San Diego to kick off its wireless phones. This time, the word is "band-width" -- the new telephone and Internet connections being laid around Los Angeles' Staples Center, where the convention is being held, to allow for high-speed data transmissions.
"Our fat pipes," said Steve Getzug, spokesman for SBC, referring to the high-speed connections, "will be a pretty incredible application. We want to show some amazing gee-whiz technology to capture the fancy of the media."
Still, no company -- telecom or not -- is making a bigger splash in Philadelphia than Comcast, the nation's third-largest cable company. Brian Roberts, president of Comcast, is co-chairman of the Philadelphia 2000 Host Committee. And Comcast owns the First Union Center in South Philadelphia, where the convention will be held, and which is being renamed the "Comcast-Spectacor Center" for the duration of event. (Among Comcast's other corporate ventures are its ownership of QVC, the television-based retailer, the 76ers basketball team, and the E! Entertainment, Golf and Food cable channels.)
Comcast has its dance card full of activities: Its regional cable network, CN8, will broadcast five hours of live convention programming daily using the $10 million studio Comcast built at the convention site for sports games. And it is dedicating 200 employees to this effort, which will be offered free to cable operators across the country, potentially reaching 68.5 million homes.
Comcast will be sponsoring a fund-raising reception for 400 people honoring retiring Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who helped steer the Telecommunications Act through Congress. The company is footing the bill for a 100-page media and delegate guide for the 100,000 people expected.
It will also install Comcast kiosks there to demonstrate its high-speed Internet service and may sell political memorabilia on QVC.
"These are people who have to make important decisions, and they are coming to our house," said Mr. Roberts, president of Comcast. "This exposure may enhance our own credibility when we are explaining new technologies, and it's a unique onetime opportunity for elected officials to see Comcast. Policy makers can meet us first and remember our names, our faces and our products. And, for Philadelphia, it's our Super Bowl, our Olympics."

Battle Flag Is Lowered, But War Isn't Quite Over

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., July 1

 BODY:
As its reign atop the South Carolina Statehouse finally came to an end today, the Confederate battle flag had become almost as much a curiosity as an object of division, a symbol of the state's exhausted recent history even more than of its distant past.
The arguments about the flag might have grown familiar over its 38-year presence, but they were often riveting, and no issue has delineated the state's racial chasm more clearly. There was plenty of partisanship among the crowd of about 3,000 who came to watch the flag's removal at noon today, and even a few unruly if nonviolent confrontations between the rowdiest elements at each end of the historical spectrum. But many in the crowd seemed both relieved and wistful, as if they would miss the emotional charge the debate had injected into public life. 
 "I can't remember when it wasn't up there," said Dwight Enroe, a 32-year-old diesel mechanic who drove his family of four down from Spartanburg for a last glimpse, even though he favors its removal. "For a while it seemed like that was all anybody talked about, that and video poker. What are we going to fight about now?"
By a strange and resonant coincidence, the other issue that has obsessed the state for the last decade -- the insistent spread of video gambling machines -- also came to an end this weekend. Thanks to a State Supreme Court decision last October, the 34,000 machines that had noisily overtaken most of the state's gas stations and convenience stores were illegal as of midnight Friday, the largest shutdown of a state's gambling industry in nearly a century.
The two issues were related principally by the intensity of the passions they created, and by their ability to eclipse virtually any other substantive discussion during legislative sessions and statewide elections. Amid the red tide of battle flags and the countervailing signs of "shame" at the Capitol today, many South Carolinians saw the holiday concurrence as a signal of renewal.
"This is a momentous weekend," said Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, who has campaigned prominently against both video poker and the flag. "After all these years of paralysis, the people of South Carolina finally rose up at the grass roots and got their representatives to respect their wishes. This state really can control its own destiny, and now we can get to education and everything else we put aside."
The vote to remove the Confederate flag from the dome and the Senate and House chambers came in May, after legislators finally tired of years of pressure from business and religious leaders, as well as a statewide tourism boycott imposed by the N.A.A.C.P. The moral argument against the flag as banner of slavery was ultimately unpersuasive; many suburban legislators who had previously supported the flag as a benign symbol of Southern heritage said the weariness of their constituents and the damage to the state's economy finally changed their minds.
But the decision came only after flag supporters insisted on a compromise, which was played out today a few seconds after the flag's removal: A smaller, square version of the flag, once carried by the Army of Northern Virginia, was raised by Confederate re-enactors on a pole at the main entrance to the Capitol, adjacent to a monument to rebel soldiers. The new flag was almost too small to catch a breeze this afternoon, but its continued presence on the Capitol grounds has infuriated many prominent blacks.
"It's clear that the movement to another flagpole was intended not to resolve the issue, but to continue the reign of the flag," said Dwight James, executive director of the state N.A.A.C.P. Conference, which conducted a silent protest march of about 800 people to the Capitol this morning. "They're trying to distract those who have called for economic sanctions against the state, but it won't work." The boycott has already shown some signs of weakening, but the organization plans to maintain it as long as the flag flies in its new location.
The end of video poker was likewise the result of a middle-class revolt against the enormous size of power of the gambling industry, which at its peak in 1999 was generating $3 billion in yearly revenue, mostly from players further down the economic ladder. A referendum against the machines was on the verge of passage last year when the state's high court beat the voters to it.
"It was the same group that ultimately came together against the flag, too," said Richard Gergel, a prominent Columbia lawyer who brought a racketeering lawsuit against the video industry. "They saw the social cost to the people who were gambling, and the economic cost to the state. And they finally made the political system respond."
But the gambling shutdown also had its costs. As the machines were unplugged, an estimated 3,000 people lost their jobs, many of them senior citizens who had been the required attendants in the game rooms.
"Everyone's here to say goodbye," said David Whigham, the general manager of Treasures, a chandelier-bedecked "casino" that was packed with last-minute players all day Friday. "The politicians and the churches thought they were ending some kind of vice, but really they were just breaking up a family."

HEADLINE: REPORTS SAY CHINA IS AIDING PAKISTAN ON MISSILE PROJECT

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
American intelligence agencies have told the Clinton administration and Congress that China has continued to aid Pakistan's effort to build long-range missiles that could carry nuclear weapons, according to several officials with access to the intelligence reports.
The revelations are complicating President Clinton's effort to win quick Senate passage of a bill establishing normal trade relations with China. 
 In a series of classified briefings on Capitol Hill, most recently on Thursday, the agencies have described how China stepped up the shipment of specialty steels, guidance systems and technical expertise to Pakistan, China's longtime strategic ally, after India and Pakistan set off rival nuclear tests in 1998.
Chinese experts have also been sighted around Pakistan's newest missile factory, which appears to be partly based on a Chinese design, and shipments to Pakistan have been continued over the past 8 to 18 months, several of the officials said.
On Tuesday, the administration is sending a large delegation to Beijing to raise the issue in detail, the first high-level negotiations over missile exports since November 1998.
The delegation will be headed by John Holum, senior adviser to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright for arms control, and will include several other high-ranking officials.
The talks were suspended for more than a year after the accidental American bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
A senior American general this week called the arming of Pakistan "a longer-range issue" that persists despite assurances from President Jiang Zemin of China to President Clinton two years ago that Beijing would review its aid to the country.
But the ties between China's military and Pakistan run deep -- both consider India their greatest threat -- and the general said "part of the issue is, we're not sure how much is going on that the Chinese hierarchy knows about."
Clinton administration officials, trying to head off action by Congress that could place new sanctions on China, say they have been encouraged that China has greatly reduced its weapons exports to the Middle East.
The White House has argued for several years that the Chinese have abided by agreements to halt exports of nuclear and chemical weapons to Iran, North Korea and other nations that the United States considers a strategic concern.
But the continuing exports of missile parts and technology to Pakistan are creating a raft of political problems, much as they did during the last presidential election, when Mr. Clinton decided in May 1996 not to punish China for the sale of $70,000 in equipment that helped Pakistan produce weapons-grade uranium. The latest revelations appear to be contributing to the reluctance of the Senate leadership to schedule a vote on permanent normal trading relations with China, a bill which already passed in the House.
Moreover, the administration fears that in order to win passage of the trade bill, it may have to accept a bill constraining China's exports of missile technology.
Sponsored by Senators Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican, and Robert G. Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, the bill would require the administration to monitor China's record on the spread of nuclear weapons. It would also impose automatic sanctions on companies or states if there is "credible evidence" of certain exports -- even though China has never signed the Missile Technology Control Regime, a voluntary accord to limit sales of missile technology.
Mr. Clinton would have the discretion to waive some of the penalties, but others would be automatic.
The bill only focuses on China, even though North Korea and other countries are believed by American intelligence agencies to be shipping full missile systems to Pakistan. Last month the administration lifted 50-year-old sanctions against North Korea, and there was no discussion even from conservatives in Congress about North Korea's aid to Pakistan.
It is possible that both Senator Thompson's measure and the trade bill could pass, but supporters of the trade measure fear Beijing's reaction if the tough sanctions legislation is passed.
Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee who opposes the Thompson-Torricelli legislation, said in an interview this week that both that bill and the new intelligence could greatly complicate or even imperil passage of normal trade relations with China.
The House has already approved the change in China's trading status -- part of the drive to make China a member of the World Trade Organization by the end of the year -- but any changes in the Senate version could send the legislation back to the House.
"If the Thompson bill passes, you might embolden people who do not want P.N.T.R. to go forward," Mr. Hagel said, using the shorthand for permanent normal trade relations. "It so complicates the issue that P.N.T.R. could fall as a result of its own weight. There are those in the Senate who wish that to happen."
The argument over the sanctions bill culminates seven years of struggle between the White House and Congress over which one will manage relations with China.
Critics of the administration's China policy, both Democrats and Republicans, argue that the White House has ignored a pattern of Chinese exports in order to avoid imposing sanctions that existing law requires. They argue that in the name of preserving a broader relationship with China, the Clinton administration is always leaping through loopholes in the sanctions laws.
The White House, in response, says that Congress confuses sanctions with a workable policy on trying to slow the spread of advanced weapons, and notes that the Thompson bill sets stricter requirements for Chinese behavior than international agreements do.
The dispute goes to the core of one of Mr. Clinton's major arguments in favor of normalizing trade relations with China: That a China more economically entwined with the rest of the world will become more cooperative on issues like stopping the spread of weapons.
"They know that divisions with the West on these nonproliferation issues could ultimately be bad for business," one senior American diplomat said.
"But Pakistan is a particularly difficult issue that runs up against their strategic relationship, and their rivalry with India," the official added. The resumption of aid to Pakistan, the official said, coincided with the tit-for-tat nuclear tests India and Pakistan set off in 1998, which the official said "fundamentally changed the strategic landscape."
One Congressional official familiar with the intelligence said that the Pakistanis "went to the Chinese and said, 'We know you have this agreement with the Americans, but we really need your help.' "
Since then, American intelligence agencies have detected a persistent flow of aid to Pakistan.
Twice in the past decade Washington has imposed sanctions on Beijing for its aid to Pakistan, once in 1991 and again in 1993. In 1994, to resolve the issue, China agreed to comply with the main provisions of the Missile Technology Control Regime and said it would no longer sell full M-11 missiles to Pakistan. But the Chinese are not signatories to the agreement, and the accord with the administration did not cover components and technology listed in an important annex to the missile accord.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL NOTEBOOK;
Campaign Contrasts Grow Starker

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 1

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush was all set and ready to go from New York City to Detroit on Tuesday when his campaign plane let out an enormous belch, drawing the attention of maintenance workers and stranding him and his entourage on the tarmac at La Guardia Airport. He seemed amused and unalarmed. "This is an optimistic campaign," the Texas governor joked to the reporters who were sitting several rows behind but plenty close enough to see and hear him.
When the delay dragged on, he wandered back, chatted about baseball and mused that a great virtue of this relatively unhurried stretch of the presidential campaign was that he had ample time to run and lift weights. He talked more about working out than working. There was just one public event on his campaign schedule for the day (although his morning was busy with several private meetings), and it was still many hours away. 
 Vice President Al Gore, meanwhile, was in Philadelphia, and had just finished a speech on energy and the environment that was chock-a-block with ideas, aspirations, painstakingly emphasized phrases and showy digressions, including a survey of transportation in the 20th century that began with horses, buggies and the environmental hazards they posed. "Feed lots were crowding out farmland," Mr. Gore noted. He then headed to a convention hall to address union workers, effortlessly switching his focus from pollution to occupational safety and quickly establishing that he knew a lot about that, too. If he ever truly relaxed, it was not evident. Then again, the reporters on his plane, Air Force Two, had no glimpse of his cabin up front, and Mr. Gore never did drop by to say hello.
And there, in the span of several hours, it was: the stark differences between the presumptive Republican and Democratic nominees for president, the widely divergent images they project to the world.
One breezes past the tough stuff in an effort to remain forever buoyant, and can come across as lighter than air. The other fairly bludgeons listeners with all that he knows, and can come across as aloof. Each politician's appearances this week, tracked by reporters who switched places to take a fresh look at the man they usually did not cover, captured these contrasting styles, which also happen to tap into the candidates' strengths and especially their weaknesses, what they must take advantage of and what they must overcome.
Mr. Bush's looseness and confidence may have something to do with his edge over Mr. Gore in most polls, but they also threaten to strain the appeal of levity to voters who undoubtedly want to look up to their president. Mr. Gore's diligence may have something to do with his need to catch up, but it also threatens to strain the appeal of gravity to voters who undoubtedly don't want their president to lecture them all the time.
The candidates' days on the campaign trail this week also revealed another potentially crucial difference. Mr. Bush, guarding an apparent lead, let himself focus more intensely on fund-raising than on talking points, and collected about $9.5 million for the Republican National Committee. Mr. Gore was more absorbed in making the argument for his candidacy, and collected only about $1.5 million for the Democrats.
Unlike Mr. Gore's fund-raisers, Mr. Bush's were closed to reporters, a strategic decision by Republicans, who said they worried that any discussion of the Texas governor and money served to reinforce their reputation as the party of the rich and to remind voters that Mr. Bush's candidacy has been fueled by an unprecedented sum of contributions.
Mr. Bush's aides even played down the tallies: the original estimate of money raised at a Tuesday breakfast of 55 people was $3 million, but the ultimate sum was $4 million. On Thursday, Mr. Bush did not have a single public campaign event, but he held a fund-raiser for the party in Dallas that brought in an estimated $4.5 million.
His public appearances earlier in the week were scripted to highlight the idea that he was a "different kind of Republican," one who would reach out to the minorities -- Latinos, blacks, immigrants, those with disabilities -- to whom his party had appeared indifferent if not hostile over the years.
But these events were so glancing and his level of engagement so minimal that he raised doubts about his commitment to the process of campaigning. He spoke in short spurts -- his longest event lasted about 15 minutes -- and he gave the impression that his mere presence was more important than what he actually said. He frequently skipped over policy and details and implored his listeners to vote for him, saying they should simply trust him, even though, as he said at one point, "until I'm the president, it's going to be hard for me to verify that I think I'll be more effective."
When he spoke at a news conference about being a "different kind of Republican," he simply declared that the party was not "anti-immigrant" or "anti-education," as some may have believed. But he did not try to build an argument.
"Unfairly but truthfully, our party has been tagged as being against things," he told reporters in Cleveland. "Anti-immigrant, for example. And we're not a party of anti-immigrants. Quite the opposite. We're a party that welcomes people."
"Slowly but surely," he concluded, "I'm beginning to change the imagery."
Yet in the same week, he spent an evening in New York with members of the Congress for Racial Equality, once a leading civil-rights organization, now a collection of black conservatives. On the dais with Mr. Bush were people thought to be descendants of Thomas Jefferson and his slave Sally Hemings, as well as Barry Slotnick, the lawyer for Bernhard H. Goetz, the subway shooter.
Mr. Bush seemed most comfortable not in front of audiences but one-on-one on his campaign plane, where he sets a tone of easy affability. There is an openness that is not possible on the more formal and restricted Air Force Two. On Monday, as reporters filed on board, the governor was standing in the press section scarfing down pizza and ready for chit-chat and hands-on schmoozing. He placed both paws on one reporter's shoulders, then pinched another on the cheek.
Unlike Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore did not banter all that much, but he did talk and talk. He talked about the environment in front of a modernized power plant in Philadelphia and about "community empowerment" in a meeting hall in Columbus, Ohio. He talked about the scourge of AIDS and "Afro-pessimism," or the wrong-headed belief that investment in Africa was a losing game.
And he was, or at least appeared to be, in full command of each of these topics. But he was also strangely unvarying in his approach, so that his quasi-professorial, follow-along-with-me-if-you-can tone of voice followed him everywhere he went, even into a small fund-raiser late Tuesday night in a penthouse apartment in Washington where only about 20 high-rolling donors had gathered.
He shared a personal story or two with them, but he also shared mini-tutorials on the evolution of the economy from the dark valley of stagflation in the late 1970's to the current peak of prosperity. He used the word now as a transition into each next point, the way a college instructor proceeding through an outline would. His pupils were standing at the edge of a plush living room, wine glasses in their hands, in poses decidedly less starched than Mr. Gore's language and demeanor.
That was late Tuesday; halfway through Thursday, the vice president stood on the roof of a building jutting out into Lake Michigan, with the skyline of Chicago as his backdrop. He was pushing more federal spending on light rail, and mentioned that Portland had a nifty system, which he had seen himself. He offered evidence in the form of lengthy aside.
"Each station celebrates the unique quality of life in Oregon," Mr. Gore said. "One of them has a scarecrow weather vane, bronze rails and other things that are uniquely representative of the rural heritage in that area. Another one, they had a contest where the families participated in making the tiles themselves, and each family had a separate tile and they all come together to make up the stop. And some of them put their baby's footprints in the tile."
This went on for well over a minute, before Mr. Gore finally said, "Now, Chicago, of course, is another great national model for mass transit." He had returned at last to the present place and time, but it was unclear how many people in the audience were still with him.

HEADLINE: Castro Says He Will Press Effort to Change U.S. Policy

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MANZANILLO, Cuba, July 1

 BODY:
Fresh from a victory with the return of Elian Gonzalez, President Fidel Castro vowed today to press a nationwide campaign for changing American policy toward Cuba, but suggested that he did not expect immediate success with either of the candidates to succeed Bill Clinton in the White House.
"Neither of them inspires any confidence whatsoever," Mr. Castro said in a written message read at the first rally since Elian returned home on Wednesday. "Whoever is the next president of the United States should know that here is Cuba with its ideas, its example and the rebelliousness of its people; that all aggression and all attempts to asphyxiate us or put us on our knees will be defeated." 
 A crowd estimated by officials at 300,000 packed the plaza of this historic town to hear a succession of speakers inveigh against the American trade embargo, which they said had caused billions of dollars of economic damage, and the Cuban Adjustment Act, which grants asylum to Cubans who reach American soil.
The crowd was told that that Cubans had to channel the same energy they used in the last seven months to call for Elian's return into a renewed fight against policies that the speakers said had weakened Cuba's economy and led people like Elian's mother to take to the sea in risky attempts to flee.
"Now begins the second stage that will also be triumphant," Raul Castro, the minister of the armed forces and the president's brother, said after the rally. "What other solution do we have? What other solution do the Americans have? Invade us? I would not like to see that because we would pay a terrible price. But they would pay as terrible a price as we have."
Just as he promised not to change their tactics, he insisted that there would be no change in Cuba's political system despite the speculation about what might happen when Mr. Castro, 72, dies.
"Now they talk about the famous transition," he said at a 15-minute news conference. "I have read hundreds of articles about that famous transition. Who will come after Castro? Will his brother be able to control the situation? Here, anybody can control the situation. You cannot cover the sun with your finger."
That theme has been sounded often in the last seven months, as the Cuban government found, for the first time in many years, that it had the overwhelming support of its people on the emotional issue of uniting a motherless boy with his father. Most of the people at the rally wore tiny pictures of Elian in the arms of his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
Behind the crowd, a billboard featured a quote from Jose Marti, the 19th-century poet and Cuban nationalist. "I am son of my son," read the quote. "In him I am reborn."
By trying to harness the rejoicing for the Gonzalez family and its victory, officials hoped to renew their revolution. Despite rumors that Mr. Gonzalez would be at the rally, he was at a seaside Havana house where his son and several friends are staying. Officials have insisted they would not use the boy in any public appearances. But they invoked the family's example often.
"Those who thought we would get tired have learned the reality," Felipe Perez Roque, the foreign minister, told the rally. "On a day like today we affectionately congratulate Juan Miguel Gonzalez, an exemplary father and son of a people who struggled for a noble cause, not just for his son, but to show that you cannot use a child for political manipulation."
The rally leavened harsh political talk with dance and music, including pieces in a traditional rural song style with improvised verses about Elian, the embargo and other issues. During the speeches, the rustle of tens of thousands of paper flags waved by the crowd was more common than applause.
People said they agreed with the goals of the new campaign, often repeating the same phrases about "doing away with the unjust laws."
In recent days, a number of Havana residents had said they needed a break after too many months of hectoring the United States.
"They get taken to the rallies and they shout, 'Elian! Elian!"' said one man who declined to identify himself. "This has been enough. They take you there and give you flags. It's like we're in a spaceship here."

HEADLINE: It's Not Just the Heat;
There Are Any Number of Miserable Reasons Not to Like Summer

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Ah. Summertime.
Why, you can venture outdoors, and party with mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus, ticks bearing Lyme disease and caterpillars waiting to emerge as gypsy moths. Or you can escape to the beach, as long as you're willing to pay a half-year's salary for a tiny saltbox, no view. Then again, to get away from the city, you probably need a car; to run it, you'll have to pay record gasoline prices. 
 O.K., so you could stay at home, too. Of course, you'd have to play electricity roulette with Consolidated Edison. But hey, at least there's a decent chance that your children will be moping as they hang around the house, thanks to the city's new mandatory summer school program for underachieving students.
Summertime, and the living is easy? Maybe that was the case in 1934, when the Gershwins wrote "Porgy and Bess" and set it in South Carolina. But in 2000, in New York, summer is actually threatening to be kind of a bummer, with residents plagued by problems like outdoor pestilence, indoor power outages, high-priced summer rentals and ill-fitting summer sandals.
No longer does summer automatically compute as the precious, stress-free cushion reinforced by sunny movies or golden memories. For some people, instead, there are so many expectations, expenses and pressures built into making summer a three-month whirlwind of great vacations, great camping experiences, great everything, that it may be tempting to simply declare: the heck with it.
"The difficulty with summer," mused former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who, though generally pro-summer, is aware of the other side of the coin, "is the difficulty you have with Christmas and Hanukkah."
"When Christmas and Hanukkah are approaching," he explained, "you are overwhelmed by this feeling that you're supposed to be joyous. And unless you're joyous, you're miserable. Well, summer is Christmas and Hanukkah for three months. We're going to let you out from school, we're going to release you from your high-rise offices, and what we want you to do is have a good time. And it's too much of a challenge."
To be fair, summer can supply a year's worth of nice stories about nice people having nice experiences. And besides, some dyed-in-the-wool New Yorkers aren't about to let a few inconveniences and irritations block their passion.
"If you are a New Yorker, you learned to roll with the punches a long, long time ago," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch. "I'm in love with the summer. I'm in love with the winter."
Still, some New Yorkers who view a glass as half-empty insist, with an occasional wink here and there, that this summer promises to be especially stressful. Just look at the rising cost of sleepaway camp an average of $3,000 for four weeks; the ever-longer knots of traffic; the Cassandra-like warnings against fireworks and undercooked food being hazardous to your health; and, of course, the vagaries in the weather.
But for anyone who has a car -- particularly a gas-thirsty sport utility vehicle -- this summer's big bane is the price of gasoline, which has almost doubled in a year. The spike has prompted some people to scale back or even cancel family trips and vacations, according to several recent surveys.
Staten Island residents have to endure extensive road closings on the Outerbridge Crossing -- a major funnel to the Jersey Shore. On the New Jersey Turnpike, E-ZPass won't be ready this summer, as planned; on the Garden State Parkway, E-ZPass won't reach the beaches of Belmar until late July, and Cape May until late September.
And once you get to the beach, you must pay skyrocketing rental prices, which, in some spots, like the Hamptons, are up to 20 percent higher than last year's, and almost double what they were five or six years ago.
Then there are the pests. Last fall, the West Nile virus killed 7 people and sickened 62 others in the metropolitan region; the virus has been detected this summer in dead crows in Rockland County and in Bergen County, N.J. So to guard against creating places for mosquitoes to breed, some people are discarding birdbaths instead of just changing the water frequently, while others are forbidding children from playing at dusk.
Keeping a close eye on your children is ever more crucial because of the growing number of bears popping up in the suburbs -- including one in Dobbs Ferry, in Westchester, last week. In New Jersey, some bears have killed livestock; some have rummaged through garbage cans and backyards.
In the Great South Bay on Long Island, the biggest outbreak in more than a decade of the microscopic algal bloom called "brown tide" is threatening clams, scallops, oysters and other marine life -- as well as the livelihood of local fishermen.
And in East Hampton, the main problem is the gypsy moth caterpillar. Bruce Cohen, who owns a public relations business in Manhattan, was reading the behemoth book "Gotham" on his deck in Water Mill last Saturday when a caterpillar, dark and hairy, fell on a page discussing New York City during the American Revolution. "It landed on the British," he noted.
Barry Murac, a broker at Cook Pony Farm Real Estate, says the caterpillars have chewed up so many tree leaves that some areas "look as if they've been in a forest fire." And with caterpillars dropping their waste onto all objects, many residents have soaked their lawn furniture in their swimming pools, have been loath to dine alfresco and have pulled the tops down on their convertibles.
"They're gross. They're disgusting," said Mr. Murac (referring to the moths, of course). "I wouldn't want to be eating anything outdoors that's blackened or encrusted."
This year, the caterpillars have stripped off the leaves of about 60,000 acres of trees in New Jersey. The insect has a natural population cycle of 8 to 10 years, but the speed of this year's resurgence has surprised experts.
Jonathan Forsell, the Essex County agricultural agent with the Rutgers Cooperative Extension service, told The Star-Ledger of Newark that damage from the caterpillar last year covered only 1,380 acres in Salem and Burlington Counties.
One way to avoid the perils of nature is to stay inside, of course. But that isn't necessarily a respite -- particularly if the weather is scorching and the demand for electricity outstrips supply. Last July, Washington Heights suffered a 19-hour blackout. On Monday, eight buildings on the Upper East Side lost power, stoking fears of another blackout.
Of course, with more people functioning as tireless cogs in a purring economy, the boundary between home and work becomes blurry, said C. Leslie Charles, the author of "Why Is Everyone So Cranky?" (Hyperion, 1999). From the inside of a cubicle, for 16 hours a day, summer may not feel different from the other seasons.
For fashionable and entrepreneurial women, the must-have mode of transport this summer to dinners, parties and weddings is a sandal with a tight strap just barely thicker than dental floss and a sole so thin it could probably double as fax paper.
As a result, some women say they have never seen so many blisters and Band-Aids on women's feet. Ever. To treat their wounds, some women keep a stash of Band-Aids in their purses and desks, as well as a pair of comfortable shoes for the office, to reduce the toe cramps.
"There's no support group yet, but there probably should be one: Scarred Feet Anonymous," said Malaika Danovitz, an account executive at the Geek Factory, a high-tech company in Lower Manhattan. "We just pray for the fall to come."

Softening Cuban Embargo

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
After weeks of negotiations, House Republican leaders agreed to language that would weaken the economic embargo against Cuba for the first time in four decades. The bill, pushed by Representative George W. Nethercutt Jr., a Washington Republican, would permit the direct sale of food to Cuba, similar to a policy allowing the sale of medicine. 
 But the legislation, designed to benefit agribusiness and to shore up Mr. Nethercutt's re-election chances, is so loaded down with restrictions that it is more a symbolic step toward normalizing Cuban-American relations than it is a boon to farmers. LIZETTE ALVAREZ

Borrowers Misled

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The nation's sixth-largest credit-card company, the Providian Financial Corporation, agreed to reimburse the millions of customers it had misled and improperly billed. Providian will pay at least $300 million to about three million consumers, according to the federal and California officials who signed the agreement with the corporation. Over the last five years, Providian convinced people, many of them with poor credit histories, to sign up for cards with higher fees and interest rates than were apparent. DAVID LEONHARDT

HEADLINE: Is Retirement a Gift or a Burden?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
William Safire suggests indexing the Social Security retirement age to life expectancy (column, June 26) both to improve Social Security's finances and to keep our minds active and healthy. But America is the most productive country in the world. Forcing the retirement age to 72 would be a slap in the face of the millions of American workers who work long and hard every day.
For the wealthy, retirement age is a moot point. For the rest of us, retiring with our minds and bodies intact is a dream fulfilled. A full Social Security benefit cuts across class lines without punishing those at the lowest income levels. 
 A more equitable way to increase Social Security financing is to lift the cap on taxable income and bring all state and local employees into the system.

Two American Anthems, in Two American Voices

BYLINE: By JODY ROSEN; Jody Rosen, a freelance writer in New York, is working on a book about Irving Berlin's "White Christmas."

 BODY:
IN October 1938, Irving Berlin came home to New York from the London premiere of his latest musical film, "Alexander's Ragtime Band," determined to write a "peace song" -- an anthem to soothe an American public weary from the Depression years and unnerved by the specter of Europe on the brink of war.
For over a quarter of a century, Berlin had been the country's leading songwriter, a pop poet laureate with an unwavering feel for the vagaries of mass taste. He had spent the better part of the 1930's at work in the Hollywood fairy-tale factory, feeding public desire for buoyant escapism with little masterpieces of tuneful, elegant insouciance: "Isn't This a Lovely Day?," "Top Hat, White Tie and Tails," "I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm." But by the autumn of 1938, history had caught up with pop culture's bon vivants in evening clothes. Millions of Americans were still unemployed and destitute; Hitler was menacing Europe -- the Munich pact had just been signed -- Spain was rent by civil war, and suddenly, the spectacle of Fred Astaire twirling through a penthouse with a cocktail shaker felt decadent and unseemly. 
 Berlin set out to write a song that was the antithesis of 30's cosmopolitan cool -- an earnest, spirit-boosting anthem for troubled times. He made several unsuccessful passes at the project before he remembered a number he had abandoned two decades earlier: a bit of purplish patriotic verse, set to a rousing tune, originally written in 1918 for his World War I-themed revue, "Yip Yip Yaphank." Berlin dragged out the old song, tinkered with a few lines, adjusted a musical phrase and gave it to Kate Smith, the radio star whose wholesome image and fervent vocal style were a perfect match for the song's rostrum-pounding sentimentality.
Smith introduced "God Bless America" on her radio show on Armistice Day, Nov. 11, 1938. It was an instant sensation. Within weeks, the song was ubiquitous: crackling across radio airwaves, sung in churches, schools and ballparks, widely championed as a replacement for Francis Scott Key's ungainly "The Star-Spangled Banner." In a war-era pop culture filled with mawkish and bellicose patriotism, "God Bless America" stood out: more of a benediction than a rally-round-the-flag fight song, it both registered Americans' anxiety and provided a sense of reassurance and communal uplift. It was, in a hit-making career that spanned six decades, perhaps the greatest single example of Berlin's populist largesse. "A good song embodies the feelings of the mob," he once said. "And a songwriter is not much more than a mirror which reflects those feelings."
BUT not every American took solace in the skyward-striving strains of "God Bless America." In the winter of 1940, Woody Guthrie was bedeviled by the song: everywhere he went, Kate Smith's belting seemed to follow him; the more he heard the song, the angrier he got.
Guthrie may have been the only other major American songwriter as prolific as Berlin; in almost every other way, he was Berlin's opposite. While Berlin spent the Great Depression writing tunes for Broadway shows and Hollywood musicals, living in a plush Manhattan apartment and camping out in Beverly Hills hotel suites, Guthrie lived as a hobo, crisscrossing the West in railroad cars, working odd jobs, churning out wry, politically pointed folk songs on an acoustic guitar that bore the legend "This Machine Kills Fascists."
By 1940, Guthrie had landed in New York, where on Feb. 23, in a fleabag Midtown Manhattan hotel, he pulled out his guitar and, using a tune lifted from the Baptist hymn "Oh My Lovin' Brother," composed a six-verse song. Guthrie's Great Depresssion miseries had radicalized his politics, and in "God Bless America" he heard just the kind of uncritical jingoism he despised. This new song was Guthrie's answer: a patriotic epic, which, like Berlin's, used pastoral imagery to evoke an America of mystical grandeur.
"From the mountains/ To the prairies/To the oceans, white with foam," Berlin wrote. "God bless America, my home sweet home."
"When the sun come shining, then I was strolling/ In the wheat fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling/ The voice was chanting as the fog was lifting:/ God blessed America for me," went Guthrie's rejoinder.
Today, Guthrie's hand-written lyric sheet still bears its original title: "God Blessed America." But the world knows the song by the title Guthrie used when he recorded a revised version in 1945: "This Land Is Your Land."
This call and response between revered troubadours is one of the most piquant episodes in American pop music -- a tale whose mix of mid-century politics and national myth-making and whose turbulent backdrop of Depression and world war could fuel a semester's worth of American studies seminars.
But the story of "God Bless America" and "This Land Is Your Land" resonates most forcefully today not as a class battle between the Broadway millionaire and the Popular Front minstrel, not even as a clash of conflicting ideas about patriotism, but as a parable about musical populism. Pitting Tin Pan Alley's greatest dream-weaver against the archetypal renegade balladeer, pitting urban pop sophistication and music industry muscle against homespun folk, the Berlin-Guthrie skirmish is emblematic of a question that continues to roil a music culture obsessed with authenticity: who speaks in the true musical voice of the American people?
In the rock era, that question has been answered with an emphatic endorsement of Guthrie and the gritty tradition he represents. Berlin's Tin Pan Alley ethos -- that ardent dedication to "the mob" -- is regarded in the rock world as a false populism: lowest-common-denominator music that plies the people with the spun sugar they want. The theory of populism that prevails in American music culture today, dominating its iconography and mythologies, coloring its criticism and historiography, exalts Guthrie and his rock heirs for giving the people something more profound: a liberating blast of the truth that they need.
Though Guthrie's catalog remains a source of inspiration for innumerable songwriters, it is his image as a rogue cultural critic, armed with a guitar and his hard-won folk wisdom, which has most deeply marked rock culture. In Guthrie, rock recognizes a spiritual ancestor to its contrarians, misfits and provocateurs: a prototype not just for folkie protest singers, but for all musical rebels who refuse to compromise, from hip-swiveling Elvis Presley running roughshod over sexual proprieties to punk rock agitators to hard-boiled gangsta rappers.
Rock culture has also absorbed Guthrie's anti-pop animus. A self-declared singer of "peoples ballads," Guthrie loathed Tin Pan Alley music -- its grandiose production values, cloying sentiments and "sissy-voiced" crooners. His aversion to "God Bless America" was as much aesthetic as political: to Guthrie, Berlin's song was a supreme example of Tin Pan Alley's empty artifice and bloated emotionalism. In place of schmaltz, Guthrie offered grit and unflinching realism; at the bottom of the sheet on which he had scrawled the lyrics to "This Land Is Your Land," Guthrie noted: "All you can write is what you see."
That commitment to realism is alive in a rock culture that makes strenuous efforts to distinguish itself from the corrupting commercialism of pop; in the perennial hip-hop vow to "keep it real"; in the spectacle of rock bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam bewailing their chart-topping success; in the purist politics that dominate music scenes like indie rock and techno, in which bands jockey for underground credibility amid recriminations about "selling out." Rock critics, in particular, have imbibed the anti-capitalist/social realist thrust of the Guthrie-led folk movement, often favoring even banal iconoclasm to well-made commercial pop, ignoring the fact the rebels they lionize are themselves professional musicians -- as Guthrie was before them.
This rock populism has, in many ways, served the music well. For almost 50 years, rock, in all its incarnations, has remained remarkably trenchant and politically potent music, reinvigorating itself, time and again, with fresh sounds and new voices from the cultural fringe.
But rock populism is problematic when projected back into musical history. The official history describes the genre's rise as a victory of rugged, rustic folk culture over Tin Pan Alley's high-toned treacle. It was, the story goes, a triumph of the heroic proletarians who are enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: folk singers (Guthrie and Leadbelly), cowboy balladeers (Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams), blues legends (Robert Johnson, Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey). Though rock 'n' roll has traveled far from that musical promised land of dust bowls, deltas, Appalachian valleys and hilltop churches, it has preserved its indomitable spirit and broadcast its down-home verities to the world.
This is a lovely story, and there is truth in it; but like most polemical narratives, rock's myth of origins ignores inconvenient historical facts: the music's debts to Tin Pan Alley pop. Those debts exist, and not just in obvious places like the highly crafted music of the Brill Building and the Motown song-mills. Rock's power, which -- from Elvis to Bob Dylan to Lauryn Hill -- is so reliant on the magnetism of superstar performers, could not have existed were it not for the vaudevillians and crooners who pioneered that role: Al Jolson, Sophie Tucker, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra. And were it not for George M. Cohan, Jerome Kern, George Gershwin and, of course, Berlin, rock 'n' roll would simply not have had a pop-culture flag to capture in the first place. As the critic Gary Giddins has written: "To the extent that our lives are measured in song, we live in the Irving Berlin Era."
By rock's own criteria, Berlin's populist credentials would seem to be impeccable. A self-taught musician who never learned musical notation and could play piano only in the key of F sharp, Berlin registers with the rock mythology that glorifies ragged garage bands over slick professionals. There can hardly be a more genuine working-class hero than the dirt-poor Lower East Side street urchin who left home and school at 13 and plunged into the Bowery demimonde, sleeping in flophouses and tenement vestibules, scraping a living as a song plugger, sometime street busker and, eventually, singing waiter in a Chinatown brothel and opium den.
But if Berlin's low-born pedigree is unassailable, and his journey a picaresque that makes Guthrie's hard-knock rambling look genteel, his crowd-pleasing songs and unembarrassed aspirations unmask him as the bourgeois that rock culture abhors. Lushly melodic, unapologetically romantic, mixing slangy colloquialism and bursts of wit aimed at higher brows, classic Tin Pan Alley pop was music made for a broad middle-class mainstream of white adults -- an audience that turned to music not for unvarnished truth, but an enchanting reflection of its fondest desires and most cherished illusions.
If the song standards of that pre-civil rights, pre-feminist epoch strike us today as blithely ethnocentric, it should be remembered that they were the result of a social struggle in many ways as significant as those that have inflected rock's history. Tin Pan Alley was dominated in both its creative and business spheres by Jews, and the music it gave to the world was the music of assimilation, a distinctly New World concoction: the result of a people's terrific striving for social acceptance and a piece of the American pie. "God Bless America" -- that hymn of gratitude composed by the man born Israel Baline, who arrived at Ellis Island in 1893 as a 5-year-old refugee from the pogrom-scourged shtetl of Tyumen in Siberia -- is a milestone of Jewish-American acculturation matched perhaps only by another Berlin magnum opus, "White Christmas": a symbol of the way in which the Jews who wrote songs and founded movie studios reinvented American popular culture in their own image.
Rock culture wants no part of this story of middle-class arrivistes: it looks past Tin Pan Alley to other ancestors with more hard-bitten images and more colorful struggles. These days, those forebears aren't just haunting the pages of rock histories: they're hip. Spurred by the 1997 rerelease of the seminal "Anthology of American Folk Music" -- a collection of recordings from the 20's and 30's, compiled in 1958 by the musicologist Harry Smith -- "primitive" roots music is hotter than it has been in decades. This time it isn't just folk aficionados worshipping Smith's mountain string bands, Piedmont bluesmen and Bible chanters. The techno star Moby's hit album "Play" is filled with samples from old spirituals, blues and field hollers. At Other Music, the NoHo temple of record collector chic, shoppers who jostle to buy the latest drum 'n' bass imports and the new Belle and Sebastian album can take home "Prayers From Hell: White Gospel and Sinners Blues, 1927 to 1940" and "American Yodeling: 1911 To 1946," and have made the just-released fourth volume of Harry Smith's anthology one of the store's top sellers. The music's street credibility is mirrored by the mystique conferred upon it by rocks mandarins: the critic Greil Marcus has romanticized the anthology as "an occult document," the mysterious sound of "the old, weird America."
THERE is a parallel body of recordings in Tin Pan Alley pop -- musical artifacts of an America that is just as old and weird, yet today is all but forgotten. Those songs, preserved on cylinder recordings and 78-r.p.m. records, date from the period that preceded the heyday of the smooth Broadway and Hollywood song standard: the rambunctious heights of vaudeville, before, during and just after the First World War. They are the urban equivalent of the songs found on Harry Smith's anthology: long-lost songs by long-dead singers, dizzying in their variety and disorientingly bizarre.
Berlin's output from the period is representative of that music's eclecticism: a madcap mix of ethnic parody songs, dance numbers, syrupy "high-class" ballads, ersatz rags, rakish novelty tunes. The titles alone evoke the freewheeling optimism of an America being transformed by its big cities, loosening morals, new immigrants and new machines: "Keep Away From the Fellow Who Owns an Automobile," "Jake! Jake! The Yiddisher Ball-Player," "I Was Aviating Around," "My Wife's Gone to the Country (Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!)," "The Elevator Man Going Up, Going Up, Going Up, Going Up!"
In these oddball songs, we hear not only pop music being invented as a mass medium, but a new nation being born: it is melting-pot music, the sound of a polyglot America emerging from its Victorian past and striding jauntily into the century it would claim as its own. This clarion call of modernity was perceived, quite rightly, as a threat to the cultural dominion of the Anglo-American middle-class. Tin Pan Alley pop packed as much anti-establishment menace as the most outre rebel rock: with unabashed anti-immigrant bias, newspaper pundits thundered about the threat to public morality posed by the "suggestive" lyrics and manic ragtime-influenced rhythms emerging from New York's Jewish-run song factories. Some of the first folk music revivals date from this period, sponsored not by righteous lefties but by wealthy nativists seeking to bolster the indigenous culture imperiled by the toxic spread of "Hebrew Broadway jazz."
You won't find recordings of those vaudeville tunes at Other Music. No D.J.s have layered breakbeats over samples from Jolson 78's; no independent record label has released a smartly packaged compilation of "Primitive Pop." While a new generation of hipsters learn to treat the songs of Blind Willie Johnson and the Carter Family as holy writ, vaudeville-era pop, expunged from American music's official history, languishes in music libraries and on the shelves of obscure collectors, condemned to the most inglorious of pop culture oblivions: it is nostalgia music, the secret joy of a few crackpot old-timers.
The blame for this historiographical mess cannot be ascribed solely to rock culture: there has been plenty of provincialism to go around. In the 1950's, when rock 'n' roll dislodged Tin Pan Alley pop from cultural center stage, the shrillest rhetoric came from the older generation. In 1958, Frank Sinatra called rock 'n' roll "the most brutal, ugly, desperate, vicious form of expression it has been my misfortune to hear." Berlin, in a fit of petulance, tried to stop radio stations from playing Elvis Presley's recording of "White Christmas." There is more than a hint of tin-eared snobbery in today's champions of pop song standards: lurking behind their paeans to the "golden age of popular song" is the assumption that melodic sophistication and lyrical wit disappeared from pop music the day rock 'n' roll blazed in, riding a wave of African-American rhythm.
It is pleasant to think that, in the year 2000, we might get past all this -- that we'll leave the old resentments and misapprehensions behind with the old century, and hear that century's music afresh. It's time to pitch a musical big tent: time to scold the lover of a Gershwin tune who can't hear the beauty in James Brown, in the Notorious B.I.G., in Lucinda Williams; time to celebrate the common tradition that links "The Yankee Doodle Boy" and "Hellhound on My Trail" and "Stardust" and "Respect" and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Nuthin' but a G Thang" and "God Bless America" and "This Land Is Your Land."
As we approach the first Independence Day of the new millennium, those two great national anthems of the American century are a reminder that, despite decades-long attempts to reduce it to genre myths and freight it with false politics, American pop music won't be tamed. It is, like our fondest hopes for the country that produced it, an improbably eclectic, wildly democratic thing: one grand, raffish, indivisible musical tradition, made for you and me.

In Defense of Luxury

BYLINE: By SCOTTY DUPREE; Scotty Dupree, who was editor of Luxe magazine, which covered the marketing of luxury products, lives in Briarcliff Manor.

 BODY:
I WAS disappointed by Hubert B. Herring's article "Coping with Luxury Fever" (June 25). His stilted view of current luxury trends offended me.
I was disturbed to see that he used only a few select points from Robert Frank's book "Luxury Fever" to illustrate his ire. The quotes he chose misrepresented the book, leaving me wondering if Herring has read it. Frank, an economist at Cornell, uses examples of the current luxury boom to win the reader to his economic view. What he proposes is a newer version of a system this country has spent nearly 100 years fighting: Communism. Our personal and economic freedoms allow me to make the choices I do, which often include dropping my teenage stepdaughter at her school in my sports utility truck. In the truck my family is safe and comfortable; that I drive my daughter door-to-door despite gridlock gives me a valuable 5 or 10 minutes more of precious time with her. Are safety, comfort and time with your children a luxury? 
 That the luxuries that Mr. Herring sees as selfish and destructive have become commonplace not only in Westchester but also in most areas of the country, demonstrates that our system works.
But Mr. Herring missed the real point. He noted that Westchester "is one of the nation's richest counties, so you would think that all that money could buy an awfully good way of life." I, too, thought that when I moved here two years ago. Unfortunately, it is not so. Despite a wealthy population, Westchester's retail is a cross between the Third World and relics from the 1950's. Its grocery stores rival those of Manhattan for their narrow aisles, bad lighting and out-of-date products on the shelves. If shoppers want to go to Putnam County, where the income levels don't approach those of Westchester, the grocery stores are modern with gourmet sections rivaling Zabar's. Connecticut boasts dozens of fresh grocers, such as Hay Day and Fresh Fields, which specialize in fresh and organic produce and gourmet goods not available in most grocery chains.
And food retailing is only the beginning. In recent years Westchester got its first Price Club, a concept that has become a suburban necessity that the rest of the country has had for 15 years or more. Also in recent years the county got its first Circuit City store; previously residents were forced to pay top dollar for less than top-of-the-line products at a limited number of stores.
The county recently witnessed a huge battle to build a Stew Leonard's, Costco and Home Depot on a large rocky tract on the Thruway in Yonkers. At issue was the quality of life of Yonkers residents.
What is more important to the quality of life: keeping traffic down (even though it brings with it more tax revenue and jobs) or fresh and competitively priced goods? If we don't keep our marketplaces competitive with new entrants and more choices, all of us -- rich and poor alike -- will be forced to pay ransom-like prices for basic necessities such as bread and milk.
Westchester's retail community seems to operate as a complete contradiction to American economic philosophy that supposes that consumers rule the marketplace with the power of their dollar.
In Westchester there often is no marketplace, so consumers drive to Connecticut or New Jersey to shop. I would welcome more development in my neighborhood, as would many of my neighbors. But with residents like Mr. Herring objecting to the simplest luxuries, such as driving our children to school, it is unlikely that Westchester retail will achieve 20th century standards for another few hundred years.

Watch Out Barney! Here Comes Zebby.

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER; E-mail address: lijournal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
YOUNG children like to watch the same videos and listen to the same music cassettes over and over again. But repeatedly hearing their syrupy songs often makes parents cringe.
Enter Tim, Ed, Matt Wahl and Nora Wahl Firestone, siblings nurtured on the music of Van Halen, Madonna and the Grateful Dead, raised watching "Sesame Street" and "The Electric Company." If a purple dinosaur named Barney could capture the hearts -- and ears -- of millions of children, why couldn't they come up with a character who could enchant grown-ups too? 
 Four years ago, Ed Wahl, 33, a Nassau County police officer, and Matt Wahl, 26, an officer with the New York Police Department, wrote a rock 'n' roll soundtrack, using the same beat as the music they loved growing up in the Plainedge school district. Canvassing the alphabet, the Wahls chose a zebra as their star. Why? It was the only animal they could think of that wasn't already a known character.
The strategy worked. Recently, "Zebby's Zoo," believed to be the first nationally syndicated children's program conceived and produced on Long Island, was picked up by America One, the cable and satellite network. Added to Telecare, where the show has been broadcast twice a day, five times a week since its inception, and WLIW where it airs Saturday mornings at 7:30, "Zebby's Zoo" can now be seen in 62-million homes nationwide.
"It's 'Sesame Street' on steroids," said Tim Wahl, 32, who produces the half-hour show and runs the business end of the fast-growing "Zebby Zoo" empire out of his Westbury home. "It's very simple, but it's what the kids love; it's what the kids want to see," he said. "It's very upbeat. It's something that the parents could really relate to. It's something that's easily tolerated."
Even by their mother. There was Karen Wahl, 56, on the stage at the Nassau County Fair in Uniondale recently, dressed in a Zebby the Zebra costume, dancing her way across the stage.
From across the midway, by stroller and on foot, came the toddler and kindergarten set, gathering at the foot of the stage to sing and dance along with the zebra. "Do the Zebby, do the Zebby. . . ." blared from the speakers. While Zebby and a friend, the Lazy Lion, hoofed, Tim Wahl pulled out a table laden with Zebby T-shirts, audio and video cassettes and Beanie-Baby knockoffs of Zebby.
Merchandising, after all, is what "Zebby's Zoo" is all about.
The children's entertainment program started with online sales of music cassettes. The characters weren't brought to life until the Wahls created the television show. By then, thousand of videos, cassettes and stuffed animals had been sold.
"A TV show is developed and promoted and if it is successful, they go to the next step, which is licensing or manufacturing the merchandise," Tim Wahl said. "We went exactly the opposite way. We didn't do it that way by accident. That was our objective. We knew from the beginning that we didn't have the experience in the TV industry and we didn't have the budget to do a Manhattan- style shoot where we could shoot 52 episodes. So we said first things first, let's get people to identify with who the Zebby Zoo character is."
Tim Wahl, after all, had been wholesaling 8,000 to 10,000 units a week of licensed "Sesame Street," Barney and Arthur products. He knew the market. His brothers knew music.
"A lot of the stuff I write in my head while I'm working," said Ed Wahl, concentrating on lessons about manners, safety, family values, counting and spelling. He then sings the compositions into his answering machine.
Along with other partners, the Wahls have invested $350,000 in "Zebby's Zoo." They expect to turn a profit by the end of the year.
When the Telecare show started, Tim Wahl said, hits to the Zebby Web site -- www.Zebbyszoo.com -- soared. Fans, known as Zebheads, started chat rooms. A live "Zebby's Zoo" production at the Westbury Music Fair soon followed. Earlier this year, two shows at the Vanderbilt in Plainview were standing room only at $12 a ticket.
"We had a solid foundation," Tim Wahl said. "We had 120,000 kids ages 2 to 7 in Nassau and Suffolk county who not only knew who Zebby Zoo was, but they had merchandise in their bedroom they could identify with. We felt that really helped propel the TV show to its popularity."
Seven minutes of each episode -- 72 have been made -- are shot on location around the Island, from the Hewlett Fire Department to the Long Island Game Farm in Manorville and the jungle gym in Wantagh Park.
And Zebby has a new line of sliced white bread, baked at Zebby's Bread Company in Toronto. Already one million 24-ounce loaves have been sold. The bread is available at some Costcos, King Kullens, Farmers Bazaars, Key Foods, C-Towns and Waldbaums. Zebby's doughnuts will be out in the fall.
And the Wahls are compiling "Zebby Songs," an album of 13 popular songs, like Woody Guthrie's "This Land is Your Land," sung by the zebra. (Several vocalists sing Zebby's role; a search is under way for a single voice.)
Still, the show is not technologically sophisticated. Animation is done in a friend's basement in Franklin Square. "We didn't feel we had to compete with "Sesame Street" and Barney," said Tim Wahl, looking to take "Zebby's Zoo" to the next level. "There are always going to be kids. There are always going to be parents. Even if the economy is down, if the parents have $10 in their pockets they are going to buy their kid a toy before they buy themselves lunch. If we can turn on the kids, that's great, but if we can turn on their parents, it's a double whammy."
 
Spanish in English
For the cover of the inaugural issue of Latin Long Island, Ed Diaz chose a photograph of many of the leaders of the Hispanic community. "We're here," Mr. Diaz said recently at a party at the Huntington Town House celebrating the launching of the new magazine. "We're not going anywhere. We want to be recognized."
Among the featured movers and shakers: Yvonne Pena, executive director of the Suffolk County Human Rights Commission; Pilar Delgado, staffing coordinator for Sterling Personnel Services in Hauppauge; and Miriam Garcia, executive director of Adelante of Suffolk County, the cultural and civic center in Brentwood that sponsors the Hispanic Day Parade and myriad job training, youth leadership and social services.
"There are a lot of misconceptions and misperceptions about Latinos on Long Island," Mr. Diaz said. "That can be overcome by highlighting the positive in our community. This magazine is about bringing people together."
The second issue, due out later this month, will feature Jack Gallagher, chief executive officer of North Shore/LIJ Health Care System. Mr. Gallagher's mother was Colombian.
Twelve years ago, Mr. Diaz, of Babylon, the owner of a collections agency, helped found the Long Island Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The glossy new publication, he said, is the next step and the proper venue to both tout the Island's top Hispanics and create a forum to bridge the communications gap between different Latino communities. Latin Long Island, however, is published in English.
"This magazine will allow people who don't know about the Latino community, who don't read or speak Spanish to read a publication that will highlight the creme de la creme of the Latinos, learn what we are all about and the contributions we make to Long Island, " Mr. Diaz said. Included among those potential readers of the soon-to-be monthly magazine, he noted, are English-speaking advertising executives who place ads in local Spanish periodicals like Hoy or Noticias but can't read their own copy.
"I am anxious to overcome some of that ignorance that still is out there," Mr. Diaz said. "Some people will perceive Latinos out of ignorance as unsophisticated, being worthy of only low-paying jobs in restaurants and assembly lines and that not what we're all about."
Latinos own more than 5,000 Long Island businesses, come from 26 different countries and live in communities from Riverhead to Freeport, Glen Cove and Brentwood. What they have in common is the Spanish language, although by the second generation, many no longer use it, Mr. Diaz said.
Mr. Diaz was born in the Bronx. Though his parents spoke Spanish, English was always his main language.
"In my English-dominant world, practically every person I know here who is Hispanic watches very little Spanish language television and rarely ever reads Spanish language newspapers," he said.

HEADLINE: No Blues for This Bowling Alley

BYLINE: By STACEY STOWE

 BODY:
IN a bygone era, someone might have made a musical about it: neighborhood families buy a 60-year-old bowling alley for $20,000 and fix it up by chipping in money and elbow grease.
A stockbroker figures out a business plan and a lawyer checks legal issues. A pair of architects orchestrate renovations. A mother of three decides to return to the workforce as manager. Teenagers volunteer to paint and ask for part-time jobs. In this kind of plot, Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland could pop up at the shoe rental counter and break into song. 
 But those fresh-faced youngsters would be upstaged. It's the twinkly-eyed grown-ups who sing the praises of owning a 16-lane duckpin alley in the West End section of Hartford.
"The first thing I hear when I tell people about buying it is, 'What a cool thing to do with a mid-life crisis'," said Christine Palm. Ms. Palm, the mother of four boys and the editor of a local paper, The West End News, said she heard through the grapevine that the alley was to close. She and her husband, James Baker, a graphic artist, considered buying it to prevent another neighborhood business from closing. Phone calls to five other couples confirmed their sentiment.
Not only did those first few friends want in, within several weeks the number of interested families climbed. Over the period of a few months, 23 families committed to the purchase. The initial cost of $20,000 was split 23 ways, but the families also raised an extra $44,000 for renovations. Although revenue from the bowling alley isn't the source of their primary income, the families formed a limited-liability corporation to protect their assets. The corporation is managed by three partners: Ms. Palm; John Gale, a lawyer; and Avery Buell, a stockbroker, all long-time West Enders.
"Our biggest concern was liability," said Susan Russell, who stepped forward to manage the lanes now known as the Alley. "We wondered, if it goes under will we lose our first-born child?" Yet the idea of a communally owned alley was so popular, would-be investors had to be turned away; a week before its May 27 grand opening, a neighborhood businessman stepped among the paint cans and asked if he could become an owner.
Serendipity also stepped in. The landlord, Steven Neiditz, whose father and uncle owned the building for longer than he could remember, offered things like a month-to-month lease. The alley purchase coincides with the publication of a book by a Harvard professor that asserts Americans need to join clubs, specifically bowling leagues. "Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of Community in America" (Simon & Schuster), by Robert D. Putnam, makes a case that belonging to clubs like bowling leagues increases "human connectedness," and the trickle-down effect is improved relations within families and between people of different race, culture and economic levels. "One of them dropped me a note, and when I found out about what they were doing, I thought it was the kind of grass-roots initiative that if it were emulated in other communities around the country, could significantly increase social connectedness," Mr. Putnam said in a telephone interview from his home in New Hampshire.
Mr. Putnam's words echo what these mostly middle-aged professionals say they hope to accomplish.
They have plans to sponsor events in conjunction with their neighborhood elementary school. On a recent weekday, Ms. Palm was fielding calls from a shelter for homeless young women about a trip to the bowling alley. The Mayor of Hartford, Mike Peters, bought $500 worth of tickets that are kept at the alley for children who wander in to bowl, but don't have enough money.
Hank Murray, a labor lawyer who has lived in the West End with his family since 1977, said many residents were drawn to the area because of its racial and cultural diversity, not likely to be found in suburban neighborhoods. It was Mr. Murray who contacted Mr. Putnam.
Buying the Alley, opened 60 years ago as Mark Twain Lanes after the city's favorite son, was a way to keep the neighborhood alive, and the active social network was the means to the purchase, Mr. Murray said. "We weren't going to have one more neighborhood business bite the dust," he said. "We were still smarting from the closing of Cheese & Stuff," added Ms. Russell.
Cheese & Stuff was a grocery store specializing in organic foods that was emblematic of the funky style so dear to West Enders. It sold bulk flour and cereal as well as pricey prepared fare, organic produce and bath soaps. The staff was racially diverse and likely to dress in tie-dyed clothes and Birkenstock sandals. In the last decade, it was what remained of a corner that once included a shop that sold crystals as well as a feminist bookstore and restaurant.
Earlier this spring, the owners of Cheese & Stuff, the Wild Oats grocery store chain, announced it was closing the Farmington Avenue store and relocating to tonier West Hartford. West Enders wrote letters to the editor and picketed, saying they were promised by the store's owners that the market would stay put. In the end, it moved and the site is still empty.
Residents described the West End as a place where people meet on the sidewalk, walking dogs or following children on bicycles. On warm summer nights, someone is usually having a neighborhood cook-out. Most blocks have a book club. There is a mixture of multi- and single-family houses, most of them from the Victorian era or early 1900's. Most of the yards are well-tended, but some boast a charming lack of perfection.
The Alley purchase is not the neighborhood's first foray into business. Fifteen years ago, neighbors stepped forward when Mo's Midtown, a small and immensely popular diner near the Alley, was scheduled to close. A few families bought it and held it for six months, until a Mo's waitress raised the money to buy it herself.
The 23 families bought the bowling alley from an East Granby couple, Nancy and Jim Gesuelle, who owned it for more than 10 years and had spent close to $100,000 renovating and replacing the machinery and lanes. Mr. and Mrs. Gesuelle each work full time at the Cigna Insurance Company. They said they sold the business, formerly known as Farmington Avenue Duckpin to spend more time with their two school-aged daughters.
The Gesuelles said there were offers to buy the alley for the pin-setting machines, but that would have meant ending its 60-year streak as a bowling alley.
"It was a love of the sport that caused us to buy it in the first place," Mrs. Gesuelle said. "I'm happy we found people who will keep it going."
"There's also selfish impulse here," said Lindsey Karl, the architect who with her husband, Michael Cannon, led the renovations. "We want a place for our kids to go." The couple have two teenagers.
To this end, the Alley will be smoke-free, but the owners are divided over whether to have a liquor license. Although the sale of liquor means higher profits, it also makes the atmosphere less family-friendly, owners said. Many of the owners place a premium on this quality.
"I don't put up with what I call trash talk," said Ms. Russell, who as manager will be stalking the lanes to insure teenagers behave. There won't be computerized bowling either, bucking a growing trend at 10-pin lanes. The Alley owners want their children to add scores the old-fashioned way, to hone their math skills.
Nostalgia for things past, however, was ultimately trumped by taste when it came to the Alley's interior. Dark paneling was taken down. Walls were repainted. A soda fountain and cafe were built. Laser bowling with its glow-in-the-dark lights was installed to lure teenagers. Four lanes of anchored chairs were ripped out to make room for a dance area where salsa and tango lessons are planned.
For maintenance and repair of the pin-setting machines, the owners turned to John Gorman, a professional bowler who has worked at the lanes for many years.
There is a growing sense that the endeavor, initiated to keep a neighborhood business afloat, could turn profitable. "I think it's going to make money," said Mr. Buell, the stockbroker who wrote the business plan. "There's enough people in this neighborhood and the extended neighborhood and a fair number of leagues are interested." (Owners said the Alley is one of just three public duckpin lanes in the greater Hartford area.)
In a move that would please Robert Putnam, welcomes are being extended to bowling leagues. So far, five are on board.
"Susan held meetings with them and baked them banana bread," Ms. Palm said.
"It was really a cheese basket," Ms. Russell interjected.
"Yeah, but banana bread sounds better," Ms. Palm said. "More homespun."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL PROPERTY/NEW JERSEY;
Bergen Landlords Look to Manhattan for Tenants

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
AFTER nearly two years of watching rents soar and space dwindle in Manhattan's office market, Laurence Gluck made his move. Mr. Gluck and a partner recently brought a 650,000-square-foot office complex on Route 4, just over the George Washington Bridge in Hackensack, N.J.
The three-building complex, known as Continental Plaza, is the first office acquisition outside of Manhattan for Mr. Gluck, the principal in Stellar Management Ltd., which, with a variety of partners, owns or manages four million square feet of commercial space. In April his company, together with Capital Real Estate of Manhattan, paid $79 million for the complex, where 200,000 square feet of space is available or soon will be. 
 "The complex was a good value in an excellent submarket that is getting better, and in a location that could take advantage of the strength of the Manhattan market," Mr. Gluck said. "We feel we can attract core tenants from New Jersey as well as those from Manhattan who don't have to be in the city and want to avail themselves of lower costs."
There is no corporate occupancy tax in New Jersey, and electric power rates and real estate taxes are well below those in New York, said Mitchell Konsker, an executive director in the Manhattan office of Cushman & Wakefield, the international brokerage company.
He is a member of one of two teams of brokers, one based in the Manhattan office and the other in East Rutherford, N.J., who are leasing agents for Continental Plaza. This two-pronged approach reflects the two sources of tenants that are being tapped.
Asking rents at the complex average $32 a square foot, about half of those for comparable space in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Konsker said.
In the last few years such cost benefits have lured a stream of tenants from downtown Manhattan to office towers on the west bank of the Hudson, mainly in Jersey City, including Paine Webber; Goldman, Sachs; and most recently, Chase Manhattan Bank.
Last month, the bank announced it would relocate many employees from 55 Water Street in downtown Manhattan to one million square feet in a mixed-use complex being developed by the Lefrak Organization at Newport in Jersey City. The move, contingent on final approval of incentives from Trenton. will involve about 1,900 employees and several hundred consultants in the business services, general auditing and other departments.
BUT rents on the waterfront are rising, and the availability of space is limited (new construction, where possible, takes time). Aware of these factors and of the ever-tighter Manhattan market, Mr. Gluck is one of a number of landlords and investors with available space in existing buildings who are betting that now is a good time to attract Manhattan tenants with immediate space needs to other close-in markets in New Jersey, like parts of Bergen County.
Other property owners in the county gearing up to draw Manhattan tenants include a landlord with a 160,000-square-foot building elsewhere in Hackensack and an investment group buying an office building with 131,000 square feet in Lyndhurst.
Many commercial brokers said the space squeeze in Manhattan and on the Hudson River waterfront was causing companies to search inland in New Jersey for alternatives. But no one is predicting that a flock of New York companies will make the leap.
"The floodgates in the inland areas haven't opened because of concerns by New York companies of the potential loss of employees, and the minimal amount of large available blocks of prime space," said Jeffrey Babikian, the senior managing director at the Saddle Brook office of Insignia/ESG, the real estate services company. Once they get over those hurdles and focus on the savings, areas of New Jersey away from the Hudson become viable options, he added.
In the case of Bergen County, Steven M. Frank, a senior vice president at the Teaneck office of the CB Richard Ellis brokerage company, said, "We've always seen a flow of Manhattan companies, and it has picked up in recent months."
Driving the market are smaller tenants taking 5,000 to 20,000 square feet of space, he said, because bigger Manhattan tenants are sensitive to the labor issue.
Another complicating factor is the lack of public transit. Unlike Jersey City, with its PATH train, Bergen County relies mostly on buses to link it directly with Manhattan. There is train service, but only to Hoboken, where passengers must change to PATH trains to Manhattan.
Nonetheless, with the current scarcity of blocks of space of 50,000 square feet or more in Manhattan, "tenants have to look outside the box," said Mr. Konsker of Cushman & Wakefield. Through lease expirations and relocating existing tenants elsewhere in the complex, two blocks, one of 50,000 and the other of 100,000 square feet, are being cobbled together at Continental Plaza. They will be available in the next four to six months, Mr. Konsker said, adding that a total of 50,000 more square feet, made up of smaller spaces, will also be available. Additional leases are coming due in the next 12 to 18 months, he said.
The landlord is improving the property, which is now almost 30 years old. The wiring in the three buildings is being upgraded for advanced telecommunications, including high-speed Internet access, and the common areas are being renovated. Mr. Gluck said the complex has its own postal substation, a branch bank and garage parking for 2,500 cars.
SINCE leasing began three months ago, five leases have been negotiated or closed, Mr. Konsker said. Of those leases, one for 8,500 square feet has been closed with Macromedia Inc., a San Francisco software company with offices in Teaneck. A second lease, for 22,000 square feet, is being negotiated with another New Jersey company. In addition, negotiations are under way with three Manhattan companies, for 20,000 to 60,000 square feet each, he said. He would not name them.
Another building in Hackensack that is seeking Manhattan tenants is at 21 Main Street downtown. Bergen County, which uses the entire three-story building for administrative offices, will vacate it by the end of the year, said Jerry L. Barta, the director of leasing and marketing at Alfred Sanzari Enterprises of Hackensack, the owner.
"We're not marketing exclusively to Manhattan tenants," Mr. Barta said, "but there has been a spillover due to the high rents, so they are one of the obvious suspects to go after, in addition to New Jersey firms which are expanding." Given the scarcity of big blocks of space, "this is not the worst time to get back 160,000 square feet," he added.
Rents have not yet been set at the building, which will be upgraded for advanced telecommunications, but they are expected to be about $30 a square foot. Mr. Barta said his company could also build a 190,000-square-foot building across Essex Street from the existing one, and the two could be linked together to create something of an urban campus.
In Lyndhurst, a group of Bergen County investors is in contract to buy an empty 131,000-square-foot building at 160 Chubb Avenue, with access to Manhattan via Route 3 and the Lincoln Tunnel. The building recently became vacant after its sole tenant, Ebasco Engineering, terminated its lease in a consolidation by its parent company, Raytheon.
"It's a classic alternative for New York firms considering the economic advantage of locating in New Jersey," said Leonard T. Miller Jr., a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, which represents the buyers. He said asking rents at the building, which could be expanded by 42,000 square feet, are expected to be $27 to $29 a square foot.
There are also development plans for new offices in the county. In Rutherford, near Routes 3 and 17, Lincoln Equities is preparing a 28-acre site for 900,000 square feet of office space in two buildings, plus a 220-room hotel. Mr. Babikian of Insignia/EGS said that Skymark Partners of Hackensack is advancing plans to build two million square feet of offices in three buildings, along with a hotel, on a 33-acre site at Route 46 and the New Jersey Turnpike in Ridgefield Park.
Mr. Babikian, who represents the developers, said discussions are under way with three prospective tenants, two from Midtown Manhattan. "The developers want to catch the market and take advantage of their proximity to Manhattan," he said, noting that the site is within a 10-minute drive of both the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel.

HEADLINE: State Grants to Foster Housing for the Elderly

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

DATELINE: WESTCHESTER

 BODY:
County organizations have received $4.8 million in state grants for four projects that will create housing for the elderly and help first-time home buyers buy homes.
In Yorktown, Landmark Partners is receiving $1.8 million to provide 64 units of housing for the elderly in a project called Wynwood Oaks. The development team consists of Landmark Partners, the contractor, the Westchester Interfaith Housing Corporation and the architect, Anthony J. Coppolla. 
 The apartments will be available to households with incomes below 60 percent of the county's median income -- $79,900 for a family of four -- with one-bedroom units renting for $440 to $840 a month.
In Mount Vernon, Community Gardens is receiving $2.6 million to build 54 one-bedroom units for the elderly. The development consists of Community Gardens, Mountco Construction and Development Company and the architect, Swanke Hayden Connell. Monthly rents will range from $365 to $672 for households with incomes below 50 percent of the area's median income.
In White Plains, $50,000 will be used to provide emergency home repairs to low-income elderly homeowners, with a maximum of $5,000 for owners with incomes up to 60 percent of the median income. The city is the municipal sponsor there.
And in a countywide program, Community Housing Innovations will receive $400,000 to help low-income residents buy homes. An average of $16,000 a unit will be awarded to households with incomes at or below 80 percent of the median income.
Statewide, $80.4 million in housing development projects and programs was approved under the state's Low Income Housing Trust Fund ($28 million), the state's Home program ($31 million), Low Income Housing Credit ($20 million) and the Restore Program ($1.43 million).
Officials said the awards statewide would provide more than $267 million in additional public and private investment and give local governments, nonprofit organizations and developers with the resources -- including Federal tax credits -- needed to make thousands of affordable housing units available.
In some cases, Federal tax credits over 10 years will be offered to nonprofit organizations to help developers obtain financing, said Judy Calogero, deputy commissioner for the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal. "Many developers don't go out for low-income housing, because traditionally they don't get as high a return on their investment," she said.

HEADLINE: The Boston Area Adjusts to Rent Deregulation

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
FIVE years after Massachusetts voters ended rent regulation or, more precisely, ended it in Boston, Brookline and Cambridge, the three cities that still had some form of rent control -- rents have taken sizable jumps, the cities are spiffier and less pockmarked by deteriorating neighborhoods and many poorer people have been forced to move to communities farther from the urban core.
While no overall study of the effects of the end of controls on rents has been made, a survey by a leading landlord in Cambridge found that rents for his company's formerly controlled apartments have doubled. 
 With the economy of the Boston area booming, landlord and tenant advocates, politicians and academics who study housing all agree that the degree to which rent deregulation itself produced those effects is impossible to determine. Yet, for good or ill, they all see deregulation as a factor in the changing faces of the three cities.
"Clearly, we enjoy an especially strong rental market," said Edwin J. Shanahan, the executive director of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board. "Demand continues to outpace supply." That is caused by several factors, Mr. Shanahan said, "not the least of which was the 25 years when we had rent control."
"Over those decades nobody would come into Boston, Brookline or Cambridge to build rental housing," he said. "So we essentially ended up with 25 years of no measurable increase in supply."
Since the end of rent regulation, Mr. Shanahan said, "we've seen substantial rehabilitation of our housing stock in those three communities, and a tremendous increase in the number of developers looking to develop" -- although so far there has been a lot more interest than actual development, he conceded.
Peter Dreier, Boston's housing director from 1984 to 1992 and now a professor of public policy at Occidental College in Los Angeles, is not so sanguine. "What Boston shows is that a rising tide does not lift all boats," he said.
"Poor and working-class families are squeezed," Dr. Dreier said. "If you're a waiter, a chambermaid, even a schoolteacher or a nurse, you have to pay half your income or more to put a roof over your head. And if you're really poor, you're going to be doubling and tripling up."
Or moving out of town.
Dian Weaver, 31, a divorced mother of three, used to live in a six-unit building in a poorer section of Cambridge. She was paying $300 a month when rent control ended in 1995. By 1998, the rent was $600, and she had to move.
Ms. Weaver, who refuses to go on welfare, kept her jobs at two restaurants in Cambridge, earning about $500 a week. She moved to Attleboro, Mass., and now commutes to work by train, an hour each way. The rent for her old apartment, "last I heard," she said: "$850."
IN a referendum on Nov. 8, 1994, residents of Massachusetts -- though lacking a majority in each of the three affected cities -- ended rent regulation by a vote of 1,034,594 to 980,723, or 51 to 49 percent. The referendum had been spurred, particularly, by a coalition of small-property owners in Cambridge, which had the most stringent form of rent control covering most of the apartments in a city comprised predominantly of renters. The impact of rent regulation in Boston and Brookline had been muted in recent years by vacancy decontrol. In all, about 100,000 units were decontrolled on Jan. 1, 1995.
No comprehensive study of the effects of deregulation in the three cities has since been conducted. But in Boston, according to Elizabeth Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Mayor Thomas M. Menino, the average rent for two-bedroom apartments hit $1,550 in 1999, up 75.1 percent from $882 in 1995.
Perhaps the best currently available barometer is a study by Alex Steinbergh, a principal of Resource Capital Group, a large landlord in Cambridge, which used as a sample the 242 deregulated units in the 15 buildings the company owns.
"The sample showed that as of November 1999, the average rent for all of the previously rent-controlled units essentially doubled, from $510 to $1,016," Mr. Steinbergh said. The survey also showed that 89 of the 242 formerly rent-controlled units, or 37 percent, had the same tenant as in January 1995. "Now the rents of those tenants, on average, went up from $577 to $967," Mr. Steinbergh said, a 68 percent increase. "So those tenants' rents weren't going up as much as new tenants'."
Some of Mr. Steinbergh's apartments were already on the open market at the time of deregulation, "and the average increase on those market-rate units was 31 percent, from $1,025 to $1,343," he said.
On a recent meandering drive through Cambridge, Mr. Steinbergh pointed out that, "if you pick streets at random, you'll find rehab work on virtually every one." And, indeed, like rainbow sprinkles on a sundae, bright pastel shingles in an array of shades adorned the sides of grand old buildings -- many with turret-like bay windows and stately porticos -- on block after block.
"The exteriors have been fixed up, and inside there are new heating systems, electrical, plumbing," Mr. Steinbergh said. "We think about a third of the 15,000 formerly controlled units have done some rehab."
Similar patterns of housing rehabilitation were evident in Boston proper. And while Mayor Menino was proud of the facelifting and economic rejuvenation of many neighborhoods, he was unequivocal in his assessment of rent deregulation: "A disaster."
In his State of the City Address on Jan. 11, the mayor declared affordable housing one of his highest priorities. "We have an obligation to make sure that prosperity doesn't price people out," he said. "A stable economy needs workers at every level. And a stable city needs a variety of housing for a variety of incomes."
IN an interview, Mayor Menino said: "We're losing the middle class. I know a situation in South Boston where this young couple has gone up in the last year over $600 a month in rent. And there's no way to combat that; they are at the mercy of the landlord. The affluent are moving to our city in record numbers. But our homeless family numbers have gone up 10 percent over the last year." The city's vacancy rate is 1.6 percent.
The problem, Mayor Menino said, "is that there aren't any rental housing proposals out there."
"Rent control came off and the housing industry said they will help us build new housing," the mayor said. "Well, it's five years later and I'm still waiting for the industry to come forward with new housing proposals; any kind, but affordable housing for the most part."
"Million-dollar luxury homes; there are some of those being built in our city," the mayor continued, "obviously not for the working person."
Mr. Shanahan of the real estate board said that the lack of development of affordable housing "essentially has to do with the inordinate delays one encounters in trying to work through the maze of permits and approvals that are required in a city as old as Boston and with as much neighborhood activism as Boston enjoys."
"Quite frankly," he said, "when you are looking at a two and a half year process to find out whether you are even going to be able to play, the game requires a significant amount of capital to be put at risk."
To which the mayor responded: "I don't believe that. If you come up with a good proposal for rental housing in our city, we will expedite it."

HEADLINE: For the Class of 2000, Renting 101

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
THE annual migration to New York of new college graduates, degrees in hand, entry-level jobs on the horizon, seems as inevitable as the changing of the seasons. Just as predictable is the sticker shock they face when they plunge into the hunt for an apartment, when they realize that what they might pay for an entire house in Birmingham or Boise is barely enough for a studio here.
That of course has been true, to one degree or another, for years, but the price tags presented to the class of 2000 seem particularly breathtaking, even compared to those of last year when the market was already torrid. 
 "The cycle of soaring rents has to break somewhere, but we've been saying that for years and years and it only gets more incredible and more shocking every year," said Michael Shapot, an associate broker with Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy in Manhattan who has many young people among his clients. "It is a landlords' market. They are demanding, demanding, demanding -- and getting, getting, getting."
Supply and demand, with a New York twist, are part of the reason.
Thanks to the booming economy in general and the demand for co-op apartments in particular, "co-op owners who once rented their apartments are now selling them because they are getting top dollar and are choosing not to rent any longer," Mr. Shapot said. "There are some new buildings, but they are selling out or renting out incredibly quickly at prices that the class of 2000 is unwilling or unable to pay."
So unless the graduates have trust funds or six-figure salaries, they are finding themselves scaling down the visions they brought to the city: trading in elevators for walkups, banding together with more roommates than they had planned on, putting up temporary walls to carve bedrooms out of living rooms or relinquishing the idea of Manhattan altogether and finding haven in Brooklyn, Queens, the suburbs.
Even then, they are making further compromises, like giving up a quick walk to a subway stop. Some, defeated altogether by the size of their paychecks relative to the going rents, return to the nest and parents.
"This is a wealthy city, and it is starting to shape up that only kids with silver spoons can be here," said Andrew Heiberger, president and owner of Citi Habitats, a residential brokerage company that rented 5,400 apartments in Manhattan last year and caters to what he described as "upwardly mobile professionals."
But even a silver spoon, inherited or earned, may not be sufficient. Consider the case of Chip Krotee of Minneapolis, who is about to begin a job as a trader with Merrill Lynch, and Arjay Jensen of St. Louis, who will work for Goldman Sachs. Roommates at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, where they received their masters of business administration degrees in May, they figured they would find a place to live with relative ease. The moving allowances their companies gave them included payment of brokers' fees.
"The brokers we called suggested we come to New York three or four weeks before we were ready to move and bring lots of cash," Mr. Krotee said the other day from his home in Minneapolis, where he was packing. "We came up on May 24 figuring we'd be safe if we brought two months' rent. We were hoping to find a two-bedroom apartment somewhere on the West Side below 90th Street for $3,500 a month for the two of us."
They were shown six or seven apartments, two of which they deemed "tenable."
"We were willing to take them outright, but we were rejected," Mr. Krotee said. "We were told we needed assets of $1 million, and even with those assets landlords wouldn't look at us unless we had worked in New York City for two years. We also needed a guarantor in the tristate region with income 100 times our rent."
THEY did find a two-bedroom apartment in a prewar building on West 73rd Street. "There the management was fine," Mr. Krotee said, "but because we had no New York City guarantor, we had to put six months' rent, or $24,000, in a security deposit and had to take out loans."
"The fact that we have M.B.A.'s, six-figure salaries, perfect credit ratings and fixed assets that are not too shabby didn't matter," he said, looking back on the painful search.
Steven Blase Boyd of Kearny, N.J., felt much the same way after he began looking for an apartment to share with three friends from Georgetown University: Benjamin Meyer of Kansas City, Kan., Nathan Swem of Shellbourne Falls, Mass., and Nicolina Kuh of Arlington, Tex. They all graduated last month and have jobs at investment banking firms like ING Barings and Warburg Dillon Read.
"We found a place on East 57th Street that was a steal at $4,900, a 35th-floor penthouse with three bedrooms and two terraces, and our four salaries covered the rent," Mr. Boyd said. "But they only wanted two people signing the lease and there were no two of us whose salaries covered 40 times the rent." (The annual income -- including salary, dividends and interest -- that landlords require of tenants can vary, Mr. Heiberger said; 40 to 52 times the monthly rent is usual.)
In addition, Mr. Boyd said, they were limited to one guarantor, and they had no one individual who could fill that role.
At one point, Mr. Boyd grew so frustrated by endless red tape that, he said, "even though I love the three people I'll be living with, friends since freshman year, I seriously contemplated dropping out and going to Hoboken or Jersey City by myself."
Pondering what it takes to make landlords become almost as picky as co-op boards, he said: "We have gone to a better school where we've all graduated with honors. I was only cum laude, the other three were magnas. We are financially responsible. I paid for a year of Georgetown out of my own pocket and we all have well-paying jobs." Now they have signed a lease on a sublet on West 106th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue for $4,100 a month. No guarantor was required, but they are awaiting approval from the board of the co-op building. "If they turn us down, I don't know who they want in that apartment," Mr. Boyd said.
The rents being paid by Mr. Krotee, Mr. Boyd and their roommates do not seem out of line with current prices in Manhattan.
"Based on the income requirement of nine out of 10 buildings, a salary of 50 times one months' rent, someone earning $60,000 would barely qualify for a $1,200 studio," Mr. Heiberger said. "And a $1,200 studio is the bottom of the barrel in the city. It would be a fifth-floor walkup or on the first floor facing an alley with a view of the trash."
"The minimum for most studios is $1,500 and they go up to $2,200," he continued. "One-bedrooms that you can convert to two are $2,400, and two-bedrooms that you convert to three are around $3,600. Once you get into three bedrooms, the prices jump greatly to $6,000 and you're competing with couples with families who are raising kids in the city."
In addition, landlords, who tend to prefer older and presumably more settled tenants, are raising the bar higher in other ways. For example, the requirements for guarantors, without whom many landlords will not consider a renter right out of school, are tightening up.
"Guarantors are required to make 75 times the monthly rent," Mr. Heiberger said. "They must submit their own financial information that is more onerous than a mortgage application to prove that they are able to support their own obligations plus the obligations of the tenant. Six out of 10 landlords require the guarantor to be from New York State, eight of 10 that they be from the tristate area and 10 out of 10 that they be from the United States. Kids and their parents are being forced to pay more than their tuition for their senior year of college in advance just to get the key."
Indeed, the fact that their nest may be empty no longer automatically ends parental financial obligation. Ryu Suzuki, who will start as an associate for UBS Warburg on Wednesday, came to New York in May right after graduating from Oberlin College. He would not have been able to move into the apartment he found -- a $2,000-a-month condo studio in Murray Hill -- had his parents, who flew here from Tokyo to make sure that he found a safe place, not been willing to put up a year's rent, $24,000, in advance. "Having recently purchased a new house in Tokyo, they were not shocked about the prices," Mr. Suzuki said.
Even a medical degree does not ensure safe passage through the roiling rental waters. "It seems to me that if someone is starting out as a physician in New York and has the credentials, landlords would bend a little," said John Lemery of Saratoga, N.Y., whose son, Dr. John M. Lemery, just graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and started work last week as an intern in emergency medicine at the Bellevue Hospital Center.
"He needed something reasonably close to Bellevue because he will work 12-hour shifts and undergo all that goes with being an intern," Mr. Lemery said. Dr. Lemery found a 300-square-foot studio in a doorman building on East 47th Street for $1,675 a month.
"We had to pay the first and last month's rent on a two-year lease, security deposit and brokerage fees which came to more than $8,300," Mr. Lemery said. "It all had to be deposited in certified funds with the broker. They wouldn't take a personal check, and I had to guarantee the lease, provide them with a copy of selected information on my income tax return and get a letter from my bank saying that we are creditworthy."
Besides providing advance payments, bank records, tax forms, references and guarantors, apartment seekers must be prepared to make snap decisions or almost inevitably forfeit opportunities even in less desirable apartments.
JACOB BERCOVICI, a new graduate of the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, is moving to Williamsburg in Brooklyn because the apartment he occupied for two years in Park Slope has been sold.
"I was told there was a new building in Williamsburg, and when I called, a woman told me there were eight apartments left," he said. "When I went to see it, there were only two left. So many apartments had been pulled out from under my feet that I was ready to take it on the spot. It was close enough to what I was looking for and I didn't feel like going crazy. There was a guy in line behind me, and once I said I would take it, the broker turned to him and said, 'Now there is only one left,' so he took it."
Mr. Bercovici, a painter who is looking for a teaching job, was scheduled to move in with a roommate yesterday, and together they will pay $1,775 a month for a 1,400-square-foot loft. "Everything else in the neighborhood was at least $500 more," he said. "There is no gas in the building yet, which is why it is so cheap." The building is being converted from commercial to residential status.
"Sadly, $2,000 a month is a steal," said Annie Livingston of Portland, Ore., who graduated from Yale last year, is now the assistant public relations director at Swann Galleries in Manhattan and has been renting a room in a friend's co-op.
She and her Yale roommate, Sarah Karnasiewicz of Southbury, Conn., an operations design assistant at the Whitney Museum of American Art, spent their lunch hours and evenings since the beginning of May pursuing an apartment, and said they had probably tramped through 30 of them.
They made every effort to avoid using the services of a broker, Ms. Livingston said, because brokers "charge 15 percent of the year's rent and don't do much," but in the end, they found their new home last Tuesday through an agent, Adam Feingold of New York City Apartments.
They said it was love at first sight when they saw the apartment -- which has two bedrooms, two baths, a living room and an eat-in kitchen -- in a newly renovated four-story town house on 78th Street east of Second Avenue. Especially because the rent is $2,200 a month.
The search was an education for the women, who just last weekend were told by a broker that it was unlikely they would find a decent two-bedroom apartment for less than $4,000 a month.
"When we started out, I thought that paying $1,000 a month was ridiculous," said Ms. Karnasiewicz, who has been camping out with friends, "moving from floor to floor depending on the kindness of strangers" since the start of the search. "Now I think we are getting a great deal for the money. To get anything halfway decent or clean for less than $2,500 seems like a bargain."
"I didn't think I would be in a palace, but I expected to find something small, clean and comfortable and would go where the prices took me, anywhere where I would feel safe," she said. "Then when we started looking, I realized we are definitely not in a position of power. No matter what state an apartment is in, it will be rented, probably to people making twice as much money as we are."
They got their apartment by getting to it first -- after they had begun to consider leaving Manhattan. "We had been looking for weeks," she said. "On Tuesdays at 1 p.m., when the new Village Voice listings come online, the day before the paper is printed, I go through them and make calls. I was the first person to call -- 20 minutes after the listing was posted -- and we raced over there right from work. We knew within minutes that this was it." Ms. Karnasiewicz's father is the guarantor.
In the past, the draw of communities outside Manhattan was directly proportional to their proximity to subway or PATH stations, but even that is changing with rising demand. "People are not so insistent any more on being right at the No. 7 subway stop," said Scott Cooper, a broker with Cooper Real Estate in Woodside, Queens. "Since apartments here are in such great demand, people who used to want to be no farther than four blocks from a subway now consider 10 blocks."
Asked what locales were the most popular alternatives to Manhattan, Mr. Heiberger listed Hoboken, Jersey City and Fort Lee in New Jersey, Astoria in Queens, Long Beach on Long Island, and Williamsburg, Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights.
But what is considered reasonable one year can become pricey the next. As rents rise in Park Slope, which once got the spillover from Brooklyn Heights, Windsor Terrace is becoming more popular. Rents there are 10 to 15 percent lower than in Park Slope, said John P. Burke Jr., a broker with John P. Burke Realty. A two-bedroom apartment in Windsor Terrace would be $1,650, compared to $2,200 in Park Slope, he said. "There has been more demand for two-bedrooms this year over last," he said, "mainly because few people can afford to live alone and must share to get by."
Rents in Astoria have been escalating as well. A one-bedroom apartment there that would have averaged $750 to $800 a month a year or so ago is now $900 to $1,000, Mr. Cooper said.
WHICH communities are considered likely to be the next magnets for the young? The graduates are not as willing as suburban homeowners to travel more than a half hour to reach the city, brokers say, but migration east in Queens to Bayside seems to be starting, and boundaries are beginning to stretch to Staten Island and Great Neck on Long Island.
Great Neck, that affluent North Shore community? "Yes," Mr. Heiberger said. "you can still get a one-bedroom apartment there for $1,200."
Tufts University class of '99 graduates Sarah Rosen, an assistant producer at Dateline NBC, and Chelsea Switzer, an events coordinator at Chelsea Piers, barely considered Manhattan, even though that was where they wanted to live.
"We knew it would be impossible," Ms. Rosen said. "We wanted to find something for $1,500 a month and with one bedroom that we could subdivide. We each wanted our own room and were not willing to have someone living in the living room."
They registered with an apartment listing service that provided them with addresses of places in their price range. "Nothing they sent us to was in Manhattan," Ms. Rosen said. They also responded to newspaper ads, through which they found a two-bedroom third-floor walkup in Park Slope that was $450 above their budget. "We saw it and said, 'We will kick ourselves if we don't take this,' and then the rent went up another $50 a month because we had them build a wall," she said. "We immediately decided we needed a third roommate."
Through an ad they put on the Tufts alumni Web page, they recruited Stefan Kimball, a new graduate of Penn State, who has a job as a paralegal with Latham & Watkins and who was scheduled to move in yesterday. The fact that the apartment is not in Manhattan doesn't seem to matter to Mr. Kimball, whose family lives in Finland. "I like the idea of living in New York, not New Jersey," he said. "Park Slope is pretty cool, and we have a nice view of Manhattan from the window. I'm paying $800, and for someplace like Park Slope, that seems like a bargain."
For those unshakable in their resolve to be in Manhattan, Gus Perry of Stein-Perry Real Estate in Washington Heights said, "We are absolutely seeing more young people up here, and in Inwood and the north Harlem areas. This is the only place you can find a large one-bedroom for under $1,500 on the island of Manhattan."
Nichole Argyres, a book editor who graduated from the University of Michigan four years ago, and David Gordon, who graduated from its school of music in April, are moving to Inwood in August.
"We had to choose whether we wanted a good location and a really small apartment or live in Brooklyn or the Bronx," Ms. Argyres said from Ann Arbor. "We knew that David would be studying at the Manhattan School of Music, which is near Columbia, so we wanted to try to be in Manhattan. To live elsewhere would be a huge commute."
They found what is termed a "junior four" (one large bedroom and one small) for $1,300 a month. "It's spacious in a great location 20 minutes from downtown on the express and there is lots of green," Ms. Argyres said happily.
How much farther young people will be willing to commute to work and play in Manhattan remains to be seen. And what current trends portend for the post-college generation of the future is an open question.
As Lucy Martin Gianino, an actress who is also a real estate broker with Coldwell Banker/Hunt Kennedy, put it: "If I could give my children one gift, it would be a co-op." Ms. Gianino has three children, Gemina, 30, a teacher who is about to enter the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Antonia, 27, a stage manager for the play "Rent," and Gian-Murray, 22, a new graduate of Wesleyan University who will be an intern for a year with the Actors Theater of Louisville in Kentucky. "It is my big concern as the parent of three children who are all in the arts or education," Ms. Gianino said. "Will they be driven out of the city as everyone here becomes an investment banker? Will they have to leave professions they love to earn a buck so they can put a roof over their heads?"

HEADLINE: Two Plans for White Plains Site

BYLINE: By PETER BELLER 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
SEVENTEEN years after it first proposed developing portions of a 121-acre parcel adjacent to downtown, New York Presbyterian Hospital says it is time to act.
The hospital, which operates its psychiatric division here on a campus designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, has proposed a $300 million retail and residential development on land it owns surrounding the campus. 
 It would include an anchor store, similar in size to the nearby Bloomingdale's, an additional 225,000 square feet of retail space, 480 housing units and a hotel and conference center. To sweeten the deal, the hospital has offered to give the city 60 acres to create what would be the biggest park in White Plains.
But the plan requires zoning approval, and many city officials and nearby residents have called it far too ambitious. "Our primary feeling was that the retail development was much too large," said Marjorie Davies, who headed a League of Women Voters study of the plan.
As a result, the hospital has offered an alternative $96 million plan -- which it says does not require zoning approval -- for new medical and research buildings and, eventually, housing for hospital personnel. This plan, however, does not include any land for a park. And unlike the first plan, the new buildings would be tax exempt.
On July 10, the Common Council is to consider the two plans. It must decide whether to refer the original proposal (known as Plan A) to other city agencies for study. It must also decide whether the second proposal (Plan B) conforms with the hospital's current permit.
With five of the Council's seven members expressing reservations about Plan A, its referral to other agencies seems unlikely.
Some city officials have charged that Plan B, including the threatened loss of the park, was intended to put pressure on the city to refer Plan A to the other agencies. But Geoff Thompson, a spokesman for the hospital, rejected that charge.
"It's not a ruse," he said. "Many feel it's preferable to Plan A."
And yet it is clear that the hospital favors the retail project.
"We believe this is a well-reasoned plan, one that takes many points of view into consideration," said Connie Hildesley, the hospital's vice president for real estate. "With this plan, we create a park and permanent open space for the residents of White Plains, new revenue sources for the city and supplemental income and a stable future for the hospital."
She said the hospital envisions "high-end retail" shops and no "big box" retailers.
The commercial value of the land is substantial, said Chris O'Callahan, a partner at the McCarthy O'Callahan Company, a White Plains real estate company. "The land is very valuable because it is at the confluence of all the major roads in the county," he said. "So the access to the property is tremendous. There's a history of high-end retail development there: it would be very, very desirable."
Harold E. Vogt, president of the county Chamber of Commerce who supports the retail development plan, said it would not harm other retail areas of the city. But opponents see things differently.
Marc Pollitzer, president of the North Street Civic Association, said, "You're talking about commercial sprawl into pristine residential communities." He said that while the group supported limited commercial development, it would "like to see a more meaningful area of property" set aside for open space.
Alan Teck, president of Concerned Citizens for Open Space, a group formed in the early 1980's to oppose the hospital's 1983 plan for development, said his organization of about 600 residents wanted to see the hospital develop medical facilities on its own campus "and sell at least 100 acres of their property" to a land trust.
Councilman Benjamin Boykin called the retail development "massive" and in conflict with the city's 1997 comprehensive plan. He said he would have liked a "scaled down" version of the retail plan. He added that through negotiations he thought a compromise could be reached with less commercial space and a 100- acre park. Councilwoman Pauline Oliva agreed.
But the hospital has rejected such an approach.
"There has to be sufficient development on what is not park to make it economically viable for the hospital to give up the parkland," Mr. Thompson said. "We need to get some critical mass on the rest of it."
Mayor Joseph M. Delfino supports the retail plan and fears losing the park, as does Councilman Robert Greer, who favors at least referring Plan A to other city agencies.
"I view the recommendations for commercial and residential development as the price the city might have to pay for a park," Mr. Greer said., arguing that meaningful discussion was needed rather than two sides "threatening each other with total annihilation."
He said he feared that "if we turn the referral down, the hospital is going to sit down and go with Plan B."

HEADLINE: A Day in the Life Of Newark Airport

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
IT was not too long ago that Fiorello LaGuardia refused to get off an airplane here because his ticket showed New York as the destination -- an early example of the effectiveness of the publicity stunt. Lost in Mayor LaGuardia's geographic elitism was the fact that Newark International was the region's first major airport when it opened in 1928 -- and for a while the country's busiest.
Today, the three major airports in the New York City area move 89 million people a year, a transportation network second only to London's Heathrow and Gatwick. Kennedy International Airport links New York with the rest of the world. LaGuardia, with a large domestic operation, was the result of a sustained campaign by the colorful mayor. 
 As the two newer airports competed for its passengers, Newark fell on hard times. In the 1950's the airport's restaurants drew more customers than its airlines. But in the aftermath of airline deregulation -- when People Express, the no-frills carrier, chose an abandoned terminal at Newark as its base in 1981 -- the airport was reborn.
These days, Newark International is the 10th-busiest airport in the nation, surpassing even Kennedy in annual passenger volume. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, operator of all three airports, says Newark contributes $11.3 billion annually to the region's economy.
Indeed, the airport is so busy that its ability to provide necessary services is strained. Just getting to the airport on time is an exercise in frustration, parking is insufficient and the monorail system connecting the three terminals -- envisioned as a link from the airport with New Jersey Transit and Amtrak -- has itself become a problem.
Though the monorail, which began operating in 1996, has already cost more than $300 million, its performance has been inconsistent; and bringing the service up to expectations will cost tens of millions more. Worse, the monorail will be closed for months beginning this summer to work out the bugs.
The Port Authority has nearly a dozen construction projects under way to deal with crowding, including two parking garages -- one scheduled to open in 2001 and the other with no completion date set -- with a total of 6,600 spaces to augment the existing 17,000. Air traffic control, which handles 1,200 to 1,400 flights a day, is getting a new tower that will be completed by the end of 2002. And the offices of the Port Authority itself are moving from the airfield area to make more room for servicing airplanes.
The hall that houses United States Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization service processes 4 million passengers a year, and at peak times the lines resemble those at Disney World during summer vacation.
Customs officials said they are hopeful the situation will improve when Continental Airlines opens its own international area in Terminal C. The expansion includes 12 new gates for wide-bodied jetliners -- a mixed blessing that will insure the arrival of thousands of additional passengers.
"We want to add more capacity overall," explained Susan Baer, the Port Authority's general manager for New Jersey airports. That is no mean trick considering that there is little room for expansion on the 2,000-acre property. Kennedy, in contrast, has more than twice as much land.
Joel Jacoby, Ms. Baer's deputy, says keeping up with the success of the airport presents a huge challenge. "We're constrained in the amount of land," Mr. Jacoby said. "All developable property is developed. We redesign facilities with the same footprint."
In an airport that is constantly growing and never sleeps, keeping up is -- as one Port Authority official put it -- like doing "surgery on a patient who refuses to lie down."
Although the air passenger traffic winds down around midnight, the runways are kept busy and the south side of the airport throbs with the Federal Express operation. Fifty-four cargo flights, requiring about 1,500 employees, make the overnight shift the company's busiest time of day.
Newark airport is, in essence, a virtual city. It has a transitory population of 90,000, and its 24,000 permanent residents, the employees, are the heart of the operation.
"I'm the mayor," Ms. Baer said. "To manage facilities you must manage people."
 
FUELING THE JETS
Robert Dickerson
Keeps Them Flying
Robert Dickerson does not need any motivational speeches as he begins his day refueling jets at 5 a.m.
"Airplanes can go without people," Mr. Dickerson said. "They can go without bags. They can go without food, and many times they do. But they can't leave without fuel."
Mr. Dickerson, 42, of Hazlet, works for Ogden Aviation, which contracts with the Port Authority to receive, store, test and dispense up to 2 1/2 million gallons of Jet A aviation fuel every day. For eight hours, Mr. Dickerson, like his 128 co-workers, works alone as he pumps fuel from underground hydrants into the wings of seven or eight aircraft.
Mr. Dickerson likes to work the airlines that require him to deliver the completed fueling paperwork to the pilots in the cockpit, since he has not outgrown his childhood fascination with flying.
"That's a nice part of working here," he says. "To go into the cockpit and look around. Passengers never get to see a cockpit."
Every fueling operation begins with an order from the airline for enough fuel to get the plane to its destination and to an alternate airport, with a small percentage extra for unexpected delays. Pulling a stepladder from his truck, Mr. Dickerson walks beneath the enormous wings, climbs the ladder and opens a panel on the underside of the wing to check how much fuel is on the aircraft. Sometimes, there is already enough.
"In the beginning I was worried about the math," he confesses. "You think the math is going to be harder then it is." Pulling his security from his shirt pocket, he says, "They give us free calculators."
The actual refueling takes 25 to 30 minutes. Only the beginning and end are difficult. "The hoses are heavy and awkward, but you got to get used to them," he says. "You work hard for a couple of minutes then stand around."
Mr. Dickerson knows many of the ramp workers, and when there's time, there is socializing -- or commiserating if the weather is bad.
"Rain, heat, snow, I don't mind the cold, but I don't like the rain," he says. "A bad day is a rainy day and all the planes coming in need fuel."
Sometimes, the inclement bad weather that paralyzes the airlines and strands passengers is a welcome relief for Mr. Dickerson. "It's a good day when all your planes cancel," he said.

Mr. Dickerson's dream day is Jeff Krisiak's worst nightmare. Mr. Krisiak, the operations manager for Continental Airlines, remembers with a wince the unexpected snowstorm in April that stranded airplanes on the runway.
"We didn't know how bad the storm would be,' he says. "The planes left the gate and stayed out on the runway. We brought catering trucks and re-catered them. We took the trash and emptied the lavs. There were planes out there five or six hours."
When another snowstorm was forecast in May, Continental was more prepared. It arranged to transport its East Coast passengers to their destinations on Amtrak.
"We sent people by train to Portland, Providence, Hartford, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Virginia Beach, Albany, Buffalo," Mr. Krisiak recalled. "Our long-term goal will be to code share with Amtrak. We took care of about 600 people that day."
Mr. Krisiak, who joined Continental in 1983, says he has had to make plenty of tough decisions -- some right, some wrong.
"If you do a good job, everybody takes the credit," he said. "If you make the hard decision to downgrade from a DC-10 to a 757 and lose 100 seats, the bosses come back and say, 'Jeff, why, why, why?' "
Mr. Krisiak works in the airline's large operations center, illuminated for the most part by a wall of windows. After driving to work from his home in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, he enters the office through an unmarked door in an area of the Continental terminal not yet open. The tranquility of the large tropical fish tank by the entrance belies the intensity of the activity. Two dozen people are responsible for monitoring every facet of Continental's operations here. They communicate with the ground workers and the crews aboard the aircraft. They watch each plane on the ground from video cameras mounted at the gates.
"We have 524 operations per day," Mr. Krisiak said, "262 arrivals, 262 departures. We have incoming information on all of the flights." With this information, the center's staff can dispatch such equipment as a replacement part or a wheel chair for a passenger before a plane arrives at the gate.
"A captain can call and have an issue," he said, motioning to three aircraft mechanics seated at computers. "We can go into the computer right here and tell him his plane's maintenance history."
Mr. Krisiak went on: "There's been a change in mindset. People were reacting. Now we're getting people to understand the time-saving benefit of pre-planning."
 
DELIVERING BAD NEWS
Robert Baldwin Serves
By Smiling (and Singing)
"In the morning I put my oatmeal on the table and mix it with humor," said Robert Baldwin, a customer service representative for the Port Authority. He wears the standard-issue grey trousers and red blazer to indicate he is one of 160 people hired by the airport to help confused travelers.
Yet Mr. Baldwin is one of a kind.
From the bright glass-walled monorail station in Terminal C, he sings: "Hello my friends. Welcome to Terminal C. Only the best to you," projecting his voice over the noise of departing trains. He is not happy when he has to tell travelers news they might find distressing.
"Sometimes I may have to talk about delays on the monorail and this is bad news, so I blend it with as much positive as I can," he said.
Women in saris, men in suits and ties, teenage girls, people pushing strollers, wheel chairs and luggage carts, ramp workers and flight attendants -- none of them escape his attention. He is a man entirely comfortable with amiability. "I give a million-dollar greeting to everyone," he said.
A young pilot emerges from the monorail and casts a quick and curious glance at Mr. Baldwin, who is singing again. The pilot, clearly uncomfortable, is not the only one who seems to want to avoid the jovial interaction. Mr. Baldwin doesn't notice.
"People almost always look and give him a smile," said Michael Bekiarian of Gateway Security, the Port Authority contractor that provides the airport with customer service representatives. "That's what the Red Coat program is all about, changing perceptions. Does he go over the top? Yes. But I see people change from their experience of him."
Two middle-aged Japanese women laugh and clap as a companion videotapes Mr. Baldwin crooning: "Train to terminals B, A and rental cars on the left. Step lively, now."
Mr. Baldwin of Belleville, who for years worked for years as a hotel bellman at the Marriott in Hanover, was hired by Gateway a year ago. In a typical eight-hour shift he can answer close to 500 questions. They can be posed politely, as in "Where are the restaurants?" or be no more than a simple "B?" barked rudely. His answers never reflect anything less than sheer delight at the chance to help.
 
EXAMINING THE BAGS
Tony Maresca,
Always Suspicious
If there is one time of day when international passengers should not arrive at the customs and immigration hall, it is from noon to 6 p.m., when most international flights land here.
"We can have six planes arrive all around the same time, each with 200 people or more," said Tony Maresca, an assistant chief inspector, "so that's 1,200 people in the prime arrival time. They go through Immigration and then they come here to wait for their bags."
When a flight gets a serious examination from the officers supervised by Mr. Maresca, the passengers have to wait a little longer for their baggage. "Every day we target a flight and give it a good inspection," he said.
On this day, it was Continental Airlines Flight 1866 from Bogota. The passengers deplaned and 10 Customs officers and a drug-sniffing dog got on. A portable X-ray machine was set up at the end of the belt loader, which held boxed cargo. Mr. Maresca looked on, sober in his dark uniform.
The luggage had been taken inside, where it was also on a conveyor belt, ascending to the baggage carousels in the room above. Two dogs were running the treadmill along with the suitcases, sniffing each approaching bag.
"You have to balance this activity because a lot of these passengers have connecting flights," said Marco Galiano, supervisor of the K-9 enforcement unit, who joined Mr. Maresca. "We don't want them to miss their flights, but we've got to get dope off the street."
As he talks, a suitcase gets one of the dogs scratching excitedly. A description of the bag is called up to a Customs inspector before it is sent into the baggage claim area with the others. A woman traveling with two young children retrieves the bag and a moment later she is standing at a metal table, the bag opened before a young agent.
"People hide drugs on kids," Mr. Maresca said, explaining how difficult it is to define usual suspects.
Then again, there are some dead giveaways. "Here's a classic," he said. "It's July and someone is wearing a coat. They won't take it off."
As Mr. Maresca and Mr. Galiano talk, they glance at the young mother. Three uniformed agents are standing much closer to her, doing a poor job of trying to look nonchalant. Small boxes of coffee are removed, examined and repacked.
A sigh of understanding emerges from Mr. Galiano. "Sometimes we train the dogs with coffee," he said. "She's got a lot of coffee there." Interest in her suitcase is waning, and five minutes later she and her children are on their way.
"Usually, we tell the passenger why their bag was selected for inspection," Mr. Maresca said. "We tell them it was the dog. If we're going to hold them up, at least we should tell them why."
 
CLEANING THE BATHROOMS
Elina Mendoza
Keeps Things Tidy
During the course of her shift, from 1 to 9 p.m., hundreds of women will encounter Elina Mendoza cleaning the bathroom by gates 60 to 68 in Terminal B. She is there to make sure the bathroom is tidy, but beyond that her presence creates an expectation.
"When there is not someone there, people won't clean up after themselves," Ms. Mendoza, from Elizabeth, explained in Spanish.
Susan Baer, the airport manager, agreed. "It's all psychology," she said. "In the bathrooms, seeing a person cleaning up assures you the bathroom is clean. It tells you 'this is a priority.' "
Sheets of mirror and brushed steel partitions around the toilets beg for polishing. Countertops need mopping up. Going about these tasks, Ms. Mendoza wears a uniform of black pants, white blouse and floppy bow tie. On her hands are disposable surgical gloves and she's ready with a rag and squirt bottle of cleaner. She also makes sure there is paper in the stalls and at the sinks and not on the floor. "My days are busy, very full," she said. "I'm constantly in motion."
Using the interview as an opportunity to sit down for a few minutes in the darkened supply area adjoining the bathroom, she went on, "Some people tell me this is not the best job, but when people ask me if I like my job I say, 'yes.' "
And there are always questions, some more peculiar than others.
One woman sticks in her memory. "She asked me where were the public showers," she said. "I told her there are no public showers here. Two days later I saw her again. She had been stuck in the airport for two days." She said, 'Please, please. Where can I clean up? I'm desperate.' Finally I let her use the big utility sink in the supply room."
 
LOADING AND UNLOADING
Ron Fizer,
Man in a Hurry
There is a determination to Ron Fizer's stride as he crosses the 200 yards of airway between the Continental ramp crew office to the Terminal C gate, where he will spend the next eight hours. Mr. Fizer -- who is responsible for everything that goes on or comes off an airplane while at the gate except fuel and food -- is dressed in blue pants, a work shirt and a high-visibility orange net vest. He swings a tool box in his right hand. On his left arm he wears a watch. He will refer to it often.
"The first thing I do is get information about my flights," explains Mr. Fizer, who has driven in from his home in Lakewood. For that he heads for a door a level below the jetway.
Just inside the doorway the hall is lined with pilots' black flight cases, stacked like bricks one atop the other. The 48-year-old Mr. Fizer moves quickly, passing first through the pilots' lounge, then a second room, this one dim and occupied by a dozen pilots dozing on recliners. In the room beyond, ramp workers sit at tables eating lunch.
"I need the upload for flight 319," he says to a man at a desk at the end of the lunchroom. Receiving a white printout, he returns outside to the MD-80 at gate 109, which is headed to Washington.
"Usually these planes are packed," he said, showing off the deep storage space of the plane's three open belly compartments, which are empty. "We can load 11,000 to 15,000 pounds in four minutes. Four guys can download 25,000 pounds."
Mr. Fizer checks the water supply on board from a panel on the front of the plane's wing. Then he moves on to the nose wheel. Taking a pin from his tool box he slips it into a joint on the gear, enabling the wheel to pivot freely. Now a tow bar and tug can be used to push the plane from the gate at departure. It takes two men to attach the tow bar, and the entire operation is complete is 30 seconds.
Mr. Fizer checks his watch. It's 3:11, and the first of the luggage for flight 319 arrives. He reaches into the curtained container and begins tossing bags onto the conveyor belt receding into the cargo compartment. He checks the tag on every third or fourth suitcase saying: "I don't want a Detroit bag on this flight. I don't want a Fort Lauderdale bag on this flight. I don't want a Paris bag on this flight. We're not going to Paris."
At 3:25 the cargo doors are locked. Mr. Fizer checks his watch. "Minutes are precious," he says. "They can make or break a flight." At 3:31 a small suitcase is delivered to Mr. Fizer by a uniformed pilot. A minute later a stroller is sent down a circular metal chute and the cargo door is opened once again.
The last-minute stowing of baggage is a regular occurrence these days as passengers strain the limits of the overhead storage bins.
"One hundred and fifty passengers all want to keep their luggage with them," Mr. Fizer said, shaking his head. "Somebody's got to cough up a bag."
As Mr. Fizer looks on, Flight 319 is pushed out to a position on the field where it will begin to move under its own power. But before the tug driver disconnects the bar from the nose gear, he takes one last, late-arriving suitcase and stashes it in the cargo area. One passenger complaint averted. Flight 319 is four minutes late out of Newark.
 
POLICING THE AREA
John Collis
Patrols on Bike
Pedaling his bicycle through the crowded international arrivals hall, Officer John Collis, 38, is blazing a trail. He wears a regulation blue jump suit and a saucy silver bike helmet as he patrols the terminals and parking lots.
The bike also allows Mr. Collins to ride a fine line between the image of the traditional police officer and that of a somewhat friendlier helper that the Port Authority wants to convey. He is one of five officers here who have received bike patrol training from the New York Police Department.
"You learn how to get on and off the bike and how to use the bike as a defensive weapon," he said.
On a typical day, Officer Collis, who lives in Verona, says he will ride 20 miles or more. "I cover a lot more ground with the bike," he said. 'It's an excellent tool."
Not long after his shift began one evening, he was summoned to the immigration hall at the end of a long concourse at Terminal B. A check of passports touched off a report that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for one passenger's.
"Police matters can get complicated here,' he said, ticking off the list of agencies and jurisdictions involved. "There are the federal authorities, the state police, the New York police, Newark police, postal inspectors and the Secret Service."
But days of routine patrolling outnumber those of excitement. The passenger in immigration was handed over to two officers and Officer Collis pedaled back to the terminal. An hour later he is explaining airport policy to an elderly diabetic in need of insulin who is out of syringes. Medics can be called, Officer Collis explains, though she will have to pay handsomely. The woman decides to take a cab to a nearby drugstore, and Officer Collis is off once again.
 
DELIVERING THE MAIL
Federal Express Works While Everyone Sleeps
While most people who work at Newark International spend the night sleepily oblivious to the passing of time, the Federal Express crew can document how every minute of the overnight shift is spent. In four hours they will take correspondence and cargo from 27 planes and 340 trucks, shuffle it, redistribute it and send it back out before daybreak.
This operation involves 1,500 people and millions of dollars in equipment in addition to a fleet of wide bodies, jetliners and feeder aircraft that take over the airfield each night. One delay or one dropped ball can create a frenzy.
"No matter what part you work, every person has an effect on the next person," says Joyce Kiesewetter of Woodbridge Township, an operations administrator. She is joined in the sentiment by Paula Krysa, a senior manager from Pine Branch, who adds, "Every little piece of the puzzle makes a difference."
Ed Patterson, a control manager from Queens, N.Y., says: "We've had nights when an aircraft down loads at 1:42. They should have been done by 1:15. Then we have to find a way to make up the time elsewhere."
Much rides on Newark, the company's biggest generator of freight, moving 385,000 pieces each night. Yet like soldiers exchanging battle stories, members of the overnight crew thrill at the obstacles they have overcome, the odds they have beaten while the rest of the airport is sleeping
"There's closure when the plane is buttoned up and takes off," Mr. Patterson explains. "For that day you're a winner."

HEADLINE: MOVIES: CRITIC'S CHOICE

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
THERE have been many incarnations of Sally Bowles, Christopher Isherwood's divinely decadent "Berlin Stories" heroine, and Liza Minnelli didn't seem the most logical choice to play her. But Ms. Minnelli proved her critics dead wrong about that in Bob Fosse's brilliant film version of CABARET (1972) and won an Oscar for her efforts. Joel Grey did the same, as the sexually ambiguous emcee of the Kit Kat Klub, where everything is beatiful - or pretends to be, as Nazi swastikas appear and begin to change Germany forever. Michael York is Sally's bisexual love interest, Marisa Berenson is his innocent Jewish student, and Kander and Ebb's music is as heartbreaking as ever - Saturday at 9 p.m. and Saturday/Early Sunday at 2 a.m. on Romance Classics. 
 In his New York Times review, Bosley Crowther called it an "obviously low-budget job," referring to the shocks as just "old-fashioned and melodramatics, however effective and sure." At least, he allowed, "the acting is fair." Despite Crowther's low opinion of it, PSYCHO (1960) is now considered Hitchcock's masterpiece. Anthony Perkins's portrayal of Norman Bates, the jittery mama's-boy manager of the dreary Bates Motel, typecast him for life, but it's fascinting cinema history, as is Janet Leigh's scary shower scene and every shot of the creepy Victorian mansion out back - Sunday at 8 p.m on AMC.
 Five years after "Citien Kane," Orson Welles made THE STRANGER (1946), a terrific, atmospheric suspense drama about a Nazi war criminal (Welles) posing as a college professor in a sunny little Connecticut town. Edward G. Robinson is wonderfully single-minded as the federal agent out to unmask him. Loretta Young gets the best lighting as the professor's new wife, who refuses to suspect a thing, even after he kills her dog - Sunday at 8 p.m. on Channel 55.
 Write about what you know, they say. So Kevin Smith, a former Quick Stop employee, created CLERKS (1994), a bleak day in the life of a New Jersey convenience store and the video store next door. Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson play the title roles. Expect irreverence; this is a film that makes necrophilia in a public bathroom funny - Tuesday at 9:45 p.m. and Tuesday/Early Wednesday at 1:30 a.m. on IFC.
 The restaurateur brothers (Stanley Tucci and Tony Shalhoub) in Mr. Tucci and Campbell Scott's BIG NIGHT (1996) are a lot more dedicated to their careers. Despite that, their Italian restaurant is on the verge of closing. Now they're going for broke: they'll make a fantastic dinner for Louis Prima and his band (the film is set in the 1950's), and the evening will either make their reputation or they'll call it quits. "Babette's Feast" fans will be happy - Saturday at 6 p.m. on Lifetime.
 Geraldine Page is eloquently sad as a fading beauty and has-been actress in SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH (1962), Richard Brooks's take on Tennessee Williams's story about a lost weekend on Florida's Gulf Coast. Paul Newman is painfully needy as her companion, Chance Wayne, struggling, youngish would-be actor who has been struggling just a little to long. Ed Begley won the best supporting actor Oscar as Boss Finley, a local politician who will go to frightening lengths to keep his oddly named daughter, Heavenly (Shirley Knight), away from Chance. Hollywood's concept of age is always interesting: Mr. Newman was 37 when the film was released; Ms. Page was 38 - Wednesday at 6 p.m. on TCM.

HEADLINE: Asphalt Blues

BYLINE: By Verlyn Klinkenborg; Edward Keating is a New York Times staff photographer. Verlyn Klinkenborg is a member of the Times editorial board.

 BODY:
Depending on how you look at it, Route 66 was a strip of the true vernacular or an asphalt hustle. Perhaps it was always both. Route 66 was commissioned in 1926, fully paved in 1938, its last stretch replaced by an Interstate in 1984. During the Depression and World War II, it was a historic migratory corridor from the Midwest to the Southwest and California. In "The Grapes of Wrath," John Steinbeck called Route 66 "the mother road" but also, more accurately, "the road of flight." It was the road across "the Western States," a road on which no one ever traveled east, on which caravans of drifters and laborers and uprooted families moved in the one iconic direction, toward the Pacific Ocean. "Need," Steinbeck wrote, "is the stimulus to concept, concept to action." The action that grew up along Route 66 during its boom years is legendary. That was where, and how, America learned what it means to be on the road with an automobile. Every motel, every auto camp, every drive-in along the way was somebody's pipe dream come true, and the road ahead was a pipe dream, too. The highway followed the lay of the land. It ran down Main Street and right out of town. It carried away the people you knew and brought strangers in their place.
As its economic importance dwindled, the highway's nostalgic importance grew, and it took only nostalgia to turn the Route 66 wayside into kitsch. The old continuous Route 66 is nearly as gone as the Oregon Trail. But America loves to memorialize its transience, and now Congress has passed a bill guaranteeing $10 million over the next 10 years to help rehabilitate Route 66. 
 What remains is the scenery -- the wide-open void -- and the towns themselves. You know the names from the Bobby Troup song, recorded by Nat King Cole: St. Louis, Joplin, Oklahoma City, Amarillo, Gallup, Winona, Flagstaff, Kingman, Barstow, San Bernardino. But also Chenoa, Ill; Baxter Springs, Kan.; Yukon and Elk City, Okla.; Tucumcari, N.M.; Peach Springs, Ariz.; Needles, Calif.; and a hundred others like them. They sound like left-behind places, but they're not. They're the dots that any cross-country highway connects almost anywhere in America.
Route 66 is still the road of flight. The migration goes on, as these photographs by Edward Keating attest. It's no longer a mass movement, but the sense of drift is much the same as it was when people were fleeing the Depression, the Dust Bowl and debt. Turn your eyes very far from the main road, and you come across some of the people Edward Keating found -- prostitutes, topless dancers, missionaries, Bible distributors and the dislocated. The migration is sometimes actual, and sometimes an internal one, a readjustment of expectations, whether you stay put or move along. The transience that Keating memorializes isn't the tourist traps or the roadside architecture of America's hectic fantasy. It's something in the glance, something in the feeling you can see in these eyes. You try to stand still, they seem to say, but the ground moves beneath you. No matter what you do, the highway ends up running right down your back.

 PAST TIME
 Baseball as History.
 By Jules Tygiel.
 Illustrated. 258 pp. New York:
 Oxford University Press. $25.
 
 GAMES resist change; they incline to the timeless. So, inevitably, the histories written about them deal with the evolution of the society around them, not their own transformations. If a baseball fan from 1900 rode a time machine to this year's opening game, there would have been very little about the sport new to him: nine players, nine innings, three strikes, three outs, 90 feet between the bases, hits, errors, bases on balls -- most of the terms would be familiar. The uniforms would look slightly different, the blare from the sound system would be disconcerting and the players' salaries incomprehensible. Black, Hispanic and Asian players would be a novelty, too. But these changes are technological, social, economic -- not the game's. This is the history that Jules Tygiel tells in this extraordinary collection of essays, which, the author says, is a history not of baseball but of American culture as seen through the sport's interaction with developments in the social, political, financial and intellectual evolution of the United States.
"Past Time" is concerned with "how each generation reinvented the national pastime to fit its own material reality and ideological perceptions," but this is no plodding, would-be Marxist analysis of baseball. Tygiel's forte as a historian is his eye for what may appear nugatory or marginal but, when focused upon, illuminates the temper of a given moment. His nine essays concern turning points in baseball and American history, arranged in chronological order. They cover the rise of the game from the mid-19th century to the present, and while each chapter is an individual unit, the book leaves one with the feeling of having read a complete history of American baseball. Tygiel's heroes are large and small, and their accomplishments range from the invention of the box score to that of rotisserie baseball.
Tygiel, a professor of history at San Francisco State University and the author of "Baseball's Great Experiment: Jackie Robinson and His Legacy," places the sport in broad yet precise cultural contexts. He argues convincingly, for instance, that baseball became a national game because improvements in transportation and communication (railroads, the telegraph) unified the United States in the aftermath of the Civil War. Baseball became a symbol of that reunification. Tygiel also argues that the development of the social sciences and of statistics in the mid-19th century led Henry Chadwick to invent the box score and to establish methods to calculate and keep baseball records. Tygiel points out that Branch Rickey's creation of the farm system in the 1930's is coeval with the emergence of the first chain stores, which contributed to the creation of a national culture by making small towns feel they were part of a larger whole. While it is not particularly original to remark that Babe Ruth came onto the scene at the same time as radio broadcasting and the movies, Tygiel goes further by allowing that Ruth was also instrumental in the advance of public relations and advertising as businesses. He was among the first celebrities produced by those industries.
Tygiel's best essay traces the interlaced, contrasting -- and clashing -- careers of Branch Rickey and Larry MacPhail. The lives of these two moguls coil around the history of 20th-century American baseball like two snakes clasped in mortal strife. Rickey, the sanctimonious, hypocritical puritan who kept track of attendance from his home on Sundays while piously refusing to go to the ballpark; MacPhail, the crass entrepreneur with vision, able to discern the potential profit of night baseball, television and aviation -- these former associates who became bitter rivals wound up in New York leading the two top teams: Rickey the Brooklyn Dodgers, MacPhail the Yankees. Inspired by greed and his much-proclaimed principles, Rickey was willing to bring about the racial integration of the game -- his specialty was the exploitation of labor, and black players, owned by weak Negro leagues teams, were a free market. MacPhail thought that large numbers of black fans at the stadiums would diminish the value of major league franchises. Like many owners, he rented ballparks to Negro leagues teams, and saw clearly that the integration of the majors would destroy his tenants, putting an end to that lucrative sideline. Rickey and MacPhail had contrasting mixtures of vision, chicanery, ambition and the will to win. Rickey, the former catcher, was obsessed with training techniques to squeeze the most out of his players; MacPhail, more forward-looking, was obsessed with business innovations that could renew the industry. Tygiel's strength in this superb essay is his affection for these flawed figures.
Some of Tygiel's best and most revealing stories are about forgotten innovators. Thus we discover that Ben Shibe (after whom a park in Philadelphia was named) "made his fortune by perfecting the machines that produced standardized baseballs." It was Harold Arlin, from Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, who first broadcast a baseball game, on Aug. 5, 1921. A fascinating unsung hero is the prescient Allan Roth, who, as a hobby, began in the 1940's to compile "the most detailed analysis of baseball ever undertaken." Roth could cite hitters' averages against individual pitchers and what they did when ahead or behind in the count -- commonplace today but revolutionary then. Rickey, always fascinated by the scientific approach to the game, hired him. Tygiel recounts the dramatic moment when the Dodger publicist Irving Rudd, seeing Ralph Branca coming in to pitch to Bobby Thomson on that fateful Oct. 3, 1951, asked Roth how the right-hander fared against the Giant third baseman: "Roth, staring out at the field, just shook his head sadly."
"Past Time" is not a paean to baseball, but it is not a destructive critique either. On the issue of racial integration, for instance, Tygiel writes, the end of segregation meant that "fewer, rather than more, African-Americans would earn their living from baseball in the latter half of the 20th century. The failure of major league teams to hire black managers, coaches and front-office personnel compounded this problem. The nearly universal celebration of Jackie Robinson's triumph notwithstanding, integration would produce negative as well as positive consequences." Tygiel notes that in 1951, four years after Robinson joined the Dodgers, "only three teams in each league fielded black players." (Also by then, the Negro leagues were in sharp decline and midcareer players were scrambling for jobs.)
Mythmaking is, of course, part of the history of baseball, a story unto itself that someone ought to write. The urge to play cannot be explained by material need; it emerges either before or after it. Myths wanting to account for the origin of this urge cannot reach it -- not even a modern one like cultural history. Tygiel is aware of this and refrains from making overambitious claims. But he also engages occasionally in mythmaking of his own and is blind to the influence the game itself has on the business of baseball. A leitmotif in "Past Time" is the slow pace at which the baseball industry adapts to change. Could this not be a reflection of the game's inherent resistance to innovation? I do not see slowness in a negative light, perhaps because I am, like everybody else, a potential mythmaker myself.
But I fear that the consolidation of the two major leagues and the investiture of limitless power on a commissioner (who is, after all, one of the owners) could mean an unchecked rush to alter the game. In my nightmares I see the World Series in neutral, warm-weather sites, with teams not representing cities but only themselves as brand names. As with the new retro parks, nostalgia will just be another commodity, and the rules may even be tampered with, as in basketball, to generate excitement and greater revenue. Three sets of three innings, with the winner of two declared the victor, to create more endgame situations? Sudden death, as in other sports, by starting all extra innings with two outs and the bases loaded? Could something like this really happen? Tygiel is optimistic that it will not: "Despite the perennial warnings of baseball Cassandras, time has yet to pass baseball by. What remains to be seen is not whether the game will survive, but how Americans in a rapidly changing world will again reinterpret and reinvent their national pastime." I hope that, being right about so much in the game's past, Tygiel is also good at predicting its future.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Third Way

BYLINE: By Paul Berman; Paul Berman is the author of "A Tale of Two Utopias: The Political Journey of the Generation of 1968." His article on Cuauhtemoc C1/3rdenas appeared in the magazine in August 1998.

 BODY:
Vicente Fox climbed a podium in the broiling sun at Minatitlan -- a tropical oil town on Mexico's Gulf Coast oozing with heat and petroleum. A few thousand people gazed at him from under their sun umbrellas and straw sombreros. And he cried out in his booming bass voice, "When is Mexico going to change?"
Fox is running for president of Mexico in today's election, and the people in the street knew his slogan and shouted it back at him. 
 "Today!"
"When is Minatitlan going to change?"
Everyone shouted, "Today!"
Fox shouted out denunciations of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The PRI has been governing Mexico for 71 years. The PRI is the world's oldest continuously ruling party. It is a tired old dinosaur, dragging its tail through the dust.
"They are corrupt!" he shouted, and the r's in the Spanish corruptos trilled through the loudspeakers. Fox said that 40 million Mexicans live in the most wretched poverty. Millions more have fled to the United States, where they are persecuted and mistreated. Those are the PRI's achievements! He talked about Mexico's presidential palace, Los Pinos. "When are we going to drag the PRI out of Los Pinos?"
And Vicente Fox Quesada and the people of Minatitlan began to chant, "Today! Today! Today!"
Those were campaign slogans. But Fox's question -- When is Mexico going to change?" -- is a question that, in a quieter mood, ordinary Mexicans have been asking themselves for a long time. People get wistful on the topic. They say -- they have said to me a hundred times -- Mexico is rich. We have oil, agriculture, industry. We have a good and honest people. We are creative. We have an artistic soul. So why is Mexico stuck where it is: poor, fearful, awash in baroque crimes and gargantuan bank scandals?"
Mexicans are perfectly aware that all over the world in the last dozen years, one country after another has shaken off the oppression of the ages, has overthrown its authoritarian government and has sometimes lifted itself out of poverty too. Fox plays on that awareness. He invokes the names of Nelson Mandela and Lech Walesa. When he cries out, "When will Mexico change?" he wants people to think, "When Vicente Fox gets into power." He wants them to swell with hope. And they do. They shout, "Today!" But you can almost hear them adding, in a dark tone of fatalism, "Maybe!"
For how else can Mexicans feel? They have had their hopes raised before. Twelve years ago, in 1988, one of the princes of the PRI, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, having defected from the old party, ran for president as an opposition candidate with support from the left. That time, the feeling of hope was sharp and fiery. Cardenas won the election, or so it is thought by a good many people. But the PRI is a past master at election frauds. The vote-counters announced a computer crash. The PRI's candidate, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was declared the winner. And Salinas's circle turned out to be spectacularly corrupt, and slightly murderous to boot.
In the 1994 election, people again began to imagine that, at last, the PRI might get overthrown. Cardenas, the old hero from 1988, had lost some of his sheen by then -- partly because a wave of killings during the Salinas years had decimated his left-wing party. But in Mexico there has always been a right-wing opposition, too, the National Action party, which is Catholic and pro-business. In 1994, someone from National Action stepped forward to lead the new crusade -- a dapper, bearded politician named Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, who seemed to be a man of talent.
That year, as in 1988, I watched the goings-on. I remember Diego Fernandez's face glowing from a television screen in a Coyoacan cantina, and the whole room shouting "Diego!" Yet, just when Diego Fernandez seemed to be doing pretty well against the PRI, he stopped campaigning; no one knows why. The PRI sailed to victory yet again. Ernesto Zedillo became president. And ordinary Mexicans sank still deeper into the gray swamp that surrounds authoritarian societies everywhere -- the miasmas of resignation and cynicism, streaked with bizarre and sinister conspiracy theories and brightly colored millenarian fantasies that cannot possibly come to pass.
In the years after Cardenas's powerful showing in the 1988 race, Mexico did, in its timid way, begin to change. The PRI was always a giant octopus of an organization, with business interests, state enterprises, its own labor unions, street mobs and mass organizations of the poor and a dozen other tentacles, known and unknown, all of them attached to the octopus's head, which consists of money and corruption. Even today, the old organization makes a fairly open habit of buying votes in poor neighborhoods. The PRI's candidate for president in today's election, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, has shown no embarrassment at all in surrounding himself with some of the shadiest faces from the PRI's old guard.
And yet, the democratic breeze has been blowing for a long time now, and the PRI has had to bend with the wind. The old party has allowed one and another opposition politician to win local elections in the last few years, including Cardenas, who became the mayor of Mexico City, and Vicente Fox, who became the governor of Guanajuato state. Freedom of the press, which used to be minimal, has become more than minimal. And so the PRI has ended up weaker and more vulnerable, and the opposition has grown bigger and richer (no small thing). And this time, in Fox, the opposition has found a candidate who is sensational even in his looks.
For as everyone loves to notice, Vicente Fox, at a rugged 58, is the Marlboro Man. He wears black cowboy boots. His belt buckle, in a slightly ominous touch, touts the oversize letters FOX. His mighty shoulders point like ax blades in either direction. His chin is a steel prow, cutting the air. Every bristly hair of his Dapper Dan mustache expresses impudence. The crown of his head stands a full 6 feet 6 inches above the ground. He is a giant. And that is only half the story.
Fox wears his big leather boots because, having grown up on a farm, the rancher's manner is his by right. But having studied with the Jesuits, he left the farm behind and took up a career in business. And because some cliches are, in their boundlessness, positively sinister, the Marlboro Man steadily rose in the world until he had become the president of Coca-Cola in its Mexican branch.
When he shifted over to politics, he enlisted in National Action, the right-wing party. But he also cleverly applied a few soft-drink marketing methods to constructing a parallel organization of his own, the Friends of Fox, in order to keep a distance from the pesky barons and troglodytic ideologues of National Action. He raised money, apparently with no trouble at all (though his enemies complain about foul play). And he has shown that he knows how to work a crowd.
I rode in his campaign bus into villa isla, a few miles from Minatitlan, where his local organizers had gathered a few thousand people together with a long row of farm tractors. Fox shook a couple of hands. He strode over to the first of those tractors and climbed into the driver's seat. He clapped a straw sombrero on his head. And right away he began, very slowly, to drive.
The tractor was a big green John Deere with rear wheels five feet tall, and it was surrounded on all sides by the jostling crowd, which made driving a delicate business. But he pushed forward. And with one hand on the wheel, guiding his tractor through the human sea, Fox raised his free hand in the V sign, which is a symbol of his campaign. The crowd roared. And down the street he went, the conquering general, riding in triumph on his white steed, which happened to be a green tractor.
It was quite a stunt. It was the performance of a man who really might get himself elected president -- cheerful, confident, well organized, efficient with time. And so, as any number of Mexicans have come to believe, in today's election the moment for change on the biggest of scales may finally have arrived. Every single condition for a democratic transition at the national level seems to be at hand: a popular disgust for the PRI, a lust for change, a feeling of freedom, a smaller likelihood of large-scale fraud and an opposition leader who radiates brio with every oversize step he takes.
There is only one problem. Vicente Fox is not the only well-liked insurgent running for president. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is also running. No one seriously believes that Cardenas can win, though his supporters sometimes convince themselves otherwise. His poll statistics dropped into single figures just a few months ago. But many millions of people in Mexico will always have a place in their hearts for the wronged and defrauded hero of 1988, and his poll statistics began to rise. He still can't win, short of a miracle. But if his numbers climb high enough, he will guarantee that Fox can't win, either. And the PRI will triumph once again.
When will Mexico change? This year, the question can be answered with exactitude. Mexico will change when enough people among the opposition democrats, on the right and left, agree to pull together against the PRI. You might imagine that, in our postideological age, a principled alliance of right and left would have been easily enough arranged. In any number of countries around the world during the last dozen years, democratic revolutions have succeeded precisely because of that kind of coalition. In 1990, coalitions of the democratic right and left overthrew the governments of Augusto Pinochet in Chile and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. It was the same in Eastern Europe in 1989, where some of the anti-Communist dissidents were social democrats and others were free-market Thatcherites.
In Mexico, Fox and Cardenas did entertain the same idea. Their emissaries negotiated, and in the southern state of Chiapas the two parties managed to come up with a single candidate for governor. But no such luck at the national level. It could even be that by the time you read this article, some 11th-hour maneuver might have taken place, and Cardenas or some of his allies might have thrown their support to Fox. But even if some such alliance did take shape, it is impossible to imagine Cardenas and his allies working up any enthusiasm for Fox. So the real decision will have to be made by the voters themselves, with or without their leaders -- by many thousands of ordinary Mexicans who might normally prefer to vote for Cardenas and the left but who will now have to consider voting, in the name of democracy, for Fox, the right-wing cowboy.
One day I visited Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in his campaign headquarters. I told him, in all sincerity, that he was the hero of Mexican democracy, due to his race in 1988 and his dignity afterward. And I asked if he didn't worry that by splitting the opposition, he was going to bring his heroic career to a tragic end. My premise was that Fox's victory would represent an obvious forward step for democracy. But Cardenas didn't agree, for reasons that mirror a crucial ambiguity that you find among a lot of people in the Mexican left. If you ask those people to explain why they hate the PRI, sometimes they will say: because the PRI is corrupt and dictatorial. But other times they will fall into an old-fashioned, left-wing style of thinking, which looks on economics as the foundation of life and on politics as secondary. When they slip into that particular mood, Mexico's leftists are likely to say: we despise the PRI because it is the agent of the rich.
From Cardenas's perspective, the PRI wasn't so bad until the early 1980's, when it began privatizing the old state economy. But from that point of view, Fox's National Action offers very little alternative. National Action is strictly pro-business, and given its druthers, would surely privatize everything in sight. National Action and the PRI disagree on many things, but on macroeconomic issues, their instincts are the same.
Now, you might suppose that after all these years the Mexican left could tell at a glance the difference between a corrupt, authoritarian octopus like the PRI and an ordinary pro-business party like National Action, even if both parties speak the language of market economics. But the Mexican left has modern moods and antique moods, and when antiquity prevails, the left sees no difference at all. That was Cardenas's position. He said about Fox, "I don't think he represents the real and deep change that Mexico needs."
Cardenas had a deeper worry, too -- a gut belief that, even apart from economic policy, Fox is no democrat at all. It is because of his tempestuousness and because of the crafty shifts in his campaign positions. Cardenas worried about National Action and its old-fashioned Catholic prudery and its line on abortion and other sexual questions.
And this gut belief of Cardenas's, as I discovered, was by no means his alone. I visited the new mayor of Mexico City, Rosario Robles Berlanga, who took over City Hall after Cardenas resigned to run for president. Robles is a vigorous woman in her mid-40's, a big talent who has made herself tremendously popular in no time flat -- someone with a real possibility of becoming a presidential contender herself six years from now on a left-wing ticket. She told me that in her judgment Fox is an authoritarian-in-waiting. "There is no difference between him and Fujimori," she said, referring to the Peruvian strongman.
I visited Carmen Boullosa, who is one of Mexico's liveliest literary figures. Fox reminded Boullosa of the macho Catholic authoritarians she knew as a child, against whom she had to rebel -- the kind of figure who has always blocked the door to any kind of modern life. I visited Marta Lamas, Mexico's leading feminist and the editor of "Debate Feminista." Lamas nearly exploded at Fox's name. She saw in him a threat to every forward step that women have taken in Mexico, a threat so large and dangerous that, unlike all the other left-wingers with whom I spoke, she said that six more years of a lamentable PRI dictatorship would suit her better than a wild experiment with Vicente Fox as president.
The whole attitude was expressed in detail by Carlos Monsivais, the cultural critic, in the weekly magazine Proceso and again over coffee and Coke. Monsivais looked on Fox as the worst sort of Catholic reactionary. He had gathered together an alarming collection of quotations to prove it, too: Fox complaining about the useful laws that long ago defined the secular state; Fox criticizing the lay character of public education; Fox saying he wants the schools to teach religious values, meaning Catholic values. Monsivais observed that on matters of abortion, Fox has expressed a hostility even to the extreme cases, like the rape of a child, where Mexican law does permit the procedure. Fox on homosexuality: "A degenerate act which goes against human nature."
Monsivais saw a dangerous messianism in Fox. It bothered him no end that Fox began his campaign by hoisting the banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the ancient symbol of Mexico's Catholic extreme right. But then, for all his hair-raising quotations, Monsivais wouldn't go so far as Lamas, the feminist. He looked on Fox as horrible, and on the PRI as even more horrible. It was just that Monsivais couldn't possibly bring himself to vote for the lesser of two horribles. He told me he was going to vote for Cardenas and hope for the best.
That sort of reaction has not gone unnoticed among Fox's advisers. And so, in the latter days of the campaign, Fox set out to undo some of his more disastrous gestures to the extreme right. The banner of the Virgin of Guadalupe was quietly put away. In one of his television debates, Fox poured words of praise on the Mexican left for its historic role in opposing the PRI. He praised the student uprising of 1968. He praised Cardenas himself for his battles on behalf of democracy.
It is true that in trying to soothe the ruffled left, Fox also managed now and then to hurl a few unforgivable personal insults. I watched him stand up in Veracruz and call Cardenas a traitor to his own party for refusing to withdraw from the race. He insulted Cardenas's mother. A bad move! Still, he calmed down and resumed his courtship, with an occasional success. A group of some 30 left-wingers announced that they were endorsing Fox in spite of their philosophical differences. Those were serious radicals -- people from the defunct Mexican Communist Party and from the '68 student rebellion. They held a meeting in Mexico City, and Fox stood on the podium and pushed his courtship even further. In a sober tone, as if swearing an oath to the entire public, he promised not to do any of the scary things, point by point, that he had been accused of wanting to do.
"I commit myself to maintain the lay character of the Mexican state and public education," he said. "I commit myself to maintain the liberty, diversity and pluralism of Mexican society and never to use the power of the state to impose lifestyles, religious beliefs or codes of personal behavior. To respect the liberty of creation, of culture and of expression of all the groups who form Mexican society."
He promised to limit the power of the presidency, which, under the PRI, has been almost monarchical. He promised to make the struggle against poverty and inequality the "supreme priority" of his new government. And he absolutely promised not to do what, in the past, he has always been itching to do, which is to privatize Mexico's state oil company, Pemex.
It was everything he could possibly do to placate the left, short of cutting off a hand. But the response among a good many left-wingers was, I must say, to recoil from Fox even more violently than before -- as if he had now revealed himself to be not just a dangerous reactionary but a dangerous liar too, a man without any principles whatsoever, not even reactionary principles.
It should be added that Fox's enemies on the left have not been the only people to glance in his direction and worry. Enrique Krauze is Mexico's leading historian and one of its most eloquent defenders of liberal democratic ideas, and in May he published his own estimation of Fox. It was a balanced appraisal, not entirely condemning Fox but fretting about his political background. Krauze reminded his readers that during the 1920's, thousands of peasants in central Mexico rebelled against the anticlerical wing of Mexico's Revolution and in the name of Christ the King went to war. They were known as the Cristeros, from the Spanish for Christ. The war was a calamity.
Fox, as Krauze saw him, comes out of the fiercest of the Cristero districts and has always nursed a vivid and slightly alarming nostalgia for Cristero values. Then, too, Krauze observed that Fox went to visit Fidel Castro not long ago and came away full of praise. That was not exactly a right-wing thing to do. Krauze found it worrisome, though.
There is, of course, one other group that has been steadily tossing its own criticisms at Fox. An internal dossier of Francisco Labastida's PRI campaign has fallen into my hands -- a book-length analysis of Fox, part of which appears to have been written by a psychologist, in the grimmest of terms: "An obsessive character, possibly associated with messianic delirium," not to mention misogyny and authoritarianism. And, sure enough, no sooner did I leaf through the PRI dossier than I began to notice attacks of that nature on Fox's character appearing in the press. It was even suggested, somewhat indirectly, that Fox is not only a madman but also a fascist.
Labastida spoke at a PRI rally in Jalisco. "Long live liberty and long live tolerance!" cried the candidate of the world's oldest ruling party. "Let's not let reaction, intolerance and fascism spread!"
So is Vicente Fox the hope for Mexican democracy? or, if you will pardon the pun, is Fox a wolf in sheep's clothing? I cannot peer into his head to identify his actual intentions. But I have been able to observe him and chat with him on a number of occasions. And I can offer an impression. His personal values on questions of abortion, homosexuality and the importance of religious education came to him from his Jesuit upbringing, in the conservative environment that Krauze has described. Those ideas are not going to change.
Even now he collects books on Cristero themes. But business became his passion. When he changed course in life and became a politician for National Action, he had no difficulty in squaring his antique Catholic sentiments with his modern business ideas. National Action has always had its Catholic nostalgias. The party was organized in 1939 to fight against the leftward tilt of the Mexican Revolution, and its early sympathies veered toward Generalissimo Franco in Spain. Franco's Falange wore blue shirts and so did Mexico's National Action. Still, the old fascists in Spain have mostly evolved into democratic conservatives. And in Mexico, National Action, which was never entirely fascist, likewise evolved -- from the party of Christ the King to the Catholic party of business and democracy.
Fox himself shows the evolution. as soon as he opens his mouth, it becomes obvious that he despises the PRI -- despises it with a quick, hot passion that endears him to ordinary people. He remembers the PRI's murders, massacres and corruption. But mostly he hates the PRI because it has run Mexico's economy badly. He is an outraged businessman. And then, having evolved into a businessman-politician, he adopted one more set of ideas, which you don't find anywhere else in National Action.
This last set of inspirations came to him from an unhappy experience in his first, unsuccessful race for the governorship of Guanajuato state, back in 1991. The PRI converted that particular election into an obvious fraud. Fox mounted a furious protest. And he found himself standing shoulder to shoulder with a number of activists from the left, Cardenas's supporters, who were campaigning for a modern electoral system. One of those people was Jorge G. Castaneda, a political writer who is well known in the United States as a commentator on Mexican affairs and as a professor at New York University.
In 1991, Castaneda was an ambitious young man from an elite but slightly peculiar background. His father had been foreign minister for the PRI. He himself had spent a few years in the Mexican Communist Party. By the time he met Fox, though, the young Castaneda had given up on Communism and was hard at work trying to rethink the whole concept of leftism and its goals. His research led him to still another Latin American professor in the United States, Roberto Mangabeira Unger, a Brazilian who teaches at Harvard.
Mangabeira Unger had soured on the traditional left-wing dream of a giant social-welfare state. He wanted Latin America's left-wing movements to build smaller and more efficient states that would use market methods to improve the condition of the poor -- to harness higher taxes to the methods of the pro-business right, in order to achieve the egalitarian goals of the left. Mangabeira Unger was a Latin American theorist of what only later has come to be known as the Third Way.
Castaneda picked up on those ideas, and he and Fox began to talk. Castaneda introduced Fox to Mangabeira Unger. And Fox became entranced with the notion of using his Coca-Cola skills to do what the PRI in recent decades has never been able to do: achieve something lasting for the poor.
Those are the ideas that seem to fire up Fox's imagination. When I spoke with him two years ago, he nattered on about economics, market programs to help the poor, democracy and corruption. Riding around with him on the campaign bus in the last weeks of his campaign, I must have watched Fox deliver a dozen speeches to audiences of every kind, and those speeches, too, hit the same notes. Sometimes he stressed the importance of labor unions -- real unions, run by their own members, instead of the state unions that are run by the PRI.
Late one night on the bus, when everyone seemed to be nodding off except the driver and the candidate, I took the seat next to him at the front of the bus and asked him about Fidel Castro. Fox told me that he genuinely admired Castro's achievements in public education, in creating "human capital." But what most caught Fox's imagination in Cuba seemed to be how beautifully Castro has restored a portion of downtown Havana. "That kind of thing is valuable for tourism," he explained, as if everything ought to have its business justification. He reflected on Mexico City and its failure to capitalize on the tourist potential.
The bus was hurtling through darkness, with no cars on the highway and no houses on the side. We pulled up at a toll booth, and Fox interrupted our chat to lean out the window and flash his V sign at the astonished toll collectors and win two more votes.
Then he wanted to talk about an interesting system for spreading financial credit to the very poor that he has seen in Bangladesh. He is a big fan of what he calls "microenterprises," the tiny businesses of the poor. And he veered into a discussion of the international business of freelance political consultants -- people like Dick Morris, who struck Fox as rather creative, and James Carville, who struck him as less creative (and who has gone to work for the PRI). But can foreign consultants make any sense of Mexican politics? "I don't think they have a nose for Mexico," he said. Fox hired his own consultant from the ranks of Mexico's Coca-Cola. And such was the conversation: business, politics, business and more business.
In my hearing, he never did harp on what, in the United States, are called "family values" or "Christian values." Those were simply not his campaign themes. Still, I did hear him let rip more than once with a slogan from the Cristero fanatics of the 1920's. He said: "If I advance, follow me! If I hold back, push me! If I retreat, kill me!" Which does sound a little extreme. And there you have the problem with Vicente Fox. He dreams a businessman's vision of a modern Mexico. But now and then, when the moon comes out, he reverts to his old nostalgias. He can't help himself.
Most of the people who line up to hear him speak aren't thinking about religious questions or about sexual and cultural controversies. They want him to lambaste the PRI and to lay out his business ideas, which sound so much more inventive and impassioned than anyone else's. But there are any number of historical-minded people whose ears twitch at the sound of those ancient Cristero slogans and who begin to reflect that Fox's National Action does contain a number of genuine fanatics of the old-fashioned Catholic right. Which is true; I've met them.
And so the worries begin. Fox has only himself to blame. But it must be said that in Mexico's left-wing opposition, he and his National Action have met their counterpart. For the Mexican left is likewise a mix of modern ideas and old-fashioned prejudices. And under the pressure of a desperately close election, Mexico's right-wing party and its left-wing party have, between them, ended up refighting the Cristero War of the 1920's, or perhaps the Spanish Civil War of the 1930's -- the eternal battle of class-struggle left-wingers against the warriors of Christ the King. And they have managed to forget that the largest and most intractable of Mexico's problems today don't come from Catholic fanatics or from anti-Catholic fanatics but from a corrupt authoritarianism whose end could be easily arranged -- if only the right and the left would stop their quarreling.
What Mexico needs, you might suppose, are some lucid intellectuals, capable of dragging their own political movements into modern times. All over the world in the last dozen years, when authoritarian governments have been overthrown, the intellectuals have been in the forefront, and a few of them have even become political leaders. Vaclav Havel, the Czech hipster, is the supreme example. But Mexico is not like other countries. Mexico's intellectuals can boast of one of the world's most brilliant literary cultures, and they bask in prestige and wield influence and have always received handsome subsidies, in one form or another, from the state, which means, the PRI. The subsidies have not exactly made them slaves either.
On the contrary, most of Mexico's intellectuals vociferously oppose the PRI. But the greatest number of them do so by supporting C1/3rdenas, even if he can't win. Some of them support an utterly marginal left-wing politician named Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, whose poll statistics hover around 2 percent. And only a handful have supported Fox -- joined in the last days of the campaign by a reluctant and slightly larger number. It is an amazing situation, given how much hangs on this election. But the most striking phenomenon in this campaign has been an outpouring of articles and op-eds supporting democracy in general -- essays so watery and indistinct that you could easily conclude that democracy must be already well established and that the PRI must be no less democratic than any other political organization and that it hardly matters whom you vote for, so long as you vote.
Carlos Fuentes is the most prestigious of the literary intellectuals, and he has made himself a master of such watery endorsements. "Vote for yourself," he wrote. And so Mexico teeters on the edge of an enormous decision -- teeters on the brink of achieving, through peaceful and legal means, a democratic transition of power in the world's largest Spanish-speaking country. And because Fox is an outsider among the intellectuals and because Fox's background has some worrisome aspects, the overwhelming majority of intellectuals have found all kinds of rhetorically elaborate ways to remain safely on the sidelines.
When will Mexico change? What can surely be predicted is that in today's election Mexico will undergo either a larger tragedy or a smaller tragedy. The larger tragedy will come about if the Mexicans simply cannot figure out how to escape the only political party they have ever known. The smaller tragedy will come about if, in spite of every obstacle, Vicente Fox does succeed in defeating the PRI. Fox will move into Los Pinos. And he will discover that bringing democracy to Mexico is going to be harder than it ought to be, if only because he and the rest of Mexico's democrats are still caught up in ancient myths and feuds, and people who should be his allies aren't.

Hurdles that online grocery shopping must jump range from the logistical to the generational.

BYLINE: By Constance L. Hays

 BODY:
LAST week, two big names in the online grocery business announced they were merging, with Webvan agreeing to pay $1.2 billion for HomeGrocer.com. Online grocers seem to be coming quickly to the realization that there is strength through scale, but significant kinks in the business continue to present big challenges to its long-term viability.
Online grocery shopping beckons like an electronic Statue of Liberty to the tired, the time-pressed and the hunkered masses who consider going to the grocery an odious task. Why drive all the way to the supermarket to tangle with a shopping cart and risk getting the one with the sticky wheel when you can sit quietly at your computer and click through your choices at your convenience? 
 The converted sing the praises of online grocery shopping, calling it convenient, reliable and, yes, no more expensive than conventional supermarket shopping. "It probably ends up being more cost-effective because you don't pick up the things you don't need," said Robin Bonenfant of Norwalk, Conn., who recently began using Peapod, the Chicago online grocery pioneer that will have its 10th birthday on Wednesday. "They take coupons as well."
Armando Quintero, a father of two who stays home with his children in San Rafael, Calif., said ordering from Webvan had simplified his life in some ways. "They can deliver very early in the morning, so if we need lunch items for our kids, we could get them delivered before school," he said.
Sometimes, he said, he and his wife, who is at work at an office all day, "interact online" -- going over their electronic shopping list and adding or deleting items from their separate computers.
Despite the fans, only about 2.8 percent of Americans buy their groceries online, according to estimates by Evie Black Dykema, a senior analyst with Forrester Research. Among the drawbacks people typically cite are having to plan and having to think about the delivery schedule.
"You have to be organized and thinking ahead," said Tracy Petrak, a legal secretary from San Rafael who orders occasionally from Webvan. At one point, she was surprised to receive a large postcard from the company, observing that she had not ordered in a while and asking, "What did we do wrong?" Webvan also sent her a $25 coupon to use on her next order, she said.
Some people just do not want to give up the social opportunities or the nostalgia they associate with grocery shopping. It ties in with memories of their parents, sometimes, or contributes to a sense of community.
"People feel guilt about shopping online," Ms. Dykema said. "Anecdotally, there is this feeling that it's a little artificial to have their groceries sent to them. It's similar to when Procter & Gamble introduced cake mixes, and they found that women wanted to add their own egg. That way, it was their own cake."
To get people to buy groceries online, companies are using a variety of models. Peapod, which appeared on the edge of extinction just three months ago when its chief executive quit suddenly and a financing deal fell apart, has now aligned itself with a traditional supermarket giant, Royal Ahold. In Fairfield County, Conn., where Mrs. Bonenfant points and clicks, Peapod used Ahold's Stop & Shop stores to fill produce orders, while turning to a Peapod warehouse for other items.
So thorough is the alignment that Royal Ahold owns 51 percent of Peapod, and a former Ahold executive, Marc van Gelder, is running Peapod. Mr. van Gelder seems convinced that Peapod's new model will work. "This is a leverage of the Stop & Shop chain, which stands for good value and good quality," he said. "And we are also leveraging, from a procurement perspective, all the advantages you get from being linked to a $26 billion company. It is a great competitive weapon."
Stop & Shop stores are also being used to promote Peapod, and the two companies are running joint advertisements. "We do advertising in local newspapers as well as public relations and door hangings," Mr. van Gelder said. "What we want to get to is to really personalize e-mail for customers. We will be able to communicate with our customers on a personalized basis."
By hooking electronic shopping so thoroughly to an old-style chain, Peapod is following the example of many European online grocers, which in many cases were started by the traditional retailers. J. Sainsbury and Tesco in Britain and Carrefour and Promodes in France, some of the biggest chains in Europe, all have online services they promote through their stores, said Jacob Jensen, a consultant with Roland Berger Associates, a consumer-products consulting firm in New York, who has studied e-grocers in Europe and in the United States.
But does the model really work? Online grocery companies are typically plagued by two issues: making sure their orders are packed and delivered properly and keeping their costs down -- something that is particularly difficult when a fleet of trucks or vans is involved.
Mr. Jensen said creating a large warehouse, along the lines of Amazon.com, was the only way to meet the first goal effectively. The cost issue is best addressed, he said, by keeping geographic markets closely circumscribed.
"From a cost perspective and from a fulfillment basis, the dedicated warehouse is the best model," he said. "What really upsets the consumers is if you don't deliver the products they ordered, or if you don't hit the window you promised for delivery. And in terms of managing delivery costs, it means the route density has to be mapped out ahead of time."
One French online grocer, Tele-Market, has tried to solve the distribution issue by subcontracting its delivery service. "They have independent couriers driving around with their products, and they take other companies' products along as well," Mr. Jensen said.
Generally, the more deliveries in a given area, the lower the costs over all. But except for a few cities, Americans who can afford computers and Internet access are more likely to live in suburbs, if not exurbs, which means more driving for any company that offers delivery.
When it comes to building critical mass for online shopping, timing may turn out to be everything.
"The next wave is when these 18- to 20-year-olds start replenishing their own households," Ms. Dykema said, noting how that age group already goes online to do much of its shopping, from cars to electronics to groceries. "They can't imagine why consumers wouldn't look online first for products. They don't suffer from any of these hang-ups."

HEADLINE: London Buyers Ignore Auction Inquiry

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 2

 BODY:
As collectors and dealers gathered here last week for Christie's and Sotheby's big sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, the auction houses' legal troubles in the United States seemed to make no difference to the buyers. Still, it was clear that the shadow cast by the federal antitrust investigation in New York had crossed the Atlantic. At the same moment on Tuesday night that Sotheby's was holding its important sale of Impressionist and modern art at its Bond Street headquarters here, Christie's was conducting its auction of contemporary art just a few blocks away on King Street.
Such scheduling conflicts never happened in the past when the two companies met openly to plan the year's auctions. But with prosecutors investigating whether the auction houses fixed prices and questioning every move they make, it was obvious that a message was being not so subtly delivered, even at this distance. 
 "We can't talk to each other at all anymore," said one top auction house official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Other than that, no one in charge offered any explanation.
As the auctions here progressed, the strong economy gave collectors confidence about the art market, making last week's sales successful for both Sotheby's and Christie's. Prices were consistently high, especially for the rarest, most expensive works. If these sales are any reflection of today's tastes, then Impressionist paintings, sculpture and photography are especially popular. But while prices were strong, few bidders went wild.
"It's an intelligent market," said Franck Giraud, head of Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art departments worldwide. "Nobody got carried away, but at the same time they didn't let the best things go for low prices. There were no bargains."
Melanie Clore, a deputy chairman of Sotheby's who runs its Impressionist and modern art department here, defined the market as healthy and controlled. The biggest difference between today and the 1980's boom, she said, is that people now are more discriminating. "They aren't in a rush. They don't need to buy mediocre material, and there's no absolutely speculative buying."
The best works sold for prices consistent with the boom years of the late 1980's. At Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art, for instance, Degas's "Young Dancer at 14," a 1922 posthumous cast of a dancer with a cream-colored silk bodice and a tulle-and-gauze tutu, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $11.5 million, above its $10.9 million low estimate.
This was the fourth time a 1922 cast of this statue had sold at auction in 12 years. In 1988, at the height of the market, one was included in a sale of art from the estate of William Mayer Goetz, a founder of 20th Century Fox, and his wife, Edith, at Christie's in New York, where it sold to Prince Jefri Bolkiah, the brother of the Sultan of Brunei, for $10.1 million. In 1996 Sotheby's sold another such Degas in New York on behalf of the Shelburne Museum in Vermont for $11.9 million. And in November, Prince Jefri sold his at Sotheby's in New York for $12.3 million.
Some prices last week exceeded those in the late 80's boom. Monet's "Beach at Trouville," a sun-dappled seascape, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder at Sotheby's on Tuesday night for $16.4 million, well above its $15 million high estimate. The painting had fetched $10.7 million at the Goetz sale at Christie's in New York 12 years ago.
A 1942 Matisse, "Dancer in an Armchair With a Checkered Floor," that was expected to bring $3.9 million to $5.4 million at Sotheby's, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $7.4 million. Four people wanted the painting, which shows Carla Avogadro, a dancer who was a friend of the artist, posing in a bright yellow chair against a background of black and white checks. The buyer bid through David Norman, head of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in New York.
(Final prices include the auction house's commissions: for Sotheby's it is 20 percent of the first $15,000, 15 percent of the next $85,000 and 10 percent of any amount over $100,000. Christie's charges 17.5 percent of the first $80,000 plus 10 percent of any amount above that. Estimates at both auction houses do not reflect commissions.)
This season Christie's combined its Impressionist and Post-Impressionist auction with its sale of 20th-century art in one evening, and both areas of the market were strong. Its star painting was Cezanne's "Still Life With Fruits and a Ginger Pot" from 1895. It was exhibited in the artist's first retrospective in Paris the year it was painted and later belonged to two famous dealers, Ambroise Vollard and Bruno Cassirer.
"For Cezanne, who was never satisfied with a painting, this was unusually finished and resolved," Mr. Giraud said. Two determined bidders vied for the painting, which ended up selling to William Acquavella, the Manhattan dealer, for $18.1 million, just at its high estimate.
Three bidders at Christie's were willing to spend upward of $6 million for Monet's 1894 "Spring Landscape (Giverny)," which sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $6.6 million, just above its low estimate of $6 million. A later, more abstract Monet, "The Japanese Bridge," painted between 1918 and 1924, was mightily fought over by two determined telephone bidders. It finally sold to an unidentified bidder for $4.3 million, above its high estimate of $2.2 million.
One rare and much sought-after painting, a brightly colored Fauve portrait of the artist Jean Metzinger painted by Robert Delaunay in 1906, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $2.9 million, far above its $2.1 million high estimate. Delaunay, who was better-known as an abstract painter, did few Fauve paintings. Metzinger is posed at an angle with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and in the background is a Japanese print, reminiscent of the famous van Gogh portrait "Le Pere Tanguy.
"When you think of Fauve artists you think of Matisse, Braque, Derain and Vlamink; you don't think of Delaunay," Mr. Giraud said. "So for a collector of Fauve works, this was a great find."
At both Sotheby's and Christie's sculptures tended to be popular, as they have for the last year. Works by Rodin, Giacometti and Picasso all brought prices far above their high estimates. One reason was that as the prices of paintings have steadily risen in recent years, sculptures by artists like Matisse, Picasso and Degas have seemed cheap by comparison.
Among contemporary collectors the same can be said for photographs. Artists like Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, Gilbert and George, and Thomas Struth were fought over by a crowd of young, international collectors who were willing to pay any price to take home famous images. Never mind that these photographs are printed in multiples.
"In this media-saturated world, young collectors were raised on images," said Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide. "They are not concerned with things being unique, they want to know that they have something that is exactly the same as a photograph hanging in the Museum of Modern Art."
This group of buyers, Mr. Meyer added, tend to come from the film industry. "They are completely uninterested in abstract painting. It's a midcentury struggle they have no connection to."
Contemporary art in general continued to command high prices, as it did at the big auctions in New York in May. At Christie's sale of 20th-century art, Bacon's "Study for a Portrait (Man Screaming)" from 1952 sold for $4.4 million, far above its $2.7 million high estimate. A Jeff Koons, "Large Vase of Flowers," a 1991 polychrome wood bouquet of 140 spring flowers that stands 4 feet 3 inches high and was estimated to sell for $380,000 to $520,000, fetched $994,961. The buyer was identified only as a European collector.
At Sotheby's a photorealist painting by Gerhard Richter of a view of Corsica with a sailboat in the distance was bought by another unidentified collector for $1.3 million, twice its high $670,00 estimate. Two people fought to take home a late de Kooning, "Untitled XVII," from 1982, an abstraction of bright blues and reds on a white background. It sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.9 million, more than twice its high $900,000 estimate.
Experts at both Sotheby's and Christie's noticed an increase in European buyers this season. No longer were the Top 10 works in each sale bought by Americans.
"The presence of Europeans was a significant change," Mr. Meyer said. "This is a market fueled by new buyers and new money. It's the economy that drives it."

HEADLINE: Magazines Combat Proposed Increase in Postal Rates

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
When magazine publishers and chief executives of media companies discuss the latest problem facing the magazine industry, they use words like "passion," "devastation" and "death."
Executives who usually favor brevity will spend an hour in conversation detailing the potential "horror" of the crisis. The feared trauma is such that magazine publishers have been cruising the halls of Congress for the last five months, spending millions of dollars lobbying for relief. 
 It is not a grand theme like freedom of speech or censorship that is kicking up all the emotion. The panic involves a rate increase the United States Postal Service has proposed to take effect next year, that would raise the cost of mailing subscription copies of magazines by 15 percent.
Estimating that the rate increase will cost their industry $300 million in the next two years, magazine publishers are going -- well -- postal.
"This could be potentially devastating for many magazines," said Nina B. Link, the president of the Magazine Publishers of America.
The Magazine Publishers of America plan to spend $10 million this year lobbying Congress on the issue, while companies like Time Warner, the parent company of Time Inc., have put their own lobbyists to work on the case as well.
The Magazine Publishers, a trade group to which more than 1,020 of the largest consumer magazines belong, has placed ads in trade journals stating that the proposed increase is twice the average increase the Postal Service usually proposes, is three times the rate of inflation and is double what the Postal Service actually needs to cover the projected costs of processing magazines.
But economists for the Postal Service say that while the service is willing to negotiate the proposed increase, it is not only necessary -- it is mandated by federal law. The Postal Reform Act of 1970 mandates that every class of mail must cover its own mailing costs.
This latest rate-increase proposal comes at a tense time for the industry: newsstand sales are sinking, subscriptions are down for many consumer magazines, and several smaller but high-profile magazines have closed this year.
And some publishers still remember the last time such a large postal increase went into effect for the magazine industry -- in the early 1970's, when the added financial burden contributed to the demise of even some venerable publications like the old weekly Life.
"Small magazines are the ones that will be most devastated because they have smaller margins," Ms. Link said. "This will hurt them the most. And it will be hard for other magazines with larger circulations that don't have much wiggle room."
Ms. Link has spent a substantial part of the last five months on Capitol Hill, pleading with members of the House and the Senate to encourage the Postal Service to turn back the rate hike. She has encouraged both Democrats and Republicans to unite in asking William J. Henderson, the Postmaster General, to reconsider the increase.
And Ms. Link has been joined by some of the most powerful figures in magazine publishing: Cathleen P. Black, the president of Hearst Magazines; Christopher M. Little, the president of the Meredith Publishing Group, and Daniel B. Brewster, the former chief executive of American Express Publishing who is now the chief executive of Gruner + Jahr magazines. She has hit Capitol Hill with as many as 10 magazine publishers in tow.
"We have been trying to educate anyone and everyone as to why this is so unfair and unjust and unreasonable," Ms. Link said.
The proposed rate increase applies to consumer magazines that are mailed under the bulk classification of "periodicals." Rate increases for other categories, such as first-class mail, are in the single digits. Greg Frey, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said that the last increase -- only 4.6 percent -- was proposed two years ago and went into effect in January 1999. Ms. Link said because that increase was so much smaller, the decision met less criticism from the magazine industry.
Mr. Little of Meredith said that every Meredith title would be affected by the proposed rate increase, the news of which he described as "a bombshell."
"Every copy of Better Homes & Gardens will be affected," he said, referring to a Meredith title. "And at Hearst every copy of Good Housekeeping will be affected, and at Conde Nast, every copy of Vogue."
The proposed rate increase has also made strange bedfellows; two of the most concerned crusaders against the increase are The National Geographic Society and Playboy magazine. Both magazines depend on subscriptions for much of their circulation.
Of The Geographic's 8.5 million circulation, 8.2 million copies are sent by subscription. Playboy's subscribers number 2.6 million out of a total circulation of 3.1 million.
Robert Sims, senior vice president for magazine publishing at the National Geographic Society, said that it costs the society 24 cents to send a subscription issue out: the proposed increase could raise that to about 27.6 cents an issue. Do the math: at 3.6 extra cents an issue each month for 8.2 million issues, that is an increase of $295,200 a month in expenses for the society.
"It doesn't sound like much at first," he said. "But when you when you add up the costs of print, editorial, and other distribution costs, well, pretty soon you don't have any money left." He described the rate increase as "potentially devastating for us."
Gail Day, a senior vice president at Playboy Enterprises and the publisher of Playboy, said, "If this goes through, we will have to look to other lines of our business to fund that."
Ashley Lyons, an economist and the manager of pricing for the Postal Service, acknowledged that the proposed increase was a substantial one.
"What we are saying is that the costs of handling magazines will go up by roughly 12.8 percent over the next three years," he said, adding that the Postal Service was actively investigating ways to reduce the increase. The Postmaster General testified before the House's Postal Appropriations Subcommittee that he would take steps to achieve $150 million in savings that would apply to magazine handling.
Mr. Frey of the Postal Service said that the service was not singling out any industry and was making every effort to include cost-cutting measures proposed by the publishers.
"The various classes of mail must support themselves and we cannot cross-subsidize," he said. "And that is mandated by law. For them to feel singled out or to imply that there is a conspiracy against some of our best customers is ridiculous." Mr. Frey said that additional increases in postage would be likely this year because of the recent spike in gas prices.
But even the Postal Service's avowal to try to curb the increase does not placate publishers like Mr. Little, who criticized the Postal Service as poorly managed. He said the Postmaster General had disregarded the Magazine Publishers of America's recommendations over the last two years to keep the increase in the single digits.
"When we first heard of this 15 percent hike, we came in and said, 'Now wait a minute,' " Mr. Little said. " 'We have been working with you for two years and we have been promised that the rate increase would not be anything in the double digits, and then you present us with a 15 percent rate increase.' That to us is just unacceptable."
If the magazine industry and the Postal Service cannot reconcile their differences, the magazine industry may be left with little recourse. Ms. Link said that publishers had begun to explore other options, such as shipping magazines via non-government means like United Parcel Service, DHL and Federal Express.
Mr. Sims of The National Geographic said that the National Geographic Society had broached the idea of negotiating a contract rate with the Postal Service, such as the Society does with foreign postal services like England's Royal Mail. But he said the United States Postal Service will not negotiate individual corporate contracts.
On June 12, Representative Chaka Fattah, a Democrat from Maryland, introduced a bill in Congress that would reduce the rate increase. Congress and the Senate have until November to approve the new rate.
"Did you ever think you'd hear so much passion about postage rates?" Ms. Link asked. "It's ridiculous. I dream about it at night."

HEADLINE: A Race to Save Roman Splendors From Drowning

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER

DATELINE: BELKIS, Turkey, June 27

 BODY:
As waters rise inexorably over the ruins of an ancient Roman town here, an international team of archaeologists has sprung into action to save whatever can be rescued in the next three months.
Buoyed by a $5 million grant from an American foundation, the team hopes to dig up mosaics and artifacts, and to create a historical park and resort. 
 A new lake is being formed as water from the Euphrates River backs up behind a new dam. Turkey is in the midst of a huge dam-building project that is to provide electric power for the country's booming economy and irrigation for parched farmland in southeastern provinces.
The ruins here are those of Zeugma, an important Roman garrison town on the ancient Silk Road. Trade made many of its merchants wealthy, and they decorated the floors of their villas with elaborate mosaics.
Experts say there may be hundreds of exquisite mosaics under the dusty hills, along with a rich trove of other artifacts.
Although archaeologists have been working here sporadically for more than 20 years, they began intensive work only recently after realizing that the inundation was imminent. It quickly became clear that Zeugma was a far more bountiful site than most specialists had realized, but by then it was too late to stop the flooding.
Belkis, the town that once stood below the Zeugma site, has already disappeared under the new lake. A new Belkis is being built on a nearby hillside, but many residents are embittered by what they say is the government's indifference to their plight.
News accounts of the flooding of Zeugma have appeared in many countries. Hardly a day goes by without a foreign journalist or television team appearing here.
In Gaziantep, the nearest city, more than 1,000 tourists have arrived in the last few weeks, according to hotel managers, restaurateurs and taxi drivers. Before the wave of publicity, they said, it was a rare month when even a dozen tourists came.
Some Turkish archaeologists and government officials seem uncomfortable with the clamor from abroad, apparently viewing it as a form of interference that borders on insult. Directors of the Gaziantep archaeology museum, where artifacts dug up at Zeugma are piled high, scorned an American philanthropist, Shawn Estes, who appeared here two weeks ago and offered the museum a gift of $20,000. They also refused to allow him to work as a volunteer at the site, and when he addressed the local Rotary Club he was accused of harboring a secret plan to steal mosaics.
"I suggested that he ask permission from the Directorate of Museums in Ankara if he wanted to work or donate money," said Kemal Sertok, who is coordinating work at the site. "In Turkey we only employ staff archaeologists."
The authorities have, however, accepted a $5 million grant from a California-based foundation, the Packard Humanities Institute. Louise Schofield, who represents the foundation here, said it might donate more money in the future.
"Our work is going to be in three phases," she said. "First is the rescue excavation of the area that will be covered by water after Oct. 4. Then there will be a very large conservation program in cooperation with the Turkish team. And then, in the long term, there is a plan to turn this site into a major archaeological park."
With at least 10 more dams scheduled to be built in southeastern Turkey in the coming decades, conflict between advocates of economic development and historical preservation may grow.
The next focus of this conflict is likely to be Hasankeyf, a historical town 260 miles east of here that is to be inundated in a few years.
A British company has won the contract to build the dam at Hasankeyf, but opponents are waging a vocal campaign in Britain. When they invited the mayor of Hasankeyf to attend one of their protest rallies in London, the Turkish authorities advised him not to go, and he canceled his trip.
"We're hoping to defuse this sense of confrontation," said Richard Hodges, a British archaeologist who is helping to direct the Zeugma excavation. "I'm interested in preserving culture, but I also like to drink water and use electricity. If we can make this project work, it can be a model for Turkey's future."
But some Turkish preservationists reject the idea of such compromises. "The appropriate lessons should be drawn from this and newly planned dam projects should be halted," said Asket Tibet, general secretary of the Archaeologists' Association.
That call was echoed by the general secretary of the History Association, Orhan Silier. "The world's leading historians are trying to reinterpret history by using findings from these regions," Mr. Silier said. "Yet we leave them under water."
It is still unclear, and may be for years, how much of Zeugma is being lost. Some specialists believe it may be less than 10 percent. Others say there is no way of being sure, since an unknown portion of the city is already under water and no one is certain how much remains buried beneath the adjacent hills.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: POLITICAL MEMO;
Shades of Gloom and Gleams of Confidence With Miles to Go

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 30

 BODY:
He may be Al Gore's most ardent booster, but President Clinton sounded rather tentative this week when he was asked about the vice president's prospects in November. "It's still more likely than not that he will win," Mr. Clinton said.
It is no secret that even with 130 days to go before the election, Democrats are unsettled, even gloomy, while Republicans are confident. Could the presidential race be over barely after it started? 
 Once again this week, it seemed that Al Gore could not catch a break: One national poll even had him 13 points behind Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Mr. Gore found himself again confronted by questions over whether the Justice Department would investigate his fund-raising practices. And Ralph Nader was elected the nominee of the Green Party, leaving Democrats to fret that he would steal votes from Mr. Gore's base. All this occurred within days after Mr. Gore named a new campaign chairman.
But even Bush loyalists concede that Democrats should not despair -- at least not yet.
No one should underestimate Mr. Gore's potential political potency: Voters may, in the end, give him credit for helping preside over the longest economic expansion in the nation's history. He is a disciplined, if lackluster, campaigner who is known for performing best in adversity. He displayed that ability when he toppled former Senator Bill Bradley in the primaries. Now, he plans to zero in on Mr. Bush's support of a rather unpopular but enormous tax cut, as well as the governor's stands on Social Security and Medicare.
Another advantage for Mr. Gore is that no one questions his competence to make decisions and to grasp issues -- and to understand how to navigate the often befuddling world of government and politics in Washington. If voters find they are not sufficiently confident of Mr. Bush's preparedness for the Oval Office -- or his heft on the issues -- they could turn to Mr. Gore by default.
There is truth to the spin from the Gore camp that the public has yet to focus on the presidential race. In an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted in mid-June, only 13 percent of expected voters said they were following the race very closely.
The reality is that many voters may be waiting for the conventions or the fall debates to learn more about the contenders and settle on a choice. That could be a plus for Mr. Gore, who has far more extensive experience as a debater and is steeped much more deeply in national and international issues. (One danger is that the high expectations for Mr. Gore in debates could work against him if Mr. Bush performs unexpectedly -- and reassuringly -- well.)
One of Mr. Gore's biggest problems is, simply, that voters seem to like Mr. Bush more and think the vice president is too politically calculating and relentlessly ambitious. But Gore aides said they hoped to turn that into a virtue by convincing voters that as president he would channel that determination and energy into his policy agenda.
Another often neglected reality is that the race may be closer than it now looks. Despite Mr. Gore's troubles in winning over loyal Democrats, in the end the likelihood is that most Democrats will side with him and most Republicans will side with Mr. Bush, leaving the contest to turn on a relatively narrow swath of swing and independent voters.
Rather than dwell on current polls, Democrats can take heart that in three of the last five presidential elections, the candidate behind in the polls at this point won in November: Ronald Reagan in 1980, George Bush in 1988 and Bill Clinton in 1992.
It could be, of course, that Mr. Gore will never climb out of his rut in the polls and that the electorate has settled early on Mr. Bush. As one top Gore aide put it, voters "might decide that they like the other guy better and that's that."
In an interview on a flight from Cleveland to Austin, Tex., on Wednesday, Mr. Bush was careful not to be overconfident -- or to raise expectations for himself.
"He's a sitting vice president with an economy that seems like it's doing pretty well," Mr. Bush said. "He's going to be very difficult to beat. I am not the favorite. Nor is he. I think it's going to be a very close race. I do."
The governor went on to advise: "I wouldn't be putting your money anywhere right now. I'd be calling it too close to call. But I'm going to nip him in the end."
Maybe so. But some Republicans are not so sure.
"The polls that show Bush ahead are extremely soft and misleading," said Mike Murphy, who was a top strategist for the primary campaign of Senator John McCain. Referring to Medicare and Social Security, he said, "Gore has a muddy bag full of ugly wedge issues and he knows how to use them. It's very possible that this race will snap back to near even after the conventions."
Indeed, it could be that the dynamics of the national nominating conventions this summer and the televised debates in the fall, not to say tens of millions of dollars in commercials, could change everything.
"The seminal events of this campaign have yet to occur," said Carter Eskew, one of Mr. Gore's closest advisers. "There's been a lot of early auditioning, but the race has not been engaged. We continue to believe that this race is ultimately going to be over stewardship of the economy and stewardship of the prosperity."
For all their public confidence, some Gore advisers privately worry that Mr. Gore should be far ahead in the polls right now -- not lagging -- given the robust economy and the fact that all seems well in the world. They are concerned that as Mr. Bush reaches out to moderates, Mr. Gore is still having trouble winning over reliable Democratic voters.
At their weekly meeting, top campaign strategists in Nashville last week mulled over what could be going wrong. Everyone seemed to have a suggestion: Some aides concluded that Mr. Gore was coming off as too liberal and needed to be even more aggressively reaching out to moderates. But, participants said, there was also a discussion of what some strategists think is Mr. Gore's fundamental problem: that people do not seem to like him as much as they like Mr. Bush.
Democrats may be uneasy, but they are not panicking because they can still make quite a plausible case for Mr. Gore. And the news media may be allies here: If the vice president demonstrates any glimmer of a comeback, he is bound to draw upbeat coverage (outsized perhaps) depicting him as on the rebound. That is because the news media, by nature, thrive on the dramatic -- and a comeback meets that standard.
"This is a very winnable race for him," said Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster. "Bush still hasn't proven that he can take the heat. And Gore seems to shine the most when the pressure is on."
Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York said he was confident that both the healthy economy and Mr. Gore's deep command of issues would assure him victory. It is certainly true that on many of the most important issues, voters rate the Democrats more capable than Republicans.
"On the big policy issues, I think Gore wins," Mr. Cuomo said. "By the time the debates are over, Bush is not going to be able to dominate on any of these issues. The obvious issue is: 'Didn't these people produce the biggest and best economy in modern history?' And Gore has an edge on the gravitas issue. It will be: 'Who is intelligent enough and who is competent enough to keep us going the way we've been going?' "
Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, a Republican, said he was optimistic, but cautiously so. What could go wrong? "I don't know that there's anything specific," he said. "It's just an understanding of the dynamics of our human existence."
But some Republicans simply refuse to buy the possibility of a Gore triumph. "There's very little that worries me about him," said Gov. John Engler of Michigan, who is working closely with the Bush campaign. "He's going to put together a scorched-earth operation. And he's going to slash and burn."
And Governor Bush, in a slip of the tongue, apparently was so confident at an event earlier this month that he dispensed with the formalities -- like the actual election. "As president," he declared, "I'm here in Knoxville, Tennessee, to tell America I'll set a new tone in Washington."

HEADLINE: With Time Short, Albright Stays Aloft

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 2

 BODY:
How does Madeleine K. Albright want to be remembered as secretary of state? As Dr. Albright zoomed from country to country, region to region -- 4 hours here, 36 hours there in 9 days -- the legacy question was never far away.
Part of her mark in history will be as the first woman to hold the post, a role she relishes. In Seoul, South Korea, last week, she emerged from her plane in citrus yellow, a bold look she said was intended as a metaphor for President Kim Dae Jung's "sunshine policy" with North Korea. In Berlin, she was not too shy to tell an audience that she was grateful for cosmetics to help disguise her exhaustion. 
 Dr. Albright has also taken on issues that others may have considered too soft, like the empowerment of women in developing countries and Internet literacy in nations under dictatorships.
But as Dr. Albright traveled from Beijing to Seoul and on to Warsaw in late June, with an interlude in the Middle East and a drive through the Brandenburg Gate, it was clear that, in the last six months of her term, she wants to concentrate on her vision of democracy.
Democracy, she said in Warsaw, was her "lodestar." And to emphasize the message, she intends to stay on the road.
"What we're going to do is keep traveling around the world and have 36-hour days, so six months is nine months," she told reporters as her plane headed home last Thursday.
She has already visited 82 countries since she took office in January 1997, a record for any secretary of state. She plans two trips to Asia this month, and perhaps another in the fall, including a possible stop in Nepal, where she has never been.
Dr. Albright says her travel shows how the job of secretary of state has changed since the end of the cold war. Her predecessors, she says, concentrated largely on the Soviet Union and the Middle East. Since then, there has been an explosion of new countries -- 189 in the United Nations at last count.
Similarly, foreign policy issues, Dr. Albright likes to say, have expanded beyond traditional questions of arms control and balance of power to international business corruption and illegal immigration. She feels obliged, she suggests, to push United States interests to new corners of the world. And for Dr. Albright, a child of Central Europe whose Czechoslovak parents fled the Communists and arrived in the United States in 1949 to begin a new life, the nurturing of democracy is a prime interest for the United States. (As she bounced from culture to culture during this latest trip, she appeared most at home chatting into the late evening over coffee in Warsaw's old town.)
The centerpiece of her stay in Poland was a conference that pulled together 107 democracies. But the gathering -- born very much of Dr. Albright's guiding hand -- revealed undertones of resentment at American hegemony.
That was most stridently expressed by France, which refused to sign the closing statement. But there were criticisms elsewhere, too.
Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch in New York, whose organization was present in Warsaw, says the promotion of democracy by the United States is useful but is done in such a way that it "fuels growing hostility."
"The United States is increasingly viewed as a government that preaches to the rest of the world but is unwilling to be bound by international standards," he said.
Despite Dr. Albright's efforts, Washington has failed to sign United Nations accords on an international criminal court or on the control of land mines -- largely because the administration and Congress want to immunize American military personnel against international laws imposed on others, and Dr. Albright failed to beat out the Pentagon in internal administration debates.
Dr. Albright seems to believe that she does best abroad, riding imperial motorcades and speaking unchallenged at a broad variety of forums. There, she is away from the political sniping of Congress and day-to-day management from the National Security Council.
She finished this last tour of the world in Berlin with a speech on democracy in the Balkans, which dealt with Serbia as a last holdout of repression.
The secretary began her term rebuking Saddam Hussein. She was one of the strongest advocates within the administration for military strikes and economic sanctions against him, but the Iraqi leader remains in power.
Since then -- before, during and after the war in Kosovo last year -- she has paid much attention to another repressive leader, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. A year after the NATO air campaign, he, too, remains in power -- much to the evident disappointment of Dr. Albright.
In Berlin, she reiterated that Mr. Milosevic belongs in The Hague, home of an international tribunal that indicted him on charges of war crimes. "If Milosevic cared at all about the rule of law," she added, "he would turn himself over to The Hague."
"I'm sure he will go," she said as she headed home, offering no clear way to achieve that goal beyond what she called a combination of people working inside and outside Serbia, and her opinion that his government is increasingly brittle.
"Patience is what is necessary," she said. "The calendar is not what we're looking at."
Dr. Albright is keenly aware of her own calendar, however. She was asked whether the Balkans, which have consumed much of her time, would remain a top priority for the next administration. "It depends on who gets elected," she replied, adding, "No matter where I am, we're not going to forget them."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
At 24, a Political Veteran, Vacuum Cleaner to Platform

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SO how did you spend the summer after seventh grade?
Mowing lawns? Rereading "Born Free" at summer school? Andrei Cherny had grander plans for his vacation. 
 The year was 1988 and he had recently read Theodore H. White's "The Making of the President, 1960." (No comic books for this preteenager.) Inspired by that portrait of John F. Kennedy, he volunteered to work on the Los Angeles campaign of another Massachusetts-bred, Harvard-trained candidate for president, Michael S. Dukakis.
A skeptical campaign official asked what he would like to work on. "Foreign policy," 12-year-old Andrei confidently replied. The official offered a vacuum cleaner instead. By fall, he had graduated from doing floors to stuffing envelopes and answering phones.
But from that modest beginning came more precocious things. By his senior year at Harvard, Mr. Cherny was writing speeches for President Clinton. A week after graduation, he became a senior speech writer for Vice President Al Gore. At 23, he edited a big-thought magazine for the Democratic Leadership Council, the party's leading centrist organization. And at 24, he wrote a book describing the new politics of the new economy.
Now, a month from reaching the ripe old age of 25, Mr. Cherny is writing the Democratic platform, a 20,000-word spiritual guide to the party's political soul that dedicated Democrats will fuss and bicker over all summer, whether or not voters pay any attention to it in the fall.
"I think there are a lot of people who really do look at the platform," Mr. Cherny said. "Perhaps especially in this day and age, it's an important way of saying: here's what the Democratic Party stands for, here's what we've done and what we're going to do."
As platform director, Mr. Cherny joins the ranks of other platform writers with silky prose and grand ideas who later became leading policy makers within the party. In 1984, it was Susan Estrich, who managed the 1988 Dukakis campaign. In 1992, it was Bruce Reed, now a top domestic policy adviser to Mr. Clinton. And in 1996, it was Mr. Reed and Elaine Kamarck, who is now policy director for the Gore campaign.
As any of those people could tell you, platform writing is its own special art form. The prose must be pithy, elegant and inspiring. And the wording must deftly skip across the ideological minefields that have surrounded Democratic and Republican platforms of the past.
For instance, when Senator Edward M. Kennedy challenged President Jimmy Carter in 1980, a combative Kennedy team -- which included the mayor of Cincinnati, Jerry Springer -- produced 25 minority reports on the platform. Things got so testy that a Kennedy adviser named Paul Tully nearly came to blows with a Carter delegate named Mario M. Cuomo.
This year, after former Senator Bill Bradley yielded early in the primaries, the intraparty struggle is much quieter. To be sure, gay rights activists, environmentalists and union leaders are laboring behind the scenes to insert pet phrases into Mr. Cherny's draft. But the process, he insists, has been remarkably consensual and free of acrimony.
"Certainly trade is one place where there's been some debate," he said. "But it's not like you have these groups at each other's throats. You have the single goal of winning in November."
A gentle platform process would befit Mr. Cherny's unassuming style. Lanky and soft-spoken, he fills his spare time, what little there is, with history books, films and, he confesses, "junk TV" shows like "Ally McBeal" and "Friends." In his cluttered office at the Democratic National Committee, a photograph of his favorite scholar-writer-politician, Winston Churchill, sternly stares down from the white wall.
THE older of two sons born to immigrants from Czechoslovakia, Mr. Cherny was raised in the Valley Village section of Los Angeles, a heavily minority, working-class community. His father, a schoolteacher, and mother, a psychotherapist, are proud of his achievements, he says, but not overly awed by the company he keeps.
"They still expect me to pick up my socks and wash the dishes when I'm home," he said.
Mr. Cherny first caught the eye of Democratic heavyweights during his senior year at Harvard, when Donald Baer, then the White House communications director, read a piece he had written for the student newspaper, The Crimson, analyzing President Clinton's landslide victory of 1996.
Mr. Baer showed the article to the president, who liked it so much he made it required reading for his cabinet and cribbed part of a sentence for his second inaugural address. "We need a new government for a new century, a government humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves," the line from the address went.
Mr. Baer commissioned Mr. Cherny to write speeches for Mr. Clinton during his final semester at Harvard. After graduation, he moved to Washington to write for Mr. Gore, an author and former reporter whom Mr. Cherny found to be a perfectionist about language.
"We would bring him drafts, he'd sit down and change every word, and then some," Mr. Cherny said. "In the end, they were his speeches."
A year ago, Mr. Cherny returned to California, where he managed to work as a part-time policy adviser to the speaker of the State Assembly while attending Boalt Hall, the law school at Berkeley, and writing a book. The book, "The Next Deal," will be published by Basic Books this winter.
And what if there is a Gore administration? Mr. Cherny says he wants to return to California, finish law school and become a criminal prosecutor. "When the convention approves the platform, my job is done," he said. But the hesitation in his voice suggested that he senses this will not be his last stint in Washington.

HEADLINE: Changing Senate Race Changes Mood of Some Voters

SERIES: UNDECIDED: Watching and Waiting

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
More than a month into what is essentially a new race for the United States Senate, Cathy Harrison and Dave Temkin, both party stalwarts, have just about climbed off the fence of indecision and chosen the candidate they will vote for in November, barring scandal or surprise.
Mrs. Harrison and Mr. Temkin -- she now set on Representative Rick A. Lazio of Suffolk County and he on Hillary Rodham Clinton -- are part of a panel of nine voters that The New York Times is following as they make their decisions in this pivotal Senate race. 
 They were culled from respondents to early New York Times/CBS News Polls, back when Rudolph W. Giuliani was the Republican candidate in the race, the number of undecided voters was unusually small and their indecision was based not on ignorance of the candidates but rather on antipathy for them.
All that has now changed, with Mayor Giuliani out of the contest because of prostate cancer, and Mrs. Clinton, in the eyes of these voters, a less contentious figure than she was a year ago. But except for Mrs. Harrison and Mr. Temkin (and Tom Beck, a Long Island guidance counselor familiar with Mr. Lazio's record who embraced his candidacy from Day 1), the six other voters continue to watch and wait.
Tom and Barbara Smith, a struggling working-class couple from Saugerties, say they still do not feel that they know enough about the candidates, partly because they live in a part of the state without the saturation news coverage of New York City, Albany, Syracuse, Rochester or Buffalo.
Charlene Clinton, a single mother in Buffalo who recently lost her first job since leaving the welfare rolls, says she pays no attention to politics, did not know Mr. Lazio had entered the race and would make up her mind at the last minute, as she always does.
Other voters on the panel have pet issues that will determine their vote. Doug Taggart, vice president of a financial services concern and a resident of Cortlandt Manor in Westchester, wants to know how each candidate would spend the growing budget surplus.
Karl Schwartz, a computer consultant on Staten Island whose wife is undergoing experimental cancer treatment, wants a senator who cares about the disease, its causes and its cures. And Bob Harrison, a high school social studies teacher from Amsterdam, who is Cathy's husband, wants to know how Representative Lazio and Mrs. Clinton plan to invigorate the failing upstate economy.
Mrs. Harrison, a nurse and a lifelong Republican, had a hard time supporting Mr. Giuliani, despite party affiliation, because she found him too harsh and autocratic, too focused on downstate concerns and too indelicate in his personal life.
But Mr. Lazio is another story. "From what I've been seeing and hearing, I like the family feeling he gives off," Mrs. Harrison said. "He's a Republican candidate and now I don't feel any need to cross over."
The choice is also simple now for Mr. Temkin, a telecommunications expert from Flushing, Queens, and a lifelong Democrat. His reservations about Mrs. Clinton remain real, Mr. Temkin said. And he would vote Republican if the candidate had the stature and courage to cross his party when it was in the interest of New York State, as Jacob K. Javits did when he was senator, he said.
But Mr. Lazio's defining act so far, in Mr. Temkin's mind, was deferring to the Republican governor, George E. Pataki, by abandoning the race in favor of Mr. Giuliani and then jumping back in on command. "He's too loyal to the party," Mr. Temkin concluded.
All these voters (two of the original group dropped out of the project in May) are learning about the candidates amid the din of their daily lives, generally more compelling than politics. There are gaps in what they know and little spare time to fill them.
The Smiths, for instance, have been preoccupied with the birth of a grandchild, the search for a new apartment and plans to paint and hang bookshelves. Ms. Clinton, the single mother in Buffalo, lost a job as a monitor at a school that was stripped of its certification. She is back in the bureaucratic maze of welfare and faced with a shut-off notice for an unpaid water bill. The Harrisons just celebrated their son's high school graduation, helped him choose a community college and left for a family vacation in Hawaii, which took two years of savings.
Still, most of them are aware of certain policy announcements, gaffes and tiffs. They agree that mudslinging, a word used by many, has increased since Mr. Giuliani's withdrawal. They agree that Mrs. Clinton has been more visible in the metropolitan region and less visible upstate, where she has less chance of winning with Mr. Lazio as her opponent. They all are hoping for debates and better elaboration of positions.
Most of the sniping between the candidates is of no interest, except to irritate them. The accusations that Mr. Lazio had inappropriately profited from a securities deal, for instance, drew ridicule because equivalent accusations have been made against Mrs. Clinton.
"It's posturing and pandering," Mr. Temkin said. "It's like Dr. Strangelove. They're afraid if the other guy does it and they don't. We're not given enough credit for intelligence as voters."
Mr. Smith had a theory on why there was less negative campaigning when the mayor was still in the race. "Maybe she didn't feel as threatened," he said of Mrs. Clinton. "Lazio is young and energetic and he exploded out of the block. Maybe that shook her up."
These voters seem unmoved by the barrage of television advertising. It is tempting to think that they discount the power of the ads because they think that is what sophisticated voters should do. But in nine interviews, only the Harrisons were able even to describe a television commercial for a candidate -- a warm and fuzzy one in which Mr. Lazio is surrounded by his wife and children.
"Family values and such," Mr. Harrison said of the Lazio commercials. "Upstate, that's a plus."
But while Mr. Lazio's attractive family won over Mrs. Harrison, her husband, who comes from less conservative Republican stock, says he needs something more. "On the economy, I haven't heard much from either candidate," he said. "That's an important issue up here, to make sure New York State prospers. So I'm waiting."
Mr. Taggart, who has been impressed with Mr. Lazio's energy, is waiting to hear his plans, and Mrs. Clinton's, for the surplus. Large tax cuts, a common Republican lure, would be both foolish and selfish, in Mr. Taggart's view. First, cuts put very little money in any individual's pocket, he said. And second, prosperous times are an opportunity to be magnanimous.
"One of the ways we define ourselves as a people," he said, "is how we get through the best of times."
Mr. Schwartz, a former schoolteacher, is quick to acknowledge that these days he has become a myopic voter, with only one thing on his mind: his wife's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He has learned on the Internet, from his lymphoma news group, that Mr. Lazio last year won the Paul Tsongas Memorial Award from the Lymphoma Research Foundation of America.
Normally a Democrat, and aware of Mrs. Clinton's focus on health care issues, he has offered the first lady a chance to weigh in, sending an e-mail message to her campaign office that has not been answered. "I would like to get her viewpoint," he said.
Mr. Schwartz is abashed to be so self-centered. "I do understand there are other issues for other people," he said. "But for us, this is life and death." In addition, he said concern about the increased incidence of certain cancers "branches into respect for the environment and your position regarding corporate power and the responsibility of big business for the mess they create."
Charlene Clinton, who has voted in all but one election since she was eligible, has been consistently unaware of campaign developments, including Mr. Giuliani's cancer diagnosis, the announcement of his planned marital separation, his withdrawal from the race and Mr. Lazio's entry.
In elections past, she has relied on an elderly neighbor, an avid newspaper reader, to keep her informed. Lately, that woman has been ill. In addition, there has been a change of pastors at the Cedar Grove Missionary Baptist Church. The former paster talked a lot about politics, and the new one does not, Ms. Clinton said.
She has never voted for a Republican, nor have her parents, Ms. Clinton said. Yet she insisted that she remained undecided. "I'm not that into politics," she said. "But issues do concern me."

HEADLINE: UNDER PRESSURE: A Special Report;
Even for Sixth Graders, College Looms

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN and JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
Lauriston Nunes takes sample SAT's as if he were taking batting practice, signing onto a Web site with practice questions a few afternoons a week from his home near Atlanta.
Chanel Meanor regularly awakes with a start past midnight, fretting about overlapping assignments at her Silicon Valley school. "Sometimes I'll wake up thinking something's due the next day," she said, "and it's not." 
 After a Duke University basketball game a few months ago, Max Mashore's father introduced him to a university admissions officer, who told Max to take Spanish rather than Latin and sign up for calculus as soon as possible at his school in Washington, D.C.
These students have one thing in common: They are in sixth grade.
On top of the timeless complications of being 12 years old, an age of bubbling hormones and anti-authority stirrings, sixth graders today face a combination of pressures that their parents never encountered.
To understand how the country's continuing educational makeover and the pace of American society are transforming the lives of students, The New York Times conducted round-table discussions over the past six months with 221 sixth graders, youngsters on the bridge between childhood and adolescence, at 21 schools -- public and private, cutthroat and coddling -- in 11 states and the District of Columbia.
The interviews showed that with a college degree increasingly seen as a prerequisite for a decent life -- and admission to prestigious universities more competitive than ever -- higher education has become a preoccupation for children even before they reach puberty.
At the same time, the students face new layers of standardized tests that judge not only what they know -- and whether they should be promoted -- but the performance of their teachers, their schools and their towns.
Concerned about the future of the nation's economy, American educators have over the past decade imported pages from the strict curriculums of Asian schools and Europe's elite academies, imposing the rigor and seriousness of high school on the lower grades. Though the United States has surpassed its competitors economically, public dissatisfaction with the preparation of American workers remains, heightening the hurdles for students.
In this era of earlier and higher expectations, most of the students interviewed said they were driven to excel by parents who had seized on test scores and early college readiness as new benchmarks for success.
Some of the students suffer tension headaches and bouts of anxiety, raising questions about the costs of growing up quickly. But a number of the students embraced this intense focus on the future, saying it gave more meaning and direction to their lives than idle hours in front of the television.
They drink in the challenges like a first sip of coffee, a tantalizing if slightly bitter taste of adulthood.
"I try to strive for stuff that I know I can't achieve right now," said Yesenia Mendez, 13, of Boston. "I read harder books that I can't understand right now."
Yesenia attends the Academy of the Pacific Rim, a three-year-old charter school that has adopted some Asian educational principles -- children take martial arts for gym, clean their own classrooms and are often rewarded or disciplined as a group for an individual's behavior.
"I stay in school longer than my mother goes to work sometimes," Yesenia said of the 210-day calendar of classes stretching from 8:05 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. "I feel like I need to get paid."
Though Manhattan's prestigious private schools are well known for their pressure-cooker atmosphere, the interviews show that similar stresses pervade students' lives regardless of geography or socioeconomic station. In fact, students at the nation's most expensive academies seemed among those most at ease, perhaps confident that their course in life was assured.
The level of anxiety prevalent in sixth-grade lunchrooms appeared almost to grow in proportion to a school's distance from the ivory towers of the Northeast. Middle-class children in cookie-cutter subdivisions say they fear that attending no-name local universities will consign them to mediocrity, while minority students and those living in poverty are scrambling to prepare themselves for any college, a path pursued by few of their predecessors.
In affluent Newton, Mass., and suburban Orlando, Fla., children are already drawing road maps to follow their parents' footsteps into the Ivy League; in the hardscrabble neighborhoods of Milwaukee and New York, there are also sixth graders fixated on Harvard and Yale as their ticket to surpass relatives who never finished high school.
At a Muslim school in Atlanta, just as at a Jewish school in Las Vegas, preteenage overachievers sweat even fractional fluctuations in grade-point average. From Nogales, Ariz., on the Mexican border, to East Palo Alto, Calif., a ghetto bordering the mansions of Silicon Valley, tutors and resume-padding activities have supplanted after-school play dates.
That means 10 more years of hated piano lessons for Lucy McDaniel, 12, whose mother tells her that music improves math scores. "I barely even get to go outside when I get home," said Lucy, who attends the Westminster Schools in Atlanta, where tuition is more than $12,000 a year.
As sixth graders confront these challenges, they also worry that the school shootings they see on television will invade their own classrooms, and they are saddled with new responsibilities in families overwhelmed by dual careers or damaged by divorce.
Even educators are confounded by this precarious age. In some districts, sixth grade is elementary school's finale, with recess and classrooms as comforting as warm milk; elsewhere, it is the opening act of middle school, where sixth graders switch rooms for every subject and fumble with locker combinations while jostled by eighth graders topping six feet.
No matter the setting, the sixth-grade curriculum is changing, too, as teachers and parents push higher-level material like geometry and geology, a trickle-down effect from high schools, where enrollment in college-level advanced placement courses has doubled over the last decade.
"There's too much going on in sixth grade," said Nora Farley, 12, of Pleasantville, N.Y., in Westchester County. "It's all being crammed in your brain. It's too much to take."
To be sure, there are sizable pockets of students at private and public schools who say they feel little pressure in their lives and who have given no thought to college. But it was only at a one-room schoolhouse in Montana that the sixth graders -- both of them -- seemed confused by the very notion of pressure.
Most schools were more like Mantua Elementary in Fairfax County, Va., where the county requires a one-time class lesson on stress -- and how to deal with it -- for every sixth grader.
"What happened to childhood?" asked Ellen S. Schoetzau, 45, Mantua's principal. "The pressures on children are much greater now than when I was teaching -- certainly than when I was in school."
 
The View
Does Any School Beat Harvard?
One new chain of thought that runs nearly unbroken through today's sixth-grade classrooms is the belief that a college degree -- particularly a parchment from someplace with a pedigree -- comes with a passkey to the good life.
"I just see education as the way to get rich," said Keenan Robinson, 12, the son of a tax appraiser and a secretary from DeKalb County, Ga., outside Atlanta. "You can't get a multimillion-dollar entertainment company by being a bum on the street."
Keenan, who used to live in New York, wants to attend St. John's University. "That's all that runs through my mind," he said.
With applications to four-year colleges, especially the most selective, increasing every year, the intense competition over admission is filtering all the way down to sixth grade.
Students like Keenan are not just ruminating about colleges; they are researching them. In Las Vegas, Nogales, Atlanta and Milwaukee, among other places, sixth graders reported surfing college home pages on the Web, some with an eye on future majors, others seeking scholarship opportunities.
"I'm not really thinking so much about which college," said Chelsea Hammack, 12, whose father is a Las Vegas police officer and whose mother works in a casino. "It's more, what am I going to do when I get there?
"Once in a while me and my parents talk about what I'm going to take for my subject that could help me with the job I want to do," said Chelsea, an aspiring writer ("fiction, short stories, mostly"). "I want to take something I'm interested in, but not something that's so easy I won't learn anything."
Chelsea has been using the Web to compare Brigham Young University in Utah with a college in Hawaii. "I'm sort of split between the two," she said. "I'm actually thinking of going to U.N.L.V. for a year to get a better chance of getting into a good school."
That is why Lauriston Nunes, the 12-year-old Atlanta boy who drills himself on the SAT's, keeps going back to the Web site of the College Board, www.collegeboard.com.
"The first few times I went there, I got every question right," he said. "It makes me feel smart. It lets me know that I can do more than what I have to do right now."
Lauriston is already experimenting with a kind of higher education: a school for models, Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. "I like being on stage," he said. "I like seeing people clap for me."
For other students, particularly those with older siblings, weekend activities include leafing through college guidebooks -- or even visiting campuses. Kristen Summerall is getting advice from her sister, a high school junior.
"She's going to Spelman, I wanted to go to Harvard," said Kristen, 12, a 4.0 student at Stephenson Middle School outside Atlanta. "Then I was like, 'Is there a school better than Harvard?' She was like, 'Its initials are M.I.T.' It's in Michigan or something.
"The farthest I've ever been is Virginia," she added. "I want to see more of the United States. When I was little, I used to tell my parents I wanted to leave the United States and go to school in Paris."
Some children are clearly self-motivated, but more often the prod is a parent or grandparent -- whose success in life has set an example that students want to follow, or whose failures the children hope to avoid.
Max Mashore's pilgrimages to Duke, his dad's alma mater, began in second grade. Max went to a basketball camp at Duke last summer.
"This whole year I've been thinking about college," said Max, a B student at Sidwell Friends school in Washington who was wearing his Duke sweatshirt, as usual.
"I don't want to go to some small college in the middle of Maine or something." he said. "I heard someone say once, 'C is community college, B is state college, A is Ivy League school.' "
Rahel Haile, 12, of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx, said her parents, immigrants from Eritrea, were determined that she achieve more than they have. Rahel's father, a grocery store manager, went to Rutgers, but that "isn't the best college," Rahel said.
"Since third and fifth grade, I used to think I wanted to go to Harvard, Harvard, Harvard," she said. "I was looking at Harvard. I don't want to sound harsh, but Harvard was just too preppy for me. I'd rather go to N.Y.U."
One might expect students at Fieldston, a feeder school to the Ivy League, to have a college focus -- though perhaps not at age 12. But what is striking is the nervous attention to college admission -- fed by misinformation -- in schools elsewhere.
Sixth graders in suburban Washington, Las Vegas, Nogales and East Palo Alto all believe, mistakenly, that colleges will examine elementary school transcripts.
"If you go to Stanford, they might look at your records and see if you've been bad," said Tuuta Tuipulotu, 11, who is worried that his one-day suspension at his northern California school, for fighting, might result in a rejection letter.
For the college class of 2010, it seems, it is never too early to start.
"With the Ivy League schools, my dad always says that to get into them, it's like a race," said Joshua Bordin, 12, the son of a Pleasantville businessman and nursery school teacher. "Let's say we could put the whole grade in a race. People have to fall. People have to stop to tie a shoe. But if you keep getting good grades, you race and race to the top."
 
The Tests
'I'm Worried If I'll Get Held Back'
In Arizona, it is AIMS. In Massachusetts, M.C.A.S. Florida has the FCAT. Virginia, the SOL. In East Palo Alto, there is the SAT-9 and the R-SAT. Las Vegas spells it out: Terra Nova, which greets sixth graders just a month after they arrive at middle school.
They are the standardized tests beloved by politicians, business leaders and those who call themselves education reformers, and they have sixth graders nationwide chewing on their No. 2 pencils. The tests are part of a concerted effort to elevate achievement, leaving students far more worried than their predecessors that poor marks could land them in remedial classes, in summer school or even back to suffer sixth grade all over again next year.
"They can feel the pressure," said Mark A. Valenzuela, the principal of Desert Shadows Middle School in Nogales, "from teachers, administrators, parents, older siblings -- from older students in the school."
It will be two years before Nogales sixth graders face the new state tests, the Arizona Instrument to Measure Standards, and four years before they take a math exam required for a high school diploma. Still, Mr. Valenzuela convened an assembly this spring to tell sixth graders, many of them the children of truckers and distributors in the tomato industry, that their homework today is critical to their AIMS performance.
To Ben Larriva, 11, such warnings echo the daily mantra from his teachers: "This will be on the AIMS test." Ben, whose parents unplug his computer if he slips off the honor roll, is warily watching his brother's experience in eighth grade. "He can't keep up," Ben said.
The pressure is more immediate at the Menlo Oaks School, where the have-nots of Silicon Valley must pass a standardized state test in three subjects to be promoted and take the Ravenswood Stanford Achievement Tests, a set of district exams, for three days each quarter.
"Every time I take a test, I get nervous," said Jeremiah Sagote, 11, the son of a truck mechanic and a store clerk from Samoa. "Not like a spelling test -- I don't get nervous on those. Like the R-SAT test. I'm worried if I'll get held back."
Jeremiah's expression of concern about promotion was repeated by sixth graders across the country. And, with scores published in local newspapers, students in several districts said they were also anxious about what the tests meant for the teachers they love (or hate).
"I think sometimes the teachers have the tendency to stress them out," said Clara Rice, the principal at Menlo Oaks. "Because the teachers will look bad if the students don't do well. Their jobs are on the line. The principal's job. And the superintendent's."
Private schools are not immune, either. At Fieldston, sixth graders have been taking standardized tests since kindergarten, and they were frazzled by a recent math exam.
"We had 30 minutes to do this test, which means we had like a minute and 5 seconds to do each problem," Joseph DeJesus, 12, said. "Most of those problems took two to three minutes."
Rocky Russo, 12, another Fieldston student, said he felt as if he was being used. "You think they could come up with a better way to figure out if the teachers are doing their jobs correctly," Rocky said.
In Fairfax County, students expressed frustration that a test on Virginia history had squeezed other educational activities out of the schedule.
"We were going to have an archaeological dig, make artifacts and bury them, and another class would dig them up, and it would be really cool," said Monica Kumar, 11, a student at Mantua Elementary.
Instead, Monica's class spent two weeks reviewing for Virginia's Standards of Learning test. "The teachers stuck note cards from every single event -- from when Jamestown was founded to Arthur Ashe winning tennis tournaments -- they put them all around the walls," said Meredith Keller, 12, a classmate.
With stakes so high, grades now count more than ever.
"I got a B on a homework assignment," said Julia Cohen of Newton, Mass., a Boston suburb known for its stellar schools. "It, like, ruined it. I couldn't say I'd gotten all A's. Everyone was making fun of me.
"If you're going to get A's, then you might as well get them all the time."
To that end, many families have devised intricate incentive plans borrowed from corporate America and pegged to even the most mundane assignment.
Jon Lipinski of San Carlos, Calif., used to write one-sentence responses to homework questions. Then his mother, an emergency medical technician, started paying him two cents per word. Now, Jon says he can pull down "six bucks" an essay. His mother also pays 10 cents for every page he reads, and Jon says he is owed $44.
At Sidwell Friends, where Chelsea Clinton is an alumna, Cameron Pastrick is striving to reach a B average by employing tutors four times a week. To stay focused while doing her homework, she uses an egg timer.
"My mom's always like, I can't get you any more tutors, unless you want one Friday and Saturday and Sunday," said Cameron, who has had tutors since third grade.
"My mom went here. Whenever I bring home, like, a C, she's like, 'When I was your age, I got an A,' " Cameron said. "I keep telling them this, and they say, 'We don't pressure you, we encourage you.' "
 
The Outside Forces
Fear of Guns In the Schoolroom
As high academic expectations hang over their young lives, this year's sixth graders have been distracted by outside forces that did not buffet their predecessors.
Five months after the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., Mia Grill skipped the first day at Molasky Middle School in Las Vegas. She was nervous that it would prove more violent than her elementary school because the pupils were older.
"My mom, she said not to worry," said Mia, 12, whose parents sell tile. "I'm still worried. Sooner or later, someone's probably going to bring a gun to school."
In the New York borough of Queens, Christopher Bennett's mind sometimes fills with doomsday scenarios as he moves through the hallways of Public School 21, a tan-brick box of an elementary school crammed with Eastern European and Asian immigrants.
"When we do a silent meeting after lunch," said Chris, 11, "I always look at the door and imagine someone big and dressed all in black coming through."
For others, though, the classroom is a respite from home lives rendered turbulent by parents' work schedules or divorce.
A cog in an increasingly mobile work force, Suzannah Mullen's mother has been shuttled through four states in recent years, often starting new jobs before her family can catch up. Suzannah, 11, and her older sister stayed with their father in the Orlando suburbs this spring while her mother, a human resources administrator, commuted to Charlotte, N.C. "Sometimes, I kind of search my house for my mom and it's like, 'Oh, she's in North Carolina,' " Suzannah said.
Joaquin Vega lives with his mother in Milwaukee, but said he might as well live alone. While Joaquin likes the DVD player and big-screen television paid for by his mother's job at a car dealership, he said they "can't pay for the time she's gone."
"I would like her to help me with my homework," Joaquin said, adding that he has never met his father. "If we have teacher conferences, she can't come. I was on the basketball team. I got first place, and she couldn't come to the ceremony."
Kayleigh Wittman, 12, of Altamonte Springs, Fla., also a child of divorce, gets a monthly allowance of $110 -- but she said that had to cover all her expenses, from shampoo to tithing and saving for college.
"I write down how much money I use, and what I use it on," she said. When Kayleigh worried aloud about paying for her future education, saying she expects no further subsidy from her family, a classmate seated nearby wondered, "Why don't you just save all your money for college?"
"Because," Kayleigh said, "I have to pay for lunch."
 
The Toll
Defining Stress And Dealing With It
At Mantua Elementary, a red-brick school a few miles down a wooded road from Prosperity Avenue in Fairfax, Va., stress is part of the curriculum: the county mandates a lesson on the subject for every sixth-grade class.
In a recent session, Suzzette Rodriguez's students easily defined the word. "A thought or something that you think about that causes strain on your mind," Matt Wong explained. "On your body, too. Say you have a big test coming up. Your body stiffens."
But, echoing some educators, Jenny Drenkard said, "A little bit of stress is probably actually good for you. You shouldn't be so laid-back that nothing matters."
Ranking the stresses in their lives on work sheets, most of the students placed school difficulties and divorced parents highest. (One boy offered a write-in candidate: "Girls in general.") When talking in groups about their most stressful situations, every cluster of children picked tests. As for the side effects, they listed headaches, queasiness, anger, depression, insomnia, exhaustion, lack of appetite and butterflies in the stomach.
At the San Carlos Charter Learning Center, an alternative public school in the Silicon Valley that does not use letter grades, many of the 15 students interviewed, including Chanel Meanor, said they had at least two bouts of sleeplessness a month because of pending schoolwork.
A coast away in Atlanta, John Hobart said that while baseball was "probably my favorite thing in the world to do," he had so much homework this year that "I get really excited when I don't have practice because I can relax."
And Sonia Dahliwal, a student at Teague Middle School in Altamonte Springs, Fla., is so desperate to get into the English class for gifted students that it is starting to show. "As you can see I don't like eating," Sonia, 13, said with a sour face. "I have better things to do than put stuff in my mouth and chew."
At Oaklands Elementary in Prince George's County, Md., Calisa Carter just dreams, every day, about being back in fifth grade.
"The only time that I don't feel stressed out is nighttime," she said, "when I'm sleeping."
But even as Calisa yearns for the past, other sixth graders are already looking beyond the summer to the fall -- and the pressures next year will bring.
Helen Park, 12, of Queens, recently toured her new junior high school, No. 185, near the elementary school that has been her security blanket, P.S. 21. "I heard a group of people there saying, 'I can't wait till Freshman Friday,' " she said. "I think they beat you up."
For many, the new school year will be filled with firsts: foreign language instruction, math and English classes sifted by students' academic abilities and junior varsity athletic tryouts.
Michael Bartomioli, 12, plans to play football, which means he will be required to attend practice daily until dusk even though he is very likely to warm the bench behind the bigger boys on the roster. He is already worried about starting his homework -- sure to be heavier -- three hours later than he did this year.
"I've heard seventh grade is the hardest grade," Michael said.

HEADLINE: THE MEXICO ELECTION: BALLOTING AT THE BORDER;
BORDER BALLOTING

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico, July 2

 BODY:
They began arriving before dawn, crossing south over the border in cars and pickup trucks and small caravans, with an unusual degree of optimism in their hearts and their voter registration cards in their wallets.
They were Mexicans who live in the United States returning to elect a new president, drawn by the possibility that the somewhat paradoxically named Institutional Revolutionary Party would lose the presidency for the first time since it was founded 71 years ago. Since Mexico does not have absentee ballots, they had to come from as far away as San Francisco, Washington and Chicago to cast their ballots at special polling places for out-of-district voters that were set up here and in several other cities along the 2,000-mile border. 
 "We all want change," said Ramiro Ramirez, a 48-year-old mechanic from Fontana, Calif., who arrived late Saturday night to ensure that he would get a good spot in line at one of the special polling sites today. Mr. Ramirez, who left his home state of Michoacan for the United States as a child, said he had made the trip today because he is thinking of his own future.
"We all left because of the same problems," he said. "But I would like to go back someday. And if the government changes, if things get better, if there's work, I will return."
By the time his turn came here, at 9 this morning, to pick up a paper ballot, fill it out in a cardboard booth behind a plastic curtain that said "The Vote is Free and Secret," and stuff the folded ballot into a cardboard box with a clear plastic window on each side, roughly 250 people were waiting behind him, many of them from California as well.
Their polling place, outside an all-night drugstore, was one of 15 in Tijuana where Mexicans away from home could vote. They wore cowboy hats and Dallas Cowboys hats, pearl-buttoned shirts and Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts, cowboy boots and Air Jordans. They came, they said, out of a belief that this election would be different from those in the past that were tainted by fraud. An opposition candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada, was virtually tied in the polls with the nominee of the governing party, Francisco Labastida Ochoa.
The vote is to be counted for the first time by an autonomous group, the Federal Elections Institute, rather than by a branch of the government controlled by the governing party. And many Mexicans north of the border were the targets of advertising and even campaign stops by the candidates.
"I think change is really possible this time," said Gabriel Castellanos, 26, who arrived here at 6:30 a.m. after driving down from Huntington Beach, Calif., with his wife, Miriam Sanchez, 19, to vote for Mr. Fox.
Fausto Soriano, 60, who came from San Francisco with four friends to vote for Mr. Fox, said, "I think this will be a cleaner election."
The election dominated Tijuana this weekend. There were the long lines at polling places, and most striking of all, there was no drinking allowed. The government imposed a dry law until after the elections.
It was quite a switch for a place that began its rapid growth, from a village to a city of 1.5 million people, during Prohibition, when Californians made this a favorite place for a boozy weekend getaway.
Without the usual rowdy revelry, the voters stood out even more than usual. The great fear expressed among them was that there would not be enough ballots to go around; an old voting-law reform, aimed at preventing fraud by ballot-stuffing, limits the number of ballots at each polling place to 750.
With only 15 sites in Tijuana where people could vote away from home, the maximum number of ballots available to them here would be 11,250. And some of those would be cast by people who live in Mexico -- soldiers, business travelers, people who moved but had not registered their new addresses.
That is why Jacqueline Vargas, 26, set her alarm clock at home in Garden Grove, Calif., for 3:40 a.m. She was so worried about oversleeping that she awakened on her own at 2:30. Ms. Vargas, who left her home in Monterrey four years ago for a marketing job in the United States, said she had followed the campaign online.
"After I graduated from the university, my aim was to move abroad as soon as I could," she said. "I didn't like the situation either politically or economically. I didn't see much future for myself there."
Mexicans living in the United States were assiduously courted for their votes this year for the first time. "The democratic process of Mexico is finally permeating north of the border, making us Mexican citizens aware of what's happening politically in our country," said Luis Pelayo, the president of the Hispanic Council in Chicago, who helped organize several caravans to cross the Texas border.
Of the estimated 10 million Mexicans who live in the United States, 1.5 million are believed to be eligible to vote. No one expected that many people to cross the border to vote -- in fact, fewer than 75,000 ballots were available at the special polling sites.
But the Mexicans living in the United States were wooed not only for their votes but also for their influence. Many of them still hold sway in the villages they left behind and with the families they support with money each month. By some estimates, Mexicans abroad send $7 billion home each year. They like to point out that this makes them Mexico's third highest source of income, after petroleum and tourism.
When Ms. Vargas called home, she said, she was disappointed when her father told her that he would vote for the governing party. "He just told me, 'They've done so much for us,' " she said. "I couldn't believe it."
It was a sore point among many Mexicans in the United States that Mexico lacks an absentee ballot. A bill that would have created one stalled last year in the Senate, which is controlled by the governing party. Party officials said they supported the concept of an absentee ballot but there was not enough time to create a fair system. Their opponents accused them of scuttling the measure out of fear that people who had to leave Mexico to find good jobs would vote them out of office.
Raul Ross Pineda, who lives in Chicago and is taking the unusual step of running for the Mexican Congress this year to represent the interests of Mexicans abroad, wrote a book on the issue called "Vote Without Borders," to call for an absentee ballot.
"Legally we are Mexican citizens; we have the right to vote, we love Mexico, we have families there that we sustain," Mr. Ross said. "We are not asking for any special privilege."
But without the absentee ballot, many Mexicans living north of the border simply took to the road. "Look at this," said Hector Alvarado, 45, from Maywood, Calif., pointing to a line of Mexicans from the United States that stretched nearly an entire city block here. "This isn't a rock concert or a football match. These are people who want to vote."

HEADLINE: U.S. Monitor Now Argues Iraqis Have Little to Conceal

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 30

 BODY:
Scott Ritter, the former United Nations arms inspector who quit two years ago charging that Secretary General Kofi Annan and American officials were undercutting efforts to disarm Saddam Hussein, now says the Iraqis have no prohibited weapons of any importance left.
Writing in the current issue of Arms Control Today, the journal of the independent Arms Control Association in Washington, Mr. Ritter says that the inspection team he served as an expert on concealment had effectively rid Iraq of dangerous weapons by 1997. And he argues that less aggressive monitoring of Iraq will now suffice and that inspectors on any new team should not pursue access to Iraqi presidential and security sites, which caused grave conflict with Iraq in the past. 
 Mr. Ritter's article was written before American officials disclosed that Iraq was rebuilding and testing a short-range missile system, which is permitted under United Nations sanctions and does not appear to be immediately threatening. But those reports appear to support Mr. Ritter's thesis that while the missile tests may be legal, they are the kind of activity that must be monitored on the ground to know if the Iraqis are trying to go beyond what us permissible, or are loading the missiles with prohibited warheads.
In an interview, Mr. Ritter said the purpose of his article was to suggest a way to overcome a deadlock with Iraq that has left the country without arms inspections for a year and half.
He said the United States has little support abroad for either unseating President Hussein or continuing sanctions indefinitely. The Russians, Chinese and French will no longer follow America, he said, and Iraq is strengthened by the division among the Security Council's five permanent members. "I propose that maybe people should take another look at the disarmament issue in a way that's more satisfactory to all the parties," he said.
Richard Butler, the former executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission, or Unscom, which was responsible for monitoring Iraq, said in an interview that Mr. Ritter's assertions run directly counter to the reports Mr. Ritter submitted when he was in Iraq.
Mr. Butler, who has just published a book on his tenure, "The Greatest Threat: Iraq, Weapons of Mass Destruction and the Growing Crisis in Global Security" (Public Affairs, 2000), said in a telephone interview that Mr. Ritter was interpreting data he helped collect in an entirely different way.
"I didn't see one shred of evidence for these assertions," said Mr. Butler, an Australian arms control expert who is a diplomat in residence at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
"Ritter's claim that it was evident then that nothing of any importance remained is completely contrary to the advice that he repeatedly and robustly gave me when he was on the staff," he added.
Several expert panels formed by the United Nations inspection commission as well as the Security Council also concluded that Iraq had not adequately disarmed, particularly in biological weapons.
In the interview, however, Mr. Ritter said that if he was considered tough when he was an inspector, he was only carrying out a rigid mandate from the Security Council. The days when international inspectors could demand every scrap of Iraqi war materiel are over, he added, and it is now time to adopt more pragmatic goals if there is ever to be a resumption of inspections in Iraq. That meant looking at what Iraq may have left qualitatively, rather than quantitatively, he said.
Mr. Ritter, who was routinely vilified by the Iraqis as the chief of a band of "cowboys" who wanted to kick down doors, met with Iraqi officials before writing the article. He said in the interview that he never took the Iraqi vilification personally.
Iraqi officials themselves had told him that the sharp criticisms were "politics," he said. And he now adopts their long-held demand that the lifting of economic sanctions should be linked with the introduction of any new inspections.
In his article, Mr. Ritter wrote that given the comprehensive nature of the former monitoring regime, "it was possible as early as 1997 to determine that, from a quantitative standpoint, Iraq had been disarmed."
By 1997, Mr. Ritter's article says, "Iraq no longer possessed any meaningful quantities of chemical or biological agent, if it possessed any at all, and the industrial means to produce these agents had either been eliminated or were subject to stringent monitoring. The same was true of Iraq's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities."
In March 1998, however, a report after one of Mr. Ritter's visits pointed to "indisputable proof" that Iraq was still concealing weapons programs.
In his article, Mr. Ritter uses the search for missing artillery shells apparently filled with mustard gas as an example of the wrong focus. "A few hundred 155 mm mustard shells have very little military value on the modern battlefield," he wrote.
His former boss, Mr. Butler, said in an interview that such a critique of the inspections misses the point.
"Unscom never asserted that these shells were themselves militarily significant," he said. "What was made clear in our reports to the Security Council was that so long as they remained unaccounted for, the veracity of Iraq's overall declarations could not be relied upon.
"Our purpose in wanting those shells was to be able to bring to final account, to verify, Iraq's overall claims," he added. "Those shells represent a far wider question."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the view of a former United Nations weapons inspector, Scott Ritter, that Iraq no longer possesses prohibited weapons of any importance misquoted a passage in an article he had written for the journal Arms Control Today. He wrote that "it was possible as early as 1997 to determine that, from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq had been disarmed." He did not write "from a quantitative standpoint."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Digital Economy's Demand for Stable Power Strains Utilities

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Read-Rite, an electronic components maker in Milpitas, Calif., has been in no position to complain whenever fluctuations in electrical service shut down a vital computer-controlled milling machine. After all, the local utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has lived up to its contractual obligation to keep the power flowing and to prevent voltage surges or dips of 10 percent or more.
Unfortunately, the milling machine, which helps Read-Rite make the tiny devices that read and write information on computer disk drives, crashes if voltages vary as little as 5 percent. And such flutters have occasionally occurred the last two years as Pacific Gas, a unit of the PG&E Corporation, has performed its daily juggling act of matching power demand and supply in the region. So far, Read-Rite's solution has been to monitor the incoming power closely and adjust settings on the milling equipment manually. 
 "We have to watch it closely because we can lose materials worth thousands of dollars," said Shahzad Mahmud, director of facilities.
Read-Rite's milling machine is indicative of a long-running, but accelerating problem: the nation's electrical power supply system is not up to the task of meeting the digital economy's needs. While the utility industry has historically prided itself on delivering fairly stable power 99.9 percent of the time, today's computerized economy is demanding even fewer interruptions and a much steadier current.
That is because electricity is more than just energy for computers -- it is the medium they use to do their job. Rapid, minute changes in voltage represent the ones and zeros that make up digital information.
Those patterns are ultimately translated into a human voice during a phone call, a calculation during a banking transaction, a dose of radiation during cancer therapy or a photo of a new baby e-mailed to scattered relatives. Any disruption in the power supply that compromises the processor's ability to manage those voltages can lead to lost data or system crashes.
Power disturbances around the world cause more than 17,000 computer disruptions every second, from annoying frozen cursors to serious destruction of equipment, according to the latest calculations of American Power Conversion of West Kingston, R.I., which began building backup power systems for computer users in 1984.
"What we have worked well for an economy that ran on motors and lights," said Peter Gross, a leading designer of giant telecommunications hubs, data centers and other buildings that operate around the clock. "There's a major disconnect with what's happening in the digital world."
There is also an explosion of interest in technologies and services that address the new economy's power needs. And the remedies go well beyond the surge suppressors that most home PC users employ to protect their computers during lightning or voltage spikes. The solutions aimed at businesses include backup generators manufactured by companies like Caterpillar and smaller power supplies from American Power Conversion and the Liebert unit of Emerson Electric. There are innovative fuel cells from start-ups like FuelCell Energy; new flywheels from Active Power and Beacon Power and a variety of battery improvements. Companies like International Rectifier and Ixys are finding strong demand for new microchips that manage power equipment.
The computer-driven economy's push to transform the electricity business adds up to a $500 billion opportunity for the companies selling into it, according to Mark P. Mills, a Washington-based consultant who, along with Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, coined the term "powercosm" to describe the evolving market. The two men jointly publish The Digital Power Report for the Gilder Group.
The message certainly is resonating on Wall Street. International Rectifier has soared from less than $12 last summer to more than $55. Ixys, a smaller competitor that was hovering around $3 in November, reached $69 last Tuesday. Start-ups like H Power, a fuel-cell maker, and Active Power are on the runway for public offerings this summer, hoping to find the same kind of welcome as Capstone Turbine, which went public on Thursday at $16 a share and ended the week at $45.0625. Meanwhile, giants like General Electric and the deregulated arms of numerous utilities have been pouring venture capital into the field.
The expansion of the digital economy is causing electrical headaches in two ways. The most straightforward is that it drives up demand for electricity in regions like the Northeast where capacity is already strained in the peak summer months. Last week, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, for example, Consolidated Edison shut off service to eight apartment buildings and lowered its voltage in the neighborhood for several hours on a hot, muggy day.
The rising demand involves much more than air-conditioning, of course. Consider the transformation of a 16-story building in downtown Newark, which formerly housed a Macy's department store and consumed roughly 10 watts of power a square foot before the store was shut down in 1992.
Now, the upper floors have been reopened as a "telecommunications hotel" where companies like WorldCom, IDT, Qwest and Level 3 Communications park rows of data servers, routers and other electronic equipment, as well as cooling systems, backup power and other devices. According to Public Service Electric and Gas, the local utility, such users require 40 to 50 watts a square foot.
One developer looking at another site in North Jersey for the home of a potential million-square-foot data and communications center asked Public Service for 100 megawatts of power, according to Patrick Downs, the utility's vice president for operations support. "That's one-third of what we give the whole city of Newark," he said.
Still, even the most extravagant estimates of the new economy's impact on sheer demand put the level at less than 10 percent of the total capacity of traditional utilities. To energy managers, engineers like Mr. Gross and, more recently, Wall Street, the volume of demand for power is less noteworthy than the higher quality of electricity that digital users are insisting upon.
"Three nines is great for the grid," Mr. Mills said, referring to 99.9 percent reliability, or roughly eight hours of power losses a year. Indeed, it is hard to imagine this figure becoming much better, given the vulnerability of power supply grids to bad weather, animals shorting out transformers and other equipment and drunken drivers hitting utility poles.
But even "three nines," Mr. Mills said, is "trash for a computer."
Mr. Mills's prescription for microprocessor-friendly power quality is 10 nines, or 99.99999999 percent reliability -- a mere 32 seconds of power loss a year -- plus equipment to protect against those gaps and the sags, spikes and surges in between.
So great is the cost of computer disruptions to the economy that the sale of services or equipment to prevent such problems is starting to be seen as a can't-miss proposition for those with the right technology.
"When the Model T was introduced, people didn't worry about the grade of gasoline," said Larry R. Wilson, director of strategic planning for the electric power unit of Caterpillar. The invention of high-performance cars changed that, Mr. Wilson said, and now the same thing is happening on a much broader scale with electricity.
"Where people have a power quality need, price is not an issue," Mr. Wilson said. He predicts strong growth for Caterpillar's generator sales to a "premium" market of users for whom price is no object when it comes to reliable backup energy. Such users are willing to pay the equivalent of $20 a kilowatt for backup supplies, compared with about 7 cents a kilowatt, on average, for electricity drawn directly from the utility grid.
Although it varies by state around the nation, utility regulators generally define a momentary power loss as one lasting one to five minutes. Such interruptions can cause havoc in stock-trading systems, automated paper mills and other computer-driven processes unless there are backup power generators and equipment to switch to them seamlessly.
But in many cases, trouble does not wait for an outright power loss. A voltage dip of just 10 percent, with no interruption, can cause problems for some systems in a sixth of a second, according to Marek Samotyj, who manages power quality programs for the Electric Power Research Institute, a Palo Alto, Calif. research group owned by utility companies. And some sensors in medical equipment fail if current is cut off completely for as little as four milliseconds, he said.
Even as the crowd of suppliers that offer remedies swells, the question of who will pay for better power is very much unsettled.
Last year, American Electric Power, a large utility based in Columbus, Ohio, and the equipment maker Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution began studying what combination of monitoring equipment and system improvements would be required to supply premium-quality power to an industrial park in Delaware, Ohio. American Electric's goals included learning whether premium power could command premium prices, according to Harry Vollkommer, one of the project managers for the utility.
But James Osteen, senior industrial engineer at the Nippert Company, a wire manufacturer that is one of the major utility customers in the park, does not see a more stable power supply as a premium product. He said all companies were expected to improve quality continually these days, and the utility should be no exception. "Our expectation is that we won't pay more for premium power," he said.
A similar attitude prevails in Detroit. In order to keep business from the Big Three auto companies, Detroit Edison is currently supplying power under a contract that penalizes it if it fails to steadily reduce the number of power losses and fluctuations. The number of power losses at General Motors has been reduced by two-thirds since the contract began in 1995, and Detroit Edison has improved enough to avoid any penalties so far for power sags, according to John C. Anderson, director of energy services for G.M.
Addressing the new economy's power needs, however, is not simply a matter of improving the utility grid. Studies show that 70 percent of disruptions originate from electrical problems at customer sites, according to Richard P. Bingham, a manager at Dranetz-BMI, a power quality products and consulting company, in Edison, N.J.
"Laser printers often take out computers when the heater comes on," said Mr. Bingham, citing but one example. Electronic ballasts in overhead lighting and compressors in soda machines also cause unexpected loads. And electronic devices, like drives that adjust speeds on motors to save energy, generate electrical interference on the lines that power them. The interference, known as harmonic signals, can trip up other equipment unless it is canceled by filtering devices. And many schools, he said, are creating problems for themselves by overloading their electrical systems with new electronic equipment.
The variety of problems and the public's dwindling patience with disruptions means that trouble-shooters like Dranetz-BMI can no longer restrict themselves to the utility-dominated world, where the person on the other end of the phone is generally an engineer. "There are a lot more people with less and less knowledge of electricity calling me with questions," Mr. Bingham said.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 7, 2000, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Monday about the challenge of maintaining a reliable flow of electricity to meet the needs of the computerized economy miscalculated the amount of time that a user would be without electricity if the power supply were 99.99999999 percent reliable. It would be 0.0032 of a second a year, not 32 seconds.
The article also described FuelCell Energy incorrectly. The company, which changed its name last September, was founded in 1969 as the Energy Research Corporation. It is not a start-up company. A chart with the article provided an outdated list of the company's products; it spun off its battery business as Evercel Inc. last year.

HEADLINE: The Truest Measure of Patriotism

BYLINE: By David M. Kennedy; David M. Kennedy teaches history at Stanford University. His most recent book, "Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945," won the Pulitzer Prize.

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
Commodore Stephen Decatur, freshly returned in 1816 from subduing the Dey of Algiers and swollen with nationalist fervor, rose to his feet at a banquet in Norfolk, Va., and offered a notorious toast. "Our country!" he said, glass held aloft. "May she always be in the right; but our country, right or wrong." Decatur's salute is often cited as the quintessence of American patriotic feeling. It's also the kind of remark that has given patriotism a bad name.
In our own time, sentiments like Decatur's have fallen far out of fashion, but so has a more tempered and cogent kind of patriotism, a classic case of throwing out the baby with the bath water. "A patriot is a fool in every age," jeered Alexander Pope, but perhaps in no age have patriots been deemed more foolish than in our own. To confess love of country today is to invite sneers from sophisticates, to court banishment to the supposedly lunatic fringe, to risk indictment as smug, stupid and reactionary -- or, vilest of all possible epithets, corny. How did this sorry state of affairs come to be? 
 Always a plural people, Americans in recent years have grown downright fractious -- not a condition that conduces to patriotic emotion. Loyalties to tribe and race and communities both virtual and vital, not to mention ardor for mergers and startups and global networking, have apparently crowded out love of nation. The booming economy also tends to make mere sunshine patriots of us all.
"The days of palmy prosperity are not those most favorable to the display of public virtue," wrote Edward Everett -- the other speaker at Gettysburg on Nov. 19, 1863, when Abraham Lincoln managed in just three pithy paragraphs to craft a surpassing argument for devotion to American nationhood. Only "in hard, doubtful, unprosperous and dangerous times," Everett claimed in an 1860 essay, do the "patriotic find their way."
It has been a long time since privation and danger have blighted this lucky land. The Civil War was one such occasion. The era of the Great Depression and World War II was another -- a decade-and-a-half-long ordeal when widely shared penury and peril combined to nurture a feeling of common cause and to inspire a truly healthy sense of patriotic feeling. It was a momentous era, one that has lessons to teach us still, not least about our relation to our country.
The patriotism of the generation that suffered the Depression and waged the war was no witless endorsement of "our country right or wrong." So far from being "the last refuge of a scoundrel," their patriotism was the first haven of those who revered the promise of America even while recognizing its defects.
Franklin Roosevelt knew how stricken his land was. He demanded relief for the one-third of its people who were ill-housed, ill-clad and ill-nourished. But in the opening words of his first inaugural Roosevelt also affirmed that "this great nation will endure as it has endured," and in the next breath gave his famous warning that "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself." That passage amounted to a fond appreciation of the high value of American institutions, even as F.D.R. was about to extend their embrace to that excluded one-third.
Popular culture in the Depression decade reflected the same fusion of admonition and attachment. Through all the prodigious outpouring of contemporary photographs, films and writings that documented the Depression's devastation -- works like Walker Evans's and James Agee's portraits of busted tenant farmers in "Let Us Now Praise Famous Men," or Pare Lorentz's dirge for the despoiled Mississippi in his haunting film, "The River," or John Steinbeck's indictment of the ravages of capitalist agribusiness in "The Grapes of Wrath" -- there beats a clear subtext.
All throb with shame for their country, with anger at its failures, but they pulse with unmistakable affection for it, too. The critic Alfred Kazin recognized this distinctively American attitude of what might be called critical patriotism when he described the cultural mood of the 1930's as "born of the depression and the international crisis," but also suffused with a feeling of "affirmation," with "an insistence to know and to love what it knew." It was as if artists and writers in Depression-era America turned instinctively to the better angels of their nation's nature to guide their countrymen through their greatest crisis in nearly a century.
World War II, of course, unleashed a further upwelling of patriotic fervor. But even wartime patriotism was not without its critical element. Black Americans, for example, embraced the "double-V" campaign, demanding both victory over aggressors abroad and victory over discrimination at home, deftly combining loyal commitment with constructive criticism.
No less striking was the publication in 1944 of the Swedish economist Gunnar Myrdal's classic investigation of race relations, "An American Dilemma." Its basic argument was twofold: in accents that even the most red-white-and-true-blue American could endorse, Myrdal praised "the American Creed," a set of values that included "liberty, equality, justice and fair opportunity for everybody."
But he also composed a withering condemnation of racial oppression, inequality, injustice and denial of opportunity -- probing America's most vexed social issue even during the most anxious months of the war, and thereby helping to lay the foundation for the triumphs of the civil rights movement in the succeeding generation. "Let us go forth to lead the land we love," said John F. Kennedy on the eve of those triumphs. But Kennedy also branded the current treatment of black Americans as a "moral crisis," and summoned his fellow citizens to honor their own best beliefs. That second statement was surely no less patriotic than the first.
The words "patriot" and "paternal" stem from the same Latin root, meaning "father." Critical patriotism toward one's country might be likened to the love that fathers and mothers alike ideally tender to their children: unconditional, but still demanding. What good parents do not both love and challenge their young, supporting them but at the same time pushing them to be all they can be?
Stephen Decatur got it only half right. May our country always be in the right, to be sure. But the truest patriotism -- critical patriotism -- will not hesitate to hold up the mirror of this nation's better, ideal self to expose its wrongs and urge its citizens to right them. Critical patriotism demands not mindless veneration, but strict accountability. It judges as well as celebrates. It is neither foolish nor corny. It is simply necessary if this nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all of us are created equal, is to long endure.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Growth Rate Is the Slowest in 17 Months

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
Manufacturing expanded in June at the slowest pace in 17 months as companies started to feel the effects of six interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve the last year, new figures showed today.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly factory index fell to 51.8 in June from 53.2 in May. June's reading was the lowest since January 1999, when manufacturing began to climb out of a yearlong slump in export sales to Asia and Latin America, but any reading above 50 still indicates an expansion. 
 "The cumulative impact of the interest-rate increases is beginning to bite," said Kenneth Mayland, president of Clear View Economics in Cleveland.
Automakers are feeling the pinch. June sales of North American-built cars and light trucks fell 5.8 percent at General Motors, 3.1 percent at Ford and 9.8 percent at DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler arm, the companies reported today. Industrywide sales fell an estimated 1.4 percent last month, the second straight monthly decrease.
At the same time, business at service companies and others not involved in manufacturing grew at a faster pace in June, another association survey showed. The association's nonmanufacturing business index rose to 64 last month from 61.5 in May, putting it close to its record of 65 set in April.
Another report today showed construction spending barely budged in May, lifted only by an increase in work on factories and office buildings. Spending rose 0.1 percent in May after falling 1.1 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. Recent data point to cooler demand for manufactured goods other than semiconductors and other electronic equipment.
Economic statistics the last month suggested higher rates started to curtail home buying and sales of cars and other retail goods. That, in turn, cut into orders for factory goods.
Today's manufacturing report showed that the production index, a gauge of current output, fell to 53.6 in June -- the lowest since January 1999 -- from 56.3 in May. The new orders index, a gauge of current demand, fell to 50.6 in June -- the lowest since December 1998 -- from 51.1 in May.
The purchasing association's prices-paid index in June fell to 61.2 -- the lowest since August 1999 -- from 65.8 in May. The prices index has fallen since March, when it reached a five-year high of 79.8.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Up On New Data On Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday in light preholiday trading, getting a boost from a manufacturing report that showed signs of an economic slowdown.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 10/32, to 103 24/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.98 percent from 6.01 percent on Friday. 
The 30-year Treasury bond rose 14/32, to 105 12/32, while the yield fell to 5.87 percent from 5.89 percent on Friday.
The bond market closed at 1 p.m. yesterday ahead of the Independence Day holiday today, when United States financial markets are closed.
A report from National Association of Purchasing Management found the nation's manufacturing sector grew at a significantly slower pace in June, another sign that the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool the economy by increasing interest rates are working. The manufacturing growth was considerably lower than expected.
If the economy is indeed slowing it could forestall the Fed from further increasing interest rates as it has six times in the last year to keep a lid on inflation. Higher interest rates hurt the value of bonds in circulation since they pay a fixed rate of return.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 96 7/32. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.91 percent.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	Price	98.526	96.979	 	High Rate	5.83%	5.97%	 	Investment Rate	6.00%	6.25%	 	Low Rate	5.75%	5.90%	 	Median Rate	5.80%	5.96%	 	Total applied for	$27,154,512	$18,049,320	 	Accepted	$12,919,354	$3,494,460	 	Noncompetitive	$1,169,936	$1,249,890

HEADLINE: Texas Nursing Home Financial Crisis Seen

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., July 3

 BODY:
Texas nursing home operators say they are facing a financial crisis in the next two years if the state does not increase reimbursement rates or help contain rising liability costs.
"We've taken a hard look at our situation," said Tim Graves, president of the Texas Health Care Association, which represents 700 nursing homes. "We're running on fumes." 
 About 22 percent of nursing homes in Texas, with an estimated 23,000 beds, are in bankruptcy, and this could jump to as much as 45 percent, Mr. Graves said. The state would need to increase nursing home spending by as much as $800 million in the 2002-2003 budget to help the industry, he said.
State lawmakers will draft the state budget in the 2001 session.
Earlier this year, the state adopted a 3.7 percent increase in nursing home reimbursements, but industry officials said it was too small. The industry said it needed a 7 percent increase to offset the rising costs of liability insurance and labor.
The legislature, however, had authorized only enough money for the smaller increase, the same amount as the year before.
The reimbursements pay nursing homes to care for patients covered by Medicaid, the state-federal health care program for low-income people.
Industry officials say Texas nursing homes lost money every day on Medicaid patients in 1999. Health care providers say the state's $78-a-day average payment was one of the lowest in the country last year while liability coverage has tripled since 1998, raising the average premium from $650 a bed to about $1,800.

HEADLINE: Saudi Arabia to Raise Oil Production 500,000 Barrels a Day

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
In a move to bring down stubbornly high oil prices, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter of crude oil, announced plans yesterday to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day.
The decision will go into effect within the next few days "if the price doesn't decrease," according to a statement from the Saudi Arabian oil minister quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency. 
 The unilateral step by the Saudis comes less than two weeks after the 10-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader, decided to increase production by 708,000 barrels a day, hoping to rein in crude oil prices that exceeded $30 a barrel. The price of crude instead rose, driven by the disappointment in the market that the production increase was not greater, as had been widely expected.
The announcement came after commodities markets in London closed, and the first United States reaction will only become apparent after the Independence Day holiday. Analysts believe the new increase in output will dampen crude oil prices. The increase most likely comes too late to affect United States gasoline prices this summer, analysts said, but they are cautiously optimistic that it will push down prices for heating oil, which have jumped 10 percent the last month.
"Any additional oil supply is good news for the American consumer," said John Felmy, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington trade group. "But demand continues to grow, so it's not clear how much prices will decline."
The 500,000 barrels a day constitute a small fraction of the 75 million barrels a day the world consumes. Typically, for every $1 decrease in the price of crude oil, there follows a 2.5 cent decline in the price of gasoline and other petroleum products.
The United States market will not see the first of the new oil until early August or so, because it takes about 40 days for Persian Gulf crude to reach American ports. By that time, gasoline prices should be tapering off on their own, as vacation season winds down and people begin to drive less. But the oil would arrive just as refineries begin to build stocks of heating oil for the winter.
The Energy Department reported last week that inventories of distillate, which includes diesel and heating oil, were 21 percent lower than last year. Surging demand for diesel has drawn distillate out of refineries as quickly as it flowed in, leading to a rapid rise in heating oil prices. New Saudi oil could ease the supply shortage and help drive heating oil prices lower, though perhaps only slightly. But recent production increases by OPEC have failed to reduce crude oil prices, primarily because robust economies, especially that of the United States, demand more oil than the cartel has so far offered. After weathering years of depressed oil prices, OPEC cut production drastically in March 1999 to boost prices. But once crude oil surpassed $30 a barrel earlier this year, OPEC came under pressure from the world's industrialized nations to raise output. The high crude prices also worried some OPEC members, particularly Saudi Arabia, which have seen worldwide recessions unfold because of costly oil.
OPEC increased output significantly this spring, with little impact on crude prices. When cartel members met again in Vienna 10 days ago, the oil market had been primed for a second increase, on the order of one million barrels a day. It was widely known that cartel members were producing an estimated 500,000 barrels a day more than they had agreed to in spring. So an increase of one million barrels a day would have brought on the market an additional 500,000 barrels of so-called new oil.
When OPEC announced a more modest increase of 708,000 barrels that would release only about 200,000 barrels of new oil, the market rejected the gesture and crude prices jumped to more than $32 a barrel.
"OPEC was really surprised that prices went higher after Vienna," said Leonidas P. Drollas, chief economist with the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London research group. "Most people expected one million barrels a day. That would have been enough for the soft landing that people had sought. But that seemed a bridge too far for the hawks in OPEC."
Hawkish OPEC members have little to gain by a more substantial increase. Of the 10 active members, all but three -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates -- are producing at full capacity. The other seven countries lose revenues with any increase in output because they lack the capacity to make up for the fall in crude prices by pumping more oil. That may explain why Saudi Arabia acted swiftly and apparently unilaterally, though in their statement the Saudis said they would raise output "in consultation with other producers." Some observers expect Kuwait and the emirates to also increase production.
The lopsided decision could increase tensions within the cartel, but that is unlikely to affect Saudi Arabia's decision. "They were getting really antsy about prices not coming down and about their inability to affect market psychology," said Roger Diwan, managing director of the Petroleum Finance Corporation, a Washington consulting group. "Now, the Saudis have taken the oil bull market by the horns and pulled it down."

HEADLINE: Big U.S. Automakers' Sales Dropped 1.4% Last Month

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 3

 BODY:
Americans bought fewer autos from General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler than expected in June, opting to buy vehicles made by Japanese and European companies or to keep the vehicles they own.
Sales of North American-built cars and trucks fell 5.8 percent at G.M. and 3.1 percent at Ford. DaimlerChrysler, beset by an aging minivan lineup, said its sales excluding Mercedes-Benz fell 9.8 percent. 
 Industrywide sales rose 0.2 percent, to 1.61 million cars and light trucks, according to the Autodata Corporation, based on reports from 17 of 24 carmakers and estimates for the rest. Monthly records by Toyota Motor, Honda Motor and gains from other overseas makers, including Volkswagen, helped surprise analysts who expected United States sales to fall 1.4 percent. First-half sales rose 6.1 percent, to a record 9.12 million.
Asian and European automakers have "competitively priced, attractive product" that is luring buyers, said David Garrity, an auto analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.
Record gasoline prices, rising interest rates and stock market declines may be starting to take the wind out of a yearlong buying spree, analysts said. Even so, the estimated annual selling rate in June of 17 million is in line with record sales of 16.96 million in 1999.
The United States auto sales boom began in earnest in May 1999, when the annual selling rate hit 17.3 million. Until last year, 15 million was considered a strong performance.
Toyota, the fourth-largest automaker in the United States, reported a 7.8 percent gain, while Honda, the No. 5 maker, said sales rose 16 percent; it was the best June ever for both companies. Volkswagen of Germany said its sales rose 9 percent.
Shares of DaimlerChrysler rose $1, to $53.0625, today, while G.M. rose $1.5625, to $59.625. Shares of Ford rose 93.75 cents, to $43.9375. Sales were announced after trading closed at 1 p.m. for the Fourth of July.
General Motors sold 459,994 North American-built cars and light trucks, a bigger decline than the 5.2 percent average analyst forecast. Total sales including imports and large trucks fell 5 percent, to 472,078. Total car sales fell 2.3 percent, while total truck sales slid 8.7 percent.
Car sales in June were hurt by declines at its Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Cadillac divisions.
Ford sold 401,680 North American-built cars and light trucks in June, down 3.1 percent, compared with the 2.3 percent decline forecast. Total sales including Volvo, Jaguar and heavy trucks fell 2.6 percent, to 419,932. Total car sales declined 5.5 percent while total truck sales slipped 0.3 percent.
Ford is phasing out production of its Mercury Mystique and Ford Contour cars to build a new compact sport utility that goes on sale later this year. Sales of the Taurus car were unchanged.
The Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler sold 215,597 cars and light trucks in June, missing forecasts that sales would fall 5.9 percent. Car sales fell 20 percent while sales of trucks, minivans and sport utilities declined 5.8 percent. Total sales including Mercedes-Benz fell about 8.6 percent, to 233,516.
Sales of DaimlerChrysler's minivans, which will not be redesigned until later this quarter, fell 25 percent, even though discounts increased on some of the longer models.
Analysts expect United States auto sales to cool the remainder of the year because of higher interest rates and declines in the stock market, the source of some car-buyers' wealth.
The Federal Reserve's six interest rate increase in the last year "have definitely hurt, as has the market's reaction to the moves," said Paul Taylor, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.
The United States average retail price of regular gasoline hit a record $1.681 a gallon in June. Some automakers reported softer vehicle demand in Midwest, where the average price was highest, but said gas prices did not affect sales nationwide.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Democratic Breakthrough

 BODY:
Never before in the memory of living Mexicans has presidential power passed peacefully to an opposition party. But just such a transition is now under way, following the decisive victory of Vicente Fox Quesada and his center-right National Action Party, or PAN, in Sunday's Mexican elections. It is a great advance for democracy in Latin America's second-largest country and Washington's second-biggest trading partner.
Mexico began prying lose the authoritarian grip of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, more than a decade ago, as its citizens came into contact with the democratic currents sweeping Latin America and the world. Initial electoral challenges were repulsed by intimidation and fraud, or bought off with patronage. But opposition parties persisted, and during the six-year term of President Ernesto Zedillo important reforms opened up the electoral system. Statehouses fell to opposition governors. Three years ago the combined opposition won a congressional majority. That allowed scrutiny of the federal budget and cabinet ministers. But Mexico's Constitution concentrates power in the presidency. Its passage into opposition hands is a transforming event in the political life of Mexico. 
 Mexico's transition toward a modern democracy also has significance for the United States. No major policy differences divide Mr. Fox's PAN from the long-ruling PRI. But the inauguration of democratic competition at every level of Mexican politics can have a salutary effect on a wide range of issues. It can provide a check on official corruption in Mexico and mitigate the feelings of political and economic powerlessness that have driven so many Mexicans to emigrate illegally to the United States. Some officials in Washington may miss the predictability of permanent rule by the PRI. But wiser heads will see the positive potential in this week's change.
Besides winning the presidency, the PAN will also be the largest party in the Congress. But to command a majority, it will have to make deals with other political groups. This need for a broadly based government should prove healthy, encouraging the PAN to reach out to members of the center-left opposition as well as the PRI.
Catholic intellectuals formed the PAN more than 60 years ago to fight the secularism and land reform programs of Mexico's post-revolutionary governments. More recently, the PAN has evolved into a moderate pro-business party, well represented by Mr. Fox, a former chief executive of Coca-Cola in Mexico. In building his victory margin, Mr. Fox attracted considerable support from left-of-center voters, many of whom felt that ending the PRI's enduring grip on the presidency was the most important issue in this year's election.
The PRI, associated with so many electoral manipulations in the past, behaved wisely and responsibly in defeat. Its candidate, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, conceded early and gracefully, getting the lengthy five-month transition period off to a firm start. The PRI's constructive new attitude owes much to Mr. Zedillo's enlightened leadership.
Mr. Zedillo correctly understood that the only way to restore public confidence in elections was to create an independent electoral institute to supervise campaigning, balloting and the tallying of votes. Without that crucial reform, this year's generally clean campaign and Sunday's reliable count might not have been possible.
Mr. Fox will not take office until Dec. 1. Past presidential transitions have been marred by economic turmoil. In 1994, the administration of Carlos Salinas failed to coordinate its financial policies with Mr. Zedillo's incoming team, badly undermining international confidence in the peso. The result was a painful recession, which cost Mexicans dearly. Mr. Zedillo should draw the appropriate lesson from that experience. Having given Mexico its cleanest election ever, he can make a further contribution by working closely with Mr. Fox and his advisers through the crucial months ahead.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Links Drug Industry and G.O.P. to High Costs

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: CLAYTON, Mo., July 3

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore today accused drug companies of "price-gouging" and "special interest schemes" to keep drug prices high, and he pledged to a crowd of the elderly to "fight for you, not for the powerful drug companies."
Mr. Gore's appearance at a community center in the swing state of Missouri began a weeklong Gore drive to highlight an issue that has emerged as one of the most potent this election season: the spiraling cost of prescription drugs. 
 The vice president worked to tie his main opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, and the Republicans in Congress to the drug industry. "It is not all that complicated," Mr. Gore said at a news conference. "Governor Bush is with the big pharmaceutical companies."
He also contended that drug companies had written the House Republicans' recently passed bill that provides a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients. The Republican bill would rely on private insurance companies to sell drug coverage polices to the elderly, backed by government subsidies and incentives.
"I think they crafted the actual words," Mr. Gore said.
The Democrats support a more expansive measure, relying directly on the Medicare system. Mr. Bush generally supports the House Republican plan.
Mr. Gore has a history of taking on the drug companies, dating to his years in Congress, although some of his friends and advisers now represent the pharmaceutical industry as lobbyists. His campaign advisers believe the issue allows him to draw a sharp contrast with Mr. Bush, who received more campaign contributions from the industry.
Mr. Gore's aides distributed a list of contributions that drug companies had made to Republicans. Separate figures, provided by the Campaign Study Group, a nonpartisan research organization, showed that Republican Party committees have received $4 million in unregulated "soft money" contributions from pharmaceutical companies since January 1999, while Democrats received $1.4 million.
In response to Mr. Gore's speech, the Bush campaign released a statement by Representative James M. Talent, Republican of Missouri, asserting that the Clinton administration had been "an obstacle" to overhauling Medicare for eight years.
"After eight years of failing to propose a solution," Mr. Talent said, "the vice president is now saying he wants reform."
For several years, Democrats have put the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly at the top of their agenda. With drug prices rising faster than the rate of inflation, President Clinton a year ago proposed an expansion of the 34-year-old Medicare program to cover drugs. House Democrats have been riding the issue hard in their quest to regain control of the House -- even running bus trips for the elderly to Canada and Mexico, where drug prices are lower.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, who was at Mr. Gore's side today, said House Democrats would campaign on the issue across the country this week.
Republicans originally denounced Mr. Clinton's plan as a costly expansion of a program that already faces fiscal difficulties and said they would not take it up unless it was part of a broader overhaul of Medicare.
But trying to blunt the Democrats' drive, House Republicans just before the July 4 recess pushed through on a near-party-line vote their own measure costing $40 billion over five years, changing the debate to which party's plan is better. John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said Republican House members were also told to conduct town meetings this week to promote their plan.
Mr. Feehery said the Republican bill avoided "a government takeover of health care" and did not rely on a "huge government bureaucracy."
Mr. Gore pointed to assertions by insurance companies that the Republican bill would not work. He said the Republican bill reminded him of a story about a veterinarian and taxidermist who "go into work together and they put up a sign saying, 'Either way, you get your dog back.' " He added, "There is a difference."
Mr. Gore today heard stories from hard-pressed elderly people, including a woman who told of buying 16 boxes of macaroni and cheese dinners because they cost only $4, saving her money for medicine.
"You've been eating macaroni and cheese for every meal?" Mr. Gore prompted her.
"I can save a little bit of it for the next day, too," said Jacqueline Steele Johnson, 72.
"We don't want to have a system where you are completely at the mercy of the big drug companies and no one is standing up for you," the vice president said. "I want to stand up for you."
The drug companies had too much power over drug costs, the vice president said.
Mr. Gore singled out for criticism the manufacturer of Claritan D, a top-selling allergy medication, because it is circulating legislation to extend its patent. He said drug patents were not designed to create a situation "where we can be just exploited forever by the wealthy and the powerful."
The Republican drug bill would offer a drug benefit to Medicare recipients that would use private insurance companies to sell drug coverage polices to the elderly, backed by government subsidies and incentives.
The difference between the Democratic and Republican approaches on prescription drugs involves philosophy and detail. The Democrats rely on the Medicare program, while the Republicans rely on incentives to private insurers to sell policies to the elderly.
Under the Republican plan, the government would set the parameters of a standard drug policy for the elderly, but premiums and co-payments could vary from one private drug plan to another as long as the overall values met the government standard. The plan envisions premiums of $35 to $40 a month. After a $250 deductible, the policies would pay for half of a recipient's annual drug costs, up to $2,100.
Mr. Gore, like other Democrats, has proposed a more generous benefit than the Republicans, which would cost $255 billion over a decade. It would carry no deductible and would cover half of the costs of drugs, up to $5,000. The premium would start at $25 a month.
The vice president's plan and that of the House Republicans would both contain subsides for low-income seniors and protections for those with high drug costs. The Republicans would provide 100 percent drug-cost coverage after an individual's out-of-pocket costs reached $6,000. Mr. Gore would pay for all expenses after out-of-pocket costs reached $4,000.
The drug industry is the second industry that Mr. Gore has gone after in recent weeks, having just finished a series of broadsides against the oil companies. Today, he hailed news that Saudi Arabia was raising oil production and called on the "big oil companies" to pass along price reductions.

HEADLINE: THE MEXICAN ELECTION: WASHINGTON;
Change in Leadership Is Welcomed as an Opportunity for Greater U.S.-Mexican Cooperation

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 3

 BODY:
The Clinton administration welcomed the transition of power in Mexico, saying today that the election of Vicente Fox Quesada was evidence of the maturing of democratic institutions and that it set the stage for economic growth.
President Clinton telephoned Mr. Fox to congratulate him, and also spoke to President Ernesto Zedillo, the departing leader, to express his gratitude for his role in strengthening democracy in Mexico. 
 "Mexicans should be proud of the extraordinary steps they have taken during the last six years to strengthen and consolidate democratic institutions and set Mexico on a course of economic growth and prosperity," Mr. Clinton said in a statement released by the White House.
Mr. Clinton dealt frequently with Mr. Zedillo in the past six years, especially after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which saw trade between the two nations soar. The two leaders held their eleventh meeting here last month when Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Zedillo for advancing the process of trade integration with the United States.
During the campaign, the Clinton administration had been fairly scrupulous in not showing a preference for either Mr. Fox or his main opponent, Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
It also had expressed confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.
That confidence was borne out in the conduct of the elections on Sunday and in the results, the White House said.
For Washington, dealing with a Mexican administration led by the PRI, which had been in power for 71 years, has been an ingrained habit that survived countless bouts of economic crisis in Mexico and American-led financial bailouts. Through all the crises, Washington was generally grateful to have a stable neighbor even though it was poor and in more recent years became the major conduit for illegal narcotics into the United States.
But Mr. Fox is not an unknown quantity in Washington. In an introductory pre-election visit here in May, he met with Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering and gave talks at several foreign policy institutions.
He impressed people here not only as a businessman who once worked for Coca-Cola but also as a politician who understood the United States, a senior administration official said. One of his major points was further expansion of American investment in Mexico.
"He wanted to reassure us that the United States would have a good partner, that he would be reliable and would co-operate across the board," the official said. "Relations under Zedillo had reached an all-time high and we would expect Fox to continue the momentum."
But this was not to say that Mr. Fox would not inject some new ideas into the relationship.
On the three main issues between Mexico and the United States -- immigration, trade and the flow of drugs -- Mr. Fox, as a former governor of a northern Mexican state, would likely bring some fresh thinking, officials said.
During his campaign, Mr. Fox said he would like a more even relationship with Washington on the handling of immigration which, from the Mexican point of view, has largely been treated by the United States as a criminal justice and police issue.
"I think this is one issue that the new president and the new president of the United State will have to deal with quite quickly," said Andres Rozental, a business consultant in Mexico City, who was a deputy secretary of state dealing with American relations in a former Mexican government.
Mr. Rozental said he believed that Mr. Fox would like to look beyond just "managing" the question of illegal Mexican immigrants into the United States and turn toward reaching agreements with Washington that would allow better terms for semi-skilled Mexican migrants to enter the United States.
He pointed out that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. had recently noted the value of semi-skilled foreign workers to the United States, and that the Treasury Department had attributed some of the economic growth during the Clinton administration to immigrant labor. This presented a "window of opportunity" for Mexico to try to persuade Washington to sit down and take a new look at immigration policies with Mexico, he said.
Despite disputes involving trucking and sugar -- two sectors in which Mexico would like a bigger share of the American market -- Mexico's trading relations with the United States have moved steadily since NAFTA was signed into law by President Clinton in 1993.
An administration official said that Mr. Zedillo had refrained from repeating the practice of his predecessors of ramping up the Mexican economy in an effort to have his party win the election.
"There is stability, not boom," in the Mexican economy, an administration official said.
There was also the prospect of continuity in the economy with the head of the central bank, Guillermo Ortiz, slated to stay. It also appeared possible that the finance minister, Jose Angel Gurria, might remain in office.

Sales in June for Big Three Were Less Than Expected
Americans bought fewer autos than expected from General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler in June, opting to buy vehicles made by Japanese and European companies or to keep the vehicles they already own.
Sales of North American-built cars and trucks fell 5.8 percent at G.M. and 3.1 percent at Ford. DaimlerChrysler, beset by an aging minivan lineup, said its sales excluding Mercedes-Benz fell 9.8 percent. Industrywide sales rose 0.2 percent, to 1.61 million cars and light trucks. Shares of DaimlerChrysler rose $1, to $53.0625, while G.M. rose $1.5625, to $59.625. Shares of Ford rose 93.75 cents, to $43.9375. Page C2. 

Start-Ups Struggle in Silicon Alley
These are trying days for Silicon Alley, an industry made up of as many as 7,000 enterprises, most of them tiny start-ups. They tend to specialize in content rather than technology, making them more vulnerable to gyrations on Wall Street. Several high-profile Internet companies in New York have gone under or are barely hanging on, and more are expected to succumb in the coming months. B1.
 
Napster Seeks to Forestall Closing
Napster, the Internet music start-up, asked a federal judge not to shut down its service, asserting in a court brief that individual Napster users are doing nothing illegal by making personal collections of copyrighted music they download over the Internet. C4.
 
Growth in Manufacturing Slows
Manufacturing expanded in June at the slowest pace in 17 months, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management, which said its monthly factory index fell to 51.8 in June from 53.2 in May. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed construction spending rose 0.1 percent in May after falling 1.1 percent in April. C5.
 
Stocks Rise in Sluggish Trading
Stocks rose broadly in light trading before the holiday as investors reacted to a lower-than-expected reading for manufacturing activity in June. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 112.78 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,560.67. The Nasdaq composite index edged up 25.82 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,991.93, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 14.72 points, or 1 percent, to 1,469.32. C4.
 
Treasury prices rose as the yield on the 10-year note fell to 5.98 percent from 6.01 percent and the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.87 percent from 5.89 percent. C4.
 
Microsoft Bolsters Defense Team
Microsoft added more firepower to the defense team in its antitrust case by hiring Carter G. Phillips, a leading appellate lawyer. C5.
 
An Inflation Warning for Russia
Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, warned that inflation is rising at an annual rate of nearly 35 percent, a trend economists say could severely strain the incomes of Russians. Mr. Putin, who is making his first attempts at economic policy, was quoted as suggesting at a Kremlin meeting that the government should take steps to slow the pace of inflation. C2.

 
Shareholders Back Telephone Deal
Minority shareholders of Cable and Wireless voted overwhelmingly to be acquired by Pacific Century Cyberworks, an Internet company run by Richard Li. The deal needs to be ratified by a judge on July 25, but analysts say the vote guarantees that Mr. Li, 33, who runs Pacific Century, will soon own Hong Kong's flagship telephone company. C3.
 
Wireless Venture May Sell Stake
A British wireless venture backed by the Hong Kong conglomerate Hutchinson Whampoa and Telesystem International Wireless of Canada, is in talks to sell about a third of the company to NTT DoCoMo and Royal KPN for as much as $2 billion. C15.
 
U.S. Financial Markets Closed
The stock market and other financial markets in the United States will be closed today in observance of the Fourth of July. Most overseas markets, however, will be open. United States markets will reopen tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Washington Reneges on a Bargain

 BODY:
Congress made a welfare deal with the states in 1996 that it now threatens to tarnish. Under the deal, the states relinquished their 60-year-old entitlement to additional federal money when their welfare rolls rise. In exchange, every state received a big fixed annual grant to cover its welfare costs. Congress also gave 17 needy states extra help in the form of supplemental grants. Congress now threatens to reclaim part of these supplemental grants.
This misguided proposal would punish poor states with high rates of child poverty. It would also send the terrible message that states will be better off if they spend money quickly and foolishly rather than slowly and well. 
 Congress provided the supplemental grants partly to help states that were paying low benefits to existing enrollees. The idea was to close some of the huge gap in benefits paid by rich and poor states. But as a soaring economy and stiff welfare reforms drove down welfare rolls by 30 percent in the years following the 1996 law, states found they did not need to spend every last federal dollar. In addition, the families left behind were often the most disadvantaged and hardest to help. Some states, needing time to figure out how to reach them, held on to their money until they could develop the right strategy.
The administration proposed many months ago to raise revenue for budget purposes by reclaiming some of the unspent supplemental grants -- an idea embraced by the House and now under consideration by the Senate. But according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group, the supplemental grants are essential in helping poorer states achieve parity in federal grants. In the beginning, these poorer states spent a smaller portion of their federal allotment than the wealthier states, creating the impression that they did not need the extra money. But their hesitancy was temporary. Now, according to the center, the states receiving supplemental grants are using more of their federal dollars than other states.
Money is not the sole answer to poverty. But a recent evaluation of an ambitious program in Minnesota shows that it can produce startling results. The Minnesota welfare program combined generous work incentives with child-care assistance and support for enrollees after they find work. The result was a decline in the number of poor people living solely on welfare and a rise in employment and marriage rates among enrollees. At a time when the federal treasury is flush with cash, Congress need not deprive states with high rates of child poverty of the money they were promised. It is also money they desperately need to help the families left behind by prosperity and facing federally imposed time limits on cash assistance.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: ADDRESSING CHANGE;
Gore and Bush Agree on Basics, But Differ Sharply on the Details

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: CLAYTON, Mo., July 3

 BODY:
With their competing array of policy speeches, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush seem to be turning this election into a referendum on which candidate can best reshape government to meet the challenges of the New Economy.
From health care to education to tax cuts to Social Security, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are placing before the voters significant questions about how some of the most fundamental public institutions should be shaped for a global, digital age that offers the prospect of sustained prosperity -- and enormous uncertainty. 
 Mr. Bush's advisers say the technology-based economy and the growth of a middle-income investor class will make voters far more responsive to Republican ideas for decentralizing government and reshaping the New Deal and Great Society programs for the elderly. Governor Bush would like the private sector to provide more government services and make people less dependent on one-size-fits-all federal programs.
Mr. Gore, on the other hand, wants to expand the traditionally Democratic entitlement programs. His aides argue that the lower and middle classes need more government assistance with education and health care and retirement pensions at a time when knowledge is ever more important to success and when employers offer less generous and less secure health and pension plans.
Those differences were on display again today as Mr. Gore promoted his plan for a Medicare prescription-drug benefit and attacked a House Republican version, supported in concept by Mr. Bush, that subsidizes private insurers to offer the coverage. Page A10.
"It's a misnomer," Mr. Gore said here in Clayton of the Republicans' plan. "It's nothing. It doesn't work."
 The face-off may not have the same high drama of the cold-war era. Nor have the two candidates focused in a sustained way on hot-button social issues the way the presidential rivals did in 1988 when crime, welfare and flag-burning were the agenda. But analysts in both parties say the stakes are high.
"The party that seizes the wave of change sweeping our economy is the one that is destined to lead for the coming generation," Peter Ross Range, the editor of The New Democrat Blueprint, a magazine of the centrist Democrats, wrote in its latest edition.
Stephen Goldsmith, Mr. Bush's chief domestic policy adviser said, "There's a big fault line here."
Some talk of the new economy is as much about symbolism as about substance. It allows Mr. Gore to try to capitalize on what should be his greatest strength, the extraordinary economic expansion of the Clinton years. And for Mr. Bush, analysts say, presenting himself as a managerial reformer lets him look less ideological than other Republicans, particularly those in Congress.
But it is also true that since the last presidential election, the economy has changed sharply. Robust growth has turned deficits into surpluses. Internet use and electronic commerce are exploding. And the stock market, while cooling somewhat in recent months, has generated huge new pools of wealth.
At the same time, new issues have arisen about the divide between the winners and losers in the New Economy, one that has produced less stable jobs and less stable benefit plans and left millions of Americans without health insurance.
"The challenge of the New Economy, one of the biggest challenges, is to expand the winners' circle so you don't leave people behind," said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist Democrat organization. "Because one of the dangers of the New Economy is if you leave too many people behind and you have a backlash."
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush agree on some broad themes. They both embrace free trade in the increasingly global economy, in contrast to the third-party contenders, Patrick J. Buchanan and Ralph Nader, and many Congressional Democrats.
They also each call for the federal government to take a stronger role in education policy at a time when the knowledge-based economy rewards the higher educated. And they each speak frequently of helping those whom prosperity has left behind.
Still, the two have fundamental differences about how to shape government.
For example, Mr. Gore would expand three government entitlement programs, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. He would bring more of the uninsured under the auspices of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. He would create a new Medicare prescription-drug benefit for the elderly. And he would offer more Social Security benefits to women.
In addition to Social Security, he would also create a new retirement benefit for the working poor and the middle class.
Mr. Bush argues for more individual choice. So he would allow workers to divert an unspecified part of their Social Security payroll tax to private investment accounts. He would turn Medicare from a fee-for-service guaranteed benefit program to one that lets people buy different levels of health insurance.
And while he too would create a prescription-drug benefit for the elderly, he wants to create subsidies for private insurers so that they, not the government directly, would offer the benefit. He would give tax credits for health insurance but send people to the private market to buy it.
A similar contrast concerns education. Both men would invest in schools and teachers -- Mr. Gore putting in about 10 times more money than Mr. Bush -- and both have plans for how to improve accountability and performance. But two proposals are particularly telling.
Mr. Gore would extend the reach of public-school systems by giving states grants to create public pre-schools. Mr. Bush, as a lever against failing schools, would give low-income parents whose children attend such schools vouchers that could pay for private-school tuition.
And while both candidates favor tax cuts, they differ in method and degree.
Mr. Bush calls for a $1.3-trillion across-the-board tax cut over a decade, saying, "A government with unlimited funds soon becomes a government of unlimited reach." Mr. Gore offers $500 billion in tax cuts intended to reimburse people for particular needs -- like child care or college tuition -- and phasing out as income rises.
Mr. Bush's aides call the top-down, big-government structures outmoded relics of the Great Depression. "Governor Bush will put more control over decisions -- whether they are health, retirement or savings -- in the hands of individuals," Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said. "The vice president will maintain them in the hands of government."
Democrats respond that Mr. Bush's ideas would erode the common commitment to many government institutions.
"The big danger with a lot of the Bush programs is what we call cherry-picking," said Robert Reich, the former labor secretary. "The healthy, the wealthy or the well-educated will be the first to opt out, leaving the poor, the sicker and the lesser-educated behind in the general insurance pools or in the education system. This is a sure-fire recipe for social stratification."
Mr. Gore's aides are also trying to turn the debate to the issue of whom the competing plans help, particularly pointing to the tax cuts.
"Bush takes the old-fashioned approach of cutting everybody's rates which ends up really, really, really helping wealthy people because they pay so much and being of marginal help, if any, to people in lower brackets," said Elaine Kamarck, Mr. Gore's policy director.
Mr. Bush promotes his tax cut by saying it would remove six million low-income families from the tax rolls. Critics say it would also give most of its benefits to higher-income groups simply because those pay the most taxes.
An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal public policy group, found that Mr. Bush's plan would give the top 1 percent of tax payers 42 percent of the tax cuts, while the bottom 20 percent of tax payers would get less than 1 percent.
Mr. Bush's aides counter that their approach to tax cuts gives individuals more choice on how to use their money. "Gore views government's roles as manipulating people and uses people's own tax money to manipulate their behavior," said Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser. "Bush says it's your money. You keep it. Do what you think is best with it."
A similar debate is brewing over Social Security. Depending on how it is structured, Mr. Bush's plan to switch some Social Security payroll tax to individual savings accounts could prove more lucrative for upper-income groups.
If two percentage points of payroll tax were diverted to individual investment accounts, someone earning $76,000 annually would have slightly more than $1,500 a year to invest in private markets. Someone earning $25,000 would have $500 to invest. Critics of the idea say it is not hard to see which taxpayer is likely to build up the better retirement account.
Some plans on Capitol Hill try to address this by cutting the basic Social Security benefit more for higher-income individuals than lower-income ones or by giving extra contributions to low-income workers. Mr. Bush has said the idea of matching funds for the lower incomes should be considered. But he has not committed to it.
Mr. Gore would preserve the current Social Security system, and create a new retirement plan in addition to it. This plan would be similar to a 401 (k) plan and geared toward helping lower-income groups.
For example, the government would give couples earning less than $30,000 a year $3 for every dollar they put in this savings account; the government match would then reduce as income grew. The program would not be available to couples earning more than $100,000.
Mr. Bush's aides also say Mr. Gore would make Medicare and Social Security more expansive and costly at a time when the boomer generation's impending retirement threatens to bankrupt the systems.
"The fundamental challenge facing the next president is to solve this problem," Mr. Lindsey said. "What Gore just proposed is layering another new unfunded entitlement on top of what's already out there."
Mr. Bush's aides also prefer to steer the debate to how people are helped. They say they want to give people with lower incomes the same kinds of choices the wealthy have -- whether it is the choice of attending a private school or the choice of investing their retirement money in the stock market.

HEADLINE: Shift in the Mix Alters the Face Of California

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 30

 BODY:
At some unknown moment between now and July 1, 2001, if demographers are right, California will become the first big state in which non-Hispanic whites are officially no longer a majority. Or, to put it another way, California will become by far the largest proving ground for what it may eventually be like to live in a United States in which no one racial or ethnic group predominates.
The California of postwar popular imagination, of the Beach Boys and the John Birch Society, of Disneyland and monochromatic Pleasantvilles full of aerospace workers, is not dead. But it is, literally, dying fast. Non-Hispanic whites now account for about three-quarters of the deaths in California, and barely a third of the births. As recently as 1970, the state was 80 percent white. 
 Some experts argue that this shift, fueled by millions of new immigrants, mostly Latin American and Asian, and the higher birth rates of foreign-born residents has already taken place and has yet to be reflected in estimates by the state Department of Finance only because of counting glitches. It has already had striking social, political, economic and psychic effects, including bitterly fought ballot initiatives to cut government services for illegal immigrants, and to end state affirmative action programs and bilingual education. Polls show that the disappearing white majority is generally more pessimistic than other groups.
But with the state's economy booming again, and the overall population expected to grow by close to 18 million in the next 25 years, Californians are grappling anew with the meaning of this momentous shift, which the State Department of Finance now projects will happen sometime in the next year, and many are finding reasons for optimism.
"Who knows when that line is crossed, but it surely will be," said Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat. "I believe leadership requires one to look on the bright side. There's no question that a more diverse population creates some potential discomforts and even potential conflicts, but it also brings great strengths."
The demographic shift has begun to change the state's politics as scores of Hispanic voters have registered as Democrats in a backlash spurred by Republican-led campaigns against illegal immigration. That is complicating efforts by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to make inroads in a state where his aides believe his Southwestern brand of Republicanism should be appealing.
In Los Angeles, where the demographic transition has already occurred, it is at once invisible and omnipresent, apparent in the miles of neighborhoods where signs are printed in every language but English. This city has the largest population of Koreans outside Korea and the largest concentration of Iranians in the Western world, a polyglot port of entry comparable to New York at the turn of the last century. The region's latest gang battle is between Hispanics and Armenians in the once lily-white suburb of Glendale.
California is not the first state where non-Hispanic whites will not constitute a majority; they do not in Hawaii, whose population is mainly Asian and Pacific Islander. In the past, there have been times when they have not been a majority in New Mexico, while before the Civil War, South Carolina had a black majority.
But California is the biggest state to experience the shift, and for longtime residents, the changes seem breathtaking. Just 40 years ago, the most common language of foreign-born Californians was English, reflecting the population of British and Canadian immigrants, said Peter Schrag, the former editorial page editor of The Sacramento Bee and the author of "Paradise Lost: California's Experience, America's Future" (1998), a study of the state government's failures to deal with social and economic change.
"In the history of the state, we've gone up and down on this issue, and there's a kind of inherent ambivalence," Mr. Schrag said of the demographic diversity. "But a lot of it is conditioned by economic circumstances. When times are good, we like these folks, because they give us cheap labor. And when times are bad, we say, 'Who are these damn Mexicans taking our jobs away or using public welfare?' I'm not saying that's a cycle we're fated to live with for the rest of our existence, but it's been the pattern."
The prevailing classification scheme of demographic groups is itself fraught with anomalies. "Hispanic" is an ethnic description, not a racial one, that lumps together Latin Americans of all descriptions: whites, blacks, mixed-race people, and descendants of Mayans, Aztecs, Incas and other Indian groups.
Similarly, "white" in the California usage can include immigrants from the Middle East who may be dark skinned. By this standard, some analysts argue that Californians of Anglo-European ancestry have actually been a minority here since sometime in the late 1980's.
One such analyst is Ron Unz, the Republican millionaire who sponsored the 1998 measure to end bilingual education in the public schools in an effort to help forge what he sees as the state's best hope: a new multiethnic assimilationism that could avoid the racial wars of the past.
"Asians and Latinos are intermarrying at 30, 40, 50 percent rates, so the reality of the melting pot is stronger than ever," Mr. Unz said. "But the ideology has been driven out of the public arena. Very few members of the media or politicians are talking in terms of glorifying and ratifying the melting pot, so whether assimilation is doing well or not depends a lot on how you define the terms."
When California joined the union 150 years ago, it was the nation's most diverse state, with a population of international adventurers drawn by the Gold Rush. But beginning with the Southern California real estate boom of the 1880's, Midwestern whites poured in, and ever since, the state has followed cyclical patterns of welcoming, and then rejecting, immigrants, from the Asian exclusion laws of the late 19th century to Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot measure sponsored by the Republican governor at the time, Pete Wilson, to cut off social services for illegal immigrants. Blacks have never been the presence here that they have in other large, industrialized states.
The current estimated population of 34 million includes 17.4 million non-Hispanic whites, 10.7 million Hispanics, 3.9 million Asians or Pacific Islanders and 2.3 million blacks.
Anxiety over immigration seems to have abated. By 1998, polls found that fewer than 10 percent identified either legal or illegal immigration as a major concern, and recent surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research group, show residents about evenly divided over whether immigrants are a benefit or a burden, with whites the most skeptical. In various surveys, Hispanics, who are expected to surpass non-Hispanic whites in total population by 2025 and become an absolute majority by 2040, express more optimism about the future.
"Optimism is alive in the barrios," said Harry P. Pachon, a political scientist who directs the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization with branches at the Claremont Graduate University and the University of Texas. "It is constantly being renewed by an influx of immigrants and however bad things are, relative to the home country, things are better here.
"The dispersion of a population of color throughout California means that white Californians now routinely see others who are unlike them," Dr. Pachon added. "So at a political level, the anti-immigration rhetoric has subsided. But nativist groups are sitting out there in the wings, and we can't underestimate how some of that is bubbling under the surface and may erupt in an economic downturn."
Nearly three million legal immigrants came to California between 1980 and 1994, and perhaps another two million entered illegally. Analyses are divided over the net costs and benefits, though a rough consensus suggests that the short-term costs have been high and the long-term benefits are potentially great, as new generations of immigrants assimilate and fuel the economy.
"This plurality that we have is what allows us to be so creative," said Maria Contreras-Sweet, the state's Mexican-born secretary of business, transportation and housing. "In Silicon Valley or wherever, as you're developing a product, you're doing so mindful of the different needs and cultural nuances of world markets."
The political implications of the change are hard to predict. Hispanics accounted for nearly all of the increase of one million registered voters over the last decade, and went from about 4 percent of the electorate in the 1990 gubernatorial election to 14 percent two years ago, while whites declined to 74 percent from 84 percent in the same period and blacks shrunk to 7 percent from 8 percent. The new Hispanic voters are predominantly Democratic, in what is regarded as a protest against Mr. Wilson and Proposition 187.
Yet in other ways, surveys show, including a recent extensive statewide sampling by the nonpartisan Field Institute of San Francisco, the overall ideology of Hispanic voters is similar to California voters on the whole, with nearly half calling themselves middle-of-the-road. On some issues, like abortion, Hispanic voters tend to be more conservative than other groups as a whole.
And though California is often celebrated as the crucible of trends, and other big states like Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois are on the road to becoming similarly diverse, demographers note that the nation will not catch up to California's diversity until midcentury, and even then small, interior states may remain disproportionately white.
"It's not the precursor for the rest of the country," said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Milken Institute in Santa Monica. "A lot of white, baby-boomer retirees are going to be moving to the Rocky Mountain West and the South Atlantic states and other high-amenity states."
But even some of the most pessimistic critics of California's experience find hope in the prospect of diversity and rising intermarriage.
"The California that I love is incipiently Hawaii," said Mike Davis, who wrote "City of Quartz" and other studies of the California dream's downside. "That's not to embrace multiculturalism, everybody in their little box, but to embrace all the leakage and the fact that the boxes don't work anymore. Here in L.A. you have this seashore that could be Polynesian, but it's been owned by Midwesterners for most of the 20th century who built this Puritan city on the edge of the Pacific. For generations, Hawaii's been trying to break out of that, and there's a real chance for that again this generation."

HEADLINE: Taking Stands and Taking Shots, Lazio Hops a Bus for Campaign Tour

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: SCHENECTADY, N.Y., July 3

 BODY:
Representative Rick A. Lazio began a five-day bus tour across the state today, balancing an effort to direct his United States Senate campaign toward issues against consistent attacks on his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
At times, he managed to do both. 
 After beginning his tour with a visit to a Long Island health clinic, where he called for more money for breast cancer research and took credit as the "point man in the House" on cancer issues, he labeled Mrs. Clinton's effort to come up with a universal health care plan a "monstrosity."
At times, he overlooked apparent incongruities.
At a rally in Yonkers before about 75 supporters, Mr. Lazio said Mrs. Clinton "can't get out of the motorcade" to empathize with drivers frustrated by high gasoline prices. But he did so while standing in front of his large, idling, customized campaign bus -- hardly a model of fuel economy -- which had just been escorted by motorized police through city streets.
Mr. Lazio, a Republican, is on his second such bus tour since beginning his campaign May 20. He is making the most of a Congressional recess after a few weeks of being largely pinned down in Washington while Mrs. Clinton went on the offensive with strident language on the stump and a barrage of attack television advertisements. She, too, plans a tour upstate later this week, as both candidates court voters in a region campaign officials see as crucial to victory in November.
Mr. Lazio's tour, orchestrated down to the kind of attire he will wear at certain stops, will include campaign staples like parade appearances, including three planned for Independence Day. But as he rides a bus named "Mainstream Express," he will also use campaign stops to highlight legislation he has sponsored or supported and make pointed contrasts to Mrs. Clinton. Mixed in will be traditional party rallies, like one here tonight that drew about 50 people to a park under a steady drizzle.
Mr. Lazio used strong language today, but some of the strongest words came from his surrogates, including Mayor John Spencer of Yonkers, a Republican who at the rally in his city railed against "elite Democratic liberals looking down the nose of the people of Yonkers."
And as he boarded his bus, Mr. Lazio's campaign aides blasted a snippet from a Ray Charles song, "What'd I Say": "Tell your ma, tell your pa, going to send you back to Arkansas."
In an interview, Mr. Lazio said he was merely reciprocating the negative campaigning that Mrs. Clinton had started, a claim the Clinton campaign disputes. "We were in the race for less than a month before she personally went on the attack and began airing these negative distortion ads," Mr. Lazio said.
He continued tonight, telling supporters at the Schenectady rally that "character does count," as well as integrity, without directly accusing Mrs. Clinton of lacking either.
Mr. Lazio's theme today was health care, and he toured a hospital in Suffern, in Rockland County, and a clinic in Brentwood, on Long Island, to speak on women's health issues. He referred to legislation he co-sponsored last year that provides Medicaid to poor women needing treatment for breast and cervical cancer. He counts the bill, which eventually passed, among his signature achievements, although House Democrats often assert that the Republican leadership stalled its passage.
Mr. Lazio also urged the passage of a bill he introduced last week that would continue financing for breast cancer research through the sale of postage stamps. "We need to make sure we put the foot on the research accelerator," he said in Brentwood.
Mrs. Clinton's campaign office issued a statement deriding Mr. Lazio's record on health care and criticizing him for not supporting a "patients' bill of rights" backed by Democrats last fall that would have allowed people more latitude to sue their health maintenance organizations over mistreatment.
"Carefully staged photo ops won't change the fact that Rick Lazio has committed legislative malpractice," Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, said in the statement. "He voted against a real patient's bill of rights, against a prescription drug plan that will cover all seniors, and voted to cut Medicare by $270 billion. For New Yorkers looking for real health care solutions, Rick Lazio's rhetoric is a bitter pill to swallow."

HEADLINE: With Light Show, Jersey City Hopes to Make a New Name for Itself

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, July 3

 BODY:
Call it a case of light-show envy.
Long overshadowed by its neighbor across the Hudson, this booming back-office hub will not allow itself to be entirely upstaged by Macy's 60,000 exploding rockets, most of which will burst just beyond the view of the 250,000 people expected to gather Tuesday night in Jersey City's Liberty State Park. 
 With millions of spectators oohing and aahing over the pyrotechnics on the New York side, Jersey City officials proudly plan to launch their own illuminated extravaganza Tuesday night, an eight-and-a-half-minute splash of psychedelic imagery projected on the facade of a new 10-story office building that faces Manhattan. The weeklong show, which was to begin tonight but was rained out, is to be visible each night from sundown until 1 a.m. It is the work of Rudi Stern, 63, a lighting artist who has collaborated with the likes of Igor Stravinsky, Timothy Leary and the Doors over a 40-year career.
But unlike parts of New York's fireworks display, which Jersey City's mayor, Bret Schundler, has loudly complained will be hidden from viewers in his city, Mr. Stern's illuminated projections are clearly visible to those on the opposite side of the river. "We're sharing our show with everyone," said Mr. Schundler, who is planning to run for governor in 2001. "We just wish they would share theirs with us."
Of course, Jersey City's "Theater of Light," as it is called, is not meant to compete with New York's fireworks display, which is being billed as the largest in history. It is a relatively modest affair, a $60,000 production that includes prerecorded music and a 50-foot-high kaleidoscope of hand-painted abstractions, which Mr. Stern describes as "a romantic voyage and visual story involving sensual shapes and forms."
The installation, using municipal money, says a lot about how this city of 238,000 is trying to reinvent and market itself, especially now that it is no longer an economic basket case. As its waterfront bulges with office construction, drawing scores of companies from Manhattan, Jersey City officials want to make sure that it does not end up as a staid collection of buildings best known for cheap rents, low taxes and nice views.
Stuart Koperweis, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said many prospective tenants tell him they have no interest in relocating to a sterile office park, no matter how enticing the rents are. "At this point, development is taking care of itself," he said. "Now, we have to let people know that Jersey City has all the amenities of a great city, including art and culture."
City officials boast about their special arts district, where rents are shielded from steep increases, and the old Jersey Loews, a 1929 movie palace once destined for demolition but now being restored as a nonprofit performance space. In an impressive sign that Jersey City is becoming more culturally relevant, workers broke ground in April on an $11 million museum to showcase the work of Jersey City artists.
Eager to raise his city's profile, Mayor Schundler said it was no coincidence that the light show was largely aimed at those living on the other side of the river. "With all the national media here for the Fourth of July, we're literally beaming our message to the world," he said.
"It's a chance for us to flaunt the artistic abilities of our citizens."
In that sense, it is especially fitting that the city has chosen Mr. Stern for its cross-Hudson flourish. Mr. Stern, a longtime resident of Lower Manhattan, moved to Jersey City last year after he was unable to find an affordable space to construct his sprawling light displays. Like the dot-com start-ups, accounting firms and investment banks that have fled Manhattan rents, Mr. Stern, who had never before set foot here, said he was surprised by what he found. "It's so diverse, so vibrant," he said.
This is the first time that Mr. Stern is trying to show his work on a building, and he said he was finding it hard to persuade all the tenants of 90 Hudson Street to turn off their lights or shade their windows after sunset. "With all the moldings and mullions, it's like projecting onto a crossword puzzle," he said. "If the facade isn't dark, it just doesn't look right."
Using nail polish and paint, Mr. Stern creates his images on glass and transfers them to Mylar scrolls, which are fed through 350-pound projectors with huge 6,000-watt bulbs. The result is colorful but understated. Those expecting a soul-shaking display of light and booming sound, he said, may be underwhelmed.
Across the river, Macy's officials expressed annoyance over Mr. Schundler's repeated claims of being snubbed, saying their fireworks would be visible from all points along the Jersey City riverfront. "They can see them bright and beautiful," said Ronnie Taffet, a spokeswoman.
Though she said she had not heard about Mr. Schundler's light show, she said it was in no way competition. "I'm sure it will be nice," she said. "But it just can't compare to 60,000 shells going off at once."

Voters in Mexico End A Monopoly on Power
Election returns showed that Mexican voters handed the opposition presidential candidate Vicente Fox Quesada a substantially more decisive victory over the governing party on Sunday than any poll had predicted. With almost all ballots counted, Mr. Fox had 43 percent, to 36 percent for Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the party that has governed Mexico for 71 years. But when the dust settles on the first democratic transition of power in Mexico's history, no major party, including Mr. Fox's center-right party, will control either house of Congress. A1
 
Mexicans seemed stunned but excited by Mr. Fox's triumph, and a feeling of empowerment echoed among people of many backgrounds. A7 

The Clinton administration welcomed the outcome, saying it was evidence of the maturing of democratic institutions in Mexico and would set the stage for economic growth. A7

P.L.O. Plan for Statehood
Leaders of the Palestine Liberation Organization decided in Gaza City that a Palestinian state should be declared by mid-September, whether or not a permanent peace deal had been reached with the Israelis. The move expressed general Palestinian frustration with the peace effort while also locking Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, into a tight, potentially explosive time frame. A5
 
Effort to Stem China Migration
The I.N.S. commissioner, Doris Meissner, met with Chinese officials in Beijing in hope of gaining a commitment for more help in stemming the flow of illegal immigrants. She said illegal migration by sea had been slowed but was rising by air, with 4,000 illegal immigrants from China expected to be sent back from American airports this year. A4

HEADLINE: THE MEXICAN ELECTION: Man in the News;
The 'Sell Me' Politician the Mexicans Bought

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 3

 BODY:
The confirmation of his election as president of Mexico was still hours away, the victory real only in the computers of his pollsters, but Vicente Fox Quesada was already three steps down the road. There would be a quick sip of Champagne, a victory speech, and then he would get to work.
"Right tomorrow I want to be working," Mr. Fox told an American journalist in between nonstop interviews handled over his ever-present cell phone. "My hobby is work. It enchants me. I thoroughly enjoy it." 
 Mr. Fox, who turned 58 on the day that Mexicans elected him the first president in the nation's modern history from an opposition party, is nothing if not a man of considerable ambition and energy. He is a politician who once told his political marketing strategist to "sell me" like any other product.
By background he is a rancher's son whose career has traversed business and politics. A manufacturer of cowboy boots and a former Coca-Cola executive, Mr. Fox entered politics by being elected a congressman and later was a governor.
But perhaps more than anything else, Mr. Fox is a maverick. In Congress half of his votes followed the line of his conservative, pro-business party. The other half were leftist positions, many of them backed by the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which he vanquished on Sunday night.
Even before his campaign began, he was careful to manage expectations. "Ending 70 years of dictatorship will be a great heroic exploit for Mexico," he said, "something like when you Americans put a man on the moon. Reaching the moon took a decade of work, and defeating the ruling party will also require lots of time, talent and money."
During the campaign, Mr. Fox sought to allay fears that turmoil might result were he to prevail by pledging to form what he has called a government of transition. After his victory, he reiterated those promises, extending friendly messages to his rivals and calling for unity.
Indeed, as governor of Guanajuato in central Mexico from 1995 until he resigned to campaign for president, Mr. Fox appointed a woman with ties to the PRI as his state auditor and enlisted the help of a member of the largest leftist party to devise programs to benefit rural women.
Undoubtedly the government he will lead will contrast sharply with those of the 13 consecutive PRI presidents before him, partly because he is likely to bring his business instincts to the job.
When he formed his campaign team last fall, Mr. Fox asked a headhunting firm to locate superstar executives to act as his top aides. He is unabashed at using marketing techniques for political communication.
"Look at me as a product, and figure out how to sell me," Mr. Fox said to Francisco Ortiz, the former Procter & Gamble marketing wizard he hired to direct his broadcast campaign, Mr. Ortiz recalled in an interview.
Although Mr. Fox ran as the candidate of the center-right National Action Party, he reached out to leftist intellectuals across Latin America, and in discussion groups he demonstrated considerable political flexibility, said Jorge Castaneda, a liberal New York University professor and author who lives here part-time.
"These people were from a different world, ideologically and socially, and he was learning how to get along," Mr. Castaneda said. "These were establishment and leftist intellectuals. They dressed differently; they liked different things. To put it mildly, he was not in his element. But he'd sit down and he'd manage."
Dick Morris, the American political consultant, who worked for Mr. Fox, said: "Vicente Fox is a phenomenon. This has not been a situation where the consultant runs the campaign. Fox has a chemistry with the people of Mexico that is beyond belief."
Born on July 2, 1942, in Mexico City, Mr. Fox spent his childhood on an 1,100-acre ranch in San Francisco del Rincon, Guanajuato, purchased during the Mexican Revolution by his paternal grandfather, an immigrant to Mexico of Irish descent.
His mother, Mercedes Quesada, was born in Spain, a legal impediment for Mr. Fox's eventual political ambitions until a clause barring the children of immigrants from serving as president was eliminated from the Mexican Constitution.
Mr. Fox has eight siblings. His father was a prosperous landholder, although not vastly wealthy in Mexican terms.
"Something I'm proud of is that I became good friends with the children of the smallholders and peasants," he wrote in a campaign autobiography. "With them I shared my infancy, my playthings, my house and my food. From that time I began to understand our country's painful inequalities."
A Catholic, he was educated by Jesuits and spent a year at an academy in Prairie du Chien, Wis., learning among other things how to speak fluent but accented English.
He could be the most unapologetically religious of Mexico's modern presidents. The governing party that coalesced after the Mexican Revolution of 1917 had a strong anticlerical bias, and the armies of the revolutionary governments that ruled during the 1920's carried out a violent counterinsurgency against Catholic rebels in the west-central region that surrounds Mr. Fox's birthplace.
Mr. Fox has expressed historical fascination with the legacy of the Catholic insurgents, known as Cristeros, and during his campaign often ended rallies with a Cristero war cry: "If I advance, follow me! If I stop, push me! If I retreat, kill me!"
If his predecessors have learned the country's local idiosyncracies as military men or as bureaucrats, Mr. Fox's sense for the texture of grass-roots life came as a route supervisor for Coke, working in six cities in seven years. After his transfer to Mexico City in 1971, he climbed to the top of Coke's corporate hierarchy, serving as its chief executive in Mexico from 1975 to 1979.
"What I hated most about those years at Coca-Cola was the time I had to spend dithering with the government," he said recently, recalling how the president would convene meetings of Mr. Fox and hundreds of other business executives to the presidential palace "so we could listen to a lot of foolishness."
In 1979, Coke offered to make Mr. Fox the head of its Latin American operations, which would have required that he move to Miami. Instead, he quit and returned to Guanajuato to work with his brothers.
While at Coke, Mr. Fox married his secretary, Lillian de la Concha, and the couple adopted four children. They were divorced in 1991.
The early 1980's saw many devaluations of the Mexican peso, and Mr. Fox has said that the harrowing experience of running a small business with a chaotic economy helped convince him of the need for political change.
During that economic turmoil, Mexico's opposition forces were achieving their first major victories in local elections in the north, and in 1988 dozens of entrepreneurs ran for Congress representing the National Action Party, including Mr. Fox.
He won, served one term and then ran for governor in 1991, losing an election marred by fraud. Four years later he won. Three years into his governorship, he began his quest for the presidency.

HEADLINE: A Few Ways to Spend $60 Billion

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In deciding whether or not we Americans should spend $60 billion to build an antimissile system (front page, June 30), two questions must be answered. 
 First, would it be able to destroy incoming missiles consistently? Qualified people, other than those who would benefit economically or politically from its construction, have expressed consistent skepticism.
Second, if peace and security are our goal, is military hardware the best investment? For example, might we live in a world of less risk if we invested the $60 billion in promoting primary education and public health in low-income countries, thereby improving living conditions and good will toward the United States?
For the sake of future generations, we should not permit this discussion to be framed and monopolized by the military-industrial complex, and the politicians who do their bidding.

HEADLINE: THE MEXICAN ELECTION: THE OVERVIEW;
MEXICO, VOTING IN NEW LEADER, BEGINS A POLITICAL SEA CHANGE

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 3

 BODY:
Swept to power by younger, better-educated voters fed up with corruption and one-party rule, President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada today began the transition from a republic led for decades by autocratic presidents to one in which political power suddenly seemed up for grabs.
As Mr. Fox fielded congratulatory phone calls today from world leaders, including President Clinton, and met with President Ernesto Zedillo, election returns showed that Mexican voters on Sunday handed him a substantially more decisive victory over the governing party than any poll had predicted. 
 With 93 percent of the ballots tabulated, the Mexican electoral agency reported that Mr. Fox had won 43 percent of the votes, while Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the governing party, won 36 percent and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist candidate, 17 percent.
Mr. Fox will take office on Dec. 1.
For many Mexicans it was still sinking in today that after 71 years, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which evolved from an alliance of revolutionary generals into a model nationalist party imitated across Latin America before degenerating into a clique of corrupt insiders, was finally deposed from the presidency.
But when the dust settles on the first democratic transition of power in this country's history, for the first time none of the major parties -- the deposed one, Mr. Fox's center-right party or the largest leftist grouping -- will be in control of either house of Congress.
At a news conference tonight, Mr. Fox said he had assured President Zedillo that he did not intend to carry out a purge of the government bureaucracy, at least in the first stage of his new administration. The two leaders agreed to meet frequently between now and December to plan next year's budget and to discuss the transition, Mr. Fox added.
"Our team will take office with creative ideas and new philosophies, but there'll be no change in federal work rhythms," Mr. Fox said. "Mexico will be a country on the move, headed by a government that keeps its commitments."
Mr. Fox will preside over a government unused to coalition politics but one in which all major business will require the consent of one or the other of his rival parties.
"All the parties are going to have to relearn the art of making politics," said Carlos Elizondo Mayer-Serra, a political scientist who is rector of the Center for Research and Teaching. "The fundamental pillars of Mexico's political system have changed."
These unsettled results were reflected around the country. Mr. Fox's National Action Party won the two governors' seats up for grabs on Sunday and will now govern in 7 of Mexico's 31 states. In Mexico City, the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or P.R.D., retained control of the mayor's office, but the president-elect's party took control of the City Council.
As president, Mr. Fox will face the ticklish task of meeting the hopes for quick and sweeping change of the diverse voters who backed him. He has promised, simultaneously, to modernize the economy and spur 7 percent growth, carry out political reforms and initiate an "educational revolution."
He has pledged to better the lot not only of the largely young, middle-class professionals in his own party, but also millions of poor urban workers as well as dirt farmers who have in the past supported the governing party.
"We've all got to get to work right away," Mr. Fox said in an interview early today after his triumph. "I want to be certain to deliver good results to the people of Mexico, to govern and to govern well."
The election results provoked a debate over how successfully President Zedillo's party would navigate its journey from its powerhouse position into the ranks of the opposition. Some said the party had already proven its adaptability and resilience in states where Mr. Fox's party had already won control of the governors' chairs.
But others, comparing the position of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, to some Communist parties in Eastern Europe, argued that without presidential support and control over federal patronage, the party would crumble.
Dulce Maria Sauri, the party chairwoman during the presidential campaign, quickly announced her resignation, and some party officials said they feared that it could be the first in a significant exodus.
The results of the elections to fill all 128 seats in the Senate and all 500 in the Chamber of Deputies indicated that Mr. Fox's party would finish with its powers significantly enhanced, mainly at the expense of the leftist P.R.D., with which it shared opposition powers during the last legislature. Still, it will not control a legislative majority.
The PRI lost the Senate majority it had enjoyed since the party's creation, and without the power of the president to coordinate its efforts, the PRI's entire legislative delegation will wield considerably less strength.
Mr. Fox's party was receiving 38 percent of the votes for Congress, the returns showed. The PRI was receiving 36 percent and the P.R.D. 18 percent.
As the ballot counting continued, Mr. Zedillo met privately in the presidential compound with the top PRI leaders. Aides said Mr. Zedillo had outlined his views of the challenge to the survival of the party, which had gone undefeated in presidential voting -- often through the simple exercise of its vast powers of patronage and public works and sometimes through outright ballot fraud -- for 71 years.
In a second encounter, Mr. Zedillo addressed the 21 of Mexico's 31 state governors who belong to his party, urging them to cooperate fully with Mr. Fox's government.
"The PRI is like the phoenix," Melquiades Morales, the PRI governor of Puebla, told reporters as he entered the meeting. "It will rise again from its own ashes."
If Mexico is entering absolutely new political terrain with the PRI's defeat, neither foreign nor domestic investors appeared concerned. The Mexican stock market surged 6.1 percent on news of Mr. Fox's victory, and the value of the peso, which had been battered in recent weeks as nervous Mexicans converted savings to dollars, climbed 2.7 percent.
"Investors are very enthusiastic," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, president of Ecanal, a Mexico City consulting firm. "The market is seeing Fox as a man who can bring important changes, in the sense of modernizing the economy and the system."
In the interview early today, hours after his triumph became apparent, Mr. Fox outlined his hopes to forge tighter relations with the United States, where he has traveled extensively and attended high school for a year, in Wisconsin.
"Fortunately, I know well the philosophy of the American people, because I've worked all my life there both in business and in politics," he said. "I know that we are going to be able to accomplish many things together. We can develop our great potential, which still stretches before us. I want to work intensely with the United States because it is the world's largest market. It's our neighbor. It's our partner."
Mr. Fox offered words of conciliation to Mr. Labastida and to Mr. Cardenas, after having traded extraordinarily harsh criticisms with both during the campaign.
Of Mr. Labastida, he said: "I send him my regards. I recognize his participation and his passion in defending his ideas."
In a victory speech, Mr. Fox said he would withdraw the libel suit he filed last week against his rivals, who had accused him, without providing documentation, of accepting illegal campaign donations from a Belgian company.
"Ours is going to be a government of national concord, a government of unity, a government with its eyes fixed on the future," Mr. Fox said.
President Clinton called Mr. Fox this morning to congratulate him on the election.
Several delegations of international observers praised the elections as well organized and free of fraud. Jimmy Carter called the elections "a turning point of great significance."
Analysts were puzzled about why Mr. Fox's victory was far more extensive than most surveys had predicted. Several polls had shown Mr. Fox and Mr. Labastida running neck and neck, but Mr. Fox won by a 9-point margin.
Stanley Greenberg, an American pollster who worked on contract to the PRI, said Mr. Labastida had failed to compete for young, urban middle-class voters.
"Labastida and the PRI simply had to attract votes beyond their longtime base in the rural areas," Mr. Greenberg said.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY: NOTEBOOK;
Rangers' Deal Falls Through

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS 

 BODY:
One of the Rangers' most perplexing problems this past season was that they could not seem to find a defenseman to play with the team captain, Brian Leetch. They were working on a possible solution to that issue yesterday, but Glen Sather's plans fell through.
Sather, the Rangers' new president and general manager, spoke yesterday to Mark Witkin, the agent for the free-agent defenseman Don Sweeney. Last night, however, Sweeney decided to re-sign with the Boston Bruins, with whom he has spent parts of the past 12 seasons. 
 As Witkin said earlier in the day, "Things change very quickly."
They sure did.
And so Sather's quiet summer stayed that way -- and may continue until next Monday or Tuesday, when Ron Low is expected to be announced as the Rangers' new head coach.
Low, a former goaltender, was Sather's coach for a spell in Edmonton, where he succeeded George Burnett during the 1995-96 season and continued through the 1998-99 campaign.
After Sather could not guarantee Low a raise for last season, Low stepped down and coached Houston in the International Hockey League. With Madison Square Garden's backing, Sather can now pay Low better. He is believed to have offered Low a deal worth about $700,000 annually. Low also interviewed with the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets last Wednesday.
"I'm in a no-comment mode," the 50-year-old Low said from his summer cottage in Manitoba yesterday. "Everything is in freeze frame. It's likely I'll be able to say something next Monday or Tuesday."
By then, Low could be speaking from a dais at his introductory news conference in Manhattan.
The team he inherits, right now, will look much like the one that failed to make the playoffs for the third consecutive season this spring. Unlike last season, when the Rangers went out and signed every available big-name free agent, it has been a silent summer in the hockey offices at Madsion Square Garden thus far.
Other than the June 1 news conference to announce Sather's appointment, that is.
Not that Sather isn't trying. Sweeney would have given Leetch someone to play with on a regular basis.
The Rangers were not the only metropolitan-area team interested in the veteran defenseman. The Islanders' Mike Milbury has always been high on Sweeney, who turns 34 on Aug. 17, dating to Milbury's days in the Bruins' organization, where he was a player, a head coach and an assistant general manager.
Milbury entered into negotiations with Witkin this week regarding Sweeney. But, according to one league official, the Islanders bowed out because Sweeney's asking price was above $2 million a season. Instead, the Islanders went younger and signed 29-year-old Kevin Haller to a three-year deal that averages about $1.7 million a season.
St. Louis, meanwhile, signed 30-year-old defenseman Sean Hill, who played for Carolina last season, to a four-year, $9 million contract.
Sweeney, a Harvard graduate with a degree in economics, was looking for figures closer to what Hill signed for. The Bruins, known for being tight with their purse, ended up giving Sweeney enough for him to stay. JASON DIAMOS

HEADLINE: SOCCER: NOTEBOOK -- 2006 WORLD CUP;
Brazil Pulls Out of Bidding Process

BYLINE: By ALEX YANNIS 

 BODY:
Brazil dropped its bid to play host to the 2006 World Cup yesterday and threw its support (and the votes of the two other South American representatives on FIFA's committee) to South Africa.
 England, Germany and Morocco are also under consideration, but recent acts of hooliganism by English fans at the European Championships have damaged that nation's chances, and Germany appears to have only the support of Europeans from among the five confederations of FIFA, the sport's world governing body. 
 A number of Brazilians, including PelE and JoAo Havelange, FIFA's former president, have said that Brazil was not ready to stage the tournament and urged Ricardo Teixeira, the president of the Brazilian confederation, to back South Africa in return for its support for Brazil to be host to the tournament in 2010.
 FIFA's president, Sepp Blatter, has been saying for months that the tournament should be held in Africa, preferably South Africa. The 24-member executive committee will vote Thursday at FIFA's headquarters in Zurich. A simple majority will win the bid, and South Africa could garner enough votes to win on the first ballot.
 "I am genuinely of the opinion that the World Cup must be awarded to Africa before long," Franz Beckenbauer, the leader of Germany's bid, said last month in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. "But is Africa ready now? I don't know. Let us organize the 2006 World Cup in Germany and then the next one in Africa."
 When the German Football Federation filed its first application in 1993, Havelange supported it, saying It has a strong economy, a stable currency, a great culture, an outstanding infrastructure, an exemplarily organized federation and large stadiums.
 Germany staged (and won) the 1974 World Cup during Havelange's first year as FIFA president. He was replaced by Blatter two years ago.
 
METROSTARS
 There is no longer any doubt about the MetroStars' turnaround; they have gone from worst to first in half a season. Even though they played their last game without the injured Lothar MatthAus and Thomas Dooley, the two veterans who are supposed to be the backbone of the team, the MetroStars have not lost in their past five games.
 After finishing with a 7-25 record last season, the worst in Major League Soccer, the MetroStars (9-7-2) are in first place in the Eastern Division, 3 points ahead of New England, after Saturday's 2-0 victory in Tampa, Fla., against the Mutiny.
 Matthaus (lower back) and Dooley (left hamstring) will most likely miss tomorrow night's game against visiting Dallas. But their injuries are secondary in the scheme of things because the MetroStars have enough good players to replace them this season.
 A healthy Tab Ramos has made a huge difference. The skillful midfielder has been playing with such gusto that there is talk he may be recalled by Bruce Arena, the United States national team coach, for the coming World Cup qualifying games. The first player to be signed by the league, Ramos has been playing better and better since his return last month from reconstructive surgery on his right knee.
 Ramos has not been the only MetroStars player drawing attention. Clint Mathis was named player of the month by the league yesterday after his three goals and five assists in June helped the MetroStars to a 3-2-1 record. Mathis, who was recently acquired from Los Angeles, is the first MetroStars player to be so honored.
 The league's annual Independece Day showcase will have 10 teams playing today, with the MetroStars-Dallas game the only one tomorrow. Four of today's five games will feature postgame fireworks. Last year's five games on July 4 averaged 46,238 fans.
 
GERMANY
 The coaching staff of the national team, which had a disastrous showing in the European Championships, needs a new vision and foreign influence to help rejuvenate the team. That was the consensus among Germans with authority and knowledge just hours after Rudi VOller was named as interim coach until Christoph Daum becomes free from Bayer Leverkusen and takes the reins.
 Voller has no coaching experience and even lacks the coaching license required in Germany to run a team. Franz Beckenbauer took over as coach under similar circumstances 15 years ago and led Germany to the World Cup championship in 1990 after losing the title game to Argentina in 1986.
 Voller, who played in Italy for several years, was a striker who scored 47 goals in 90 games for Germany. He was one of the key players in 1990, and he will be assisted by Bayern Munich's vice president, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, another former striker of the national team. Rummenigge will lead a task force to find an assistant for Voller.
Gunter Netzer, a former midfielder who is now a popular television commentator, is among those Germans urging the new regime to give the team less of a German look and reflect the country's multicultural makeup.
 Netzer and others have urged the country's governing body to follow France's example and allow players of different cultural backgrounds to join the national team. More than half the players on the French team that captured the World Cup in 1998 and the European Championship this past Sunday are children of immigrants, including Zinedine Zidane, the son of Algerian immigrants, who is currently considered the world's top player.
 Like France, Germany has a huge immigrant population, with nearly 10 percent of the country's 82 million people considered foreigners. Unlike in France, it is extremely rare in Germany for such players to be included in the national team, mainly because it is difficult to become a German citizen.
 
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS
 After their triumph over Italy in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on Sunday, the French made a triumphant entry into the heart of Paris yesterday for a welcome from tens of thousands of fans who chanted, On est champions! The players sprayed Champagne from the balcony of a hotel and flung T-shirts to the crowd.
 It was a significant day for some players. Emmanuel Petit was married, Zinedine Zidane shaved his already sparse head of hair on a bet and Robert Pires signed a four-year contract with Arsenal of the English Premier League. ALEX YANNIS

HEADLINE: President Kennedy's Plan for Peace with Cuba

BYLINE: By Richard Goodwin; Richard N. Goodwin was a White House assistant to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.

DATELINE: CONCORD, Mass.

 BODY:
We tried to exempt cigars," John Kennedy told me in early 1961 when I brought him the order that imposed an embargo on trade with Cuba, "but the cigar manufacturers in Tampa objected. I guess we're out of luck."
He was right -- I was out of luck. But not the president. Somehow he never seemed to run out of Cuban cigars. 
 The embargo was part of our continuing effort to overthrow Fidel Castro, one weapon in an arsenal that included assassination, sabotage of the Cuban economy, guerrilla infiltration -- a kind of state-sponsored terrorism.
None of it worked. The reason was simple. An overthrow required a strong, organized internal opposition. And that didn't exist. Indeed, we had helped neutralize it by our attempted invasion of the Bay of Pigs.
"I want to thank you for the Bay of Pigs," Che Guevara told me in Uruguay during an unexpected meeting at a party for a Latin American diplomat in 1961. "It solidified our rule and discouraged our middle-class enemies."
"You're welcome," I replied. "Now, maybe you'll invade Guantanamo."
"Never," he laughed.
At the height of the cold war, and with strong Communist movements in other Latin American countries, the unanticipated transformation of Cuba into a Communist outpost seemed a potential threat to our security. The policy of containment had broken down only 90 miles from Florida.
Yet little more than a year later, the withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba changed the atmosphere, and Kennedy dispatched an emissary to talk with the Cuban delegate to the United Nations, in hopes of laying the groundwork for some rapprochement.
Then the president died, and the embargo was frozen in place for four more decades, long after the reasons for it had evaporated. In this time, Soviet Communism weakened and tumbled. The Communist-led movements in Latin America disappeared. We welcomed trade with the Soviet Union and China. Yet through it all the embargo on Cuba stayed in place, the historical artifact of a cold war that had ended.
This anomalous policy owed its durability to Florida politics. A large and passionate exile community in Miami turned against any party and any politician who seemed willing to dilute our hostility toward the Cuban government.
President Kennedy had foreseen this when he made a futile effort to persuade new exiles to settle in other parts of the country. But they continued to come to Miami, and their intransigence and voting power threatened any presidential candidate with the loss of Florida's crucial electoral votes.
No president and no candidate for president was willing to take that risk. So for political reasons -- and only for political reasons -- the embargo has remained. And since Cuba was small and weak, politics could be allowed to determine policy.
Paradoxically, the embargo has only strengthened the rule of Fidel Castro, the lone surviving leader of the 60's, and enhanced his not inconsiderable stature in Latin America. A few years ago I went to a conference of Latin American leaders and functionaries in Cartagena, Colombia. When Castro entered the room, the audience of committed capitalists stood and cheered. And not for ideological reasons. He had stood up to theYankees and won.
To the extent he has become an almost mythical figure, that myth rests on his defiance of our hostility. There can be no doubt that opening Cuba to a flow of American business and travelers would have a wholly salutary effect on the life of that country. It would also greatly improve the prospects that the Cuban people will someday move toward a market economy and democracy.
That is, after all, the dominant lesson of recent history. The Cuban people have endured hardships and deprivation for decades. It is time to welcome them back into the American community, not grudgingly, but with the generosity of spirit that we like to think characterizes our nation.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: Battle of the Graduate Schools;
Law Gains Edge on Business, and No One Knows Why

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
With a swiftness that has surprised and puzzled educators, law schools have gained the advantage in their long tug of war with business schools for the attention of corporate America's future elite.
At virtually every top business school, the number of applicants fell last spring, and some of the numbers are startling. At the University of Chicago, they dropped 24 percent. At Cornell, the dip was 23 percent, and at Stanford, it was 18 percent. 
 As a result, it is considerably less difficult to gain admission to some business schools than it was a few years ago, and school officials have relaxed their requirements for work experience and stepped up overseas recruiting efforts.
Law schools, meanwhile, are enjoying their first increases in applications since the 1980's. Around the country, about 77,000 people submitted applications to begin law school this fall, up about 3 percent from the previous year. It was the second consecutive increase, reversing a string of declines that accounted for a 30 percent overall drop from 1991 through 1998, according to the Law School Admission Council.
Deans say they have no clear explanation for the trend, which comes after a decade in which interest in M.B.A. programs grew as rapidly as stock market values did. Top schools became so selective that at some the admission rates plummeted, to 10 percent or even less. At the same time, law schools became less selective, thanks to a growing perception that there were too many lawyers anyway.
Now, however, the tight labor market is causing companies to offer promotions and perquisites to retain young employees who otherwise would be considering business school. "The opportunities presented to someone like me are pretty compelling right now," said Brian D. Gale, 27, an equities trader in Boston who is trying to decide between going to the University of Chicago full time and working for a bank in Cleveland that has offered to pay his tuition if he enrolls in Chicago's weekend program. "It's difficult to take a timeout for two years. People are saying, 'I'll postpone it until there's a need for me to go back.' "
In fact, graduate programs of almost all types, from the humanities to the physical sciences, have received slightly fewer applications over the last five years than in the past, according to the Council of Graduate Schools. The number of people in their late 20's has decreased, and the strong economy has given them many alternatives.
Law schools have managed to defy the demographics, though. Unlike many business schools, they accept students directly from college, before the students have employers who are desperate to keep them. The law schools also seem to be benefiting both from corporate America's willingness to hire lawyers for a broader range of jobs than in the past, deans say, and from a heightened interest in public-interest work after a long economic expansion.
Nevertheless, the speed and the size of the turnaround for business and law schools defy easy explanation, administrators say. "Nobody I've talked to has come up with a really good reason for this, and we're all concerned," said Mary Miller, the associate dean for admissions at the Stern School of Business at New York University, where the number of applicants fell by 15 percent this year.
The flip-flop in the schools' fortunes is connected, graduate-school experts say, because both draw from the same pool: ambitious young adults who have decided against careers in specialties like medicine and engineering and opted instead for degrees that can be passports to wealth and success in just about any business field.
Last summer, the first warning signs that M.B.A.'s were losing some luster came as applications fell at schools that traditionally attract people interested in technology, like Stanford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
This year the bad news is widespread. In fact, the list of schools where applications dropped, and acceptance rates spiked, reads like a magazine ranking of the country's best programs: Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, M.I.T., Columbia, Michigan, Virginia, Northwestern, Duke. The declines are steepest among American applicants. Yale's business school appears to be the only big-name M.B.A. program with an overall increase each of the last two years.
Officials at the schools themselves tend to be among those who blame the hot economy. "Career prospects generally look so good now that a two-year investment in an M.B.A. may be hard for many to justify," said Richard L. Schmalensee, the dean of the Sloan School at M.I.T. Indeed, the combination of tuition costs and lost wages can easily exceed $200,000 over two years.
George G. C. Parker, an associate dean at Stanford, added, "There are a lot of people who feel things are moving so quickly that they don't want to stand on the sideline."
It doesn't help that managers at some large companies are discouraging younger workers from going to business school, in part because they cannot spare them in the current job market and in part because they want to keep them a safe distance from Internet start-ups.
Sally P. Lannin, the president of MBA Strategies, a firm in Edina, Minn., that advises applicants, said companies had become more reluctant to hire her to speak to their employees about how to get into a top school. "These organizations are really questioning whether they need to have these people go to business school because they're having such a hard time getting them back," said Ms. Lannin, a former admissions officer at Stanford Business School.
Some firms have responded by helping employees get their M.B.A.'s in part-time programs while they continue working. Starting in January, for example, Paine Webber will pay for N.Y.U. to send professors to the company's office in Weehawken, N.J., and teach night classes to about 20 of its most promising young employees. "This is totally related to the tight labor market," said Sue Emanuel, a corporate vice president for career development at Paine Webber. "We want to make this as convenient as possible for them."
Schools with higher acceptance rates have not been hit as hard, probably because they tend to attract younger students whom companies are more willing to let go, deans say. (There are no nationwide statistics for business schools because applications do not go through a clearinghouse, as they do for law schools.)
To get back on track, the most prestigious schools are relaxing some of the admissions guidelines they imposed at the height of their popularity in the 1990's. Cornell University, the University of California at Los Angeles and a number of other top schools have begun accepting applicants with only two or three years of work experience, people who would most likely have been rejected in the past.
Deans say their worry is tempered because they are still receiving far more applications than they need to fill a class. "There's still plenty of hot competition," said Daniel Bauer, the managing director of the MBA Exchange, an admissions consulting firm based in Illinois.
Administrators also note that the recent downturn in many technology stocks could make some companies less appealing places to work and leave their young employees more interested in M.B.A. programs. The number of Americans taking the business-school admission test increased slightly this year -- although turning test-takers into applicants is not easy in a strong economy, deans say.
Educators say the resurgence of the law schools is an even greater mystery than the business schools' slippage. Maybe, they speculate, the business schools had become so selective that some people gave up hope of getting in and sent their resumes to law schools instead. And no doubt the big increases in starting salaries that many law firms have introduced in the last two years, in part to hold onto their associates, increased the law schools' allure, administrators add.
The tight job market and the legal complications arising from new technologies are also opening up new opportunities for law school graduates. About half the consultants that Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey & Company now hire do not come from business school, for instance, and many instead hold a law degree, or juris doctor. "Increasingly, J.D.'s are becoming a surrogate for M.B.A.'s in business," said Trent R. Anderson, a vice president at Kaplan Inc., the test-preparation company, who has both degrees and who holds seminars for people thinking about applying to professional school.
America's unprecedented prosperity probably also plays a key part. Many young people were not in the work force in the last recession and assume they will never have to worry about money. As a result, some educators suggest, they have set their sights on higher ideals. "Potential students to business and law school think they want to make a difference," said Edward A. Snyder, the dean of the University of Virginia's business school, adding that most see the law as a better way to do so.
To be sure, gains in law school programs have not been as stark as the setbacks at business schools. Some law schools experienced big increases in applications over the last year, for example, but roughly half of the elite schools, including Duke, Harvard and Yale, registered declines.
Whatever erosion occurred, though, was generally slight and far less than the slide that characterized most of the 1990's. Applications to Duke, for instance, fell less than 3 percent last year, compared with a 37 percent free-fall from 1991 through 1996.
Schools that have booming numbers of applicants, like Columbia, Georgetown and N.Y.U., are suddenly much harder to get into. In 1991, for example, the law school at the University of California at Berkeley admitted just one out of nine among its 6,527 applicants. By 1997, when only 4,171 people tried to gain admission, about one in five succeeded. This year, after three consecutive years of application growth, the odds were closer to one in seven.
Herma Hill Kay, the outgoing dean of the school, says many professors think popular culture, as much as any economic factor, has a hand in the changing interest in law school.
"When it was going through the roof in the 1980's, people said it was because of 'L.A. Law,' " Professor Kay said. "When it was going down, people said it was because of the O.J. trial." These days, most people are not quite sure why it is on the rise again, she added.

Chart: "J.D. vs. M.B.A."
Business schools, which won out over law schools in the 1990's in the competition for talented college graduates, are now on the defensive as applications for law schools have turned up while those for M.B.A. programs have dropped sharply.

HEADLINE: Saudi Plan to Lift Oil Output Sends Prices Lower in London

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 4

 BODY:
Oil consumers might soon see some relief from prices that have surged more than 60 percent the last year after Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest producer, broke ranks with OPEC colleagues and pledged to pump more crude.
Benchmark crude oil prices in London fell $1.52 today, or 4.9 percent, to $29.58 a barrel after Saudi Arabia on Monday announced plans to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day. The move, which will go into effect as early as this week, is Saudi Arabia's third try this year to reduce prices that are among the highest since the 1991 Persian Gulf war. 
 The Saudi oil minister, Ali Naimi, said he wanted prices to drop to $25 a barrel, a level most members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agree is acceptable. Yet besieged by recent failures to stem oil's rise, Saudi Arabia is reasserting its role as the group's de facto leader, analysts said.
The United States, which provides military support to most Persian Gulf oil producers, has repeatedly called on OPEC to bolster output further, saying $30 a barrel is too high and threatens world economic growth. American drivers are experiencing record-high gasoline prices.
Other OPEC members today sought to assure traders that any new effort to open the taps further would be a collaborative effort, rather than Saudi Arabia acting unilaterally. Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC's secretary general, called all oil ministers today to discuss their reaction.
The new oil could be pumped within days though likely would reach American shores too late to relieve lean gasoline inventories during the summer travel season. Tankers take more than a month to complete the passage from the Middle East, meaning additional supplies would be available for the autumn heating season.

HEADLINE: Misery Index Of U.N. Panel Finds Africa Is Worst Off

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Africans south of the Sahara, an area convulsed in wars and weakened by natural disasters, also suffer the broadest range of social and economic disadvantages, a United Nations survey says.
The survey, the Human Development Report, examines the availability of schools, clean water and medical care, and whether people can play a role in politics. It began 10 years ago as an experiment to measure a nation's growth not by economic figures but by statistical profiles of its people and what they can expect from life. 
 This year, 30 of the 35 countries at the bottom of the index were in sub-Saharan Africa.
In that region, where the spread of AIDS and other diseases has begun to shorten life spans after decades of slow improvement, people can no longer expect to live beyond their 40's or 50's. Fewer than half go to school and fewer than half -- sometimes 25 percent or less -- can read, the survey shows. It also shows that a large proportion of people -- as high as 66 percent in the case of Sierra Leone -- lack access to clean water, and that even larger majorities lack basic sanitation.
Apart from Sierra Leone, which is ranked last, the other most disadvantaged nations, from the bottom up, are Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Chad, the Central African Republic and Mali.
At the other extreme, the countries with the highest human development indicators are, from the top, Canada, Norway, the United States, Australia, Iceland, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Japan and Britain. In the Western Hemisphere, only Haiti ranks in the bottom 35.
Every year the report, produced by the United Nations Development Program, focuses on new themes that experts say should be factored into studying why some countries remain poor and others grow in economic and human terms. This year the report tried to connect human rights and political freedom with economic and social conditions, saying the two can no longer be separated. It challenges the view that people are not "ready" for democracy until there has been economic growth.
"Human rights are not, as has sometimes been argued, a reward of development," said Mark Malloch Brown, the development program's administrator, in an introduction to the report. "Rather, they are critical to achieving it. Only with political freedoms -- the right for all men and women to participate equally in society -- can people genuinely take advantage of economic freedoms."
In another departure, this year's report, which was issued last week, calls for the increased collection and more effective use of statistics to aid in promoting human rights by quantifying more effectively the conditions under which many people live.
"Statistical indicators are a powerful tool in the struggle for human rights," the report says. Among other benefits even the simple collection of information can provide, it adds, is help in monitoring the actions of government and in curbing corruption.

HEADLINE: Report Weighs Benefits and Risks of Pill

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 4

 BODY:
A new report suggests that while women taking birth control pills -- even the newer, low-dose forms -- are at higher risk of stroke, that risk is outweighed by the contraceptive benefits of the pills. And in any event, the report in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association said, strokes are so rare in women of reproductive age that the increase is of little significance.
The low-dose forms, taken by most of the more than 10 million American women using oral contraceptives, contain less estrogen and are thought to be safer. Still, women taking them were nearly twice as likely as non-users to suffer a stroke, while women using higher-dose pills faced nearly a threefold risk. 
 The excess risk translates to one additional stroke yearly per 24,000 women for low-dose pill users and one per 12,000 women for higher dosages.
"The key is about whether this risk matters," given how effective the pill is at preventing pregnancy, said Dr. S. Claiborne Johnston, a co-author of the report and assistant professor of neurology at the University of California at San Francisco.
If oral contraceptives were replaced by condoms, about 687,000 additional unintended pregnancies would result each year, the study authors said. Some of those women would have abortions, and others would face health risks associated with pregnancy plus "major psychological and economic consequences" of unintended children, Dr. Johnston said.

BRITAIN: CURBING HOOLIGANS
The government proposed emergency laws to give the courts and the police power to restrict suspected soccer hooligans from attending domestic matches and prevent them from traveling to games outside England. With expected Conservative support, the bill should become law before the end of the month. More than 950 English fans were arrested in Belgium during the just-ended Euro 2000 tournament, and organizers threatened to evict England from the competition. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

BRITAIN: ROYAL FREEZE
Queen Elizabeth II's taxpayer-supported income will be frozen at $12 million a year for the next decade thanks to cost-cutting by her family and low inflation, Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament. The payout, called the Civil List, is reviewed every 10 years. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
GREECE: WITNESS PROTECTION
Witnesses to the June 8 terrorist attack against Britain's top military envoy to Athens, Brig. Stephen Saunders, left, will be given special protection, including third-country relocation, according to a government spokesman. Dimitris Reppas said the move "will pave the way for a string of ad-hoc counterterrorism measures" that Washington and the European Union have been urging Greece to adopt in its fight against terrorism. Anthee Carassava (NYT)
 
AUSTRIA: SANCTIONS REFERENDUM
Austria will hold a referendum in the fall on citizens' opinions of European Union sanctions. The curbs, more symbolic than financial, were imposed to punish Austria for letting the rightist Freedom Party into government. Citizens will be asked whether the government should push for an end to sanctions, which amount to a refusal by European ministers to meet their Austrian counterparts formally. Donald G.

Judges and prosecutors said the trial of a 93-year-old man indicted for aiding the Nazi killing of Jews could proceed despite a ruling that he was mentally unfit. A court said a medical commission had ruled that Kazys Gimzauskas, charged with aiding the NazI genocide during World War II, was unable to stand trial. The court said it would meet on Sept. 11 to rule on how to proceed. (Reuters)

BRAZIL: PRIEST WARNED ON CONDOMS
The Catholic church in Brasilia threatened to punish a priest for passing out condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS, highlighting an internal split among clergy in the world's most populous Catholic country over the Vatican ban. Warning of unspecified punishment, Archbishop Claudio Hummus condemned the priest's "incompatible" practice of passing out condoms to the poor in Sao Paulo. (Reuters)

SRI LANKA: CENSORSHIP BACK
President Chandrika Kumaratunga, invoking an emergency decree, has reintroduced censorship on local and foreign news media three days after a landmark Supreme Court ruling that censorship was illegal. The decree will cover whatever the government considers to be against national interests or detrimental to the preservation of public order, officials said. Censorship of war-related news was imposed under emergency regulations in May, but removed from foreign reporters a month later. P. J. Anthony (NYT)
 
KASHMIR: AUTONOMY REJECTED
The Indian Cabinet rejected a greater autonomy resolution passed by Jammu-Kashmir state lawmakers last week. The resolution would have restored the state's pre-1953 status, under which it had its own president, prime minister and courts. The federal government would have had control of defense, foreign affairs and communications. Similar autonomy demands were made by Assam in 1940, Punjab in 1973 and Tamil Nadu in 1974. P. J. Anthony (NYT)
 
JAPAN: CABINET SHUFFLE
Yoshiro Mori was reconfirmed as prime minister, a week after his Liberal Democratic Party won a much narrower than predicted victory in legislative elections. In what many analysts saw as a confirmation of his weak position, he immediately picked a new cabinet in which the most powerful economic and foreign policy positions were holdovers from his previous administration.

IRAQ: MISSILE REPORT RIDICULED
Iraq ridiculed a report in The New York Times that Baghdad had restarted its missile program and flight-tested a short-range ballistic missile, but did not say whether or not it possessed the missile mentioned in the report. The Times, which attributed the report to administration and Pentagon officials, said Iraq had carried out eight tests of a missile, including one last Tuesday, involving a ballistic missile that could carry conventional explosives or chemical and biological weapons. The missile does not violate United Nations restrictions. (Reuters)

CHAD: HABRE CHARGES DROPPED
A court in Senegal dismissed charges of torture against Hissene Habre, left, the former President of Chad who has lived in exile in Senegal since being ousted in 1990. Senegal's judiciary, which has been going through changes since a new president, Abdoulaye Wade, was elected in March, gave no reason for its decision. In February, Chadian and international rights groups took Mr. Habre to court. Norimitsu Onishi (NYT)
 
IVORY COAST: MILITARY PROTEST
Soldiers angry over pay took to the streets of Abidjan, firing in the air and leaving the commercial capital deserted. The military government led by Gen. Robert Guei, who seized power in a coup last December after an earlier protest by disgruntled soldiers, said the disturbances were started by soldiers who had been demanding $8,700 each for having supported the general.

Europeans Are Setting Merger Sights on U.S. Targets

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 4

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom has been that European companies, newly emboldened by a common currency and economic growth at home, would use Wall Street style tactics in crossborder deals unifying the Continent. But not following the script, European companies have increasingly set their sights on acquisition targets in the United States first.
From Vivendi's recent deal to acquire Seagram to Unilever's agreement to buy Bestfoods to Terra Network's buyout of Lycos, Europe is looking across the ocean before it looks across the street. 
 And with Deutsche Telekom of Germany strongly considering making a bid for Sprint, trans-Atlantic deal-making seems to be unlikely to stop anytime soon.
"European companies are in a pretty mad scramble to be global," said Donald Meltzer, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Credit Suisse First Boston in London. "You go where you can do the deals to achieve a critical mass. And acquiring control is still easier in the U.S."
To be sure, European companies have completed a handful of crossborder deals, including the largest takeover in corporate history, Vodafone AirTouch's $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann. That was supposed to pave the way for even more such takeovers, but now investment bankers are less sure about the potential for big crossborder European deals than they used to be.
In fact, in the last year it became apparent that many of the political and cultural roadblocks that were supposed to have disappeared were still up. Spain's largest telephone company, Telefonica, tried to buy the Dutch telephone operator Royal KPN in May, but was foiled by the Spanish government, which owns a controlling share in Telefonica and blocked the deal over political concerns. A privately proposed merger between Telefonica and British Telecommunications was also thwarted.
"In certain sectors -- telecommunications, banking, media -- there is still going to be nationalistic tendencies," said Daniel M. Dickinson, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions for Merrill Lynch in London.
Even intra-country deals have been stymied, exemplified in Germany by Dresdner Bank's recently failed merger with Deutsche Bank, and in Norway by the foiled marriage of two phone companies, Telenor and Telia.
Still, some investment bankers are not too concerned about the problems that have hung up European deals. "I think Anglo-Saxon tactics can be applied in Europe," said Simon Robey, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in London. Nonetheless, he added, "It's pretty natural to expect we'll see trans-Atlantic activity in all the big sectors."
Others have pointed out that the market for trans-Atlantic deals has expanded because investors in the United States are now more receptive to foreign acquirers. The stocks of many European acquirers are relatively high, enabling them to pay big premiums for American takeover targets. And European companies that want to increase their size quickly are inclined to go after American companies, which are usually much bigger, before looking at their neighbors. "The game at the moment is to do something strategically transforming," Mr. Robey said.
While trans-Atlantic mergers and acquisitions have increased recently, overall deal-making has actually slowed the last three months, according to statistics released today by Thomson Financial Securities Data, which tracks mergers and acquisitions. The global market for deals in the April-June quarter fell by 32 percent to $760 billion after a record-breaking first quarter of $1.121 trillion. Most of the decline can be attributed to activity from deals in the United States, which fell to $324 billion from $568 billion. European activity remained relatively flat at $298 billion, compared with $303 billion in the earlier quarter. Nonetheless, global activity for the first half of the year surpassed previous results with a total of $1.882 trillion in deals.
As Wall Street banks jockey to rake in the most deals, the race is tight, with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Goldman Sachs in a virtual tie at the top. Based on completed deals so far this year, Goldman is the leader, followed by Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse First Boston, J. P. Morgan and UBS Warburg. But based on deals announced so far this year, Morgan Stanley leads, followed by Goldman, the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup, Merrill and Credit Suisse.

A Film Prize And a Baby, Too
"I'm 39," said JOAN STEIN, who won the gold medal for the best narrative film at the Student Academy Awards last month, along with the Directors Guild of America's Student Film Award. "It's nice to be considered an up-and-coming young filmmaker and have everybody asking how old I am, but it's such an ageist industry. I don't feel old; I feel like I've worked hard to get to this stage in my life. I feel like the film reflects my life and experiences and thoughts and dreams."
The 25-minute film, "One Day Crossing," was her master's thesis at Columbia University. CHRISTINA LAZZARIDI, a screenwriter who graduated from the Columbia film program two years ago and who worked with Ms. Stein on "One Day Crossing," accepted the student award at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills, Calif. The $2,000 prize went to Spike Lee, Trey Parker and Robert Zemeckis early in their careers. Ms. Stein had to skip the trip to California: she is eight months pregnant.
Ms. Stein arrived at Columbia after three years in Budapest as a management consultant (her undergraduate major was in economics and her first master's degree was in business administration).
"There I was, living in Budapest and hearing about genocide and ethnic cleansing, being mortified what was happening," she said. "I started volunteering. We were organizing games, activities for the kids, and I started videotaping them. I met some filmmakers from Sarajevo who made me realize this was important."
"One Day Crossing" is about a family in Budapest at the end of World War II. "Although the film is a work of fiction," said Ms. Stein, whose parents lived through the war there, "the story behind it stems from experiences very close to my heart. I never really understood the inexpressible shadow that the Holocaust cast over me my whole life. The film is an attempt to make some sense of the experience for those who survived and those who didn't."
 
Voice of the Past, And It's His
"Today the theater looks to the young composers who may become the Youmans of their day," declares the voice on what is billed as a "bonus track" to the 1954 original-cast recording of "The Pajama Game," which was re-issued last month. The name "Youmans" would have been familiar to theatergoers 46 years ago: Vincent Youmans collaborated with everyone from George and Ira Gershwin to Oscar Hammerstein II and wrote the songs for "No, No, Nanette" and other hits.
The voice that read the sentence about Youmans sounded familiar, and sure enough, it belonged to MIKE WALLACE. The 57-second excerpt on the recording -- an interview with Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, who wrote the music and lyrics for "The Pajama Game" -- came from a radio program called "Stage Struck" that featured Mr. Wallace as the host. The interview was recorded in Boston, three weeks before "The Pajama Game" opened on Broadway (and 14 years before '60 Minutes' went on the air).
"I barely remember it," Mr. Wallace said the other day.
He said that Columbia, which re-issued "The Pajama Game" and four other original-cast recordings last month, had sent him the compact disks. "I put them on the shelf," he said. "Then I thought, come on, for Pete's sake, listen to them. I promise you, I had very little memory of the interview, it's such a long, long time ago."
"Stage Struck," he said, was broadcast on Sunday afternoons and covered productions that were bound for Broadway. "We would go out with the cast and cover what went on, either in New Haven or Philadelphia at tryouts, or at the recording of the album. It's so long ago, one of the people we chose as ingenue of the year and featured was Eva Marie Saint in her first appearance on Broadway."
Yes, but what about hearing himself again after so many years?
"You cover all kinds of things as you grow up," he said. "That was nearly 50 years ago."

Mexico's New Deal

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
When things went wrong for global capitalism in the 20th century -- and they often did -- they tended to go wrong first in Mexico. The Victorian version of globalization -- which depended either on colonialism, or on the support of domestic elites so disconnected from the local population that they might as well have been colonists -- began to fall apart in 1911, when Mexicans rebelled against the rule of the "scientific" dictator Porfirio Diaz. The cocksure optimism of "emerging market" investors in the early 90's got its first serious warning at the end of 1994, when Mexico plunged into financial crisis -- a crisis that proved to be a dress rehearsal for the terrifying Asian crisis that began 30 months later.
So Mexico's triumphantly free election on Sunday was cause for rejoicing, not just for Mexico, but for everyone who hopes that this time around we may be getting globalization right. 
 It's by no means clear that Vicente Fox Quesada was the better man. In terms of policy positions, he was virtually indistinguishable from Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (what a name!), or PRI. And Mr. Fox will face a sort of reverse version of the Nixon-goes-to-China effect, which may put him at a disadvantage as he tries to continue Mexico's opening to the world. As a former executive of Coca-Cola, he will have to be especially careful not to lay himself open to charges of Coca-colonization, of selling his country to foreign investors. As the candidate of a party originally founded to defend the privileges of the Catholic Church and oppose land reform, he will have to bend over backwards to show that his free-market policies are not just a way to make the rich even richer.
And yet his electoral victory is the best thing that could have happened.
The worst-case scenario was a narrow victory by the PRI -- a victory that would have raised understandable suspicions of fraud. A solid victory by Mr. Labastida might have been acceptable; but Mr. Fox's victory proves that Mexico's reformers meant what they said, that they really have been out to turn their country into a real democracy.
Need one point out that this is, among other things, a vindication for the North American Free Trade Agreement? Sophisticated supporters of Nafta have always acknowledged that the treaty would in itself produce only modest economic gains -- a few percent added to real income in Mexico, a few tenths of a percent added in the U.S. The real justification of the agreement was political: it gave Mexico's reformers an achievement to point to, a promise of better things to come. Some critics of Nafta jeered at this argument, claiming that Mexican reform was a sham, that the reformers themselves were merely well-spoken crooks -- a claim made more plausible as revelations emerged about the dealings of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. But now we know that, whatever the sins of Mr. Salinas, the reformers he brought to power were sincere -- and the reform was real.
More broadly, those of us who believe that globalization, while neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for democracy, tends to promote freedom have another success story to add to the list -- a list that now includes Korea, Taiwan, Chile, Argentina and more. When a nation opens to the world, its businesses become less dependent on government favor, its citizens become more aware of how politics is conducted in advanced countries. The result, repeatedly, has been a peaceful transition to true democracy.
Of course, such transitions are not automatic -- we still need heroes. And the hero of Mexico's transition is the current president, Ernesto Zedillo. Mr. Zedillo was an accidental president, a mild-mannered economist thrust into power when assassins gunned down the PRI's chosen candidate. His elevation raised the obvious questions: Would he become just another machine politician? Or would he simply be weak, allowing the "dinosaurs" to return to business -- including the business of stealing elections -- as usual?
But Mr. Zedillo was neither corrupted by office, nor a patsy for the corrupt officials in which the PRI still abounds. He insisted on a fair election. And he and his party have triumphed in defeat: the finest hour in the PRI's history was surely the moment in which it finally lost power.

HEADLINE: Mexico Stocks Rally Again; Europe Is Generally Weaker

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 4

 BODY:
Stocks in Mexico continued to rally today as investors showed enthusiasm for President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada, the opposition candidate whose victory on Sunday ended 71 years of rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party.
Deutsche Bank responded by naming Mexico the top pick in its Latin American portfolio, saying "as democracy is strengthened in Mexico, the economy will become a major focus of attention for investors." 
 After closing 6.1 percent higher on Monday, the Bolsa index rose 2 percent, to 7,520.04.
Stock markets in Europe were generally weaker today, brought down by telecommunications losses and weak oil stocks.
The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.8 percent, to 6,417.0; the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt traded flat at 6,958.99; the CAC-40 in Paris fell 0.2 percent, to 6,494.77; and the Amsterdam AEX was 0.2 percent higher, at 669.62.
Phone stocks declined after Stoxx Ltd., the company that compiles the Stoxx series of European share indexes, said it would recalculate the indexes beginning on Sept. 18 to eliminate shares that cannot be bought or sold by investors.
Alcatel and Telefonica led gains among companies that stand to benefit from the change, while France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, Munich Re and L'Oreal declined.
Saudi Arabia's decision to increase its output of crude oil in a bid to rein in rapidly rising prices pulled down the shares of BP Amoco and Royal Dutch/Shell shares. Continental European oil groups were more resilient, with France's Total and Italy's ENI rising slightly.
In Japan, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei stock average shed 144.51 points, or 0.82 percent, to 17,470.15, as investors sold shares to lock in profits from gains on Monday. The market reacted little to a Japanese central bank report showing further improved business confidence.
Shares closed higher in Hong Kong, but most investors were sidelined because of the Fourth of July holiday in the United States. The Hang Seng index finished up 0.69 percent, or 110.79 points, to 16,235.76.
Major currencies traded in tight ranges yesterday. The dollar slipped marginally in Tokyo as traders speculated that Japan's central bank might raise interest rates. The dollar bought 106.32 yen in late trading, down 0.02 yen from late on Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 105.68 yen.
In other currencies, the euro was traded at 100.80 yen, down from 101.16 yen late on Monday in Tokyo, and flat against the dollar, settling at 95.09 cents.

Consumers May See Higher Heating Bills This Winter
After a summer of high gasoline prices, consumers may be in for another shock this winter, as the rising cost of heating oil and natural gas threaten to make it significantly more expensive to heat American homes.
With demand for fuel and electricity soaring, natural gas prices have nearly doubled in the last year, to their highest levels in more than a decade. Heating oil prices have risen 10 percent just in the last month. This winter, many homeowners could discover that it costs at least 30 percent more to heat their homes than it did last year.

Of Parachutes and Software
Did you hear the one about the optimistic sky diver? No, this is no joke. Thomas M. Siebel, chief executive of Siebel Systems, a maker of e-business application software, compares sky diving to taking business risks. He also likens house painting to the software business. And he says that as a result of his Midwestern sensibilities and lessons about hard work and debt, he prefers real business attire for business dealings and hopes his employees never boast about all the Ferraris parked in their lot. The Boss. C6.
 
European Companies Eye U.S. First
The conventional wisdom has been that European companies, newly emboldened by a common currency and economic growth at home, would use Wall-Street-style tactics in cross-border deals unifying the Continent. But not following the script, European companies have increasingly set their sights on acquisition targets in the United States first. C4.
 
Crime News Site to File Chapter 11
APB Online, operator of a criminal justice news Web site that recently foundered, plans to file for protection for creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Last month, ABP Online laid off the staff and scrambled to find private investors to inject new capital into the debt-ridden company. The bankruptcy filing, which the executives of APBnews.com said they would announce as early as today, is designed to provide a little more breathing space for the site. C5.
 
Record Delays in June for Airlines
June appears to have been the worst month in domestic airline history for delayed flights, preliminary statistics from the Federal Aviation Administration indicate. In general, bad weather accounts for about 70 percent of flight delays, which are the bane of business travel. The big question now is whether the trend will continue as record numbers of passengers crowd onto planes. Joe Sharkey: Business Travel. C2.

HEADLINE: Steep Rise Is Forecast for Winter Heating Bills

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
After a summer of high gasoline prices, consumers may be in for another shock this winter, as the rising cost of heating oil and natural gas threaten to make it significantly more expensive to heat American homes.
With demand for fuel and electricity soaring, natural gas prices have nearly doubled in the last year to their highest levels in more than a decade. Heating oil prices have risen 10 percent in just the last month. This winter, many homeowners could discover that it costs at least 30 percent more to heat their homes than it did last year. 
 Even with a new pledge on Monday by Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil exporter, to increase production to help reduce global petroleum prices, the effects of such a move on American energy costs remain unclear at best.
"What you need to fear is the double whammy," said Steven Parla, a natural gas analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "That's when prices rise 30 percent, and it's cold, so you use 40 percent more gas."
While the prices of all fuels have risen recently, natural gas is affected by a variety of factors, including its use in electric power generation and in heavy industry, in addition to home heating. Used in power plants in summer to churn out electricity to keep air-conditioners working, natural gas warms slightly more than 50 percent of United States homes in winter, mainly in the Midwest, Sun Belt and Rocky Mountain states, according to 1997 Census figures.
More than 90 percent of new houses in the United States are outfitted to use gas, according to Keyspan, the supplier of natural gas to much of New York City and Long Island. Only about 10 percent of homes burn heating oil, a large proportion of them concentrated in the Northeast, where oil prices rocketed last winter during a stretch of bitter weather.
Closer to winter, rising heating fuel prices are likely to generate political controversy, much as gasoline prices have done recently. Consumer anger over gasoline prices especially in the Midwest, has made the cost of energy an issue in the presidential campaign and led to Congressional hearings and federal inquiries. Already, Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, backed by the Northeast-Midwest Congressional coalition, has asked the Federal Trade Commission to monitor the increases in heating oil and natural gas. The F.T.C. declined to comment on the request.
The price increases have been caused by an imbalance between supply and demand that probably will not right itself soon.
Energy usage is an important indicator of an economy's health. United States industry uses prodigious amounts of oil, gas and electricity each year, while consumers are buying larger houses and cars and other products that demand more fuel. At the same time, critics of the government charge that a series of Republican and Democratic administrations has failed to construct a sound energy policy to take into account shifts in demand and the complexities of the supply of oil and gas. Now, the Clinton administration and Congress are scrambling to find ways to undo or slow the increase in fuel prices.
"When it comes to energy, we only seem to wake up when there's a crisis," said Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, an energy watchdog group in Long Island.
High fuel prices have yet to slow the economy, and adjusted for inflation, domestic prices are still much lower than can be found in the rest of the world.
Wholesale heating oil prices are now at about 84 cents a gallon, compared with 49 cents a year ago. Wholesale natural gas prices are now at about $4.44 for a million British thermal units, compared with $2.39 one year ago. Some analysts say that natural gas prices will fall, while others contend that they have yet to peak.
A decision to cut back production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last year spurred the ascent of crude oil prices, which helped push up heating oil prices. At the same time, demand blossomed. Refineries usually begin in summer to store distillate, which includes heating oil and diesel fuel. But this year, surging demand for diesel has drawn distillate out of refineries as quickly as it flowed in, analysts say.
To worsen matters, a refinery in Kuwait that supplies a disproportionate amount of distillate to world markets was damaged by an explosion last week, which markedly reduced supply at a time of rising demand. The Energy Department reported last week that inventories of distillate were 21 percent lower than last year. This situation was unlikely to change even with the Saudi Arabia announcement on Monday about higher production.
Stocks of natural gas are also 10 to 15 percent below levels a year ago. The shortfalls are partly the result of conditions over the last couple of years, when oil and gas prices were so depressed that few energy companies were drilling for new supplies. As prices rose for oil and gas, however, companies speedily resumed drilling. There are 65 percent more active drilling rigs in North America than a year ago, and 75 percent of them are for natural gas, according to the Natural Gas Suppliers Association, a trade group.
Natural gas is used in manufacturing by its primary consumers, heavy industry, including steel and fertilizer producers. But natural gas prices are also reacting to shifts in electricity generation and to increases in power consumption.
About 25 percent of the country's current energy needs are met by natural gas. That proportion is expected to grow to 27 percent to 28 percent in about three years, which analysts say is a huge jump, driven mainly by the use of natural gas in new power plants. Stricter environmental standards for clean fuels have also led to more utility use of natural gas. Ninety percent of power plants to be built over the next decade expected to run on the fuel.
Many so-called peaking plants, which provide additional power during periods of particularly heavy demand, already run on natural gas. And those periods have grown more frequent and intense. Summers are longer and hotter, and more homes use air-conditioning. Natural gas not only fires the electricity to run commercial air-conditioners but because the gas itself is cold, it often serves as a coolant for the air-conditioning unit itself.
"It's double demand," said Donato Eassey, natural gas analyst with Merrill Lynch. He explained that the accouterments of the new economy demand more electricity. "All the laptops, cellular phones, Palm Pilots we use require a huge back office to run them, which requires a lot of energy, and then they need energy for air-conditioning to keep those systems cool."
Such summertime demand has kept natural gas stocks low and pushed prices higher, analysts say. Through summer and into autumn, when utilities adjust their rates to reflect higher use and fuel prices, consumers will have to settle up. Some electricity providers, like Con Ed in New York, have already warned customers about increases in their electricity bills because of increased demand and costlier fuel.
Despite higher gas prices, Americans continue to drive as much as before, and they are expected to heat their homes as warmly as always, albeit with some consternation.
"We don't like it, and there's no reason why supply should be so diminished," said Ben Whitley, 48, who paid about $130 a month last winter to heat his Atlanta home with natural gas.
Steep energy prices would hurt low-income Americans, however, especially those on a fixed income. A 78-year-old retiree, Lillian Drummond and her husband live in Chicago, where gasoline exceeds $2 a gallon. With a combined monthly income of $1,500, they count every cent paid for the gasoline they use to drive to the doctor a few times a week. Last winter, the couple spent about $100 a month on natural gas to heat their small, brick one-story house and were spared even steeper payments by the mild weather.
Mrs. Drummond said she did not know how she or her many neighbors who scrape by every month would pay higher heating bills this year. "It would be terrible, because I don't know how we would handle it. We barely manage to save anything now," she said. "We keep the thermostat at 60 degrees in the winter and stay under the covers. Any lower and we would freeze."
High natural gas prices have also begun to frustrate, even erode, certain industries. Steel makers, for example, are scrambling to cut expenses to offset the cost of firing their furnaces with natural gas. About 70 percent of the cost of making nitrogen-based fertilizers, among the most widely used in agriculture, is from natural gas. Already weakened by months of low prices worldwide, some United States fertilizer plants have been forced to close or downsize drastically because of high natural gas costs.
Some analysts believe prices of heating oil and natural gas will gradually slide as supply catches up with demand. They point out that the renewed drilling will send more gas into the market. But others caution that the benefits of increased production will only be felt deep into the winter, in January or February at the earliest.
"Gas companies say they thought they are behind in filling supplies, they can catch up," Mr. Eassey said, "but from what I see, I'd argue that every day they are falling farther behind."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Convalescing, Japan Debates A Rate Rise

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 4

 BODY:
Faced with growing evidence that the Japanese economy is gaining momentum, the country's central bank could decide later this month to raise interest rates from their near-zero level. Such a move would be the first increase in Japanese rates in a decade.
The latest sign of economic strength came today with the bank's closely watched quarterly survey of business sentiment, known as the tankan, which showed that big Japanese manufacturers were more confident of their future business prospects in the quarter ending on June 30 than they have been in three years. 
 "The strength of the tankan means the probability is now quite high for a rate hike," said Masaaki Kanno, a senior economist at J. P. Morgan in Tokyo and a former official at the central bank. "But it's hard to say whether that's a good or bad thing at the moment."
Indeed, the tankan survey was in many ways a tale of two economies, the global and the domestic, making it hard to draw overarching conclusions from the data.
While executives at Japan's large corporations were feeling more confident, their colleagues at smaller businesses remained gloomy. That difference in sentiment will complicate the central bank's decision on interest rates, which is likely to be the hottest topic of discussion among the nine policy board members at their next meeting on July 17. The central bank governor, Masaru Hayami, has made it clear that he favors raising rates as quickly as possible, and at least two other members of the policy board have supported him.
The bank lowered short-term interest rates virtually to zero a year and a half ago, when significant parts of Japan's financial system seemed at risk of collapse and the threat of severe deflation loomed large. But in the process, the bank deprived itself of its most valuable tool, the ability to use interest rates to influence the economy.
While many economists and policy makers agree that bank officials did the right thing, opinions about when and how the bank should go about recreating a more normal interest rate environment diverge widely.
There is as yet no clear consensus that the budding economic recovery can flourish on its own, and the tankan survey results did little to resolve the debate.
Big companies reported that they intended to increase their capital investment by 4.6 percent on average in the current fiscal year, ending in March 2001, but smaller companies said they would be cutting their spending -- and even more sharply than they projected in the previous quarter, from January through March.
Economists say that difference speaks volumes about the strength of the nascent recovery in Japan's economy, the world's second largest.
Larger corporations have been able to rely on demand in Europe and the United States to increase business. Were they solely reliant on the domestic economy, like smaller companies and service businesses, they too might be less optimistic about the future.
Big multinationals also have less need than small companies do for the short-term financing that would become more expensive if the central bank raised interest rates. Indeed, a surge in profits has enabled many large companies to go on a spending spree using their own cash, as reflected in a continuing decrease in bank lending in this country.
"The big guys that rely on export markets are doing great," said Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company in Tokyo, "but the domestic service sector and small and midsized companies that do most if not all of their business domestically are only a little better than stagnant. The question for the bank thus becomes whom do you run the bank for."
Higher rates and borrowing costs for companies might curtail their investment activities or even accelerate the pace of bankruptcies. "My view is that raising rates would kick off a recession," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter here.
But others consider such concerns overblown because the central bank is not likely to raise rates above 0.25 percent. "The increase in borrowing costs should have only a small impact on economic activity," Mr. Kanno of J. P. Morgan said. "Bank lending is declining anyway, and capital expenditures are increasingly financed internally."
The central bank has not laid out guidelines, like inflation targets, that would help steer its decision making and increase understanding of its intentions. It has said that the low rates are meant to help stimulate the economy by keeping the cost of borrowing down. But low rates may also be contributing to a deflationary chain of lower prices, wages and profits.
Consumer prices in Japan are currently falling at the fastest rate in the last decade. Moreover, the prices that manufacturers can charge for their goods are falling much faster than the prices of their raw material and other costs, eroding profit.
Central bank policy board members argue that much of this is "good deflation," but they have yet to produce convincing evidence.
The finance ministry is also making things difficult for the bank in setting a clear policy. The ministry, another center of financial power in this country and often a rival, is using its authority on intervention in the currency markets to send a clear message that it does not favor raising interest rates. It has ordered the central bank to intervene to keep the yen from rising more than 10 times this year. Such intervention tells the market that rates are unlikely to rise, since a rate increase would itself put upward pressure on the yen.
At times, the bank seems confused about its role. Like most central banks, its legal mandate is to maintain price stability. But lately, some policy board members have expressed concern that a "moral hazard" is emerging from the exceptionally loose monetary policy. They fear that by holding rates effectively at zero, they have enabled corporate Japan to avoid the painful overhaul it needs.
"I understand, and in some ways agree with the concern about moral hazard," Mr. Feldman said. "But the bank is not in charge of structural policy, and anyway, using interest rates to influence structural reform is sort of like using a hammer to hit a screw."

HEADLINE: Immigration Injustices

 BODY:
With unemployment rates at a 30-year low and strong growth in the high-tech sector, many technology companies are hard pressed to find enough programmers and other skilled workers to meet their needs. One way industry has dealt with the labor shortage has been to hire skilled foreign workers who are allowed to come to this country under special, temporary H-1B visas. But now demand for skilled workers is outstripping the number of such workers allowed in each year by statute. Congress needs to raise the visa cap temporarily to ease the shortages. It should also correct some severe injustices in the immigration laws that have hurt immigrants who have been in this country for more than a decade.
Under current law, H-1B visas, which permit foreign workers to stay in the United States for upto six years, are capped at 115,000 for fiscal year 2000 and will decline to 65,000 in 2002. There is bipartisan support in Congress to increase that cap for a limited time. One reasonable proposal, sponsored by Representatives David Dreier, Republican of California, and Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, would increase the cap to 200,000 visas per year through 2003. Their bill would set aside a number of the visas for nonprofit research institutions and would require that 60,000 visas be reserved for people with advanced degrees. The proposal would also increase the visa application fee to $1,000 from $500 and direct the money toward job training and education programs. 
 The Clinton administration supports a temporary increase in the visa cap, but with higher fees than the Dreier-Lofgren plan. It also wants Congress to correct some other immigration problems.
In 1997, Congress granted permanent residency to Nicaraguan and Cuban refugees who fled oppression by their leftist regimes in the 1980's. But it granted only lesser forms of relief to Guatemalans and Salvadorans who fled right-wing regimes, and it neglected Haitians and Hondurans. Congress should dismantle these distinctions and allow Central American refugees to apply for permanent residency on an equal basis.
Congress should also cure a legal mess left over from the 1986 immigration overhaul. At that time Congress granted amnesty to illegal aliens who had been in the country before 1982. But some 300,000 people were improperly denied the opportunity to apply for amnesty by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Years of litigation followed, with the courts ruling in favor of the immigrants. Then in 1996, Congress stripped the courts of jurisdiction over these cases, leaving these immigrants, a great number of whom had been granted work authorization, in legal limbo. A sensible bill now pending in Congress would allow these individuals and other similarly situated people who have been here since the mid-1980's to stay permanently.

HEADLINE: Cuba Sees Fervor Over Elian Useful in Other Battles

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: HAVANA, July 4

 BODY:
Now that Elian Gonzalez is home and has begun to reclaim his young life, officials say that it will be a challenge to sustain the emotional commitment Cubans had to that case as the government presses its latest battle with the United States over its trade embargo and immigration policy.
The embargo and the Cuban Adjustment Act are emerging as the centerpieces of a post-Elian era, and officials intend to continue the public rallies and televised discussion that were a staple of daily life throughout the seven-month custody battle over Elian. But in an acknowledgement that the issues are different, Ricardo Alarcon, the president of the National Assembly and the main adviser to the Gonzalez family, said the events would be scaled down somewhat. 
 "Do you ask if there can be the same emotional level? No," he said in a 90-minute interview on Monday. "You cannot ask people to have the same emotional level about a boy without a mother, separated from his father, for a discussion of the adjustment law. It is more abstract."
Still, Mr. Alarcon, who was the highest-ranking Cuban official to greet Elian when he arrived at Jose Marti International Airport last week, said the public events staged on behalf of Elian had proved useful in mobilizing people and reaching out to Cuban youth. It was an opportunity, he said, born of the campaign by Cuban-Americans and their Congressional supporters to keep Elian in Miami after he was rescued from an inner tube last Thanksgiving.
"They gave it to us on a silver platter," he said. "This is a battle of ideas that we appreciate clearly. This did not begin in November or in the first days of December. The denunciations started with Elian, and at that time we did not think it would go so long. But those seven months have allowed us to discover new forms, methods and actors, and a lot more youth, above all. Why stop that when there are so many problems to resolve?"
Those problems, officials contend, stem from the economic havoc wreaked by the embargo and are exacerbated by policies that allow Cubans who reach American soil to apply for asylum. Others, including ordinary Cuban citizens, feel the real problem is a lack of enthusiasm for the revolution among a people who have been fed a diet of slogans while adjusting themselves to the daily struggle of inventing ways to resolve their personal economic crises.
Mr. Alarcon said it was "simplistic" to believe the rallies were intended to revive the revolution's flagging domestic appeal. But he acknowledged that Elian's case had intense support among the young, who have been featured players in the rallies and other events.
"The youth will continue to be the protagonists, but that is the march of life," he said of the new campaign. "Elian touched almost all the youth. Elian was 5 years old. His mother, Elisabet, was around 24. His father Juan Miguel was 31. The grandparents are in their 50's. They were children at the triumph of the revolution."
He said that the public support for Elian paid off with his return, which he said some young people likened to Jan. 1, 1959, when Fidel Castro and his revolutionaries took power.
"For the youth, Jan. 1, 1959, was something they read about of their parent's generation," he said. "This is theirs. We speak about how youth are into other things. But no one could imagine how the events here firmed up people of both generations."
Cuban officials want to capitalize on that attention, although at a rally in Manzanillo last Saturday many there seemed to be going through the motions, waving flags during speeches filled with familiar scorn for American policy. Just in case, officials have reduced the time of the televised discussions to one hour and 45 minutes from two hours, as well as freeing up one of the country's two state-run television stations for regular programming. In the interview, Mr. Alarcon took issue with how a recent Congressional agreement allowing American food sales was portrayed as a softening of the embargo. He insisted it would make sales of wheat and rice more difficult unless American banks are allowed to finance the transactions and ships are allowed to make deliveries without being penalized. Currently, ships cannot dock at American ports for six months after going to Cuba .
As officials turn their attention to the new priorities of trade and immigration, the Gonzalez family may find it difficult to attain its own goal of being a normal clan. For now, they are in a seaside Havana home, where Elian and some of his classmates are wrapping up their first-grade studies before going off on a vacation with the eventual plan being that the Gonzalez family will return to its hometown of Cardenas.
In recent weeks, the government media has been filled with praise for Juan Miguel and Elian as model citizens, raising the question of whether greater things are in store for Mr. Gonzalez.
"Juan Miguel will be able to do whatever he wants," was all Mr. Alarcon would say about the future. "He was a normal person who was turned into something else. Returning to what he was before will not be easy."

HEADLINE: As U.S. Debate Intensifies, Pay for Teachers Rises 3%

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 4

 BODY:
Beginning and average teacher salaries rose more than 3 percent last year, but they still fell short of earnings by other college-educated workers and, adjusted for inflation, remain below teacher salaries from 1972, according to a survey released today by the American Federation of Teachers.
The average annual paycheck for first-year teachers in 1998-99 was $26,639, while teachers with an average of 16.2 years on the job earned $40,574, the survey showed. New Jersey, Connecticut and New York led the nation for average teacher pay, around $50,000, while Mississippi and the Dakotas had the lowest average salaries, below $30,000. Among cities with more than 100,000 residents, Yonkers had the highest starting salary for teachers at $37,045. 
 "It's clearly, I think, a national emergency," Sandra Feldman, head of the teachers federation, said at the union's biennial convention. "We have to ask ourselves, What are our priorities here as a nation?"
Although the union has been conducting the salary survey for a half century, this year's release comes amid an intense national debate over how teachers should be compensated. Facing a national shortage of some 2.5 million teachers over the next decade, school administrators and state legislators have been searching for creative ways to recruit and retain high-quality people.
Alabama recently enacted a law that will bring its salaries up to the national average by 2007 (provided that tax revenues remain flush). The governors of California and New York are essentially engaged in a bidding war, offering tuition reimbursements, home loans and incentives for advanced certification. Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has suggested strong involvement by the federal government, with $5,000 or $10,000 signing bonuses for teachers who agree to work in hard-to-staff schools.
Meanwhile, six states and about a dozen local districts are experimenting with various types of merit-pay plans for teachers. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley has suggested making teaching a year-round profession -- automatically increasing the pay by about 20 percent for the added time at work.
"I think we're seeing state legislators in a growing number of states, and governors in a growing number of states, being willing to do something about it," said Robert Chase, president of the National Education Association, the other major teachers union, which expects a contentious debate over pay-for-performance at its convention this week in Chicago. "We're seeing the kind of movement we want to see. Hopefully it will expand."
Over the past year, Connecticut and the District of Columbia each raised starting salaries for teachers more than 10 percent, the American Federation of Teachers survey showed, while Alabama's first-year pay rose 9.2 percent, Iowa's 8.2 percent, and Minnesota and North Carolina both more than 7 percent. Overall average salaries also shot up 11.3 percent in North Carolina, 9.1 percent in Alabama, and 7.9 percent in the District of Columbia.
"It's just not high enough," Ms. Feldman said. "If it were, we would be able to fill all the teaching vacancies."
Alaska was the only state where the average salary dropped, down 1.8 percent to $48,275. The starting salary dropped $10 in North Dakota, to $19,136.
Still, the starting salary for teachers has not recovered from its inflation-adjusted high of $26,880 in 1972, and remains just 72 percent of what average college graduates expect to earn in their first jobs. Comparing mid-career professionals with similar experience, teachers earn 59 percent as much as engineers and attorneys, 61 percent of the salary of computer analysts, and 82 percent of accountants' pay, according to the teachers federation.
"I made a lot more money as a pretty bad salesperson than I do as a pretty good teacher," said Julie Blaha, 30, a first-year math teacher in Anoka, Minn., who spent the previous five years selling steel.
Steve Ray, a history teacher at Lincoln High School in Yonkers who is president of the union's local, said he had seen a change in the quality of teachers as the school system has increased salaries some 50 percent over the past decade.
"Before, if you couldn't get a job elsewhere, you came to Yonkers," Mr. Ray said. "The new teachers we've been hiring over the last six to eight years are top-quality people who look at Yonkers as somewhere they want to spend their careers."
While Yonkers previously lost teachers to the surrounding Westchester suburbs and even New York City, "now you almost have a flip-flop," Mr. Ray said.
New York City's starting salary of $30,265 -- 18 percent below that of Yonkers -- ranked 23rd among the 100 large cities. "For New York City experienced teachers," he said, "coming to Yonkers is a promotion."

HEADLINE: Struggling Hudson River Village Seeks Rebirth as a Tourist Haven

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: HAVERSTRAW, N.Y., July 4

 BODY:
An odd coalition of idealists and entrepreneurs, ranging from the novelist Toni Morrison to a powerful Westchester County developer, has a vision. The goal is to turn this tattered village with a whopping view of the Hudson River into the next Piermont or Nyack or Cold Spring -- Hudson Valley towns that draw throngs of well-heeled tourists in search of small-town charm and inessentials like potted topiaries and pumpkin butter.
But Haverstraw needs more than a nip and a tuck. The 2.2-square-mile village in Rockland County, once a thriving river town and the self-proclaimed brick-making capital of the world, went into a steep decline after the emergence of skyscrapers killed the demand for brick. There are now far more bodegas than boutiques, and many of the Hispanic residents, who make up more than 60 percent of the population of about 9,400, are poorly housed and underemployed. 
 No matter, says the mayor, Francis Wassmer, known as Bud, a former marine with a can-do attitude and a sentimental belief in his native village. If Haverstraw is ever going to dust itself off, it is now, he argues, given the humming regional economy, the sudden availability of all two miles of the village's once-industrial riverfront and the growing allure of the Hudson Valley as a tourism destination.
But the village's plans raise an intriguing question. How many Hudson Valley towns can be reinvented as antique-and-boutique zones for the well-to-do, and does that redevelopment have to come at the expense of the lower-income people already there?
Like Peekskill, N.Y., which actually advertised for artists, and Piermont, N.Y., which evolved more naturally, Haverstraw is pursuing an idiosyncratic strategy of economic development, putting artists, antiques and boutiques front and center. "Just as the Renaissance led Europe out of the Dark Ages, the arts are going to be a big part of the revitalization of our village," Mayor Wassmer said with characteristic bravado.
But some Latino residents are uneasy. They worry about being displaced if property values rise. And they wonder whether they will feel alienated by stores like the recently opened Jacqueline's Treasure Chest, which sells $4 cookie cutters in the shape of teapots and $6.25 bags of English scone mix. "We hear rumors that when they fix everything up, they won't want us here," said Delsa Hilario, a hair stylist born in the Dominican Republic who has called Haverstraw home for 30 years.
While other towns have deployed artists and antiques dealers with mixed results, there are signs that Haverstraw, despite its grittiness, might at least be on the verge of attracting them.
Martin Ginsburg, a prominent Westchester County developer chosen by the village to redo the waterfront, has all but persuaded the Hudson Valley Children's Museum to abandon Nyack in favor of a riverside perch at the foot of Main Street where he wants to build 850 apartments. Mr. Ginsburg has teamed up with a local developer to renovate an old five-and-dime building, with antiques shops and artists' studios. And he is working with New York Waterway and Metro-North Railroad on a ferry service, scheduled to begin in late August, to lure Westchester's thick wallets from the opposite bank.
Mayor Wassmer and his wife have just opened an antiques store, the Captain's Chest, to "lead the way," as he put it, though, in truth, the merchandise looks more second-hand than antique.
In perhaps the biggest coup, Ms. Morrison, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and Nobel laureate, is renovating a 19th-century fixer-upper on the river with the intention of renting out apartments to artists. A resident of the affluent village of Grand View in southern Rockland, Ms. Morrison, who declined to be interviewed, has said she was attracted by Haverstraw's ethnic and racial diversity and wanted to make a financial commitment to the arts.
In recent years, the village, about 30 miles north of Manhattan, has laid the groundwork for a rebirth. There was a successful assault on crime, as well as facade improvements and new parking spaces. A few professionals priced out of other towns have trickled in, restoring historic houses, and an Italian restaurant called Civile's, where lunch for two can top $100, opened on the river's edge in 1998. "The immediate area is not ready for me," conceded Tom Civile, the owner. "But everything's moving in the right direction."
Those rumblings attracted the notice of the Ginsburg Development Corporation of Hawthorne, N.Y. The company is assembling 40 acres along the river, from the site of a former ready-mix concrete plant to land belonging to a defunct fuel oil company. The $150 million project, which must undergo a lengthy environmental review, will consist mostly of rental apartments and will include a public promenade running the length of three peninsulas.
It remains to be seen whether the potted-topiary set will take to a place with a strong Latino flavor and hints of hard times. In the small downtown, restaurants wear hand-painted signs, salsa music drifts from car radios and a check-cashing outlet occupies prime real estate.
"Some folks like their suburban ghetto where everyone makes $200,000 a year and is white and goes to church," said Robert F. Bristol, president of Saratoga Associates, a planning firm that has advised numerous towns on revitalization efforts. "But if the village can capitalize on the quality aspects of that cultural mix, it shouldn't be an impediment."
For his part, Mayor Wassmer, whose relationship with Hispanic residents has not been entirely harmonious, says Latino food and culture will be "part of the attraction." But some Hispanic leaders say they ought to be the main attraction. They would prefer a row of restaurants representing the cuisines of Latin America, along with Latino music clubs and shops typical of San Juan and Mexico City.
"Why not develop it with a Latin theme?" asked Edna I. Rivera, executive director of Housing Opportunities for Growth, Advancement and Revitalization, or Hogar, a nonprofit group in Haverstraw. "I'm a firm believer that if revitalization happens, it must begin from within. Otherwise, it's gentrification."
Like Ms. Rivera, Hector A. May, an investment banker who is chairman of HOGAR, says residents have not been properly informed of a plan that could change their lives. "I don't believe the mayor is anti-Hispanic or racist, but he has a military, Marine-Corps mentality," Mr. May said. "His attitude is that he's in charge and he will share his plan on a need-to-know basis."
The proposed housing is planned for a vacant industrial wasteland, and village officials say displacement is therefore not a concern. But critics fear that property values in the rest of the village could soar, driving up rents and raising taxes for homeowners who will shoulder the cost of additional services. (Estimates of the number of Hispanic residents who own their own homes range from 40 percent to 60 percent.)
The mayor argues that a bustling commercial district will mean more jobs for residents, and the developer has pledged to create at least 85 units of below-market housing. But Mr. May insists the village needs twice that amount. "There are people living in basements and abandoned cars here," he said.
More than anything, the village wants to take advantage of the increased interest in the Hudson Valley, a six-county region north of New York City that draws 25 million people a year. Between 1988 and 1998, hotel, inn and bed-and-breakfast revenues jumped to $301 million from $178 million. More and more, tourists are coming from as far away as Britain and Europe to witness the landscape made famous by the Hudson River School of painting and to visit the valley's many historic sites, artisan food producers, wineries and tucked-away villages offering the antithesis of a mall experience.
The Putnam County village of Cold Spring, with its 19th-century streetscape overlooking the river, now has 50 boutiques and antique shops along a half mile stretch of Main Street. It draws 2,000 visitors a day on a sunny weekend. In Rockland County, the one-square-mile village of Nyack, which has a racially diverse population, has grown steadily over the years. Starting out as an antique junction, the village is now known as much for its night life, with 21 restaurants at last count.
But other towns in the Hudson Valley that have tried to reinvent themselves as antiques-and-arts meccas offer cautionary lessons.
In Peekskill, N.Y., a racially diverse city in northern Westchester, local officials set out in the early 1990's to recruit artists to loft spaces by placing advertisements in The Village Voice. They got artists all right. But they did not spark a downtown revival. Instead, they started acting up at City Council meetings, where they objected to video surveillance cameras in town and refused to adhere to strict speaking guidelines. In last fall's elections, artists helped sweep in a new council.
In southern Rockland County, the village of Piermont saw its identity change after a paper mill on the Hudson River shut down in the late 1970's. In the 1980's, a critically acclaimed restaurant, Xavier's, opened in the tiny business district, along with antiques shops and arty boutiques.
Then a big developer swooped down to capitalize on the energy, proposing a large condominium complex on the Hudson River. After a bankruptcy and a change of ownership, the 327-unit development is almost complete. The mayor, Dennis W. Hardy, who lives in the complex, calls Piermont's transformation a "success story."
But others are less sanguine. They say something was lost when the simple street of quirky shops was transformed into a "condo village." On weekends, traffic is snarled. Village taxes, which spiked 30 percent in a two-year period in the mid-1990's, have since moderated, but school taxes continue to climb.
"This development came so quickly and wasn't integrated into the fabric of the village," said a village employee who requested anonymity. "It hasn't been the golden egg that everybody thought it would be."
In Haverstraw, village officials do not seem discouraged by the mixed results elsewhere. "We were the dregs of society before," said Angelo J. Cintron, a village trustee active in Hispanic life there. "We can't go back to where we were. If I thought Latinos were going to be driven out, I wouldn't support the plan."
As he finished a three-course lunch at Civile's, the jovial mayor turned suddenly solemn. "If I died tomorrow, and there was only one line written on my tombstone," Mr. Wassmer said, "it would be that 'He saved this village.' "

HEADLINE: VICTOR IN MEXICO PLANS TO OVERHAUL LAW ENFORCEMENT

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, July 4

 BODY:
The president-elect of Mexico, Vicente Fox Quesada, announced plans today to rebuild the country's federal law enforcement system, moving it toward an American model of justice as a way to wipe out corruption that has crippled his nation for decades.
Mr. Fox also said he would travel to the United States soon to meet with President Clinton and both major presidential candidates to press his proposal to open the United States-Mexico border to a less-restricted flow of immigrants. 
 The president-elect also explained some of the measures his new government would take to deal with a range of Mexico's most persistent and complex troubles, including the fight against poverty, efforts to stem the flow of drugs through Mexico and the unresolved conflict in Chiapas.
A two-hour news conference by Mr. Fox, whose election on Sunday ended a 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, turned into a wide-ranging foreign policy address. But his most detailed proposals centered on his fight against corruption, a problem he considers a top priority.
To accomplish the overhaul, he is likely to use executive powers that allow him to create a federal police agency and to shift law enforcement responsibilities from one agency to another.
Toward that end, he said, he will create a Ministry of Security and Justice, similar to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that will be responsible for all the federal police.
Mr. Fox's plans would also significantly reduce the powers of the Interior Ministry, which currently manages a recently created federal police force. And the attorney general's office would be similarly weakened, not only by the removal of its control over federal law enforcement, but also by Mr. Fox's plans to create a new agency of federal prosecutors to manage investigations.
Because his ideas have widespread support, Mr. Fox's transformation of the system is also expected to be well received in the Mexican Congress even though it will no longer be dominated by any single political party as a result of the election on Sunday.
In his wide-ranging comments, Mr. Fox brought up his goal of having greater cooperation between the United States, Mexico and Canada. He suggested the creation of a North American common market that would allow a freer flow of merchandise and workers, with strict standards for the protection of the environment, law enforcement and workers' rights.
"It appears to me that both of us have lost sight of the goal," Mr. Fox said, referring to the United States and Mexico. "The United States' goal has been to put up walls, police and soldiers to fight immigration. That can't work."
"Mexico's goal," he added, "has been to open an escape valve, allowing 350,000 young people to cross the border each year and washing its hands of any responsibility."
"If we are serious," Mr. Fox concluded, "the least we can do is sit down and say, 'This is the problem' and the goal is to close the development gap."
In his answers to reporters' questions, Mr. Fox also offered specific proposals for improving United States-Mexican relations, including extending the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement more evenly to small businesses on both sides of the border and turning the drug certification program from a unilateral to a multilateral process involving all countries affected by trafficking.
Mr. Fox said that in the next two months he would use five international head-hunting concerns to help him select the members of his cabinet so that leading up to his inauguration on Dec. they can work side by side with the ministers they will replace. A team of aides to Mr. Fox have also been assigned to work with the current leaders of the Finance Ministry on setting next year's budget.
In trying to transform the law enforcement system, Mr. Fox's plans could be upset by a backlash from below, where bureaucrats and officers enjoy strong Civil Service protections.
President Ernesto Zedillo reorganized and renamed the nation's drug police at least twice, and each time traffickers quickly infiltrated the forces and bought off leading officials.
And he created a new federal police force to fight a mounting wave of federal crimes, including kidnapping. But so far the new police have done little to make Mexicans, especially those in larger cities, feel any safer.
Jorge Chabat, an analyst of Mexican law enforcement, praised Mr. Fox's plan to take the federal police out of the hands of politicians, who used the agents for their own agendas. He said he felt some pessimism over whether the new system would be resistant to the corrupting forces of drug traffickers. But, he said, "someone has to try to fight them."
"The truth is whatever the government tries, it will face a problem with the corruption of traffickers."
In emphasizing his commitment to fighting corruption, Mr. Fox turned the spotlight not only on the past, but also on his administration and its future. He announced that he would create a "Commission of Transparency," made up of Mexican citizens whose job would be to investigate high-profile scandals of past administrations as well as to serve as a watchdog over his own government.
But he was careful to make clear that he would not conduct wholesale investigations of government conduct before taking office.
"We do not want to waste our government looking only at the past and conducting witch hunts that could be misinterpreted," Mr. Fox said in the news conference at the presidential residence, Los Pinos. The transparency commission, he added, would be his government's way to "set its sights forward, to construct a harmonious government and also to make an accounting of the past."
In a signal of assurance to the Mexican military, Mr. Fox said he would not consider appointing a civilian as chief of the Ministry of Defense. "I see no reason to break a tradition that has brought stability to the country," he said.
On other domestic issues, Mr. Fox said he wanted to visit Chiapas as soon as possible and reopen peace talks with the Zapatista rebels. He said he was willing to consider withdrawing the military from rural areas of conflict in the state, one of the rebels' main demands.
Fighting poverty was another area that Mr. Fox called a priority and he said that he would not approve budgets or program proposals from members of his cabinet unless they could demonstrate in concrete terms how these would help the poor.
"This would be our way to pay attention to the groups that have been totally excluded from the development of our country," he said. "It is one of the strong principals that we are going to introduce in the decision-making process of the new government."

NEW YORK
 
BAY SHORE: FATAL FIREWORKS
A 34-year-old Long Island man was decapitated last night when he bent over some lit fireworks to check on them and they exploded, the police said. The accident occurred at 9:30 p.m. in an empty lot along a Sunrise Highway service road. No other information was available. (AP)
 
QUEENS: REWARD DOUBLED
A resort in Kingston, Jamaica, has doubled the reward for information about a New York travel writer who disappeared while staying at one of its camps. On Monday, Sandals Resorts raised the payment to $50,000 for clues about the writer, Claudia Kirschhoch, 29, who works at Frommer's Travel Guides. Ms. Kirschhoch, who had been staying at a Sandals resort in western Negril, was reported missing on June 2. An Astoria resident, she arrived in Jamaica on May 24 as part of a Sandals-sponsored tour for travel writers, and was last seen on May 27. (AP)
 
MANHATTAN: ROBBERY ARREST
Michael Contessa's mistake, the police said, was one of timing: his robbery of a crowded nightclub was undone by a more elaborate endeavor. Early yesterday, Mr. Contessa and two other men robbed Exit, a club on West 56th Street, the police said, only to be captured by officers preparing the block for the Fourth of July celebration. The officers were keeping cars from parking on streets that adjoin the Hudson River when they got a call about the robbery. The three men were caught nearby, the police said. Kevin Flynn (NYT) 

ALBANY: PRISONS TO GET TOWERS
The state is building observation towers at 27 medium-security prisons as a means of keeping a better eye on inmates and prison grounds. Eleven of the 31 towers planned are already in place, and work is expected to be completed within the next year. The towers will cost about $2.5 million, according to state prison estimates. All maximum-security prisons in the state already have surveillance towers. (AP)
 
ROCHESTER: RESEARCH CHIEF
A developer of a vaccine for childhood bacterial meningitis has been selected to lead the Center for Human Genetics and Molecular Pediatric Disease at the University of Rochester. Dr. Richard A. Insel and a team of 12 scientists will study diseases that are caused by damaged genes. In the 1980's, Dr. Insel was one of three University of Rochester researchers who developed the vaccine against Haemophilus influenza Type B, a leading cause of meningitis in young children. (AP)
 
BUFFALO: DOCTOR SUSPENDED
An obstetrician-gynecologist has been temporarily barred from practicing medicine after allegations that she mistreated nine patients, including two who died, state health officials said Monday. The doctor, Monica Applewhite, who has offices in Williamsville and Lockport, faces 23 charges of misconduct. In one case, Dr. Applewhite is accused of performing a tubal ligation, elective surgery that prevents pregnancy, when the patient had an infection. The patient died June 3. (AP)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
NEW HAVEN: DEER POPULATION
State scientists say the deer population in the state is increasing, bringing more ticks and the risk of more Lyme disease. A survey by the wildlife division of the Department of Environmental Protection shows an estimated statewide count of 75,000 white-tail deer. The department counted deer in 11 zones while there was snow cover last winter, the first periodic aerial deer census since 1996. The state average was about 21 per square mile, up from the average of 15 four years ago. (AP)
 
HARTFORD: BUDGET SURPLUS
The strong economy and higher-than-expected income tax revenues will push the state budget surplus to $470.2 million to close out the fiscal year, the state comptroller, Nancy Wyman, said Monday. Her latest surplus estimate is $56.8 million higher than last month's projection. The income tax will bring in $275.4 million more than was expected. Ms. Wyman warned, however, that state spending was expected to rise about 6 percent over the next year, outpacing the 5.4 percent growth in revenue. (AP)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
CARNEY'S POINT: NEW TOLL PLAZA
New Jersey Turnpike officials say a new $44 million toll plaza will end traffic tie-ups at Interchange 1 and make New Jerseyans proud. Edward Gross, the executive director of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, said, "Just about everyone I've shown the design to says it's very attractive." Construction is to begin next year on the plaza, a few miles from the Delaware Memorial Bridge and 1.2 miles north of the existing, 50-year-old plaza. Its opening is scheduled for June 2003. (AP)

HEADLINE: U.S. Study Reopens Division Over Nuclear Missile Threat

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO and STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 4

 BODY:
Intelligence officials, military officers and policy experts in the Clinton administration are deeply divided over the seriousness of missile threats posed by countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq, even as the administration says the United States needs to build a national missile defense system.
Officials at the State Department dissented from an intelligence report last fall that stated that North Korea could soon develop a ballistic missile that could threaten the United States. They are also quite likely to dissent again as intelligence agencies prepare a new assessment for the president, administration officials said. 
 Some officials in the White House, State Department, Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency argue that the threat has been almost exclusively defined by technological abilities and that the emerging analysis discounts political, economic and social factors that could make a threat less likely.
The officials said the intense focus on missiles that could hit American soil also obscured the more immediate threat posed by nuclear weapons carried by terrorists or fired from ships. The officials said the change in focus devalued the concept of deterrence, by which the sheer force of the American arsenal would inhibit even the most irresponsible leader from attacking American soil.
Dissension exists even on the technological side. A senior Pentagon official acknowledged that Iran's ballistic missile program had problems and was "certainly not clicking along really fast."
The Pentagon schedule to build a missile defense is entirely driven by the belief that North Korea will have a long-range missile by 2005. Indeed, the coming intelligence report will reportedly find that North Korea could develop a missile that could strike the United States by 2005, the same finding that was in the report last year.
In the case of Iran, the study last year reported that some experts believed that the threat was "likely before 2010." Others have said there is "less than an even chance by 2015," a split that persists.
As for Iraq, officials agree that Iraq will pose no concrete threat to the United States as long as international sanctions remain in place.
The assessments are crucial, because they are driving the decision by President Clinton to decide in the fall on proceeding with a $60 billion program to build a limited missile defense in five years. Mr. Clinton has repeatedly said -- as recently as this week -- he will make his decision on four factors, the cost, the technological feasibility, the effects on other countries and the urgency of the threat.
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen has declared the existence of a threat in five years. "I believe by the year 2005 a threat will be present that could threaten the security of the United States," Mr. Cohen said in an interview on CNN on Saturday.
That finding is being fiercely contested by some officials, including experts on Korea, who point to North Korea's suspension of its missile tests in the fall and the progress between the leaders of North and South Korea since their successful meeting last month.
The intelligence report being completed for Mr. Clinton is known as a National Intelligence Estimate and is supposed to reflect the consensus of all the intelligence agencies, including, among others, the C.I.A., the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department Bureau of Intelligence and Research. But as experts from those agencies have contributed their views and information to drafts in recent weeks, there is little consensus.
In fact, as a missile defense has emerged as an important difference between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush in the presidential campaign, many intelligence officials have complained that what is supposed to be a coldly analytical process has evolved into a roiling political debate.
In the report last year, the rules of classic intelligence analysis were altered, the officials said, to measure not whether countries were likely to threaten the United States, but whether they "could" do so. The officials said that change skewed the results toward the most alarming assessment.
"There's a lot of pressure from the Hill driving this process," said a longtime intelligence official involved in preparing the new report. "You end up with realms of possibility, including what is least likely to what is unthinkable. We are writing in worst-case language. Frankly, from my perspective, this is nonsense."
Senior administration officials defended the process. "We don't live here to make anybody happy," a senior intelligence official said. Still, that official acknowledged that people on all sides of the debate were "looking for something in what we say to support their own arguments."
The intensely partisan politics swirling around the urgency of the threat were on display on Thursday at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. At one point, John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, pressed Larry D. Welch, a retired Army general who heads an independent team that is reviewing the Pentagon's plans, to enunciate the extent of the nation's vulnerability to missiles.
"Look straight into the cameras and say, 'We are as a nation defenseless,' " Mr. Warner demanded after trying several ways to have the witness say that affirmatively.
General Welch replied: "We as a nation have no missile defense to deal with these threats. That's correct."
But at another point, John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, "There's nothing that I'm aware of that suggests that the threat of an attack on the United States is 'increasingly likely' in the next few years."
Mr. Kerry said the threat depended on not only the ability to build weapons, but also on "analysis of the nature of the relationships with a country, the rationale for an attack, the possibilities of an attack, the levels of deterrence."
The central question asked by many critics of the national missile defense is why its advocates appear to have discounted deterrence as a counter to the missile threat, even though deterrence governed American strategic thinking throughout the cold war.
Many senior officials have said deterrence no longer held when it came to countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq. The officials regard the leaders of those countries as capable of irrational self-destructive behavior.
"We didn't like the Soviets, but we roughly understood them to be extremely cautious," said Leon S. Fuerth, Mr. Gore's national security adviser. "We never have had the depth of understanding about what makes the North Koreans tick to give us that confidence."
As for Iran, a senior Pentagon official pointed out that Iranians seized American hostages 20 years ago; still chanted, "Death to America"; and were involved in state-sponsored terrorism.
Intelligence officials say Iran is considering developing a rocket that can put satellites in orbit, a move that would represent a significant step toward possessing an intercontinental ballistic missile. Tehran has begun discussing the project with France, India and Russia.
The officials also cite Iran's efforts to develop a longer-range missile, the Shahab-4. But Iran is still faces difficulties in its program to build the Shahab-3, a missile with a range of 780 miles. Those problems have prompted experts to question the Iranian missile threat to the United States. "There is an Iranian threat to U.S. forces in the region, not to the continental United States," said an official.
Some officials complain that all the attention focused on the potential missile threat diverts attention from more likely threats like chemical or biological weapons prepared in the United States and hidden in a truck or even a cruise missile carried aboard a ship.
Even Mr. Cohen acknowledges those facts. "I think the act of terrorism taking place on the United States is more likely than intercontinental ballistic missile," he said in his interview on Saturday.
But at another point he added, "To say that we can't protect against everything doesn't mean that we shouldn't protect against those that can cause us catastrophic harm."
Administration officials vehemently deny that the missile program is aimed at curbing the military ability of Russia or China. The analysis last year and the report being prepared find that the United States defines those two countries as a threat only in the case of an accidental unauthorized launching.
But especially on Capitol Hill there are those who argue that the ultimate threat is China's ability to strike the United States. Five years ago, an unpublished report prepared for the House National Security Committee by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization cited the possibility of China's "using its ballistic missiles to prevent U.S. action in Korea" as a pivotal threat that justifies a defensive shield.
"It's easy to talk about North Korea, Iran and Iraq, but people don't like to talk about Russia or China," said Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona. "But people privately also are a little worried that there could be another threat from China. I'm candidly telling you that behind closed doors you hear some people expressing some concerns about ultimate threats like China."

HEADLINE: A GROWING AMBITION: A special report.;
Behind the Lazio Smile Lies a Deliberate and Pragmatic Substance

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Tall and lanky, with a voice that occasionally cracks and a forelock that resists conformity. All in all, he presents himself as the perfect young man to escort your daughter to the junior prom: he would obey the speed limit, attempt nothing more than a peck on the cheek, and studiously avoid the rum raisin ice cream for dessert.
But Rick A. Lazio is 42 years old, not 18. Despite the gee-whiz air about him, he is old enough to have a wife, two daughters and a weekend beach house; eight years as a Republican congressman; and the brash self-confidence to square off against Hillary Rodham Clinton in New York's high-wattage race for the United States Senate. 
 Advisers have warned Mrs. Clinton that in many ways, Mr. Lazio presents more of a challenge than Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the putative candidate he so gleefully replaced two months ago. He has a palpable ambition that infuses him with energy, a gift for negotiation, and that rare ability, shared by her husband, to connect with a savvy lobbyist in Washington and some teenager working a pizza oven in his native Long Island.
Above all, they say, he is a nice guy, with little in his personal life to titillate the curious and suspicious. He rarely socializes and spends most of his free time with his family.
Sherwood L. Boehlert, a Republican congressman from Utica, N.Y., and his wife were recently watching a televised scene from a political rally that showed an aide gripping Mr. Lazio by the arm and leading him off stage. The candidate broke loose, Mr. Boehlert recalled, went back to take the hand of his wife, Patricia, and walked away with her by his side.
"That was very important to my wife," he said. "I'll tell you, that was a heady position he was in. And yet he stops, grabs his wife's hand and walks off together. That's not manufactured. That's real."
But those who know him say that a certain calculation lurks behind his smile. He promotes himself in a way that unnerves colleagues. He is well-known for waiting until the last moment to cast his vote; while supporters say it reflects a deliberate approach to lawmaking, detractors say it shows a penchant for pandering to the Republican leadership.
Then there is the question of the Lazio ideology. Although considered to be a moderate Republican, his positions, from gun control to abortion, can seem oh-so-carefully nuanced. Peter T. King, an outspoken Republican colleague from Long Island, said he doubted whether Mr. Lazio was guided by any particular philosophy.
"He's basically a facilitator, a mediator, a fine-tuner," Mr. King said. "He tries to make things work a little better, but it's not out of any real ideological base."
Lloyd Braun, the co-chairman of ABC Entertainment Television Group, said he had a different take on his former college roommate, a man he loves and teases "like a brother." For all his boyish qualities, he said, Mrs. Clinton's opponent is as hard-driven as they come -- and "very, very pragmatic."
 
Early Lessons in Responsibility
Rick Lazio inherited that pragmatism from his father, Anthony Lazio, who worked long hours in the automotive parts store he owned, then spent many nights making contacts through the local Kiwanis club and the Suffolk County Republican clique. The lesson imparted was that little comes to those who relax.
Anthony Lazio had met his wife in the mid-1950's when he serendipitously stepped on the foot of Olive Christensen, the daughter of Danish immigrants living in Brooklyn. "It must be a family thing," Rick Lazio joked, referring to his own lip-splitting stumble at a recent Memorial Day parade.
Both were veterans of World War II, single parents -- he was a widower with one daughter, and she was divorced, with two daughters -- and rabid Brooklyn Dodgers fans, which prompted a romantic trip to Ebbets Field that eventually led to marriage. They settled down in a small Cape Cod house in middle-class West Islip on Long Island's South Shore. It was just a few miles east of Lindenhurst, where his Sicilian parents, a seamstress and a man who dabbled with unsuccessful inventions, ran a dress shop out of their house on Montauk Highway.
In March 1958, the couple had their first child together: Enrico Anthony Lazio, named after his paternal grandfather. Mr. Lazio later joked that when his teachers conducted roll call -- "Mary, Jane, Paul, Bill, Enrico!" -- other children would look to see "who's the new exchange student."
He was the baby in the family, doted on by his parents and three older sisters. To hear Mr. Lazio tell it, his childhood was normal and healthy, but hardly a free ride. Yes, his family owned a beach house on Fire Island. Yes, he played Little League and collected stacks of baseball cards. Yes, they installed a floodlight over his basketball hoop so that he could mimic Walt Frazier late into the night.
But he never received an allowance, he said. Instead, his father made him earn spending money by stocking shelves and sweeping the floor at the family store.
The younger Lazio also played down his father's role in politics. "He would be one of the guys who would put the signs up and carry the petitions," he said. "And then when you had some sort of visiting bigwig come into town, he'd be the guy who would be asked to go pick him up at the airport and bring him in."
But Edwin M. Schwenk, the Suffolk County Republican chairman from 1967 to 1977, remembered Tony Lazio as playing a significant role. The party paid Mr. Lazio about $26,000 a year, he said, to coordinate elaborate fund-raising dinners that often included a formal program and a three-tier dais.
"He made everybody think that Suffolk County was important, and he convinced them to come, including the vice president, Spiro Agnew," Mr. Schwenk said, adding: "And he wasn't bashful about telling me what a good job he did."
The younger Lazio minimized the role of politics in his childhood, saying he did little more than attend a few rallies. As for Republican patronage, he said, his father would help friends secure summer jobs on the public beach, but his son's assignments would be "the lousiest": hauling garbage or working on the mosquito-control unit.
About this time, his future political opponent, Mrs. Clinton, was a young lawyer working for the House Judiciary Committee. Her task: preparing for the impeachment of one of the Lazio family's heroes, President Nixon.
 
Choosing His Causes
The West Islip High School yearbook in the bicentennial year 1976 includes a photograph of a grinning graduate named Enrico Lazio sporting a striking white bow tie. His listed accomplishments included membership in the Coin and Stamp Club and something called the Leaders Club.
"The Leaders Club was like a group of people that were picked to -- what did we do? -- we sort of led," Mr. Lazio said, laughing and cringing simultaneously.
He was not the kind of teenager to sneak a six-pack of Schmidt's beer down to the Babylon docks; nor was his high school's coin club likely to rumble with rowdy numismatists from, say, Bay Shore High School. He followed the Mets, hung out in friends' basements, spent time clamming off the Fire Island shores.
That fall, he began to attend Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., which had begun to admit men only seven years earlier. Vassar retains a whiff of its upper-crust past to this day; afternoon tea is still served under gold chandeliers in the Rose Parlor.
Mr. Lazio said he chose Vassar because it was relatively close to home, had a small-school feel and offered him some latitude in choosing course work. The disproportionate women-to-men ratio, he added, "certainly wasn't a negative."
There he was, a political science major in Lacoste shirts and Top-Siders, dressed like a preppy but not a true preppy, more interested in Tom Seaver than in Mary McCarthy, a wide-eyed product of what he later called a "lily-white middle-class background."
At some point he tried marijuana, he said, but those who knew him then say he was hardly one to join others in beginning their weekends with Thursday-night pitchers of beer. He and his friends spent most of their time competing in cutthroat games of Risk, basketball and all-around teasing, but he was neither the sharpest-tongued nor the most athletically gifted.
"You could easily give him a pass and it would hit him in the head," Mr. Braun, his former roommate, said.
The conservative kid from West Islip gradually revealed himself on the liberal-leaning campus. He was the campus coordinator for Youth for Ford -- "a pretty small group of volunteers, as you can imagine," he said -- fought for more student input in faculty evaluations and lost in the election for senior class president.
"Did I think perhaps one day I would run for public office?" he said. "Yeah, I thought that."
Such aspirations were obvious to those around him. "Lazio was always understanding of the things you cannot do if you want to have a career in politics," said Michael Naso, another former roommate. "He was conservative in his actions because he knew where he was going."
When talk turned to national politics, Mr. Lazio passionately argued that Nixon had been railroaded. But he would not immerse himself in some stickier issues, as when many on campus erupted in protest over the college's investments with banks that did business with the apartheid government of South Africa.
"Rick was not on the map for any of that," said Dimitri Cruz, a graduate who was active in campus politics. "In that sense, Rick chooses very carefully when to present himself, when to express his views, when to assert himself."
For all the appearance of being focused, Mr. Lazio was more than a little distracted. In late 1978, his father suffered a severe stroke from which he would never fully recover; doctors told the family that Tony Lazio would never get out of bed, and would probably remain in a vegetative state.
The prognosis failed to account for the determination of a man who eventually willed himself to walk a few steps with a cane, Mr. Lazio said, recalling, "He pushed it as hard as anyone could imagine."
College friends recall visiting the Lazio house to spend time at the nearby beaches and to help their friend with his father, assisting him in his physical therapy and using flash cards to help him regain his speech -- Tony Lazio was so affected by the stroke that only family members seemed to understand him.
"It was not a house of remorse," recalled Steve Kluger, another former roommate.
Mr. Lazio also worked to keep his father in touch with the Republican clique that once meant so much to him. Sometime during Mr. Reagan's presidential campaign in 1980, he said, he put a note "in somebody's hand who put it in somebody's hand," asking that Mr. Reagan mention his father during a Long Island rally.
He later said he just wanted the celebrity to point to the man in the wheelchair and say: "Tony Lazio, glad you're here."
It did not happen. But the next morning, Mr. Reagan called the Lazio house to apologize, saying that he had received the letter only after he had left the rally. Then Olive Lazio held up the phone, Mr. Lazio said, so that her husband could hear the future president tell him "how much he meant to the party, meant to the nation, the community."
Remembering how the call thrilled his father, Rick Lazio said: "It was a nice thing to do, something that didn't need to be done. My dad -- it was a nice thing to do."
One day, two young men from Long Island, Rick Lazio and Michael Moriarty, were studying at American University School of Law in Washington when, according to Mr. Lazio, an acquaintance came up to his friend and said: "Hey, man, Moriarty, I saw your sister. She's pretty good-looking, man."
Mr. Lazio said he felt betrayed; he had been driving Mr. Moriarty home for a couple of years and yet knew nothing of this sister. "When am I meeting her?" he asked.
Mr. Moriarty, now a lawyer in Manhattan but forever an older brother, decided such a meeting made sense.
"He had a seriousness that a lot of other guys didn't have, a sense of where he wanted to go," Mr. Moriarty said, which was reflected by Mr. Lazio's dedication to his family. "What he was doing was not what a lot of unmarried guys in their early 20's wanted to spend their time doing."
It was arranged for some law school students, among them Mr. Lazio, to meet some nurses, including Patricia Moriarty, at a bar near George Washington University Medical Center. The son of a Suffolk County politico started talking with the daughter of a New York City police officer, then walked her to the hospital, where she was working the night shift.
"It probably took him about a good month to call," she later said. And so began a slow-paced relationship.
Meanwhile, Mr. Lazio's interest in someday running for office had grown so strong that he wrote a letter to James L. Buckley, a conservative former New York senator, seeking advice -- a brash move that yielded a lunch meeting. While becoming a prosecutor was an honorable choice, he recalled the veteran politician telling him, someone interested in elective office should work instead on a few campaigns.
"Of course, I did just the opposite," Mr. Lazio said.
He landed a summer job with Patrick Henry, the Suffolk County district attorney and a Republican. "He had known my dad," Mr. Lazio said. "And I'm sure -- though he never said it -- I'm sure it probably had something to do with that he felt that it was a nice thing to do for somebody in need."
By now, Mrs. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas, a prominent lawyer and the mother of a toddler named Chelsea. And Mr. Lazio was on the verge of becoming an assistant district attorney who each morning packed the court papers he needed and the lunch prepared by his mother.
"It was always a nice sandwich with lettuce and some healthy fruit," recalled Marcy Rudner Flores, who shared a cubicle with Mr. Lazio.
"Raisins," Mr. Lazio said sheepishly. "The transitional food: not quite a candy or a fruit."
Ms. Flores recalled Mr. Lazio's being the office "golden boy" who was always there to encourage others. Mr. Henry, now a State Supreme Court justice, described him as an able prosecutor who rose to become the office's executive assistant -- and an attentive son, often seen pushing his father in a wheelchair at Republican events.
In October 1985, Mr. Lazio won a conviction in a felony case against the ringleader of a major bootleg record album business. The next month, his father died, at 65. The obituary in Newsday included a statement from former President Nixon that said, in part that "the Nixon family has lost a good friend."
It was a generous gesture, Mr. Lazio said, considering that Nixon barely knew his father.
 
The Road to Congress
In late summer 1988, Mr. Lazio left the district attorney's office to open a general practice law firm in Babylon. It was time, he later said, to get on with his life.
For one thing, there was Patricia Moriarty, whose photograph he kept on his desk. The casual long-distance relationship had recently become more serious. She said she told him, "You need to make a decision."
"He thought about it long and hard, and we stopped dating for a couple of months," she said. "Then he came back one day and said: 'I really thought about this. I want to marry, but I'm not ready at this point.' "
A month later, in January 1989, Mr. Lazio proposed at the Rainbow Room. They would marry in June the following year and move into a ranch house in Brightwaters, just three miles east of his mother's house.
Then there were his political aspirations. Mr. Henry, his former boss, was stepping down amid a state investigation into the office's sloppy practices. And so Mr. Lazio, all of 30 years old, spread the word that he wanted to run for district attorney.
The Republican Party committee instead chose James M. Catterson, a man almost twice Mr. Lazio's age, but strongly hinted that he had a future.
A few months later, in the fall of 1989, he easily won an open seat in the Suffolk County Legislature, thus joining an 18-member panel known for preferring an in-your-face style of democracy. Shouting is common. A member once struck a colleague with a pocketbook; another once dropped some tissues on an opponent's desk, a sly reference to tears shed during a previous argument.
Rarely participating in the grandstanding was the gentleman from West Islip, who was exceedingly friendly and always immaculately dressed. Alan Binder, a legislator, remembered being so obsessed with the perfect dimple in Mr. Lazio's tie that he confronted his colleague in a parking lot and demanded that he share his sartorial talent.
"Since then," he said, "I have had a dimple in my tie."
Although his party had the majority in the County Legislature, some former colleagues say that Mr. Lazio's legacy does not go much beyond the dimple now found in Mr. Binder's tie.
"He worked to not get out in front of the controversial issues," Paul Sabatino, a Republican and the counsel to the County Legislature, recalled. "He was a pleasant person, but he left no fingerprints."
Sondra M. Bachety, a former Democratic leader in the Legislature who sat next to Mr. Lazio, agreed. "He would speak about things and sound very sincere, but I never found him to be a stand-up guy in that respect," she said. "He didn't take the tough votes."
Mr. Lazio cited several accomplishments, from helping to revitalize downtown Bay Shore to working to recognize the sacrifice of reservists during Desert Storm. Besides, he said, he served only one two-year term. In 1992, during his second term, he ran for Congress against a fellow West Islip High School graduate who had become a Washington institution: Tom Downey.
After 18 years in office, Mr. Downey, who was usually elected by huge margins, was one of the most effective members of Congress and served on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Back on Long Island, however, more than a few thought he had become distant, too caught up with the clubbiness of Congress.
The Suffolk Republican leadership basically told Rick Lazio the eager politician: go ahead, kid, give it a shot. But shortly afterward, the same leadership delivered a message to Rick Lazio the legislator: support its budget bailout package, a plan that included an increase in the sales tax.
Mr. Lazio refused on principle, he said, and not because he was concerned about how a vote for a tax increase would hurt him on Election Day. He simply did not like borrowing money for operating costs.
But many said the county had no choice, including Michael D. O'Donohoe, the conservative Republican who headed the Finance Committee at the time. "He kept saying there must be another way," said Mr. O'Donohoe, "which used to drive me up the wall."
The bailout package eventually passed, but not before Republican leaders vowed to get even. When the Lazio campaign held a large fund-raising dinner at LaSalle Military Academy in Oakdale, prominent Republicans boycotted the event, leaving the uneaten canapes to remind him that he could expect only lukewarm support.
The Republican freeze-out of 1992 has become part of the Lazio lore, feeding the legend that he was a David to Mr. Downey's Goliath.
In fact, he received significant financial help from a national Republican operation that smelled blood. And he waged an aggressive campaign that belied his boyish manner, accusing Mr. Downey of abusing his position by overdrawing checks from the House bank, of overusing his mailing privileges and of taking government-sponsored junkets. (Such trips are common, but ABC News had recently broadcast images of Mr. Downey on a Jet Ski during one such trip to Barbados.)
Mr. Downey said recently that Mr. Lazio was "an affable, friendly fellow," but that "when you scratched the surface, there was not a lot there."
Even so, he said, "I made mistakes -- the trip to Barbados, the House banking scandal -- and the economy was in such poor shape."
In retrospect, Mr. Downey said, the myth that Mr. Lazio was woefully underfinanced galls him the most. The national Republican leadership had dedicated "extraordinary resources" to the race, he said. "The amount of money he spent made a material difference."
Richard N. Bond, who was then the chairman of the Republican National Committee, declined to say how much was spent on the Lazio campaign. But, he added, "I took it as my cause to do everything within legal boundaries to fund that race."
In late January 1993, the country had a new president, Bill Clinton, and a new first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. And the Second Congressional District of New York had a new representative, a gangly young man with a beguiling smile and a reputation as a giant-killer. His new Republican colleagues bathed him in applause.
 
Alliances and Ambitions
Eight years in Congress have matured Rick Lazio, beyond the gray hair just now appearing at his temples. He is the representative credited with steering a law to overhaul the federal public-housing policy; the mediator between the conservative Republican leadership and the moderate members known as the "lunch bunch"; a deputy majority whip.
Paul A. Equale, a prominent insurance lobbyist who generally supports Democrats, said of Mr. Lazio: "Unlike many of them, he really gets his hands dirty in terms of legislative issues. He gives direction to his staff, not the other way around. He understands both the politics and the policy, and is generally working hard on both."
And the traits that he first exhibited during his years at Vassar -- establishing many relationships, avoiding controversy, choosing his causes -- have served him well.
With the Democrats controlling the House his first two years, he often supported the policies of President Clinton. In 1994, when Newt Gingrich and the Republicans took control, he became more conservative. When several Republican factions were vying for the House leadership in 1998, he lobbied hard for the majority leader, Dick Armey, a rock-solid conservative from Texas who is rarely mistaken as a friend to the interests of the Northeast.
As a result, Mr. Lazio's credentials as a moderate are sometimes called into question. In late 1998, for example, he surprised many in his district by voting for two of the four articles of impeachment against his future opponent's husband.
Critics say that his alliance with Mr. Armey smacks of opportunism and forces him to lean conservative on tough votes, but Mr. Lazio is unapologetic. Friendship is at the root of a relationship that also helps him in his legislative duties, he said: "You have the ability to be around the leadership table and provide another perspective."
And for all of Mr. Lazio's persona as Everybody's Friend, he has had his share of battles over the years and is known for being a demanding, driven boss. "I'm not a yeller," he said, "but I'm pretty demanding."
There is also that bubbling ambition, reflected in the way he persisted in promoting himself as a Senate candidate -- even after the state Republican leadership cast its lot with Mr. Giuliani -- and in the way he seeks publicity.
Some of his New York colleagues still grumble that he took most of the credit for getting federal reimbursement for the money Suffolk County spent in the aftermath of the Trans World Airlines Flight 800 disaster. They say that Representative Michael P. Forbes deserved credit for seeking the appropriation; besides, the plane crash was in Mr. Forbes's district.
"It wasn't going to happen with Mike Forbes," Mr. Lazio said of the appropriation. "Trust me."
Of course, in finally winning what he has lusted for these last few years -- the Republican nomination for Senate -- Mr. Lazio is learning that every photo opportunity, every vote, every move, is under scrutiny. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into a profitable investment he made a few years ago, and even his struggle to restrain that disobedient forelock has become newsworthy.
At the moment, Mr. Lazio seems to be moving even faster than usual. Dimitri Cruz recalled seeing his old Vassar classmate at their 20th reunion last month. "We gave each other a hug, said hello," he said. "And he kept on running, kept shaking hands."

An article last Wednesday about the career of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate candidate, misquoted Marcy Rudner Flores, a prosecutor who once worked with Mr. Lazio at the Suffolk County District Attorney's office. Ms. Flores said of Mr. Lazio, "He wasn't like a golden boy. He was one of the guys." Ms. Flores did not say that Mr. Lazio was the office "golden boy."

HEADLINE: Africa Can't Just Take a Pill For AIDS

BYLINE: By Lawrence Goldyn; Lawrence Goldyn, a doctor who formerly taught political science at Parsons School of Design, treats H.I.V.-positive patients.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa has so exasperated AIDS researchers that some have decided not to attend the international AIDS conference next week in his country. First he said AZT, which has safely helped prolong the lives of hundreds of thousands of people with H.I.V., might be too toxic for his people. Then he announced that he was willing to entertain the ridiculous views of the marginalized scientists who say H.I.V. does not cause AIDS.
But when Mr. Mbeki spoke to an audience in San Francisco a few months ago, his iconoclasm began to make sense. He focused on a stark reality: the pharmaceutical-based model of H.I.V. care in the West is not applicable to South Africa. He may be arriving at this conclusion by a route involving some indefensible detours, but the conclusion itself is sound. 
 The stakes are high. South Africa has one of the fastest-growing H.I.V. epidemics in the world, though with 20 percent of the adult population infected, it is in better shape than many of its neighbors in southern Africa, where 25 percent to 35 percent of adults have H.I.V. Most of the infected South Africans will die of AIDS, leaving behind hundreds of thousands of orphans with fewer resources and adult caretakers than if AIDS had been kept at bay. The economy is likely to weaken as people in their working years fall ill. The world held its breath as South Africa moved essentially bloodlessly from apartheid to a stable democratic government. Will H.I.V. unravel its stability?
Cost is the obvious barrier to drug therapy. A cocktail of drugs for an H.I.V. patient costs between $10,000 and $15,000 a year -- unaffordable at a tenth of the price for the South African government, which spends about $40 a year per person on health care. But Mr. Mbeki stressed something else: the lack of social, economic and medical structures to support drug treatment. Even in the West, where we have an array of social agencies to help, patients do not always comply with complicated regimens of H.I.V. treatment. If cheaper drugs arrived in South Africa by the shipload, how would one get people to take them?
The history of another disease, tuberculosis, is sadly instructive. For years some southern African nations have had large-scale TB programs with cheap, easy-to-take drugs, but have not made a dent in infection rates. Meanwhile, on black markets, TB drugs have different value depending on whether they are "wet" or "dry." A wet pill is one that a patient puts under his or her tongue in the presence of a health care worker and then spits out later to sell. If South Africans had easy access to H.I.V. drugs, imagine their black market value in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where there are virtually no medications.
A more immediately compelling issue is transmission of H.I.V. from mother to child. In the United States, AZT for mothers-to-be, combined with Caesarean section and other medical care, has practically eliminated transmission during birth, and when Mr. Mbeki dismissed AZT, he angered many physicians. But in a way his stance is perfectly rational.
With no medical intervention, about one-third of children born to an infected mother will contract H.I.V.; AZT treatment alone could cut this rate in half. But the United Nations estimates that 15 percent of H.I.V. positive mothers infect their children through breast-feeding. So even if mother-to-child infection were lowered at birth to 15 percent, six months later it would still be around 30 percent. One might legitimately ask if an AZT program is worth the effort and cost if you still end up with a 30 percent infection rate among infants.
There is no alternative to breast-feeding for most women in South Africa. There is little infant formula, and even if there were more, many rural women would not have clean water to mix it with. Moreover, H.I.V. carries such a social stigma that infected women have been driven from their homes and villages. Few would want to signal infection by bottle-feeding.
What Africa most needs is an H.I.V. vaccine. Although there is an international research effort, pharmaceutical companies, motivated by profit, have not put their formidable resources into a vaccine, since the nations that need it would not be able to pay much for it. Controlling H.I.V. in South Africa now would require an international effort on the scale of the Marshall Plan: creating incentives to produce and distribute medicines and providing clean water, sanitation, clinics, health education, refuge for women and care for children. This is not on the horizon.
That leaves South Africa little choice but to aim for less and hope for an affordable vaccine. The best policy would probably be to provide inexpensive antibiotics to fight the principal opportunistic infections of AIDS and the sexually transmitted diseases that increase H.I.V. infection rates, and to finance preventive education and efforts to destigmatize H.I.V. infection. As Mr. Mbeki says, the Western model of fighting AIDS is of little use to Africa now.

HEADLINE: Braking Seen In New Data On Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
An important measure of future economic activity fell slightly in May, the latest indication that a string of interest rate increases has slowed the economy.
The Index of Leading Economic Indicators declined by 0.1 percent, primarily because of a slowdown in manufacturing and a decline in stock prices, the Conference Board said yesterday. The index held steady in April, according to revised figures, after increasing 0.1 percent in March. 
 The index, which seeks to forecast economic trends for the next three to six months, stands at 106. It was 100 in 1996, its base year.
"The bottom line is that the economy is still growing," said Ken Goldstein, an economist for the Conference Board, a private industry group. "It's not as fast as it was, but it's still growing."
David Orr, chief economist at the First Union Corporation, said: "Primarily, it's further confirmation that the economy is moderating. The brakes are being tapped."
Concerns about rapid expansion and fears of inflation have prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates six times over the last year. The central bank left rates unchanged last week at its most recent meeting but left the door open to the possibility of another rate increase at its next meeting, on Aug. 22.
Employment figures are due out tomorrow, and economists say those numbers, along with inflation indexes, could shed light on what the Fed's next move might be.
"At this point it's not really a question of if the economy is slowing down," said Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "We've seen enough that, indeed, it is happening. The question is whether the Fed has achieved a balance between price stability and sustaining growth. If the Fed is not completely comfortable, it could raise rates."
Mr. Goldstein said that over the last two years key economic indicators had dropped during the spring only to rebound during the summer.
The economy is still exhibiting some strength, according to the report yesterday. The Index of Coincident Indicators, which gauges current activity, rose 0.2 percent in May, bolstered by strength in industrial production and personal income.
The Index of Lagging Indicators, which reflects changes that have occurred, also rose, climbing by 0.2 percent. That gain was fueled by increases in outstanding commercial and industrial loans, prime rates and changes in labor costs.

Western Business Tempers Its New Enthusiasm for North Korea

BYLINE: By SAMUEL LEN 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 5

 BODY:
Foreign business optimism over the thaw between North and South Korea has waned considerably in the few weeks since their leaders met and a symbolic truckload of Coca-Cola crossed into the North, one of orthodox Communism's last redoubts.
The precedent-setting discussions in Pyongyang, the northern capital, between President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and his Communist counterpart, Kim Jong Il, generated a kind of euphoria, and talk was heard of an opening of North Korea, a reclusive nation of 22 million. 
 But now, major American and European businesses are again expressing deep caution. And the Coca-Cola Company, often seen as an icon of Western capitalism that helped lead the way into Communist countries like China and Vietnam, is vague about what it envisions doing in North Korea.
"It is our intention to continue supplying our product to the North Korean market," said John Gustaveson, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in South Korea. "But at this point of time, we don't know yet."
While it will continue to watch the situation in the North, Coke said, it currently has no plans to build a bottling plant there.
Coca-Cola would not comment on the identity of its customers in North Korea, the people who were presumably able to taste that first batch of Coke, and this raised suspicions as to whether the drinks had reached ordinary North Koreans.
But Coca-Cola acknowledged that it was paid for its products. "It was a business transaction and not just a good-will gesture," Mr. Gustaveson said.
Regardless of recent overtures by Seoul and Washington, officials in Pyongyang may still consider the eagerness of Western companies to do business there as a threat. As a result, some South Korean experts said, North Korea might limit the pace of change, remaining highly selective and uncompromising about the investments it accepts.
"They perceive any hint of economic integration as a Trojan horse," said Cho Sung Ryoul, a researcher at the Institute for National Security Policy in Seoul.
Last year, after Washington partly lifted trade sanctions against the North, the American Chamber of Commerce in South Korea sought to send a delegation of American business representatives to Pyongyang. A year later, despite the lifting of more sanctions by Washington, the business group is still waiting for permission to visit.
"We have plenty of companies that are interested," said Jeffrey Jones, the chamber's president. "But it all depends on the government there."
Others said it would take more than tempting products or alluring business plans to get the Pyongyang authorities to grant access to foreign businesses. Hungry for cash to rebuild its battered economy, North Korean officials are still impressed most by hard currency up front.
"They tend to believe that when you want to start a business, you come with a bag full of cash," said Jean-Jacques Grauhar, head of the North Korea business committee at the European Union Chamber of Commerce in South Korea.
Another obstacle to investment in the North is that foreigners do not know whom to deal with. Groups from the North seeking deals with foreign investors include companies that are fronts for the Communist Party, the commerce ministry and the North Korean Army.
"There's no single controlling entity," Mr. Grauhar said. "It's so confusing for foreign companies that the business becomes more limited."
As a representative of a French trading company, Mr. Grauhar lived in Pyongyang for seven years, where he also served as a consultant for other foreign companies wanting to enter the North Korean market. He cautioned that even those companies that gain access to Northern business representatives will face surprises. Some business practices common in North Korea are likely to bedevil foreign executives.
For instance, the North Koreans prefer to meet in hotels and not in their offices, making it difficult to gauge the size of the companies they say they represent. The background and the role of these representatives may also be hard to ascertain.
"It's very important to cross-check everything, that you speak to the right person who has the decision-making powers that he says he has," Mr. Grauhar said. "It takes time, and you have to meet them again and again."
Yoon Sang Ryul, a deputy manager at the Hyundai Asan Company, which oversees the North Korean business interests of the Hyundai group, South Korea's largest conglomerate, said decision-making in the North is cumbersome and often difficult for outsiders to understand.
"Everything progresses from bottom to top by reaching a consensus at each level," he said, "and outsiders are not allowed into the consensus-forming group. Initially, it is important to build relationships rather than focusing on profit-driven models."
Mr. Cho at the Institute for National Security Policy said foreign businesses considering investments in North Korea would do well to remember what South Korea was like in the late 1960's, when its relatively backward economy was being developed under the military dictatorship of Gen. Park Chung Hee.
"The North Koreans seem to have studied Park Chung Hee's economic plan very carefully," Mr. Cho said. "The core of his leadership was introducing a market-based economy while maintaining an authoritarian rule."
General Park used his powers to ensure that concentrating investment in a handful of industries and companies most likely to encourage fast economic growth did not lead to social and political unrest. And Mr. Cho said that foreigners looking to do business in the North should expect to operate within the parameters established by a totalitarian government.
Beyond those considerations, the North -- while it has a large, well-trained work force -- has none of the infrastructure that modern business relies on. The South Korean central bank estimates that it will cost more than $50 billion over the next decade to create the modern manufacturing base, telecommunications and other infrastructure needed to make foreign investment a success.

HEADLINE: Millions Phoning Online, Finding Price Is Right Even if Quality Isn't

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Shortly after moving from Albuquerque to Portland, Ore., last year to teach philosophy, Peter Boghossian discovered he could keep in touch with friends and family around the country by placing telephone calls over the Internet. Since then, he has not paid a cent for long-distance service.
Like millions of others, Mr. Boghossian has begun to slash the cost of his telephone calls by plugging into a fast-growing trend for Internet-based voice communication. Seeking to tap the industry's potential, nearly two dozen companies have begun offering long-distance calls over the Web -- free or substantially cheaper than otherwise available. 
 "Why would you pay one penny for something when you can get it for free?" asked Mr. Boghossian, who is 33. Or to cite Jurgen Habermas, a contemporary philosopher who is a common reference in Mr. Boghossian's courses, "When technology gets cheaper and more accessible it has a liberating effect across the board."
The quality still has a way to go, with the best of conversations resembling a choppy cell-phone call and the worst a wobbly walkie-talkie transmission. But much of the growing interest in so-called Internet telephony has to do with its relative simplicity.
Most users need only an Internet hookup, headphones and a microphone plugged into a computer. Then, after shopping around with companies providing Internet telephone service, one can start placing domestic and international calls to people with any kind of phone.
According to an estimate from Jeff Pulver, an independent analyst of the Web-based voice communication industry, roughly 15 million people in the United States use voice communication over the Internet, compared with 5 million a year ago. In addition, there are several million users abroad, where the popularity of services allowing people to call the United States has spread.
Counting on rapid growth rates, the combined revenue of Web talk providers is seen growing at a compound annual rate of 200 percent a year over the next several years, to $16.5 billion by 2004 from $208 million in 2000, according to the International Data Corporation, a research company in Framingham, Mass. More of the revenue is expected to come from selling advertising on the companies' sites than from fees for placing calls.
"As an outside observer I'm supposed to have a jaded view of this new whiz-bang stuff," said Mark Winther, vice president for telecommunications research at International Data. "But the brilliance of voice communications on the Internet is in the merging of the Internet's power with the ease of use of the telephone. It's a no-brainer that this industry will take off."
One company, Dialpad.com of Menlo Park, Calif., exemplifies the industry's expansion. Using technology developed by Korean engineers that aids the transmission of voice calls over the Internet, the company offers free service to any number in the United States from anywhere in the world. Such calls might cost 5 to 25 cents a minute through a conventional long-distance carrier and as much as $1.25 a minute if the caller was in, say, Brazil. (The calls are not altogether free, because they require dialing a local access number, for which the local phone company collects either a flat or per-minute charge for a local call.)
Dialpad says it has signed up 7.5 million users in the last seven and a half months without any promotion.
"We've grown grass-roots style through viral marketing," said Peter Hewitt, Dialpad's vice president for communications.
Essentially, this means that users of Dialpad's technology informed others about it by communicating over their system or through word of mouth, much the way free e-mail addresses on services like Microsoft's Hotmail began to spread several years ago. Analysts say Dialpad's growth has been much quicker than its free e-mail counterparts.
"Dialpad is probably the fastest-growing Internet service ever," Mr. Winther said.
Like most other Internet start-ups, Dialpad loses money, though it does not disclose how much because it is privately held. Instead, the company prefers to emphasize such growth indicators as the doubling of its work force in a year, to 40 from 20. Eventually, Dialpad hopes to become profitable through the sale of advertising on its site.
"When harnessing change-the-world technology with such growth rates, you can be assured real estate on your site will get quite valuable," Mr. Hewitt said.
Other companies, like Net2Phone Inc. of Hackensack, N.J., offer long-distance calling all over the world, but charge for service. A call anywhere in the United States costs 3.9 cents a minute. A call to the Netherlands from the United States costs 5 cents a minute, compared with $1.25 to $2.05 a minute using AT&T.
Companies like Dialpad have made it simpler to place long-distance calls over the Internet by discarding cumbersome credit card registrations. But the underlying technology is not so simple, explaining in part the current limitations of the industry.
Transmissions of information online, like e-mail, other written data, or even voice and video, are generally sent in small packets of information over the World Wide Web. When a real-time exchange of information is not necessary, as is the case in most e-mail exchanges, a small delay in the delivery of the packets is not that important. But in real-time voice conversations, these delays can make a big difference.
When taken together with an Internet connection of dubious quality, an Internet voice call can become risky. Often, if voice packets are delayed beyond a given threshold, software programs will guess at the packets' content and transmit a distorted version of what was said.
While the effect can be disconcerting -- like having a discussion next to a windswept thoroughfare -- companies are working to improve the technology. In the meantime, an individual can improve voice calls over the Web by using a quality Internet connection, with a high-speed telephone line, for instance.
Despite its limitations, Internet telephony has caught the attention of large telecommunications companies. This is no wonder, given even conservative estimates that the nascent industry, which first showed promise after growing in popularity among hard-pressed graduate students in the mid-1990's, will account for at least 15 percent of long-distance traffic in the United States in five years, up from roughly 1 percent today.
In Europe, for instance, Deutsche Telekom has introduced its own Web-based voice communication services in an effort to capture part of the market. And in the United States, AT&T, after introducing its own Web-based voice products, led a group that plans to invest $1.4 billion in Net2Phone.
"We recognize that Internet telephony has evolved from a geeky, hobbyist thing into something we want included in our array of offerings," said Glenn Edens, president for strategic ventures at AT&T.
Not everyone is bullish on the prospects for the Internet-based voice communication industry. Skeptics point to the telephone's convenience and the trend of ever more competitive prices for traditional telecommunications services, regardless of Internet telephony's growth.
"I don't doubt that Internet telephony is a cheapo substitute, but a telephone is more convenient and getting cheaper," said Amanda McCarthy, a telecommunications analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "Plus, what type of advertising are you going to want to sell for people who are such penny-pinchers?"
Another concern for the budding industry is the looming possibility of taxation. Traditional telecommunications companies have lobbied to make Internet telephony companies subject to the same treatment as other communications companies, including taxes and fees paid to the local phone companies that complete the calls. (Such fees are already assessed by carriers in some foreign countries on calls placed over the Internet.)
Opponents of this proposal, though, assert that potential investors would be scared away and that the creative capacity of the industry to hone its technology would be stifled if taxes were introduced. So far, the Federal Communications Commission has been reticent to introduce any taxes, fees or other regulatory measures.
But it could only be a matter of time before these issues come to a head if more consumers make long-distance voice calls over the Internet and prices for conventional services fall further as a result.
"Either prices go down and the current regulatory system is discarded or you start to regulate the Internet," said Nicholas Economides, an economics professor at New York University whose specialty is telecommunications networks. "Clearly, for now, the first choice is better for consumers."

Profit Jitters For Software Cause Shares To Tumble

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled yesterday after earnings warnings from software makers sent investors scrambling to sell technology shares.
Weakness in semiconductor shares led the way lower for the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, while blue chips also suffered. 
 The Nasdaq dropped 128.83 points, or 3.2 percent, to 3,863.10. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.07, or 0.7 percent, to 10,483.60, dragged lower by I.B.M. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 23.09, or 1.6 percent, to 1,446.23.
"We're seeing a fairly broad devastation of the semiconductor sector, and that has been the sector that has provided the best gains for the year when looking at technology," said Barry Hyman, market strategist for Ehrenkrantz, King, Nussbaum.
Investors had little to celebrate as they returned from the Fourth of July holiday after three software companies said their earnings would fall short of projections.
Among them was the business software maker Computer Associates International, which fell 21 7/8, to 29 1/4, after it said its results would be far below Wall Street's expectations.
The company's stock recovered somewhat after reaching a 52-week low of 28 1/2 early in the session, but its drop of 42.8 percent was still the biggest percentage loss on the New York Stock Exchange.
BMC Software, which also makes business software, warned that its profits would fall well shy of expectations. BMC fell 14 3/16, to 2 15/16.
BMC and and Computer Associates cited weak sales of software for mainframes for the profit outlook, and that sent shares of I.B.M., the world's top maker of mainframe computers, down 6 1/8, to 103 3/4.
The security software developer Entrust Technologies plunged 40 1/2, to 36 5/8, after saying its second-quarter earnings would miss projections by 75 percent because of delays in closing sales.
The spate of profit warnings unnerved the market in the week leading up to the beginning of the reporting season for the second-quarter.
"Until we get through earnings statements, we are going to get a lot of concern each time one of these negative preannouncements comes out," said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Kirlin Holdings.
News from the software giant Oracle added to the fray. The company's shares tumbled 7 7/8, to 72 5/16, and topped the Nasdaq's most-active list after the departure of the company's president, Raymond J. Lane.
As for chip makers, they suffered after Salomon Smith Barney lowered its investment rating on the semiconductor sector, sending the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index down 9.32 percent.
Analysts said the action by Salomon prompted some investors to cash in profits in an industry that traditionally experiences a slow summer.
Intel, the world's largest chip maker, weighed heavily on the Nasdaq with a drop of 5 1/4, to 131 5/8. Applied Materials, another company involved with semiconductors, fell 9 1/8, to 83 7/16.
Losses in blue-chip shares were limited by strength in the diversified conglomerate Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which rose 4 3/8, to 88 7/16.
Drug stocks also fared well, with Eli Lilly rising 5 3/4, to 104 1/2, as investors continued to cheer its newest product in development, a treatment for sepsis.
Oil shares were also under pressure after Saudi Arabia vowed to produce more oil to lower prices. Exxon Mobil fell 23 9/64, to 76 15/16.

Treasuries Advance
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, as signs of slower growth and inflation bolstered optimism that the Federal Reserve was near the end of a cycle of interest rate increases.
"Bonds have value," said Hal Woolley, who is buying Treasury bonds for the $5 billion in fixed income he helps oversee at the Bessemer Trust Company. "All the indicators are saying inflation is in check."
The 30-year bond rose 5/32, to 105 17/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.86 percent from 5.87 percent on Monday. The 10-year note was unchanged at 103 24/32. Its yield remained at 5.98 percent.

An internal British debate over adopting the euro grew more intense today when the government published data that showed overseas investment in Britain had soared to a record despite the strength of the British pound.
The data undercut complaints by foreign companies that the pound's strength was damaging them by making Britain an expensive place to manufacture goods for export. 
 Further fanning the debate, Prime Minister Tony Blair acknowledged today that there were some economic benefits from euro membership. But he insisted that Britain should maintain its "prepare and decide" policy on signing up for the currency.
The euro, adopted by 11 of the European Union's 15 members, has fallen sharply against the pound and the dollar since its introduction 18 months ago. That weakness has made British exports to Europe, in particular, more expensive.
The statements from politicians and business leaders have followed weeks of dispute within the British government over how to present its policy on the single currency -- either bullish or bearish -- as foreign manufacturers like Nissan Motor, Toyota Motor and Mitsubishi insist that the pound's strength against the euro is unacceptable to them.
These companies, along with Nestle and others, have called in recent days for Britain to commit itself to joining the euro. Such a move would lock the pound into an immutable relationship with the euro-zone and remove the risk of exchange rate swings from manufacturers' calculations and export sales.
In figures announced today, Sir David Wright, head of the Department of Trade and Industry's Invest in Britain Bureau, said foreign investment here rose to a record $382 billion in the fiscal year -- almost half of it from the United States -- 25 percent higher than the prior year.
"There is nothing which suggests that the attitude of foreign companies is being significantly affected by the policy with which we are all familiar in respect to the single currency," Mr. Wright said.
Britain prides itself as the favored site among outside investors seeking a beachhead for sales into the European Union.
But there is evidence that the pound's strength against the euro is eroding the readiness of manufacturers to risk the extra currency-driven costs of doing business here.
This year alone, the Ford Motor Company and BMW A.G. have pulled out of British automotive plants, and Nissan has hinted it might move production of a new subcompact elsewhere.
Adding to pressures to commit to the euro, Mr. Blair faces a competitive challenge from the strengthening economies of France and Germany -- the twin motors of European integration -- which could leave Britain on the sidelines.
But Mr. Blair faces a domestic political challenge pulling in the opposite direction. With his popularity at its lowest in three years, a new opinion survey suggested that more than 70 percent of Britons oppose abandoning the pound.
In Parliament today, Mr. Blair insisted that Britain stick to its present view, known as the prepare-and-decide policy, that it would join a successful European currency if the euro zone's performance met British economic criteria and if Britons voted for it in a referendum.
"Membership of a successful single currency would be good for British jobs, mortgages and industry but it must be dependent on the economic tests," Mr. Blair said.
But, in remarks typifying British ambivalence, he said, "What would be disastrous for British jobs and inward investment, what would mean the immediate loss of jobs and investment in this country, is to rule out the euro altogether."

HEADLINE: New Philanthropists Put Donations to Work;
Shifting Away From Aiding Big Charities

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
It isn't his father's philanthropy.
In Sioux Falls, S.D., where Scott Reardon grew up, giving meant supporting the local United Way or leading a fund-raising drive for a school in the area. 
 But for Mr. Reardon, the president of the Dakon Group, a venture capital firm in Sioux Falls that backs communications and technology companies, the impulse to give is different. "I don't feel attached to the local community," said Mr. Reardon, who divides his time between Sioux Falls and Darien, Conn. And he does not find appealing what he described as "write a check and walk away" charity.
Keenly aware of his own success, Mr. Reardon, 51, said that he was interested in seeing his charitable giving have a geographically wider impact, with the potential to create greater changes. "I ask myself, 'Where can I make a difference?' " he said.
His current choice is the Deutsche Bank Microcredit Development Fund, a program that funnels money to organizations that grant loans, often of just a few hundred dollars, to individual entrepreneurs, typically women. Mr. Reardon, rather than simply giving money to the organization, serves as the fund's chairman and helps decide which local organizations scattered around the world will receive money.
There have always been a few wealthy people whose philanthropy was directed at sweeping change, and who often chose to start a new charity, said Paul G. Schervish, director of the Social Welfare Research Institute at Boston College, who helped conduct a new study on wealth and philanthropy. But today giving in this nontraditional form is spreading among the ranks of the wealthy, he said, and not just the superrich, high-profile technology gurus like William H. Gates or the many dot-commers making their fortunes from the Internet. As they are able to make more substantial gifts, they are increasingly demanding that charities show they can produce the kinds of specific results familiar to those in the business world but not always prized in the past by charitable organizations.
At the same time, affluent givers seem especially eager to have a more direct role. They seem to want to carry over to charity the entrepreneurship that helped make them successful. And many want to address the other side of the extraordinary wealth created in recent years: the problems of poverty, hunger and the lack of access to health care and housing.
"There is a return to the Carnegie philosophy -- getting engaged while you're alive," said Eugene R. Tempel, executive director of the Indiana University Center on Philanthropy. Among the changes, he added, is a shift away from gifts to established charities as the public has become increasingly skeptical of these organizations.
Today's philanthropists, many of whom do represent new wealth, particularly seek out fresh initiatives, said Mr. Tempel, adding, "It's just a generation trying to flex its muscles and do things differently."
The recent survey Mr. Schervish helped conduct, an anonymous study of wealthy people by Deutsche Bank's Bankers Trust Private Banking unit, whose clients provide some of the microcredit program's financing, suggests that Mr. Reardon has plenty of company in his desire to participate in a kind of charity he considers both personal and effective, Mr. Schervish said.
The survey, which was not limited to the company's clients, probed the thinking of the very rich -- nearly all 112 respondents were from households whose net worth was at least $5 million. The findings of the survey, which has not yet been released, were made available to The New York Times.
While those surveyed are only a small sampling of the roughly 600,000 households in the United States with wealth exceeding $5 million, Mr. Schervish said, their responses offer some insight into the behavior of the very wealthy.
Like most Americans, they said they were convinced of the importance of giving. The overwhelming majority describe themselves as self-made, deriving some or all of their wealth from entrepreneurial and professional efforts. On average, they gave to charity $1.2 million, or about a fifth of their family income, in 1997.
The respondents also favored giving through their own foundation, trust or gift fund. Two-thirds reported using such a vehicle.
Of course many wealthy people view philanthropy primarily as a social milieu: sitting on the board of an opera guild, say, with three dozen or so other prominent figures. Many others prefer to limit their involvement to signing checks or to making a donation that leads to a building at a college or hospital engraved with their name.
But a lot of people with money are increasingly interested in taking a more active role in their charity.
"We don't tend to give to big institutions because they have support," said Robert H. Arnow, whose family has long been active in charity. Mr. Arnow, 75, is the semiretired chairman of Weiler Arnow Management, a New York real estate company. He and his wife, Joan, are involved in a variety of causes, ranging from the arts to after-school programs, but he has become most concerned over the Bedouins in the Middle East and their lack of educational opportunities. Traditional Bedouin social and economic structures have been severely undermined as they make the transition from their ancient, nomadic way of life to an urban society.
The former chairman of Ben-Gurion University in Israel, Mr. Arnow pushed to establish the university's Center for Bedouin Studies and Development. He is now considering building an endowment for it.
While Mr. Arnow works closely with the university and the center to back initiatives like developing a special set of math and science courses for Bedouin high school students, he is not operating through an organized charity. "It's one man's efforts," he explained.
Closer to home, Burton M. Freeman, 74, who retired two years ago as a lawyer for Bankers Trust, is also taking a hands-on approach. Through his family foundation, Mr. Freeman has started a program that has allowed some 600 third graders in East Harlem to each buy $50 worth of books. He accompanies the classes to the Bank Street Bookstore, a children's bookstore near Columbia University. At one such session, Mr. Freeman helped a girl pick out a book on human biology and then one on evolution featuring the Galapagos Islands. "I get some real big thrills," he said. Mr. Freeman works with the chancellor's office at the New York City Board of Education to identify some third-grade classes and, through an associated not-for-profit fund, to finance the program.
To be sure, education, which appears to be a perennial favorite cause, was cited by 60 percent of the respondents in the Bankers Trust survey when they were asked which policy issues they wanted to influence. The category of poverty, inequality, hunger, affordable housing and health care for the uninsured was listed by nearly half. Arts and culture was named by only a third, followed by family stability and economic growth.
While many entrepreneurs say their business activities accomplish worthy social goals by employing people, according to Mr. Schervish, they also seem to increasingly favor endeavors that blend aspects of capitalism with charitable goals. Mr. Reardon, for example, was attracted by the micro-loans idea because it bypassed governments and bureaucracies and harnessed the power of the marketplace to accomplish social change.
Scott Berrie, 34, whose father started Russ Berrie & Company, an Oakland, N.J., maker of picture frames and stuffed animals, is also interested in blurring traditional lines. While Mr. Berrie is active in his father's foundation, which finances a variety of local initiatives, including Dorot, a New York agency for the elderly, the younger Mr. Berrie wants to combine his passion for doing good with his business. And he has taken an approach similar to one made famous by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, the ice cream entrepreneurs. Mr. Berrie recently helped found an eyeglass company, Scojo Vision, that will give 5 percent of any pretax profits to Helen Keller Worldwide, a New York charity that focuses on providing eye care and glasses to the poor.
"The main difference in the way our generations think about philanthropy is we think about it holistically, that work and philanthropy should be combined," he said.
Nearly all the survey's respondents also said that they had volunteered for a favorite cause in the last three years. While 71 percent served on a charity's board, many were also active in other ways, helping to raise funds or plan a specific project.
"A lot of people find meaning in direct service," Mr. Tempel said.
Virginia W. Meyer, whose great-grandfather built a fortune from coal mining in Czechoslovakia, for example, elected to spend her 50th birthday last year building a house in Jacksonville, Fla., for Habitat for Humanity, the seventh such project she has done for the charity. "I like to work with my hands," she said. "It gives me great satisfaction" to construct the house and know who will eventually live in it, she added, emphasizing what she called the "intimacy" involved.
Her husband, Juan, also noted the selfish aspects of participating in charity. "At the end of the day, it feels good," he said. "It feels good to be doing something creative and, at the same time, creating a better environment."
Ms. Meyer is interested in bringing some of that direct involvement to her family's Panwy Foundation. "We were doing a little too much check writing before," she said.
The foundation, which has supported charities geared to strengthening the family, has tried to be entrepreneurial in its financing. Interested in preventing child abuse, Ms. Meyer discovered and supported a pilot program in Connecticut, where she lives, that helps new parents cope with the stresses of child rearing. The program, Healthy Families Connecticut, has expanded to 12 sites and recently received state financing.
That is just the kind of start-up venture the foundation prefers to back. "The problem with the very large organization is impact," Mr. Meyer said, and the family prefers to play a more significant role in a charity's success. That way, "everybody feels good," he said.

Rewarding Hard Work With Penalty

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
HER name is Maria, she is 28, she has three children, 3, 6 and 8, no husband -- and this is where the stereotype ends. She's a full-time receptionist for a communications company, has worked for more than three years and has every intention of continuing to make her way in life without welfare.
But the government could undermine her resolve. 
 In April, Maria lost the subsidy that helped her pay for child care, under a program for working parents. She lost the money because she earns too much. The city told her that her salary of $2,666 a month ($31,992 a year) was $29 more a month than the regulations allowed.
A rule is a rule, right? Except the city, which is supposed to update the income ceilings for child care subsidies once a year to reflect changes in the cost of living, has not done so since 1990. And while its ceilings are generous, working parents are starting to feel the financial pressure.
Since January, the city has deemed 347 families ineligible for financial help. The subsidies will be restored in 88 of the 347 cases, said Jack Deacy, communications director for the Administration for Children's Services.
So the numbers of those hurt represent only a small fraction of the 39,000 parents who get subsidized child care in New York City. But children's advocates say that the impact is larger than the numbers imply. Many parents, who have to have their eligibility reviewed yearly, are being told at their recertification interviews that they no longer qualify for financial help. And the impact on those who lose financing, or fear they will, can be disruptive.
Some, like Maria, are scrambling to find alternative care for their children without jeopardizing their jobs. Still others on waiting lists are being told that they are ineligible for the program, which is financed through federal block grants and city funds. Parents contribute to their children's care based on their income.
"I have a number of families on the over-income waiting list who are not really over income," said Deborah Carroll, a coordinator for Youth and Family Services at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House. "But you cannot take on new families that aren't eligible. It's very arbitrary."
If the income ceilings had been raised, Maria could earn $38,363 and still qualify for the program, according to the Welfare Reform Network, a welfare advocacy group. Maria, who insisted that her last name not be printed, was contributing $67 a week for the care of her children until the last week in April. Now the same care is costing $225 a week -- $175 from Maria, $50 from her mother.
Amma Appiah, an office manager with a nonprofit education organization, has been waiting since March to find out if she will lose financial help for her 6-year-old son. The city told her then that she earned $100 a month too much for the program. She is appealing.
MS. APPIAH, 25, now contributes $5 a week toward her son's care. She can afford more, she said -- but not the full cost of $240 a week. She recoils at the specter of going back on welfare, as she was a few years ago: "I'd rather die," she said.
The city is apologetic. The villain seems to have been the bureaucracy. Child care programs were transferred from the Human Resources Administration to the Administration for Children's Services two years ago. Somehow, until then, nobody noticed the problem, or chose not to.
"It's unclear to us why the income levels were not updated," said Mr. Deacy of Children's Services. He theorized that because in 1990, the city set the highest income ceiling allowed -- 275 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of two, compared with 200 percent in many other parts of the state -- most families qualified for a long time, even under the outdated figures.
Sandy Socolar, an official of the Welfare Reform Network, wonders if the city's affluence is having an impact. "For a long time, mothers could find a relative to take care of their children," she said. "But with more and more women in the work force, it's getting harder to make arrangements."
Mr. Deacy said that the Administration for Children's Services was submitting new income standards to the state by July 30. That may be optimistic, since city officials said months ago that they would submit the figures to the state by May. Then, once the state has them, Albany has to approve the figures. The city will apply the new income ceilings whenever they are official, Mr. Deacy said.
Maria will probably reapply when new standards go into effect. In the meantime, she scrimps.

HEADLINE: Clinton Signs International Agreements to Help Protect Children

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 5

 BODY:
President Clinton signed two international agreements today, one intended to prevent anyone under 18 from being sent to war and the other to protect children from exploitation by the sex trade and other forms of human trafficking.
"To give life to our dream of a global economy that lifts all people, first we must stand together for all children," Mr. Clinton said. Several hundred thousand children are fighting in wars, some in brutal civil conflicts. And tens of millions of children are trafficked around the world as bonded labor or sex slaves, according to United Nations estimates. 
 The two agreements Mr. Clinton signed are formally known as the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. Both were approved in May by the General Assembly as additions to the 1990 Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the United States also signed, in 1995, but has never ratified.
That core covenant on children's rights has been ratified by 191 nations, with only one other holdout, Somalia, which is effectively without a government.
An American signature is important in giving a measure momentum around the world, officials say. But United Nations officials and diplomats from many countries have grown accustomed to seeing the administration in Washington back away from a fight to ratify agreements after meeting resistance in the Pentagon or in the Senate, which has been reluctant to approve treaties on a range of issues, from the environment to international criminal law to arms control.
Mr. Clinton said he would send the agreements to the Senate promptly for approval within the year.
It took more than six years of international negotiations to win Pentagon approval for the measure on child soldiers. Until January, the American military had balked because the agreement sought a blanket ban on recruitment under the age of 18 and the United States recruited 17-year-olds with parental consent. After acknowledging that the measure could affect fewer than 3,000 of the 1.4 million Americans in uniform, the Pentagon dropped its objections.
The agreement on child soldiers, which is intended to apply not only to national armies but also to guerrilla forces or irregulars who recruit, often forcibly, the majority of the 300,000 children thought to be involved in armed conflict, asks governments to raise to at least 16 the minimum age of recruitment, and demands that no one under 18 be involved in combat.
The second agreement signed by President Clinton makes it a criminal offense to sell, trade or use children for a variety of purposes including sexual exploitation and pornography. The measure was first proposed by Cuba and Guatemala, among other nations, because of other perceived violations of children's rights, including the selling of organs and forced adoptions, said Marjorie Newman-Williams, communications director of Unicef, the United Nations children's fund.
But with the rapid growth in human trafficking, especially the sale of girls into brothels in Asia, the measure has gained very wide support in the United States, Europe and other regions. Six nations now have signed the agreement; 10 ratifications are needed for it to come into force.

WorldCom and Sprint Plan To End Merger Agreement
Facing resistance from regulators in the United States and Europe to their proposed $115 billion merger, WorldCom and Sprint are planning to announce by early next week that they will abandon the deal, executives close to both companies said.
The move could immediately turn the companies into takeover targets for both American companies and foreign companies that have been seeking a foothold in the United States. Sprint has already received informal overtures from both Deutsche Telekom of Germany and from BellSouth. Shares of Sprint fell 93.75 cents, to $53.50, while WorldCom rose 37.5 cents, to $45.50. Page C6. 

With the merger between Sprint and WorldCom all but called off, Sprint executives who were given stock options as an incentive to stay can cash them in now and leave. C6.
 
Stocks Plunge on Profit Warnings
Stocks tumbled after earnings warnings from software makers sent investors scrambling to sell technology shares. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 128.83 points, or 3.2 percent, to 3,863.10. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.07 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,483.60, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 23.09 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,446.23. C10.
 
New Share Sale for Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs Group said that it would let its former partners sell as many as 18 million shares of stock in an offering that could be bigger than the firm's $3.66 billion initial public offering last year. C6.
 
Leading Indicators Down Slightly
The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, an important measure of future economic activity, fell 0.1 percent in May, the latest indication that a string of interest rate increases has slowed the economy. C6.
 
Optimism Wanes Over North Korea
Foreign business optimism over the thaw between North and South Korea has waned considerably in the few weeks since their leaders met and a symbolic truckload of Coca-Cola crossed into the North. The discussions between President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea and his Communist counterpart, Kim Jong Il, generated a kind of euphoria, and talk was heard of an opening of North Korea. But now, major American and European businesses are again expressing deep caution. And Coca-Cola, often seen as an icon of Western capitalism that helped lead the way into Communist countries like China and Vietnam, is vague about what it envisions doing in North Korea. C4.
 
Euro Debate Intensifies in Britain
A British debate over whether to join the euro grew more intense when the government published data that showed overseas investment in Britain has soared to a record despite the strength of the British pound. The data undercut complaints by foreign companies that the pound's strength is damaging them by making Britain an expensive place to manufacture goods for export. C4.
 
Have Car, Will Travel for Cheap Gas
Wedded to their cars, Europe's motorists have long been the target of governments that seek revenue by cranking up taxes on gasoline. Consequently, drivers are willing to cross international borders in search of cheap gas, driven by taxes that vary widely. A1.
 
New Economy, With an Old Twist
While many business gurus, and even some well-trained economists, say that we now live in a "network society" in which profits and economic growth can reach heights not yet seen, it is the old-economy idea of economies of scale that is making the difference. Jeff Madrick: Economic Scene. C2.

As Language Erodes, Armenian Exiles Fear Bigger Loss

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: TENAFLY, N.J.

 BODY:
Hagup H. Asadourian communes with shadows. Some are dark and frightening, like the shades of Turkish soldiers who in 1915 herded him and his family from his Armenian village, leaving him to watch his mother and four of his sisters die of typhus in the Syrian desert.
Some are sweet, revolving around the raucous Armenian-language plays put on in the 1920's at the Yiddish Theater at Madison and 27th Street in Manhattan. And some are poignant, like the reunion with his sister, the only surviving member of his immediate family, 39 years after they lost each other one night near the Dead Sea as they fled with a ragged band of Armenian orphans from Syria to Jerusalem. 
 But his battle to preserve memory, the theme of all his 14 books, cannot save him from the destructive march of time. And time, to the rapidly vanishing community of exiled Armenians, will soon finish the work that, he says, was begun by the Turkish army 85 years ago. Mr. Asadourian's latest book, "The Smoldering Generation," is, he said, "about the inevitable loss of our culture."
"No one takes the place of those who are gone," he said, seated in front of a picture window that looked out on a carefully groomed garden at his home here. "Your children do not understand you in this country. You cannot blame them."
As he spoke, his son, John, who has used a wheelchair since a stroke, jerked himself into position behind his father. He listened, his head cocked slightly to one side, with a grimace.
The death of more than one million Armenians in Turkey is often cited as the opening act for the genocidal campaigns that convulsed the 20th century. Although the Allied powers condemned the Turks during World War I, there was no effort to hold them accountable for actions against the Armenians after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. The magnitude of the deaths and ultimate indifference may have led Hitler, on the eve of the invasion of Poland, to remind his followers, "Who still speaks of the extermination of the Armenians?"
The Ottoman Turks, who feared a nationalist revolt like the one that had convulsed the Balkans, spent six months in 1915 driving most of the two million Armenians out of Turkey. In what Armenians call genocide, at least a million were forced to march in pathetic columns into the deserts of what are now Syria and Iraq, where several hundred thousand were slaughtered or left to die of starvation and disease. By 1923, Armenia says, 1.5 million were dead and orphanages throughout the Middle East were flooded with some 200,000 destitute Armenian children.
The Turkish government still vigorously denies the event. It says that some of the Armenians killed were rebels during World War I and others were victims of the fighting and the widespread famine. The Turks say they escorted Armenians away from the fighting for their own safety. They concede that, because of the war, some unfortunate incidents took place, but say that during this time fewer than half a million Armenians died along with two million Turks.
Much of the world of the Armenians, first mentioned by the Greeks and Persians in 6 B.C., has been reduced to dusty, forgotten relics in present-day Turkey. Officially, the Republic of Armenia has a population of about 3.4 million, but the poor economy, the recent earthquake and the ethnic conflict that is continuing between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh have caused at least a third of the population to leave in the last decade, Armenian scholars say.
After World War I, about 25,000 Armenians came to the United States. Some of their tales survive in small American collections of Armenian literature and poetry, like the 15,000 volumes in the Zohrab Center at 630 Second Avenue in Manhattan. But these books lie unread by all but a few scholars. Little of the work has been translated.
Zarmine Boghosian, the principal of the Holy Martyrs Armenian Day School in Queens, said she, like most who speak Armenian, failed in her effort to bring the literature to her children. And though she gives her 100 elementary schoolchildren daily lessons in Armenian, she concedes that as they go on in school the language is swiftly forgotten.
"When the sons of an Armenian school principal can no longer grasp an Armenian work from the bookshelf and read it," she said, "it means that we can no longer dream of maintaining this literature."
The loss is not only literary, but severs Armenians from the perspective of their parents and grandparents. Being Armenian, for many, is little more than a label.
"We are losing our multigenerational thread," said Aris Sevag, the managing editor of the English-language Armenian Reporter, a weekly newspaper published in Queens. "We are losing our ability to understand the Armenian gestalt, our inner world."
Yet even as the Armenian language disappears, American scholars have been turning their attention to Armenian history. Peter Balakian, a professor of English at Colgate University, said that in the late 1960's and early 1970's, the rising awareness of human rights brought more attention to the Armenian diaspora.
"The Armenian genocide is perhaps the hottest discourse in the genocide studies arena and is being taught nationwide in high schools and universities," said Dr. Balakian, who is of Armenian descent.
"Americans, who once used the phrase 'the starving Armenians' in daily speech for decades in the earlier part of the century, are now relearning this history," he continued. "I believe that this time the history of the Armenian genocide is here to stay."
Armenians have found that the present is something in which the dead hold no shares.
"My grandmother came from Bursa, a town in western Turkey," said Aram Arkun, a historian. "A man from her town meticulously compiled a manuscript with pictures, sketches and writings on the town's customs, traditions, notable families and history. This was common. A couple hundred of these local histories were published; perhaps hundreds more were not. I found the daughters of this man. They had thrown the book, which they could not read, in the trash after his death. Now a little piece of our history and our culture is gone forever."
The decimation of their universe further impoverishes cultural studies, scholars say, as Western culture relied on Armenian monks to rescue works by such ancient Greek writers as Philo and Eusebius from oblivion.
"You lose expressions used in households, terms of endearment and intellectual concepts," said the Rev. Krikor Maksoudian, who once taught Armenian history and literature at Columbia University. "Each language has its own way of describing and asserting human experience. Each contains the temper of the tradition itself. None of this can be captured fully in translation. We are losing another perspective on the world."
Although there were once 10 major Armenian-language daily newspapers in the United States, there is just one left, published in California. Armenian clubs have closed, social societies have been disbanded and cultural events have dwindled. Proceedings of Armenian meetings, when they take place, are usually in English (except at church affairs, where Armenian clergy nearly always speak in Armenian first, then English).
Mr. Asadourian, 97, said he had accepted that his writing would not halt the slide to obliteration. (His two sons were raised speaking Armenian; his granddaughter speaks it, but does not write very well.) Rather, he writes to give a voice to the 331 people with whom he trudged into Syria in September 1915. Only 29 of those people survived.
"You can never really write what happened anyway," Mr. Asadourian said. "It is too ghoulish. I still fight with myself to remember it as it was. You write because you have to. It all wells up inside of you. It is like a hole that fills constantly with water and no amount of bailing will empty it. This is why I continue."
There are American memoir writers, like Michael J. Arlen ("Passage to Ararat") and Peter Balakian ("Black Dog of Fate"), who struggle with the meaning of the genocide for the children of survivors. But their works, written in English, are a step away from the works of their forefathers.
"They put the Armenian experience into therapeutic form," said Chris Zakian, a book editor of Armenian descent. "These memoirs get the experience out of us. But then what happens? It is another act on the road to assimilation. It helps us unload the onerous bits about being Armenian. There is no continuation of a tradition."
Mr. Asadourian, who recently translated his granddaughters' poems into Armenian, has already begun to donate his papers to a library in what was once Soviet Armenia. He is sending them there because, although the historical experience, dialect and written script are different, "at least they still speak Armenian."
His passion, however, burns deep. He refused to halt the painful story of his deportation despite having to reach for a bottle of pills wrapped with a piece of white gauze. He took a deep breath before plunging into the last bit of detail, one he had left out of the lengthy chronology.
"When it came time to bury my mother, I had to get two other small boys to help me carry her body up to a well where they were dumping the corpses," he said. "We did this so the jackals would not eat them. The stench was terrible. There were swarms of black flies buzzing over the opening. We pushed her in feet first, and the other boys, to escape the smell, ran down the hill. I stayed. I had to watch. I saw her head, as she fell, bang on one side of the well and then the other before she disappeared. At the time, I did not feel anything at all."
He stopped, visibly shaken.
"What kind of a son is that?" he asked hoarsely.
The house fell silent. Mr. Asadourian's own son, as motionless as his father during the story, flipped the electric switch on his chair and rolled out of the room.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Populist Themes Set Gore Apart From Clinton

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 5

 BODY:
After a spring of ever-shifting strategies and messages, Vice President Al Gore has turned to more red-meat, populist themes that appeal to the Democratic faithful.
Today Mr. Gore criticized drug companies for the second time in three days, accusing them of "price gouging" and putting "millions of dollars" into a "phony" group "which is polluting the public airwaves with special interest TV ads designed to deceive the American people about a prescription drug benefit." 
 Last week he crusaded against "Big Oil," suggesting that high fuel prices in the Midwest could be due to collusion. Before that he portrayed himself as acting on behalf of economically pressed Americans, "not just the ones who think comfortably about their savings over Scotch in the club."
Mr. Gore's populist appeals have allowed him to speak in a voice distinct from President Clinton's, tying the vice president back to his own record in Congress where, as a young lawmaker, he fought excessive drug company profits.
Four years ago, when he ran for re-election, Mr. Clinton largely shied away from such pointed appeals to class and against the powerful when his advisers decided that the election should be fought on issues of values.
Mr. Gore faces challenges Mr. Clinton did not. Unlike Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore has been lagging slightly behind his Republican opponent in recent polls, in part because Democrats are not rallying behind him as enthusiastically as Republicans are supporting Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And, on his left, Mr. Gore has to contend with Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate running on the Green Party line. Mr. Nader is drawing about 5 percent in the polls, but some Gore supporters fear that, in a tight race, even a small percentage could hurt Mr. Gore in key states.
So the vice president's advisers and Democratic supporters say the themes now being sounded by the vice president serve several purposes. For one, they are supposed to stoke the perception that Mr. Bush, whose campaign has raised record sums, is the candidate of the well off.
"He's taken $90 million in this campaign, which is unprecedented, and time and again he took the side of the special interests," said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman.
The tones also rally the Democratic faithful. Mr. Gore appeared today before some of his party's staunchest supporters, a teachers union gathering here in Philadelphia, and a conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Cincinnati. The audience at the American Federation of Teachers convention here was often cheering as Mr. Gore criticized the insurance industry or pledged to give all children health insurance. And though aides say it is not Mr. Gore's primary intent, the attack on corporate interests co-opts some of Mr. Nader's anti-corporate message.
By portraying himself as a fighter for the common man against big business, Mr. Gore also takes one of his vulnerabilities -- that he can seem strident -- and tries to turn it into a plus. As he put it several times this week, "The question is whether you're for the people or for the power."
The risk is one that Mr. Clinton's strategists identified four years ago when they argued that class-based appeals did not get a Democratic candidate above 50 percent with the voters because they started to turn off as many people as they rallied.
But Mr. Gore's aides say that, despite his comment about Scotch drinkers at their club, he is more often taking on corporate interests that the public distrusts than he is the well-to-do.
Mr. Gore's aides say these themes will resonate with swing voters as much as with Democrats.
"These issues are core Democratic issues," said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, "but they appeal to voters across the board."
And Mr. Gore is no longer criticizing Mr. Bush head-on, the way he did in the spring when he spoke of Mr. Bush's "risky" tax scheme and criticized every Bush proposal. Instead, he goes after certain business interests that he then tries to link to either the Congressional Republicans or to Mr. Bush, or both.
Today much of his fire was against Citizens for Better Medicare, a group that, despite its name, was started by drug manufacturers. It has spent more than $2 million in recent weeks on television advertisements opposing the Democrats' plan for a Medicare prescription drug benefit.
In a letter to Citizens for Better Medicare that was distributed on his campaign plane, Mr. Gore challenged the group's leaders to make public its donor list and show who was behind it, saying, "The American people deserve to know who exactly is trying to influence this critical issue.".
In his appearance before the teachers, Mr. Gore said the group should be called Citizens for Bad Medicare, saying, "That's what they are promoting -- our opponent's plan, which tells seniors to go beg the H.M.O.'s and the insurance companies with help with prescription drugs."
Mr. Gore was referring to the House Republicans' plan for a prescription drug benefit, which broadly follows principles Mr. Bush has set out. Their bill gives subsidies and incentives to insurance companies to provide drug coverage to Medicare recipients. Mr. Gore has a more expansive plan which would offer the benefits directly through the Medicare program.
Dan Zielinski, a spokesman for the group, said it was reviewing Mr. Gore's letter to decide on a response. Mr. Zielinski said the coalition had not disguised its drug company backing.
Even as Mr. Gore was delivering his criticisms, Democratic officials sought to demonstrate ties between the pharmaceutical industry and Republicans. They said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant who helped produce the commercials for Citizens for Better Medicare, had ties to the Bush campaign.
Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said Mr. Castellanos's firm, National Media, had no part in the production of Mr. Bush's campaign advertisements.
One Bush adviser acknowledged that the company did buy media time for the Bush campaign, but said Mr. Castellanos was on the "creative side" of the company and was not involved in buying time for the Bush commercials.
Mr. McLellan accused Mr. Gore of trying to "divert attention away from his Washington, D.C., one-size-fits-all" approach to providing a drug benefit directly through the federal Medicare program. Mr. McClellan also accused three of Mr. Gore's friends and advisers -- Peter Knight, Tom Downey and Anthony Podesta -- of being drug industry lobbyists.
Mr. Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, however, noted that the vice president was acting in opposition to the drug industry despite the ties of some of his friends and advisers. But Mr. Lehane asserted that the Bush campaign was benefiting from the Citizens for Better Medicare advertisements, and was putting forward "an agenda that is in the best interests of the pharmaceutical companies."
Mr. Knight previously worked for the Schering-Plough Corporation but has since left the lobbying business.

Ad Spending Breaks a Record

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Spending by advertisers in traditional media increased a strong 12.7 percent, to $22.2 billion, in the first quarter compared with $19.7 billion in the period a year earlier, according to Competitive Media Reporting. The $22.2 billion is a record for a first quarter.
Competitive Media in New York, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending, reported yesterday that the medium with the highest percentage increase was network radio, up 38.6 percent, to $156.3 million from $112.7 million. This was followed by spot radio, up 31.3 percent, to $568.6 million from $432.9 million, and cable TV networks, up 30.6 percent, to $2.3 billion from $1.7 billion. 
 The United States Government had the highest percentage increase among the top advertisers, up 90.5 percent, to $173.8 million from $91.2 million, largely because of spending totaling $68.9 million on a campaign to promote participation in the 2000 census.
General Motors was the marketer spending the most in the first quarter, $669.9 million, up 6 percent from $631.8 million.
Three of the five most advertised brands were fast food chains: McDonald's, first; Burger King, a unit of Diageo, second; and Wendy's, fifth. Circuit City was third and the Census Bureau was fourth.

HEADLINE: Gas Taxes Send Europe Drivers On Road Trips

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 5

 BODY:
Paul Cheringou, a Frenchman, buys his in Spain. In London, Ken Reddy, a Briton, prefers to pop over -- or rather under -- the Channel to France for his. In Berlin, Monika Brauer, a German, prefers to buy hers in Poland.
What these border hoppers have in common is the quest for (relatively) cheap gasoline. And what drives them to cross international frontiers just to fill the tank is an often wide difference in gasoline taxes, one of Europe's most pervasive yet surreptitious taxes. For some Europeans, it's an offer they can't seem to refuse. 
 In some countries that share a border, a bridge or a tunnel, the difference in the price of gas can be substantial.
A driver in Britain, where fuel can cost $5.50 a gallon, can save as much as $1.80 a gallon by tanking up in France. Germans can pay $3.70 a gallon -- or seek out gas in Poland for 75 cents less. The difference is explained by taxes.
Wedded to their cars, the Continent's motorists have long been the target of governments that seek revenues by cranking up levies on gasoline rather than confront the political repercussions of higher sales and income taxes.
"Some people now pay more duty on petrol than they do income tax," said Britain's conservative tabloid The Daily Mail. "This is stealth tax with a vengeance."
In parts of the United States, price increases have pushed gasoline past the $2 mark. But in Europe, the combination of similar increases and sales taxes have put prices at levels that stagger even Europeans, and would incense Americans.
"If anyone in the United States were told to pay the prices we pay here, there'd be rioting in the streets," said Michael Johnson, a spokesman for Britain's Automobile Association.
The prices offer some insight into a yawning chasm in trans-Atlantic perceptions of the little guy's relationships with the big guys. While Americans protest vocally at gasoline prices climbing past $1.50 a gallon, Britons sigh in grumpy resignation at gas costing more than three times as much.
While the perceived rapacity of Big Oil has become a campaign issue in the United States, Europeans exude a despairing rage at what seems to be a conspiracy between political parties whose rivalries give way to a consensus on the beauty of gasoline taxes and the riches they produce for those in power.
For every gallon sold at the pumps in French francs or German marks or British pounds, European governments rake in an average 70 percent to 80 percent of the price, compared to 25 percent in America.
So, at a time when the European Union is ballyhooing its single market and single currency, the discrepancies between tax regimes, both within the European Union and beyond, are providing the little guy one of the very few chances to profit from Europe's deep-rooted national distinctions.
Even though France and Spain share the euro, for instance, Mr. Cheringou, a hotel receptionist in the French resort of St.-Jean-de-Luz likes to head south over the France-Spain border in his Peugeot 106 subcompact every 10 days on a mission to buy gas, cigarettes, fresh fruit and fish.
A 20-minute drive from the Hotel Prado where he works, he said, Spanish entrepreneurs have thoughtfully erected a gigantic supermarket, the Alcampo, to cater to him and thousands of other French shoppers, with prices both in French francs and Spanish pesetas. Because of an agreement between some European countries removing border formalities, there is no need to slow down or show his passport as he crosses the border.
The trip is well worth his drive. He figures that with the $80 he spends on a 10-gallon tank of gas, a few cartons of Winfield cigarettes and a grocery cart of produce, he saves about $30 from what he would otherwise pay in France -- the equivalent of more than $1,000 a year.
The reason, he said, is that while gas costs seven French francs per liter -- roughly $3.70 per gallon -- in France, the cost in Spain is significantly less because taxes are lower. Indeed, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris, French taxes account for roughly 70 percent of the cost of a gallon of gas in France, while Spanish taxes total about 60 percent.
The distinctions exist not just within the 11 countries that have adopted the euro to underpin their national coin. In non-euro England, for instance, where taxes consume about 75 percent of gas prices, Mr. Reddy, a 45-year-old security consultant, figures he will save more than $3,000 a year simply by doing monthly shopping not at his local stores in East London but in France.
Taking his Alfa Romeo 164 sports sedan to France, he says, costs him little more than the $37.50 day ticket to use the Channel Tunnel.
But, because French taxes on gasoline, tobacco, liquor and food are so much lower, his savings far outstrip the price of the ticket. "I go because of the ludicrous high taxes on everything we do, buy, eat or sleep in Britain," he said. "If we didn't have these ludicrous, high taxes, I wouldn't go over there."
Indeed, he said, up until three years ago French gasoline prices were higher than British prices. But since then -- coinciding with Tony Blair's New Labor government -- gas prices have risen by more than a third in Britain. "I'd say that, in the last three years, 99 per cent of my fuel has been French," Mr. Reddy said.
In Berlin, Mrs. Brauer, a 55-year-old hospital administrator, has gone one further. For many years, she said, she has kept a weekend home in a trailer park on the German-Polish border at Frankfurt an der Oder, 50 miles away.
In Germany, gasoline, laden with ecological and sales taxes, costs $3.59 per gallon. In Poland, she said, it costs 20 percent less. So, during her weekend at the trailer, Mrs. Brauer does some of her shopping by fueling her Opel Vectra compact -- and buying a carton of cheaper cigarettes -- in Poland, for a savings of about $500 a year.
"Why should I pay more taxes in Germany?" she said.
Of course, not every European lives close to a border, so the economic impact of those shopping for cheaper gas is minor. But the crossborder odysseys play into a much bigger debate over the environment, the economy and, increasingly, the Continent's politics just at a time when summer vacationers take to the autobahns.
By tradition, this is a time of debates and migrations, when Germans head to Italy, and French vacationers swarm the Riviera and Britons drive across the English Channel.
It is a time when European environmentalists fret about auto pollution and, this year, some politicians have begun to see the risk to their constituencies presented by ever-higher gasoline prices.
In big economic terms, the case for high gasoline taxes is not easy to resolve.
Higher gas prices spread increased costs across Europe's economies, pushing up delivery and supply charges.
Yet, according to Fatih Birol, the head of economic analysis at the International Energy Agency, the high proportion of taxes in the pump price of Europe's gasoline effectively fixes so much of the price of gasoline that consumers are cushioned from the wild price swings Americans have seen this year.
And governments argue that motorists should pay for the damage they cause to the environment. "It's sort of enshrined in environmental policy to persuade people to use alternative means of transport," said Vicky Sheriff, a spokeswoman for the British Treasury.
For all those high-minded protestations, the reality is that gas taxes produce significant income for governments that is difficult to find elsewhere.
In Britain, gasoline taxes and license fees net more than $55 billion a year, roughly the same as Germany's gas tax revenue.
Of course, the high price of crude oil and the strength of the dollar -- the currency of the oil industry -- have also pushed up prices. Significantly, though, the latest increases have finally nudged prices toward psychological barriers -- 2 German marks per liter or $3.70 per gallon, and 1 pound per liter or $5.50 a gallon in Britain -- that may breach European apathy about gasoline prices.
Still, some Europeans sense that their love affair with their cars leaves them vulnerable to ever higher prices.
"In France people will sacrifice even on food rather than do without their car," said Mr. Cheringou in St.-Jean-de-Luz.
"They keep slapping on the tax and all we do is sit at home and moan about it," said Mr. Reddy in London.
"You can do anything you want with the Germans because they won't leave their car at home," said Mrs. Brauer in Berlin. "The car is their favorite child."

HEADLINE: FUNGUS CONSIDERED AS A TOOL TO KILL COCA IN COLOMBIA

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

 BODY:
Under pressure from the United States, Colombia has reluctantly agreed to take the first step toward developing a powerful biological herbicide against the coca and heroin-poppy fields that are spreading almost unchecked across its countryside, Colombian and United States officials said yesterday.
For years, United States officials have been quietly debating ways to conduct field tests of such an herbicide, developed from a fungus that occurs naturally in many types of coca and other plants. 
 Now, Colombian officials say they are completing a proposal to the United Nations that would include testing for the presence of the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum, in coca, the raw material of cocaine.
If the fungus is found in Colombian varieties of coca, Colombian scientists would go on to evaluate its effectiveness, safety and environmental impact before deciding whether to produce the herbicide.
"What we want is a program of research -- and only research -- on the use of biological controls against these crops," the Colombian environment minister, Juan Mayr, said in an interview yesterday.
The Colombian government is uneasily supporting the project as President Clinton is about to sign a bill providing $1.3 billion in aid to Colombia to fight drug traffickers and the insurgents who protect their trade.
Some powerful Republican in Congress told Colombian officials that they were supporting the spending on the expectation that that Colombia would agree to explore the use of Fusarium fungus in its coca fields.
Within the Clinton administration, officials said, the testing of fungal herbicides was also pushed by the White House drug policy adviser, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, and by officials of the United States Southern Command, which is overseeing the American overhaul of Colombia's armed forces.
Environmentalists and other activists in both countries are raising a din of objections to any field tests of the fungus, arguing that it is virtually a biological weapon -- one that might upset Colombia's ecology or endanger farmers, animals and food crops.
Last year, similar complaints by environmentalists in Florida prompted state officials there to put aside plans to test a variant of Fusarium for possible use against marijuana fields.
Several plant pathologists who have studied the fungus extensively said there was relatively little scientific basis for the assertions about its danger. They acknowledged that a great deal of testing still needed to be done, but they added that the most significant unanswered questions might have less to do with the safety of the fungus than with its effectiveness and cost.
"If they're looking at local strains of the fungus, then I can't see something scientifically dangerous about it," said Jonathan Gressel, a professor of plant sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. "What you're doing is taking a disease that is already present and putting on more of it."
"But they'll be lucky if it works," Dr. Gressel added. "Because typically this inundative strategy isn't good enough in commercial agriculture, and I'm sure the narcos have been planning ahead. They'll probably go to fungicides or breed their coca to be resistant to the fungus. It's relatively easy to do."
The concerns about Fusarium's proposed use as a mycoherbicide, or fungal herbicide, have been heightened by the shadowy history of research into its impact on drug crops. Indeed, the Colombian study is being proposed after many years of often secret investigation by scientists in the United States and the former Soviet Union.
Officials said Fusarium, a naturally occurring fungus with variants that can cause wilt in everything from tomatoes and grain to marijuana, was first identified as a possible weapon in the drug fight by Central Intelligence Agency scientists in the early 1980's. The United States Agriculture Department began more extensive research into the use of the fungus on coca in 1988, and it continued, mostly in secret, for nearly a decade.
At roughly the same time, Soviet biological weapons scientists at the Institute of Plant Genetics in Uzbekistan were working to develop Fusarium fungus, plant bacteria and other pathogens to destroy opium poppies -- and perhaps enable Moscow to limit the world's morphine supply or undermine the opium-dependent economy of Afghanistan.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States continued to pay for research at the laboratory as part of an effort to keep its impoverished scientists from joining the biological weapons programs of countries like Iraq and Iran.
Some of the same research now continues under the auspices of the United Nations Drug Control Program, with has quietly supported the use of biological controls against drug crops since 1976. In Uzbekistan, as in Colombia, much of the United Nations effort is financed by the United States.
"Whatever happened in the past, the work has to be redone now in an open environment," said Eric Rosenquist, one of the officials who has worked longest on the fungus. "Only then can you debate it on its merits."
"I don't see this as some horrible thing that's going to mutate and kill people -- that's science fiction," added Mr. Rosenquist, a program leader for international programs at the Agriculture Department's Research Service in Beltsville, Md. "But you have to demonstrate that it is going to be effective, and that hasn't been done yet."
Mr. Rosenquist and other officials noted that a natural epidemic of Fusarium in Peru, beginning in the mid-1980's, had only a limited effect on the cultivation of coca there.
The attraction of the fungus as an herbicide is that its strains have generally been found to attack only a single type of plant, entering the roots and strangling the vascular system while leaving other species untouched. The fungus can live on in the soil for many years, moving from one coca plant to another.
Proponents of fungal herbicides say they may prove to be much less damaging to the environment than chemical herbicides that are now typically used to fumigate drug fields. Similar biological controls are increasingly being used to kill weeds, noted David C. Sands, a plant pathologist who has led much of the research on Fusarium's potential use against coca. "The question is whether this is considered a noxious plant," he said.
Dr. Sands, a plant pathologist at Montana State University, worked almost singlehandedly to revive congressional interest in mycoherbicides after the Agriculture Department began to phase out its support for Fusarium research in 1996.
He also holds a patent on what officials say would be the likely method for dispersing the fungus if it is ever used on coca or opium poppies. The design involves dropping Fusarium-coated seeds from planes flying over coca fields, at higher altitudes than the crop-dusting planes and helicopter that are routinely attacked by drug producers and guerrillas.
For some years, lawyers at the White House and the State Department debated whether it was possible to use the fungal herbicide on drug crops without violating the international conventions against the spread of biological weapons. The lawyers determined that the law would not be violated if a foreign country made its own decision to use or test the fungus, but that has not satisfied all American officials.
"I don't support using a product on a bunch of Colombian peasants that you wouldn't use against a bunch of rednecks growing marijuana in Kentucky," said one United States intelligence official. "And there is definitely less than unanimous support for this in Colombia."
Mr. Mayr, the Colombian environment minister, said he had flatly rejected the first proposal for a mycoherbicide research plan that was sent to him in late April by the United Nations Drug Control Program. A summary of the plan stipulated that "the government of Colombia has agreed, in principle, to experimental field trials being conducted in that country."
Mr. Mayr and two other senior Colombian officials said they will propose instead to test only fungal herbicides that already exist in Colombia. "If Fusarium is not there, we won't study it," he said. But they agreed to look at various types of biological controls against coca, including predatory insects.
The United Nations drug control director in Bogota, Klaus Nyholm, and the assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, R. Rand Beers, suggested that they would support the new Colombian plan.
"This is an idea that ought to be investigated," Mr. Beers said of the fungus's potential as a herbicide. "It should not be implemented until the science is clear. But if it is, then it should be considered a tool."

HEADLINE: John Hejduk, an Architect And Educator, Dies at 71

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
John Hejduk, one of the most revered figures in American architecture and architectural education, died on Monday at his home in Riverdale in the Bronx. He was 71.
The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Renata. 
 Mr. Hejduk was Dean of the Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art from 1975 until his retirement last month. He was an architect who largely abstained from conventional practice, and the bulk of his work consisted of theoretical projects, executed in the form of drawings that were combined into poetic, often highly personal narratives. These drawings, later published in a series of books, have been compared to the work of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, the 18th-century Roman whose engravings of imaginary prisons were a decisive influence on neo-Classical architecture. Mr. Hejduk's influence on his students and others was also profound. His former students, some of today's most imaginative designers, include Daniel Libeskind, Elizabeth Diller, Shigeru Ban and Toshiko Mori.
Like Piranesi, Mr. Hejduk (pronounced HAY-duck) offered dark, brooding meditations on architectural themes. Images of ashes, graveyards, watchtowers and medusa heads recurred in his drawings. A tall man, with the intimidating demeanor of the legend he had become, Mr. Hejduk created solitary landscapes in which architectural forms took on human, at times inhuman, characteristics. "The New England Masque," a suite of drawings from 1981, explored the alienation between married partners. Inspired by Stanley Kubrick's film, "The Shining," the project showed a house designed to prevent its two inhabitants from meeting face to face. Walls, stairs, furniture and landscape kept the two in a state of separation.
The project illustrates one of several ideas associated with Mr. Hejduk's work and teaching. Architects don't have to limit themselves to happy-face emotions. Like writers, they can delve into the darker side of the soul and the bleaker aspects of society. Andrew MacNair, an architect and journalist, once coined the name the Blacks to describe a group of architects, including Raimund Abraham and Lebbeus Woods, who explored this abysmal realm. Mr. Hejduk was the central figure in this group. His influence can be seen in Mr. Abraham's design for the Austrian Cultural Institute, a severe glass and concrete structure now nearing completion on East 52nd Street.
In Mr. Hejduk's later drawings, crosses, angels and other symbols of religious redemption appeared frequently. Yet it is fair to say that architecture was his religion, even that he was a fanatical believer. At times, the smell of incense could be overwhelming.
Mr. Hejduk's devotion to the purity of his vision inspired some students to treat him as a cult figure. But practical ideas also flowed from his example. Ms. Diller and her partner, Ricardo Scofidio, a Cooper Union professor, have successfully pursued an alternative practice, independent from the economics of real estate.
Another lesson Mr. Hejduk imparted was the social and psychological dimensions of space. He taught his students to regard architectural forms not as purely abstract shapes or expressions of structure and function but as a means of exploring relationships between public and private space. Walls, windows and architectural details were invested with emotional content.
Wall House I, an unbuilt design that Mr. Hejduk developed from 1974 onward, is the project that best exemplifies this approach. Using a vocabulary similar to that of Le Corbusier, the pioneer French modernist, Mr. Hejduk designed a house whose structure was reduced to the two dimensions of a single plane and an adjacent utility core. Living spaces were slung off the rear of the wall, in a saddlebag-shaped container. Mr. Hejduk's purpose was not to show off the possibilities of cantilever construction. Rather, he wanted to invest the single wall with the symbolic meaning of division.
A similar idea occurs, on a small scale, in a wall recess located outside Mr. Hejduk's office in Cooper Union's Foundation Building on Cooper Square. A telephone booth in function, the recess is a balloon of space that is entered from the building's third-floor lobby. The spatial flow from lobby to phone offers an intimate essay on the transition from public, through semi-public, to private zones.
The Foundation Building, which Mr. Hejduk reconstructed in 1975, will undoubtedly remain a memorial to his tenure as dean. In keeping with an institution dedicated to growth, Mr. Hejduk's design emphasized transitional spaces like stairs, corridors, and hallways. The library was placed behind glass at street level, where it could be viewed by passers-by. The Great Hall, renowned as the setting of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, regained its luster. A meeting room on the top floor, behind the dial of the building's giant clock, has become a prized setting for photographers.
From a historical perspective, Mr. Hejduk's importance may lie in his contribution to the increasing role played by psychology in contemporary architecture. Along with Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Phillipe Starck and Eric Owen Moss, among others, Mr. Hejduk helped to reframe architecture as a meeting ground between the subjective and objective realms.
Mr. Hejduk was perhaps the most extreme exemplar of this movement. He told a reporter that someone once complained that his drawings didn't really count as architecture because you couldn't get inside them. "Yes," Mr. Hejduk replied, "but I can get inside them. My friends can get inside them." And they did.
John Quentin Hejduk was born in New York in 1929. After attending Cooper Union from 1947 to 1950, he studied architecture at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio, where he received his bachelor of arts degree in 1952. The following year, he was awarded a master's degree in architecture at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design.
Mr. Hejduk began his teaching career in 1954 as a studio instructor at the University of Texas in Austin. While in Austin, he joined with Robert Slutsky, Colin Rowe and others to form a rambunctious group of educators who were called The Texas Rangers. After the entire group was fired, Mr. Hejduk returned to New York in 1956 to work at I. M. Pei and Partners, and later taught at Cornell.
He began teaching at Cooper Union in 1964 and was appointed head of the architecture department the following year. In 1975, when the department became an autonomous division, Mr. Hejduk was appointed dean. Last month, he was named the school's Dean and Professor Emeritus of Architecture.
Mr. Hejduk's 21 published books include "Mask of Medusa" and "Architectures in Love" (both published by Rizzoli International Publications), and "Lancaster/Hanover Masque" ( published by the Architectural Association and the Canadian Center for Architecture). In 1997, the Canadian Center acquired Mr. Hejduk's archive of drawings.
Mr. Hejduk did design several built works in addition to the Foundation Building. In 1988 he completed the Berlin Tower and Garden Apartments, a housing complex in Berlin. A civic center in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, designed in collaboration with Antonio San Martin G. de Azcon, is scheduled for completion later this year.
Twenty-six full-scale versions of Mr. Hejduk's designs were constructed as temporary installations in museums and other locations, including the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, the Triennale di Milano in Italy and Prague Castle in the Czech capital. In 1995, two of Mr. Hejduk's former students built a 19-foot-tall wooden model called "The Conciliator," based on Mr. Hejduk's drawing of a dark gray tower flanked by two entry ramps, on a traffic island across from the Flatiron Building at 23rd Street.
In addition to his daughter, of Phoenix, Mr. Hejduk is survived by his wife, Gloria, and a son, Rafael, of New York.
Mr. Hejduk regarded teaching as an exalted form of social service. Earlier this year he wrote: "I believe in the social contract, therefore I teach. I believe that the University is one of the last places that protects and preserves freedom, therefore teaching is also a sociopolitical act, among other things."

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
Child's Play The Way It Used to Be

BYLINE: By Wendy Moonan 

 BODY:
R2D2, meet Barbie. Vintage toys and dolls are in, not that they ever went out. There are specialty auctions, Web sites, collector clubs, swap meets. There are sales four times a year in Gaithersburg, Md., as well as the twice yearly Atlantique Fairs, sales that attract tens of thousands to Atlantic City. There are more than 80 dealers on nadda.org, the Web site of the National Antique Doll Dealers Association.
"It's a baby boomer thing," said George Glastris, head of the toy and doll department at Skinner, the Boston auction house. "It's about nostalgia and recapturing our youth, even for 35-year-old yuppies like me. The robots are a guy thing. Dolls are for girls." 
 He said tomorrow's auction at Skinner, with 694 lots, is its biggest toy sale to date. The sale includes wind-up toys, lithographed tinplate vehicles, dolls, 18th-century Neapolitan creche figures, toy soldiers, cast iron banks, board games, puzzles and robots.
Vintage toys are evaluated according to rarity and condition. "Great age is not important for toys, dolls and collectibles," Carol Prisant writes in the "Antiques Roadshow Primer." "Toys made before World War II are considered 'antique,' while toys made after the war are 'modern.' "
Old toys need not be expensive. Skinner has given many lots $200 estimates, though not the star ones. These include rare robots like the Robby Space Patrol. (The word robot, coined by the Czech writer Karel Capek, comes from the Czech word robota, meaning compulsory labor like that of a serf.) Robby the Robot was made famous by the classic 1956 science-fiction film "Forbidden Planet." A robot who drove a space vehicle across a windswept alien planet, he has become an icon among robot collectors.
"He's also rare," Mr. Glastris said. "I've never sold one before."
Mark Bergin, a private dealer in New Hampshire who specializes in vintage robots and space toys (www.bergintoys.com), said: "Today, kids and Generation X, at least the 15- to 20-year-olds, are turned on by them. They are even showing up in MTV videos."
To Mr. Bergin, robots represent not nostalgia but the future and the unknown. "These robots are futuristic in form and design," he said. "The toys are 50 years old, and we still don't have real robots yet. We are just on the verge."
Robots are also popular among graphic artists. "It's because they have a 'Pulp Fiction' kind of art," Mr. Bergin said. "Robots and robot boxes probably have better graphics than any other toy."
This may explain the astronomical prices robots can fetch. Sotheby's New York sold a Robby Machine Man for $74,000 in December 1997. That set a record for a robot sold at auction, but Mr. Bergin said he had sold robots for more. At the moment he has a red Robby Space Trooper in its original box for $7,500 and a black Robby Space Trooper without its box for $1,500. He recommended that would-be collectors read "Future Toys," by Antoni Emchowicz and Paul Nunneley (New Cavendish Books).
A quick survey on the Web proves you can also buy other movie-star toy robots made more recently, including a robot inspired by the Maria in Fritz Lang's 1926 German film "Metropolis"; Hal 9000, from "2001: A Space Odyssey"; both 3CPO and R2D2 from "Star Wars"; and Vanessa Rembot from "Austin Powers." Robots rule!
Dolls have been cherished since men lived in caves. "Dolls are the second most highly collected antiques, after stamps and coins," said Dorothy McGonagle, the doll specialist at Skinner.
They tend to be classified according to the material used to make the head: wood, china, cloth, wax and plastic, among others. "The head is 90 percent of a doll," Mrs. McGonagle said. "Some manufacturers made only heads, and others made the bodies. Then dolls were sent off to the couturier for dressing. In the late 1800's, Paris shops like Au Nain Bleu acted as a middleman. It would have samples, so the customer could specify what head and dress she wanted. They must have had teams of seamstresses making the outfits.
"Dolls are a mirror of society," Mrs. McGonagle continued. "Dolls reflect what is going on in a culture at a given time. In the 19th century, for example, France was the fashion capital of the world, and costume was an important part of French life and the French economy. So the French produced fashion dolls, dolls depicted as upper-class ladies in couture. They are the predecessors of Barbie, the fashion doll of the 20th century."
Manhattan specialty shops like Second Childhood on Bleecker Street and Iris Brown Antique Dolls on East 57th Street sell such dolls. Richard Wright, a dealer in Birchrunville, Pa., also has a selection of rare European toys and dolls.
There are two schools of thought about fashion dolls, said Mrs. McGonagle, author of "The Dolls of Jules Nicolas Steiner." "Some say they were a way France exported its fashions. I think these dolls were to play with. They were made at a time when the middle class was burgeoning and people had money. It was the right time for a huge development in doll making. Such dolls came with accessories: crosses, enameled watches, rings, rosary beads and necklaces, to name a few."
Iris Brown disagrees. "These dolls are not really for children," she said. "They have survived because they were put on shelves. Girls just looked at them."
Until the 19th century, dolls tended to look like miniature adults, probably, Mrs. McGonagle said, because children were expected to act like adults. "Early dolls were also very pale, because ladies stayed inside," she added. "Later on you see healthier coloring." Dolls were adults dressed as children until the 1870's, when the child began to be glorified and doll forms were rendered as babies and children.
French companies like Bru, Jumeau and Steiner all produced fine child dolls. Lot 171 in the Skinner sale is a rare French Bru Bebe doll called Zepherine from the late 1870's. Her beautifully modeled head and delicate (repainted) hands are bisque, while the body is made of kid leather. She looks very grown up, with protruding breasts and a (replacement) blond wig framing her face. She has enormous cornflower blue eyes made of paperweight glass, arched eyebrows and long eyelashes that have been painted on. She wears her original cotton chemise underdress, which originally would have had a fabulous outfit over it. The estimated selling price for the doll is $8,000 to $12,000.
Collectors have arcane criteria when judging dolls. "A good doll, like a good woman, keeps her eyes open and her mouth shut," Mrs. McGonagle said, quoting an adage.
To Mr. Bergin, a robot is really an industrial doll. "They mesh the computer age with the human age," he said. For him, the only good doll (or robot) is one that can move in mysterious ways. To each his own.

HEADLINE: A Call for Fair Access to Future AIDS Vaccine

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: DURBAN, South Africa, July 6

 BODY:
Though a vaccine to prevent AIDS is years away, steps should be taken now to enable a vaccine to be distributed widely in the third world as soon as it becomes available, a leading group in the vaccine effort said here today.
As the 13th International AIDS Conference prepared to open here on Sunday, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a research consortium supported by government and private grants, issued a blueprint to provide simultaneous access to an AIDS vaccine in rich and poor countries. 
 The public and private sectors need to learn new ways of doing business, the research group said in recommending sweeping changes in the way vaccines are produced, licensed, priced, bought and distributed.
The group argued that economics alone fails to fully explain the long delays that often ensue before vaccines become available in developing countries, and urged steps to harmonize the hodgepodge of national regulations and international guidelines that govern vaccine approval and use. The blueprint also calls for creation of an international group to monitor and assess experimental vaccines.
"It is not too soon to plan for an AIDS vaccine because failure to act promptly would repeat the tragedy of the widespread lack of availability to anti-H.I.V. drugs," said Dr. Seth Berkley, the president of the Vaccine Initiative, which collaborates with Unaids, the United Nations' joint program on AIDS.
The United Nations has concluded that AIDS threatens to severely damage the economies of sub-Saharan countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Swaziland where H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, has infected at least 20 percent of adults.
Most health officials believe a vaccine would be the most effective weapon in stopping the epidemic. However, the most severely affected countries would be the least able to afford a vaccine, just as they cannot pay for anti-H.I.V. drugs that are helping extend the lives of many infected people in developed countries. Also, many developing countries do not have the network of health systems needed to deliver a vaccine.
Rarely, if ever, have health officials introduced vaccines into developed and developing countries simultaneously. Vaccine manufacturers usually limit their initial production capacity for markets in developed countries. Only with time and after production capacity increases do prices fall to a level that poor countries can afford.
Thus, a delay of about 15 years has usually occurred between the time when vaccines for infections like hepatitis B were widely introduced into developed and developing countries. The first hepatitis B vaccine was developed in the early 1980's.
The United States and other developed countries quickly organized systems to deliver polio vaccines in the 1950's. But it took decades to conduct similar programs in countries with less effective health care systems and polio was eradicated from the Western Hemisphere only in the 1990's. The World Health Organization's goal of eradicating polio in the rest of the world by 2000 has been set back a few years.
The delay in introducing vaccines to the third world is "a colossal public health failure" that should not be repeated with AIDS, Dr. Berkley said. He also said that with more than five million new H.I.V. infections occurring each year, a delay of five years in delivering an AIDS vaccine could cost 20 million or more lives.
Scientists are challenged in developing an AIDS vaccine largely because of the virus's ability to mutate. Two years ago, the pipeline for AIDS vaccines was nearly empty. But today, the Vaccine Initiative said, there are promising products in early development, although there is still no plan to get any to the most affected communities in the world.
In 1985, Margaret Heckler, then Secretary of Health and Human Services, promised an AIDS vaccine within a year. In the intervening years, however, only 3 of 25 vaccines that have been injected into humans have advanced to the second stage of the three-stage testing system. Two are still in the second stage. One is known as an Alvac canary pox vaccine and is made by Aventis Pasteur of France. A second combines the Alvac vaccine and one prepared from a molecular component of the surface of H.I.V., known as gp120.
A vaccine made by VaxGen of Brisbane, Calif., is the only one to reach the third stage. VaxGen's product is being tested in the United States and Thailand, and findings are not expected until at least 2002.
New techniques are needed to estimate demand for an AIDS vaccine in developing countries and to assure sufficient production capacity because it takes five years to design, build and bring to full capacity facilities to produce vaccines.
An AIDS vaccine would be unlike most immunizations because it would be accompanied by counseling to promote safe sex practices and reduce risky behavior. Moreover, in the developed world, an unknown number of people might decline an AIDS vaccine out of concern that it might produce side effects that would not appear until years after the immunization. Also, some may shun an AIDS vaccine because it would make the standard H.I.V. blood test for a recipient positive. Additional tests would then be needed to document that the blood findings were from an AIDS vaccine, not from infection with the virus.
In the third world, there seems to be less concern about side effects because of the epidemic's severity.
Even if coordination with the World Health Organization's existing international vaccine programs produces maximum use of a vaccine for AIDS, the Vaccine Initiative said, new delivery systems will be needed to reach adolescents and adults at high risk of infection. And the work to create delivery systems could cost more than the vaccine itself.
The Vaccine Initiative urged the World Trade Organization and the major industrialized nations to create a tiered pricing structure to help poor countries pay what they can afford and allow companies to obtain a satisfactory return on investment.
The research group cited support for the blueprint from Sean Lance, chairman and chief executive officer of Chiron, a biotechnology company in Emeryville, Calif., that seeks to develop an AIDS vaccine.
Although Chiron collaborates with researchers in South Africa and has distribution agreements for other products with South Africa, the company has vastly reduced its representation at the AIDS conference because of concerns of personal safety in Durban, a spokeswoman for Chiron said. Mr. Lance, a native South African, is not attending.

HEADLINE: Sharp Gain In May Orders At Factories

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
Factory orders in May recorded the largest gain in almost seven and a half years, suggesting that signs of a slowdown in consumer demand are having only a limited effect on manufacturers, government statistics showed today.
Orders rose 4.1 percent after falling 3.8 percent in April as demand increased for electronics, autos and chemicals, the Commerce Department said. The increase in May was the largest since a 4.9 percent rise in December 1992. 
 "No one should underestimate the resiliency of this expansion," said Kevin Flanagan, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter economist.
The gain in orders, along with a separate Labor Department report showing claims for jobless benefits fell 12,000 last week, to 296,000 -- the lowest level in five weeks -- indicates the record nine-year economic expansion may not be cooling as much as Federal Reserve policy makers would like.
Still, orders to factories may slow in coming months if the increases in interest rates cut more deeply into consumer spending. Reports today from retailers showing that the sales increase in June was the smallest in almost three years may be a sign that is already happening.
The May increase in factory orders was paced by the biggest increase in orders for electronic and electrical equipment since August 1997, Commerce Department officials said. Orders for electronic equipment rose 26.4 percent after falling 17.6 percent in April.
The electronic goods category includes communications equipment, appliances and video equipment, as well as semiconductors, circuit boards, capacitors, resistors, coils and transformers.
Orders for autos and auto parts rose 3.3 percent after falling 5.9 percent in April. Excluding transportation equipment, orders increased 4.3 percent in May, the largest gain since a similar rise in January 1980.
May shipments of goods from factories, used in the government's calculation for gross domestic product, rose 1.9 percent, while inventories increased 0.2 percent. That pushed the inventories-to-shipments ratio to a record low of 1.26 months in May.
"The continued downtrend in the inventory-to-sales ratio argues for a continued strengthening in production," said Greg Jones, chief economist at Briefing.com in Jackson, Wyo. Analysts were expecting a 3.5 percent gain in overall orders after projecting a 4.3 percent decrease in April.

HEADLINE: Mortgage-Delinquency Rate at 28-Year Low

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
The number of Americans behind on home mortgage payments declined to the lowest level in 28 years in the first three months of the year, an banking industry group reported today.
Surging income and employment and low interest rates have helped consumers keep up with payments, according to the group, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. 
 Mortgage delinquencies were a seasonally adjusted 3.72 percent in the January-March quarter, down from 3.82 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999 and 4.06 percent in the first three months of 1999, the group's latest survey showed.
The 3.72 percent rate is the lowest mortgage-delinquency rate since the second quarter of 1972, when it was 3.49 percent.
Delinquencies declined in all three categories -- home mortgage loans that are 30 days, 60 days and 90 days or more past due -- and for all three types of home mortgages: conventional, those insured by the Federal Housing Administration and those insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The delinquency survey covers some 25 million home mortgage loans made by about 200 lenders. No margin of error is given for the survey.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Technology Shares Rebound, but Blue Chips Are Static

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks closed mostly higher yesterday as Wall Street looked for bargains in technology shares that were battered on Wednesday.
But blue-chip stocks treaded water as investors turned their focus to an important jobs report to be released today that some hope will give clues to the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates. 
 Gains in semiconductor shares helped lift the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index 97.47 points, or 2.5 percent, to 3,960.57.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which made a brief foray into positive territory late in the day, edged down 2.13 points, or 0.02 percent, to 10,481.47, cushioned by gains in Intel and financial stocks.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished up 10.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,456.67.
Technology shares benefited from a rebound in the semiconductor sector, which was severely beaten on Wednesday after a negative report on the industry by Salomon Smith Barney.
"Trading remains very thin, very volatile and the market is subject to these swings at this point," said Charles White, president of Avatar Associates. "I think everything is meandering around with people getting set up and comfortable for the number tomorrow."
Analysts expect the report, closely watched by the Fed as a gauge of inflation, to show continued tightness in the labor market, which some fear could prompt another rate increase.
The Fed left interest rates unchanged at its last meeting in June, after raising them six times over the last year, but it also warned that its job may not yet be done.
Intel, the chip maker, climbed 5, to 136 5/8, while the semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials gained 3 1/4, to 86 11/16. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index rose 4.51 percent after dropping 9.32 percent Wednesday.
"There's a little bit of bargain-hunting in the technology sector," said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at Edward Jones.
But all was not rosy for technology stocks.
Declines in I.B.M., down 2 1/4, to 101 3/4, and Hewlett-Packard, off 1 1/4, to 118 3/8, weighed on the Dow.
The Dow had a few bright spots, including financial shares like J. P. Morgan, which rose 1 5/8, to 116 15/16.
But Wall Street's main focus remained on today's employment figures for June, which are expected to show that the job market tightened further compared with May and that average hourly wages rose at a faster pace.
"I think the market is clearly treading water ahead of the report that is going to be released tomorrow," said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisers in Boston. "The market is torn between believing that the technology story is viable long term and the fact that there are some cracks developing, especially in second- and third-tier tech companies."

Treasury Prices Fall
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Bond prices posted their biggest drop in two weeks before a report today that may show employment rebounded in June, keeping alive speculation the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.
Investor confidence that the Fed's six rate increases over the last year have cooled growth was dented by a report that factory orders posted the biggest gain in seven and a half years in May, analysts said.
The price of the benchmark 10-year note fell 1 3/32, to 103 11/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.04 percent from 5.98 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 30-year bond dropped 2 3/32, to 104 26/32. Its yield rose to 5.90 percent from 5.86 percent.

HEADLINE: Preparing to Remake Mexico

 BODY:
Mexicans have understandably high expectations for Vicente Fox Quesada, the man they elected to break the 71-year presidential monopoly of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. In the euphoria that has followed his decisive victory Sunday, they now look to Mr. Fox to eliminate the official corruption, economic inequalities and political repression that were the defining characteristics of PRI rule. Mr. Fox's initial declarations are promising. But he will need persistence and cooperation from Mexico's other parties to succeed.
Taking over from an entrenched autocracy is never easy, and Mr. Fox faces more than the usual difficulties. The PRI remains in power for five more months, long enough to destroy records of corrupt dealings and deny Mr. Fox a smooth transition. His party will lack a Congressional majority, requiring him to make deals with other political forces, including the PRI. President Ernesto Zedillo should make sure that the current government shares information fully with Mr. Fox's nominees. 
 The most important issue facing Mr. Fox is government corruption. He has promised to remove police functions from the highly politicized Interior Ministry and the attorney general's office and establish a new, more professional ministry of security and justice. Those are necessary steps. Mexico's police have become notorious for protecting drug dealers and preying on ordinary citizens while facing little threat of investigation or punishment. But merely creating a new ministry is not enough. The training and management of police and prosecutors must be overhauled to ensure that criminal investigations are conducted properly and all law enforcement officers are held accountable for misconduct.
Mr. Fox has also pledged to channel public resources toward reducing poverty and to bring the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement to smaller businesses. Washington should offer him strong support. A Mexico with economic opportunity more widely distributed among its 100 million people would not only provide a better market for American consumer goods, it would also be a more comfortable economic and political partner for the United States. Washington should consider Mr. Fox's sensible ideas about expanding legal immigration.
Mexico's size, proximity and prominence as a trade partner tie it inextricably to the United States. Washington should do all that it can to support Mr. Fox's efforts to transform his country from an autocracy based on patronage and privilege into a law-abiding, pluralist democracy.

HEADLINE: Egypt Arrests an Activist

 BODY:
Egypt arrested a prominent sociologist last week, along with at least eight of his colleagues, and shut down the democracy institute where they work. The government said the sociologist, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, was suspected of, among other things, accepting funds from the European Union and harming Egypt's image by making a voting rights video that discussed past election fraud.
The arrests follow a campaign of attacks on Dr. Ibrahim in the Egyptian media and represent the latest harassment of advocates of democracy and human rights by the government, which appears to be trying to silence them before parliamentary elections this fall. If Egypt is truly worried about its image, it should end its embarrassing assault on independent activists. 
 The accusations against Dr. Ibrahim and other staff members of his institute, the Ibn Khaldoun center, are similar to those brought in the past two years against other activists. The Egyptian authorities also tightened regulations on nongovernmental organizations last year with a law that was recently declared unconstitutional on technical grounds.
Egypt's human rights community is understandably alarmed that the government would move against the prominent and well-connected Dr. Ibrahim, who also holds American citizenship and is a professor at the American University in Cairo. According to one of Dr. Ibrahim's lawyers, several of his staff members are still in jail, and no one has been able to visit Dr. Ibrahim since Monday. The government has 15 days to investigate charges against him, but can renew his detention indefinitely. His request for bail was denied.
Egypt seems to be harassing Dr. Ibrahim for his democracy work and for activities like accepting foreign donations and criticizing government actions. This is not criminal conduct and should not be treated as such. Washington, which gives Egypt $2 billion a year, says its ambassador has raised the case with Egypt's prime minister. The United States should continue to press for the release of Dr. Ibrahim and his staff, and for the political rights of all Egyptians.

HEADLINE: As Profits Soar, Corporate America Takes On More Debt

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
WHEN things go great, the winners go into debt. Sometimes they go too far.
With the American economy in its longest period of expansion ever, the news for corporate America has been as good as it can be. Profits have soared and are at or near record levels by almost any measure -- in dollars, as a percentage of revenue or as a portion of national income. Investors eagerly paid unprecedented multiples of those profits when they bought shares. 
 Yet, with profits pouring in and investors eager to buy stock, corporate America is deeper in debt than ever before. Corporate debt now equals 46 percent of gross domestic product, up from 38 percent five years ago.
One might expect companies to pay down debt in good times, and they tend to do so early in an economic recovery, when the bad times are still fresh. Corporate debt fell in 1991, after the last recession.
But as the economy continues to grow and people become more confident that good times are here to stay, such conservatism comes to appear foolish. "It's the perception of certainty that causes so many prosperous companies, individuals and companies to get in over their heads," says James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
As a result, the richest of one era can end up in deep trouble when times change. Mexico raked in the cash when oil prices soared during the 1970's and could not pay its debts in 1982. Japanese corporations seemed to conquer the world in the 1980's and could not pay their bank loans a decade later.
In the current corporate borrowing spree, the money borrowed has been far in excess of what was needed for capital spending, notes Paul Kasriel, the chief economist of Northern Trust. Much of the money went to buy back stock -- in large part to offset the shares that were issued to executives when they cashed in stock options. Corporate America has bought back more shares than it issued in recent years.
None of this is unprecedented. The two longest periods of expansion before the current one were during the 1960's and 1980's. In each case, corporate debt rose rapidly in the final years of the expansion. In the 1980's, Drexel Burnham Lambert, the leader in junk bond underwriting, came up with a new measure -- the "MAD ratio" -- to reassure investors that debt levels were not excessive. That stood for market-adjusted debt, and it showed that many companies were not really very far in debt, considering the market value of their stock. That was great, until share prices fell.
Now, evidence is growing that the economy is slowing, and worries are picking up that corporate profits may not be as robust as expected. Credit markets are becoming tighter. The junk bond market is reluctant to finance many companies, and banks are growing more cautious.
If such trends continue, some companies that assumed they could refinance debt when it came due will find that they cannot. And then we will see corporate defaults and bankruptcy filings rise to a level much higher than might be expected even if there is only a modest slowing in economic growth.
Inevitably, some of the companies that default will be ones that need never have borrowed money, given how eager investors were to buy their shares. But the managers feared that issuing too many shares would depress the stock price, and they knew that their duty was to maximize shareholder value. So they took on debts that did not look dangerous -- but that proved to be fatal.

HEADLINE: Playing the China Card;
One Company's Decision, and the Employees Left Behind

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: TULSA, Okla.

 BODY:
American business is rushing into China, and Marilyn C. Grant, 56, who drives a forklift for a fishing reel company, is being left behind.
The Zebco Corporation, Ms. Grant's employer, began moving much of its fishing reel production to China at the end of June. Though the company has been under pressure for a long time, the move came just a few weeks after the House passed a measure that would end cold war restrictions on trade with China. Most of Zebco's 240 workers will eventually lose their jobs, and Ms. Grant, who has worked at the company's stone headquarters plant in Tulsa for 25 years, expects to be one of them. 
 "I thought this only happened to other people, and now it's about to happen to me," Ms. Grant said. "We're just another company moving over there."
In promoting permanent normal trade relations with China, which the House approved in late May and the Senate is expected to vote on in late July, President Clinton predicted an "almost incalculable" increase in exports of American goods to China. But critics say the move also seems likely to encourage exports of some American jobs.
China agreed to open its markets to join the World Trade Organization and to get permanent trading rights in the United States. That should make it easier to sell American-made products there. But as China modernizes and loosens controls, its lure as a manufacturing base, which has been growing since the early 1980's, is also proving irresistible to many multinationals.
International trade is not a zero-sum "you win, I lose" game, and most economists say that even if some people lose their jobs, the United States reaps big advantages from trade and foreign investment -- like greater productivity, higher corporate profits and cheaper spincast reels. But while those substantial benefits are diffused among a vast number of people, the recipients are not celebrating as much as Zebco's workers are seething.
"Our government just handed our jobs to a Communist country," said Brenda McCoy, 50, a Zebco assembly-line veteran who wore a T-shirt to work that bears an image of two Chinese police officers choking a Chinese labor activist. "It just makes you feel angry and helpless."
The Chinese claim to have invented the modern fishing device more than a millennium ago by spooling line onto wicker reels. But it was the Zero Hour Bomb Company of Tulsa that invented and patented the spincast reel 50 years ago, with line spinning off the end of a stationary spool and remaining, famously, backlash free.
Now called Zebco, the company is a classic American success story. Its nearly fool-proof reels helped make fishing perhaps the nation's most popular leisure activity. They carry a "Made in America With Pride" logo.
Even in the last decade, as it had to fight competitors that paid much lower hourly wages to workers in Asia, Zebco remained the dominant fishing tackle brand. Though Zebco once tested production in Mexico, it pulled back when its Tulsa workers proved they could produce more reels in less time with fewer defects.
The dike finally gave way this year, however. With most of Zebco's competitors having already set up fishing tackle plants in China, allowing them to undercut Zebco's prices at Wal-Marts everywhere, Zebco began a year ago to explore the possibility of moving its own lines to China. The company found that it could commission Chinese factories to produce and deliver reels to the United States for one-third less than it could make them at home, company officials said.
Zebco decided to make most of its low-end reels at factories in China. For now, it will continue to produce more expensive reels in Tulsa, though union officials say the company has put them on notice that it is searching for further ways to lower labor costs, including the possibility of shifting the remaining reels to China, too.
"We made valiant efforts to keep production in the United States," said Kathryn J. Chieger, vice president for corporate and investor relations at the Brunswick Corporation, Zebco's parent company, in Lake Forest, Ill. "We just had a flood of product coming from Asia at prices we could not meet."
Even so, the layoffs, which began on June 27, left Zebco's unionized workers, who are mostly women, perplexed and angry.
Sitting in a dimly lit Transport Union Workers hall, the air soured by cigarette smoke and the tables stacked with copies of protest literature that workers distributed at a recent anti-China trade demonstration, Kristie L. Cater said she had expected to retire in the job.
"They kept telling us we were members of the Zebco family," she said with angry sarcasm. "I guess they just forgot about that."
As assembly-line factory jobs go, Zebco offers ordinary pay but solid benefits, including Christmas gifts of stock certificates. Workers returned the loyalty. Turnover was low. Some workers also became avid anglers, showing off Zebco's reels at bass and crappie fishing tournaments.
For Linda Allen, 41, an assembly-line supervisor since 1976, work was literally a family affair: her mother and grandmother preceded her in the job.
Those ties started to unravel last year. When company executives visited Qingdao, a city in northeastern China, to inspect factories, word leaked out. Then, earlier this year, the company pushed assembly-line workers to raise their output by at least 10 percent a month, and China became a cattle prod.
"When we don't get quota, it is another day closer to China taking our jobs," read a Feb. 3 memorandum from the company that was circulated among employees. "So today China won by 45 points."
Ms. Chieger of Brunswick said such memos were intended to show workers what they were up against in terms of competitors that had factories in China.
Still, the shop floor fell into stunned silence one March afternoon when the president of the company read a brief statement as first-shift workers finished their day. Zebco was moving some production to China. Many of those listening would lose their jobs. Zebco reels no longer commanded an "adequate profit," the statement said.
The explanation offended Ms. Grant, the Zebco forklift driver.
Ms. Grant has gray hair and delicate manners. As she speaks, her eyes dart about the living room of her A-frame house, which is decorated with porcelain figurines and homemade quilts. Only her strong shoulders reveal the heavy lifting she does each day as a Zebco receiver.
"They have never said they don't make a profit," she said. "It's that word 'adequate.' They're going over to China because of greed."
Just a few years from retirement, she said she had begun looking for a new job. Tulsa's economy is relatively strong, and she found one prospect. But if she got the job -- she worries that a touch of arthritis might hurt her chances -- she would lose her quarter-century seniority and $1.50 of her current $10.63 hourly wage, she said, money she needs to make payments on her secondhand Jeep.
Ms. Cater, 37, a mother of two, said that after she learned of her layoff on the assembly line, she told her 17-year-old daughter to check out community colleges in Tulsa; the higher-priced Colorado school she had been considering was now out of reach.
"I had some savings put away, but that's going to disappear," she said.
At least in theory, the recent steps China has taken to open its markets should be good for American factory workers and farmers by making it easier for companies to export goods to that nation.
But as union leaders argued when they tried unsuccessfully to block the China trade bill in the House, many leading United States companies are like Zebco: they face competitive pressure to save money by producing in China -- often exporting back to the United States -- rather than making goods here to sell in China.
The United States has been losing manufacturing jobs for decades, of course, and dire warnings about the hollowing out of the economy seem a little hyperbolic during the longest expansion in the nation's history. Most economists believe that the trade boom of the last decade -- more exports, cheaper imports and the reallocation of jobs to more productive parts of the economy -- forms a central pillar of the 1990's expansion.
Moreover, although the Clinton administration often listed exports as the headline benefit of broadening trade with China, the real advantage for United States companies is probably enhanced rights of investment and ownership there. Phone, Internet, bank and insurance companies can buy larger stakes in Chinese counterparts and set up operations in more cities under the terms of China's entry to the World Trade Organization. Most companies try to crack the difficult China market by setting up local operations, often using those plants as export production bases as well.
That means that the push into China is not limited to low-wage assemblers. Cisco, Intel, Eastman Kodak and Motorola are among the multinational companies that have lobbied Congress to grant China permanent normal trade relations even as they have expanded their manufacturing operations in China, according to a survey by the United States Business and Industry Council, which has been critical of Clinton administration trade policies.
Over all, exports to China will probably grow. But the volume of imports is expected to grow even faster. The United States International Trade Commission, a government agency, predicts that American exports will increase 10 percent a year if China opens its markets as promised. But it also sees China's appeal as a manufacturing base rising fast, bolstering China's exports to the United States by 7 percent annually. Since imports from China already exceed exports to China by a wide margin, the gaping $62 billion trade deficit is likely to widen rather than contract.
The way many workers see it, America loses.
Asked whether the United States was better off with cheaper fishing reels or job security for Zebco workers, Ms. Grant reflected for a moment.
"People might like buying things cheaper," she said. "But there's a price. They're going to wake up one day and find that nothing's made here."

HEADLINE: Big Retailers Say June Sales Were Weak

BYLINE: By KRUTI TRIVEDI 

 BODY:
Squeezed by rising gasoline prices and discouraged by cool, rainy weather, Americans put a brake on retail spending in June, new figures showed yesterday.
Sales in stores open for more than a year, a crucial figure for measuring the health of the retail industry, rose 2.6 percent for the month compared with the period a year earlier, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index. Except for March, when Easter sales were delayed by a month, that is the lowest percentage increase since September 1997. 
 As anemic as the numbers were, analysts said that they were in line with expectations that the economy was losing steam.
"We expected to see a slowdown," said George Strachan, a retail analyst at Goldman Sachs. "The weather was bad. Fashion was bad. Basically, it was a pretty bad month."
Consumers are not increasing their spending as much at all types of stores, ranging from specialty apparel stores like the Gap to discount stores like Kmart and department stores like Dayton Hudson, a unit of Target.
Much to the dismay of the merchants, consumers have shown an increasing distaste throughout the year for buying clothes, in particular. "There's no question that apparel sales have slowed as we've moved through the year," said Richard N. Baum, a retail analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. "We've seen a steady deceleration in same-store sales. This month they were barely positive."
In what could be another sign of a consumer slowdown, Federated Department Stores, the parent company of the Macy's and Bloomingdale chains, said its second-quarter earnings would be hurt by credit card defaults at Fingerhut, its catalog arm. Fingerhut sells merchandise mostly to lower- and middle-income Americans, and credit troubles there could foreshadow more widespread consumer woes.
Even discount chains like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, which led the booming growth last year, all reported moderate to poor sales in June. Wal-Mart's sales increased 4.8 percent at stores open for more than a year, but the rise was mostly a result of food sales, analysts said. Target's discount stores reported growth of 2.1 percent, in large part because of difficulties with its women's apparel business, a company spokeswoman said. Over all, Target's sales rose 1.1 percent. Kmart fared the worst, showing a 1 percent drop in sales, also because of problems with apparel, one analyst said.
Department stores and specialty stores also had difficulties. There were widespread markdowns to get rid of excess inventory, and analysts said such price cuts could eventually reduce profits.
In the specialty retail sector, Gap Inc., which has been struggling to get the fashion mix in its stores right for nearly nine months, missed again in June as sales fell 2 percent. Sales at the company's Old Navy division dropped by at least 7 percent, but analysts said that was because Old Navy had phenomenal growth of more than 30 percent last year.
Gap also announced yesterday that it would miss earnings estimates by 3 cents a share for the current quarter, but its shares rose $3.75, to $33.625, because analysts expected the news to be worse.
The Limited, on the other hand, reported a 6 percent increase in same-store sales, but its stock hardly moved. It continued to benefit from its teenager-friendly Express division, analysts said, but investors were less confident about the Structure and Lane Bryant divisions, both of which reported decreasing sales.
There were a few standouts in terms of sales. Neiman Marcus, for example, pulled in more customers by having its annual men's sale in June instead of May and by cutting back on its more moderately priced lines. Its sales rose 17.3 percent. And Intimate Brands, which reported a 9 percent sales increase, was bolstered by lingerie sales at its Victoria's Secret Stores.

Instead of the turmoil that many feared a close election in Mexico could set off, Vicente Fox Quesada's seven-percentage-point victory margin, wider by far than most polls had predicted, has buoyed the spirits not just of Mexican voters but of investors and business executives across North America.
The Mexican peso strengthened immediately after the election, the Mexican stock market hit a three-month high before dropping back a bit, and American investors generally were delighted -- not necessarily because Mr. Fox won, but because the decisive way he won kept Mexico calm and open for business. 
 But as people get used to the idea that Mexico's 71 years of one-party rule are coming to an end, investors, analysts and business leaders are beginning to ask just how Mr. Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, intends to handle the complex economic issues facing his country. And there are questions whether, in the interconnected global economy that he says he wants Mexico to remain part of, he has much leeway at all.
"First there was this euphoria, then everybody was standing around scratching their head," said John M. Bruton, executive vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City. "People of all classes voted for him because they think he can change their situations. Now, managing expectations is going to be Mr. Fox's greatest challenge."
So much of the campaign was focused on change for the sake of change that other issues did not get much attention. There was never much distance between the economic platforms of the principal candidates, and throughout the campaign Mr. Fox avoided laying out a detailed program of economic change. Instead, he offered standard campaign promises of increasing jobs, promoting investment and producing economic growth that would help the millions of Mexicans living in poverty.
Mr. Fox has made it clear that he intends to stay the economic course -- opening Mexico to the global economy and embracing free-market discipline -- set by previous administrations, but he has made it equally clear that he is not happy with the way that many Mexicans have been left behind. He supports an independent central bank, a free-floating exchange rate and increased exports. He even said earlier this week that the North American Free Trade Agreement should be amplified to further integrate North America, perhaps with a common currency for Mexico, the United States and Canada, "20, 30 or 40 years from now."
But he is facing many far more immediate issues, including the millions of Mexicans who have never recovered the purchasing power they had before the first of several end-of-administration crises in the early 1980's.
"A lot of Mexicans feel their economic circumstances have gotten worse and they expect results very quickly," said Joyce Chang, global head of fixed-income research at Chase Securities in New York. "Fox has to be careful about how he handles expectations."
Mr. Fox has a reputation as a pragmatist when it comes to business and the economy. As governor of the small state of Guanajuato, he started a program of providing loans for very small businesses as a way of promoting entrepreneurship, and he intends to repeat the program on the national level. He has also talked about copying Chile's program of providing tax relief for companies that reinvest in Chile.
One of Mr. Fox's first economic tasks will be to name an economic cabinet that inspires investor confidence in a party that has never run Mexico. He is said to be considering a treasury secretary from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. One name being mentioned is Luis Tellez, the current energy secretary.
Mr. Fox must also prepare a federal budget that by law has to be approved -- by a congress his party does not control -- within 15 days of his inauguration on Dec. 1.
Mr. Fox's chief economic adviser, Luis Ernesto Derbez, a former World Bank official who is often mentioned as a possible treasury secretary under Mr. Fox, told investors in New York yesterday that work on the budget had already begun.
Mr. Derbez said Mexican political leaders had been asked to outline budget priorities, and preliminary talks were under way with the PRI, as well as with the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution, to gauge the limits of cooperation. Mr. Fox wants to name his cabinet by the end of August and present a budget proposal by Sept. 1.
Analysts will be watching to see how Mr. Fox squares his campaign promise to increase spending for education and social programs with his pledge to decrease the current budget deficit by half. Mr. Derbez said legislation would be introduced to close tax loopholes. He also said the government would consider extending the value-added tax to medicine and food -- but only if there was a way to soften the effect on the poor.
John B. Chambers, deputy head of the sovereign ratings group at Standard & Poor's, said his company's analysts would be following the budget process and the fall legislative session in Mexico City for clues to whether the major parties will cooperate or stumble into gridlock.
Another rating company, Moody's Investors Services, upgraded Mexico's debt to investment grade in early March, but Standard & Poor's did not. This week, S.& P. affirmed its rating of one notch below investment grade, with a positive outlook for an upgrade if the new administration takes care of some pending issues.
"It really is a question of how effective we think the Fox administration is going to be in implementing the structural reform agenda," Mr. Chambers said. "Clues on that could come as early as the fourth quarter of this year." S.& P. says it will be watching for further strengthening of Mexico's banking system and deregulation of the electricity and petroleum sectors.
The last three Mexican administrations ended with currency devaluations and economic turmoil. Fears of another crisis diminished with the strength of Mr. Fox's victory, and the continuing strength of Mexico's economy. Jonathan E. Heath, a Mexican economist who wrote a book on the causes of the end-of-administration crises, says most of the factors that caused them -- a fixed exchange rate and an oversized current accounts deficit, for example -- have been eliminated.
"There's still the slim possibility of a shock that would be caused by an assassination attempt on Fox," Mr. Heath said, "but barring something weird like that, the chances of another crisis are very slim."
Rather than a meltdown, some investors are worried that the post-election ecstasy could actually make Mexico's economy overheat just as the United States economy begins to show signs of slowing down. The first two days after the election, the Mexican stock market jumped 8.2 percent, but profit taking wiped away some of that gain, leaving the market up 5.1 percent since the vote.
"Consumption, capital inflows, domestic investment, foreign direct investment, all are increasing because of this injection of confidence," said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief Latin American investment strategist for Goldman, Sachs. "The thing to do now is slow down the Mexican economy using fiscal and monetary means. Fox needs to address that in the transition."
Mr. Mariscal said that for him one incident best described the current mood of excitement and uncertainty in Mexico. Just before the election, a manufacturer in Mexico City who supported Mr. Fox loaded barrels of fragrances on a pickup truck and drove around the city's main highway. He wanted voters to know that the possibility of change was so real they could smell it.
But something went wrong: a barrel spilled onto the roadway, and there was a multicar pileup.
"Mexico," Mr. Mariscal said, "still presents tremendous challenges."

Graph/Chart: "Trying to Break the Cycle"
Presidential election years in Mexico have coincided with or been immediately followed by economic declines. Some analysts, like the Standard & Poor's credit-rating agency, say Mexico could break the cycle if it meets some challenging economic and policy goals.
 
Graph tracks year-over-year change in mexico's gross domestic product since 1981.
 
Steps that Standard & Poor's says Mexico must take:
 
Enact comprehensive tax changes to broaden the tax base and reduce the government's dependence on oil taxes.
End deficit spending.
Minimize current accounts deficit.
Avoid gridlock in a divided congress.
Strengthen the banking system.
Reduce state control of key economic sectors, particularly energy.

HEADLINE: A Spirited Campaign for Ohio Court Puts Judges on New Terrain

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio

 BODY:
Candidates for State Supreme Court here are usually so unknown that contestants with familiar names have often won because, political scientists say, voters thought they were actually voting for someone they knew.
But this year, at least two candidates for Ohio Supreme Court -- and quite possibly all seven members of the panel -- may soon be wishing for those days of glorious obscurity. A boisterous, multimillion-dollar election battle for one seat on the court is making two candidates household names, while drawing uncomfortable attention to all seven members of the rancorously divided court. 
 The race is making Ohio a case study in an aggressive new judicial politics that is reshaping courts and drawing unprecedented political spending to campaigns for state judgeships nationwide.
"People around the country are watching the Ohio judicial race," said Seth S. Anderson, director of the Hunter Center for Judicial Selection at the American Judicature Society, a nonpartisan group. "It typifies the intense involvement of interest groups in judicial races that has been growing for the last 15 years but that could reach its apex in Ohio this year."
Listeners to WSPD radio in Toledo have been hearing an unusual advertisement that seems to put the entire Ohio Supreme Court on trial. It was placed by the Michigan Chamber of Commerce to lure Ohio businesses to the state, chamber officials said.
"The Ohio Supreme Court," the commercial says, "has rejected reasonable legal reform," when it blocked efforts by the Ohio Legislature to limit liability suits against businesses.
Some people here (Democrats) said the advertisement was an example of plotting by Chamber of Commerce types against their candidate, Justice Alice Robie Resnick, an incumbent abhorred by business groups because she wrote the decision blocking the liability measures.
Other people (Republicans) said the advertisements were just a reminder of why Ohio jobs would be saved by their candidate, Terrence O'Donnell, a Cleveland appeals court judge who broadly hints he would have voted differently, saying he is against "activist judges."
The Michigan Chamber of Commerce president, E. James Barrett, denied being in league with anyone. But whatever their true purpose, the advertisements were another reminder that judicial races are beginning to provoke the same partisanship as races for other offices.
In a year when state Supreme Court campaigns across the country are transforming judges more fully into politicians, Ohio is leading the way, said Mark F. Kozlowski, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, which studies judicial independence.
"If there is success in defeating Resnick in Ohio, that could very well become a model." Mr. Kozlowski said, "Because there is an extremely focused, specific campaign against her, and if they defeat her that could become the textbook case."
Although the election is not until November, accusations have been flying here for months. With predictions that spending on the race could reach $12 million, the campaign is expected to be the most expensive judicial race in Ohio, and is likely to be one of the most expensive in the country.
A race is also under way for another seat on the court, but the Republican incumbent, Deborah L. Cook, is favored over her challenger, a Democratic Municipal Court judge, Timothy S. Black.
At stake in the Resnick-O'Donnell race is the ideological balance of the court, which has been split 4 to 3 on many economic issues, including so-called tort reform, which is how supporters describe the efforts to reduce the number of lawsuits.
But, with many state courts around the country similarly divided, the Ohio election has also drawn the attention of national groups that view it as a test of strategies in battles over state courts.
Each judicial campaign is limited by law to spending $550,000. The balance of the spending is expected to be by unions, lawyers, business groups and political parties, which are coming to see the courts as a political forum like any other. Ohio imposes no limits on spending by interest groups.
In interviews, Judge O'Donnell and Justice Resnick expressed surprise at finding themselves the objects of so much attention. Judge O'Donnell virtually squirmed during an interview in his chambers and talked of earlier campaigns in which, he said, reputation and integrity had been the only issues.
Justice Resnick seemed breathless from the intensity of the campaign. "With these special interest groups," she said, "people are beginning to think judges are politicians, that seats can be bought on courts."
Over the last year, Justice Resnick has inflamed Republican legislators and business groups by writing majority opinions in two highly publicized cases. The decisions struck down measures to limit suits by people claiming injury, and the state's system of financing public schools.
For many here, the rulings highlighted an ideological standoff on the court, in which two Republicans have voted with the court's two Democrats on some issues.
In her opinion in the school case last month, Justice Resnick seemed outraged by what she said were the inequities of financing public schools largely through property taxes. For the second time in three years, the court ruled that the school financing system controlled by the Republican governor and Legislature had deprived students in poorer districts of the education guaranteed them. In her opinion, Justice Resnick dwelled on descriptions of sewage leaks in Ohio schools.
Republicans have declared that a "Resnick tax" will be necessary to pay for the public schools, and the state's Republican chairman, Robert T. Bennett, created an acronym for the race -- DARTH -- for Defeat Alice Resnick Tax Hike.
The three Republicans in the minority on the court, including the court's chief justice, Thomas J. Moyer, have appeared to be crying for rescue.
At a political meeting in April, Justice Moyer said Judge O'Donnell shared his philosophy of judicial restraint. Without mentioning Justice Resnick, according to The Toledo Blade, the chief justice added that "when a Supreme Court justice decides he or she is smarter than the Legislature, what they are doing, in my view, is overruling the will of the people."
An ethics panel of Ohio judges is considering complaints filed against Justice Moyer by a critic of the court and a county Democratic Party chairman, who said he had violated rules intended to keep judges outside the political fray. Chief Justice Moyer has said he did not make a political endorsement, but acknowledged that he would not have spoken so glowingly about Judge O'Donnell if he had known reporters were in the room.
Judge O'Donnell, 54, who often uses the word "traditional" to describe himself, was chosen by Republican leaders to oppose Justice Resnick. A review of more than 50 of his decisions shows that he has expressed a conservative view of the role of courts, but has seldom made sweeping comments about legal issues.
In a lawsuit by the mother of a young man killed at a gay nightclub, for example, Judge O'Donnell tersely ruled that the club could not be held liable for failing to provide adequate security because its owners had no reason to expect a homicide. A Democratic judge, Leo M. Spellacy, dissented, saying the dead man's family had a right to a trial because owners had failed to provide security inside the club, even though it was in a high-crime neighborhood and there had been previous violence.
In the interview, Judge O'Donnell declined to characterize his judicial philosophy and said he had also voted for plaintiffs in some cases. Judges, he said, "should not be for or against anything."
Some of Judge O'Donnell's critics here have said his emphasis on opposing judicial activism is a coded way of saying he would vote to overturn some of the decisions written by Justice Resnick.
"I am not talking in code," he said.
Justice Resnick, who was first elected to the state's top court in 1988, is no firebrand, either, though she has consistently ruled that injured people have a right to have their claims heard in court. Now 60, she patiently climbed the ranks of Democratic judicial politics from the trial court after first winning election in Toledo in 1975. Earlier, as a prosecutor, she was a staunch death penalty proponent, with 10 death sentences on her resume.
On the State Supreme Court, Justice Resnick has been neither particularly famous nor liberal. She has enthusiastically agreed with conservative criminal justice rulings. Once, in a case involving a protester who had burned an American flag, she voted against a decision that said the jury should have been told that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment.
Justice Resnick said she saw the current campaign as a battle of fundamental values. Her opponents, she said in an interview, "want business to not have to worry about any negative decisions. To me, the most serious thing going on in this country is what corporate America is doing to working men and women."
The liability decision last summer made Justice Resnick a political target. For more than a decade, the Legislature had passed measures limiting injury claims and the court had struck them down as violations of the Ohio constitution's guarantees of the right to access to the courts.
Then in 1996, the Republicans who had gained control of the Legislature passed many of those same laws again. In what legal experts said was a rare challenge to a court's authority, the legislators included provisions that simply said they "respectfully disagree" that the provisions violated the constitution.
In a 4-to-3 opinion, Justice Resnick said the court had no choice but to strike down the laws again. To do otherwise, she wrote, would make the court "a co-conspirator in the abdication of fundamental individual rights and liberties contained in our Constitution."
The decision certainly gained notice for Justice Resnick.
Insurance, medical and other business groups began working against her. She "defied the will of the people" as expressed by the laws limiting injury claims, said Andrew E. Doehrel, the president of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, who said his members were mobilized to defeat her.
But the decision won Justice Resnick support, too. Plaintiffs' lawyers, consumer groups and unions are behind her. The Democratic Party will spend "whatever it takes" to defend her, said David J. Leland, the state chairman.
In the quaint ways of the law, it was a procedural fluke that landed Justice Resnick in the position of writing two of the most visible court decisions here in years. After the justices vote on cases, the court selects which justice will write the opinions by lot, drawing numbered marbles out of a leather jar.
So, just as she was facing a re-election bid, it happened that Justice Resnick's number was drawn both for the liability and school cases. The spokesman for the court here in Columbus, Jay Weubbold, said the number on the marble assigned to Justice Resnick is seven. It is not yet clear whether it is her lucky number.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PROCESS;
A Select Group Speaks Out On the Democratic Platform

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, July 6

 BODY:
The Democratic Party opened public hearings on its platform here today with a tightly scripted display of party unity, hearing from a parade of witnesses who endorsed Vice President Al Gore's positions on almost every major campaign issue, including gun control, the economy, health care, education and the environment.
The daylong hearing provided further evidence that Mr. Gore, who easily defeated former Senator Bill Bradley in the primaries, will not face the kind of bitter policy divisions that have bedeviled Democratic presidential nominees of the past. 
 Democratic officials intend to release a draft of the platform on Friday. And they made it clear that they expected it to be a clear articulation of Mr. Gore's vision rather than the kind of ideological treatise he might feel compelled to run away from.
"My sense is that much of this is straight out of what he has already had to say, what he has already proposed," Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, chairman of the platform drafting committee, said today. "And I think he can run on it and win," Mr. Hunt said.
The Democrats are hoping that their unified front will give them the appearance of greater party strength than the Republicans, whose platform meetings continue to provide a forum for fierce debate over abortion.
This year, the trade issue was widely expected to be the Democrats' platform equivalent of abortion. Many trade unions and environmentalists, major components of the Democratic base, have opposed the Clinton administration's position on global trade, arguing that it has hurt the environment and siphoned jobs away from American workers.
But today, trade was rarely mentioned. Indeed, the one person expected to raise the issue, Alan Reuther, legislative director for the United Automobile Workers, did not show up. Democratic officials said Mr. Reuther had a scheduling conflict.
One of the few discordant notes was sounded by Amy Isaacs, national director of Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal group. Speaking on the trade issue, Ms. Isaacs said: "Granting China permanent normal trade relations is a step in the wrong direction, we believe. As a nation, we must state clearly that profits over people is untenable."
Ms. Isaacs added that "liberals in the country are very uneasy" with the nation's political drift. And she urged the people writing the Democratic platform not to blur the distinctions between the two major parties, a criticism often leveled at the Democrats by Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president.
Mary Leigh Blek, a registered Republican from Orange County, Calif., who helped organize the Million Mom March for gun control earlier this year, typified their tone. Ms. Blek, without explicitly endorsing Mr. Gore, complained that the leadership of the Republican Party had not heard the voices of mothers who want stronger gun laws.
"But I think in November, they are going to hear it," she said.
Democratic officials said the committee was likely to face some policy debates behind closed doors tonight as they hammered out the final draft. For instance, labor officials are pushing for stronger language defending the rights of workers to form unions. They also want a clearer pledge of support for trade agreements that protect the environment and workers' rights.
Some members of the committee are also expected to push for a more sweeping declaration of the party's support for ending discrimination against gays and lesbians and a more powerful condemnation of racially motivated violence.
But those debates are expected play out on the fringes, not at the heart, of the 10,000- to 20,000-word document.
"We're not looking for a fight here at all," said Gerry Shea, a top official with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., who is on the platform drafting committee.

HEADLINE: 2 Views of Mideast Peace

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 6

 BODY:
There is a go-for-broke quality to the Israeli and American approach to the coming Camp David summit meeting, which starts on Tuesday with the stated goal of ending a 52-year-old, blood-steeped conflict.
But for the Palestinians, whose participation is more reluctant, there is at best an aspiration that the three-way meeting will serve as a stopgap to keep alive the stalemated peace effort so that a partial deal can be achieved by September. 
 Prime Minister Ehud Barak will arrive in Maryland as a weakened Israeli leader with one thing on his mind: to push the peace effort with the Palestinians to a conclusion before he loses his grip on power. Battered by the right over his peace moves and by the left over his concessions to the religious parties, he will try to rise above the partisan politics that, with two parties poised to quit his coalition, is about to cost him his parliamentary majority.
Mr. Barak will seek to forge the framework of a final peace deal with the Palestinians on the basis of what he considers a directive from the Israeli people, who overwhelming elected him last year on a platform of peacemaking. And if he fails, he said today, he will have given it his best effort in the face of a potential for the conflict to disintegrate "into Belfast or Bosnia."
Similarly, President Clinton appears to have decided that he cannot make things worse by forcing the parties into an endgame, since no summit meeting and a failed summit meeting have the same potential outcome: violence. If the chemistry of the moment produces a breakthrough, the accomplishment is substantial. If not, the risk to the American president is minimal.
But the Palestinians' leader, Yasir Arafat, whose lifelong struggle rests on this effort, will approach Camp David far more skeptically and cautiously than the other two leaders. He will take part against the counsel of his senior advisers, who think the groundwork has not been laid for a compromise on any major issue.
Of mixed mind, Mr. Arafat is saying that he is going only because he cannot refuse an invitation from President Clinton. But he is also betting that if negotiations are to work, he stands to gain the most at a high-stakes summit meeting presided over by this American president, with whom he has forged a bond. Weighing the alternative -- a unilateral declaration of statehood, which is bound to be accompanied by violence, an Israeli annexation of West Bank land and complications for Mr. Arafat's international acceptance -- he is willing to gamble.
Like Anwar el-Sadat, before the last Middle East peace gathering at Camp David, in 1978, Mr. Arafat needs to deliver some kind of victory to his people, weary of bloodshed.
Having proclaimed and disclaimed previous deadlines for establishing a state, Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian leadership this week tied the Palestinian fate to a new one, Sept. 13. This one will be harder to ignore if he is to retain his credibility; it marks the formal end of the interim peacemaking period, which was extended from May 4, 1999.
But the chief economic adviser to Mr. Arafat, Mohammed Rachid, said tonight that the Palestinians would willingly bypass the deadline if they were engaged in serious negotiations. And many experts think the Palestinian people, who would prefer a real state to a nominal one, could be persuaded to endure another postponement if they saw any tangible progress, like a substantial transfer of West Bank land.
"The people are pragmatic and they'll accept a bird in the hand," said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst. "There is a growing minority that rejects the peace process, but it is not a majority, and there is no alternative. There is no other game."
A cartoon in the Palestinian newspaper Al Quds today showed the spirit of the meeting as a whirlwind blowing out the candle of the Palestinian declaration of independence.
Israeli military analysts paint a different picture. In a briefing for foreign reporters today, a senior military officer in the West Bank said Mr. Arafat had introduced a "struggle consciousness" to accompany the negotiations. He said Mr. Arafat wants to achieve independence "through friction and blood."
"The rules of the game are low-intensity conflict accompanying the diplomatic process with the threat of terrorism in the background," the senior officer said. "Arafat wants to appear as both the pyromaniac and the fireman."
One could be whipsawed by the surface contradictions here today between the bounding optimism of Israeli doves and the thick skepticism of Palestinian officials.
Leaving a meeting with Mr. Arafat in Gaza City, Yossi Beilin, Israel's justice minister, expressed unconditional faith in the eventuality of a peace deal. "I don't believe that all the leaders will go to Camp David and come back empty-handed," he said. "We are going to make peace. And after all these years, we will have to compromise, both sides, to find solutions and come back home and tell our kids that they will not have to take part in the wars we took part in."
In contrast, Abu Ala, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature and a senior negotiator, said he does not think the summit meeting will achieve any of its aims. "It is clear that Barak is trying to escape from negotiations and jump to a summit because he thinks he can force deals," he said. "But if he thinks that he can give us some land on which to declare a Palestinian state and then we will forget the other issues, then he's living in a dream world."
Mr. Rachid, a relatively unideological and pragmatic adviser, spoke more practically about what could be achieved. He said that, in Israeli style and on an Israeli scale, the Palestinians would ask the Americans for $40 billion in aid to accompany a peace treaty. Most of that would go toward refugee aid, he said.
He also that the Israelis were overly focused on the percentage of the West Bank they would transfer to the Palestinians. He noted that Mr. Barak, who started out talking about turning over 50 percent of the land, had increased his offer most recently to 88 percent -- 78 percent now and 10 percent over time. But Mr. Rachid said the Palestinians wanted the Israelis to stop thinking of it as their land to give away and to start accepting the principle that the Palestinians have a rightful claim to the West Bank. That, he suggested, would make the Palestinians more flexible.
Mr. Barak is unlikely to travel to Washington with his most hard-line ministers because they are expected to quit before he leaves. Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, who leads a small Russian immigrant party, has said he will tender his resignation on Sunday, and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, who leads the National Religious Party, is prepared to step down too. Eli Yishai, leader of the rigorously Orthodox Shas Party, is undecided about whether he will travel with the prime minister.
Mr. Barak is expected to be accompanied by a delegation including Foreign Minister David Levy, Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben Ami, and Attorney General Elyakim Rubenstein and his security advisers. Mr. Arafat's delegation will include Mr. Abu Ala, Mr. Rachid, the senior negotiators Abu Mazen and Saeb Erekat, and Mohammed Dahlan, a security chief.

HEADLINE: SOCCER;
Political Football: Germany Lands the 2006 World Cup

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
In a mild surprise, Germany was awarded the 2006 World Cup over South Africa yesterday as international soccer officials apparently chose the certain success of the world's largest sporting event in a European country over concerns of stability and safety about post-apartheid South Africa.
Germany prevailed by one vote in a dramatic result that carried much political soccer intrigue in Zurich, the home of the sport's world governing body, known by its French initials as FIFA. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany said the victory showed that his country was "open to the world and hospitable" a half-century after Nazism and nearly three decades after the slaying of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. 
 Meanwhile, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa called the defeat "a tragic day for Africa." Securing the World Cup was being viewed as a way to help transform South Africa as it continues to reshape itself from its recent past of government-mandated racial separation by boosting national pride, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors and a billion television viewers, adding several billions of dollars and more than 100,000 jobs to the struggling economy and ameliorating the concerns of skittish international investors. While rugby and cricket are the national sports of white South Africans, soccer is the sport of choice for the overwhelming black majority.
South Africa had been host to the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the 1996 African Nations Cup soccer championships and believed it had the necessary stadiums, infrastructure and technology to stage the 2006 World Cup. Instead, for the second time in three years, it was denied a major international sporting event. In the fall of 1997, Cape Town lost to Athens in its bid to be host of the 2004 Summer Games as members of the International Olympic Committee voiced concerns after Nelson Mandela left office as president of South Africa.
Alan I. Rothenberg, the past president of the United States Soccer Federation who headed the FIFA committee that inspected the countries bidding on the 2006 World Cup, said his group had ranked Germany just ahead of South Africa in terms of preparedness. Germany is an international soccer power, having won three World Cups and three European titles, and it has Europe's strongest economy. It also entered yesterday's voting with the firm backing of the eight Europeans who are one-third of the 24-member FIFA executive committee, whose main job is to award the World Cup. For the 2002 World Cup, South Korea and Japan will be the co-hosts.
On Monday, Brazil had withdrawn its candidacy and thrown its support behind South Africa, reportedly in exchange for South Africa's support of its bid for the 2010 World Cup. Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, the president of FIFA, had also thrown his public support behind South Africa. England's chances disappeared with the thuggish acts of hooliganism committed by its fans at the recently completed European Championships held in Belgium and the Netherlands. Morocco was never given a serious chance of winning because the North African nation had a severe lack of necessary stadiums.
"I would say the vote was a mild surprise, not a shock," Rothenberg, who organized the most successful World Cup ever held, in the United States in 1994, said by telephone from Zurich. "We felt for some time that it would come down to Germany or South Africa and be very close."
Both countries were considered well qualified, Rothenberg said, but increasing violence in South Africa appeared to make some voters hesitant.
"On the one hand, nothing could be surer than having Germany or any other major western European country hosting a World Cup," Rothenberg said. "It's going to be enormously successful. South Africa came down to people assessing in their heart that while they may want it to go to South Africa, it is better to wait a while longer. This new country is only six years old. Obviously it has certain safety problems. We were satisfied after speaking with law enforcement and security people that people would be safe going there during the World Cup. We were satisfied; possibly other people weren't."
In the end, yesterday's voting was also affected by the ubiquitous and complicated political intrigue that attends the awarding of all major international sporting events. Three rounds of polling were necessary before Germany prevailed with a majority of votes from FIFA's executive committee. In the final round, Germany prevailed by 12-11, with an unexplained abstention from Charles Dempsey, a delegate from New Zealand.
The South Africans claimed that Dempsey had reneged on a promise to vote for them after England had been eliminated. His abstention led to speculation that Blatter, FIFA's president, had orchestrated the German victory behind the scenes even though he publicly supported South Africa. Had Dempsey voted for South Africa, leaving the result even at 12-12, Blatter would have been called upon to break the tie.
"I was a little bit sad that the executive committee had not the courage to innovate," Blatter said. "We have to trust Africa and we have to take this decision. We have to take the risk, otherwise they will never have a chance."
"It's very strange, unfortunate," Rothenberg said of Dempsey's abstention. "He claimed he was under enormous pressure. So is everyone on the committee. It's probably the single most important thing you do as a member of the FIFA executive committee, vote on the host of the World Cup. You make your vote and take the consequences. Some like it or hate it, but that's life. You do the right thing. I don't understand."

HEADLINE: Business Links On Web Raise Antitrust Issues

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 6

 BODY:
As companies in practically every industry rush to join business-to-business exchanges on the Internet, regulators are growing concerned that they will face a rash of new antitrust questions for which they are not prepared.
Known as B2B Web sites, the exchanges create a place for companies in the same industry, be it automobiles or grain, to buy and sell goods, potentially saving millions of dollars in back-office costs by setting up a national marketplace online. But the sites, which can compile huge amounts of sensitive data and are often jointly owned by corporate rivals, also create opportunities for collusion and price-fixing that did not exist before, antitrust experts say. 
 Both regulators and executives agree that the stakes are enormous. B2B sites already account for about $150 billion in annual sales, significantly more than the better-known consumer sites like Amazon.com. And that number is expected to grow exponentially as businesses move more and more into buying and selling on the Web.
"Antitrust has never had this kind of factual scenario to look at before," said Susan DeSanti, the director of policy planning for the Federal Trade Commission.
Last week, the commission took the unusual step of holding a two-day conference to which it invited executives, lawyers and consumer advocates to advise it on how to regulate B2B marketplaces. Already, the commission is examining Covisint, the site being planned by the nation's Big Three automakers, and last month the Department of Justice said it was investigating one that is being led by six large meatpacking companies.
The Senate Commerce Committee also plans to hold a hearing this month on the airline industry's joint Web sites. And law firms are doing a brisk business in advising business-to-business exchanges on how to organize themselves so as to avoid regulatory scrutiny.
Government officials are beginning to take notice now because in recent months one group of major companies after another has announced plans to form exchanges.
Indeed, legal experts say B2B exchanges are likely to present the next major forum -- after the Microsoft trial and the proposed WorldCom-Sprint and America Online-Time Warner mergers -- for the debate over how century-old antitrust laws should be applied to the new world of the Internet. As in the previous cases, lawyers say, the questions are not new: What is collusion and how can it be stopped? When are competitors allowed to cooperate with each other? Which rivals can they exclude from an alliance?
The new twists are the speed with which companies are able to communicate with one another and the frequency with which longtime rivals, like DaimlerChrysler and General Motors and Ford, are setting up joint ventures. Legal experts say those ventures -- the B2B exchanges -- will give suppliers the opportunity to signal each other about price increases, for instance, or manufacturers a chance to conspire to pay artificially low prices for their supplies.
"It's like the issue that came up with Microsoft," said Andrew I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University School of Law. "Is antitrust up to dealing with technology?"
Corporate executives, for their part, say the exchanges will increase competition by giving companies access to the most updated, accurate information about prices. That in turn will lower businesses' costs, increasing profits for efficient companies and eventually bringing lower prices to consumers, they add.
For now, regulators say they are trying to learn as much as they can about the B2B sites before issuing any far-reaching policies or bringing lawsuits against individual exchanges. "We at the F.T.C. are very much in a learning phase," Sheila F. Anthony, a commissioner, told executives and lawyers at last week's conference.
"The promise of huge efficiencies is certainly tantalizing," Ms. Anthony added. "On the other hand, I can't help but wonder if there might be a serpent in the garden of efficiencies."
And Orson Swindle, another commissioner, said: "We must get this right. Otherwise, we could do terrible harm."
The sites take any number of forms, from auctions that resemble eBay to online catalogs that allow buyers to sift through products. Some, like Covisint, are set up by the companies doing the buying. Others, like MetalSite, which is owned mainly by steel manufacturers, are run by sellers.
In either case, though, regulators' worries fall into two general areas, Ms. DeSanti said. In shorthand, Professor Gavil added, the issues can be thought of as "exclusion" (who is allowed to participate in the exchanges, under what conditions) and "collusion" (what the participants might do with the information they gather).
At the heart of the regulators' concerns is how the rapid exchange of information on the Web sites will affect the companies' behavior.
In almost every sector of the economy, industry groups now spend weeks collecting data on prices and sales volumes. On the B2B exchanges, by contrast, companies will be able to see current information immediately. That could make it easier for them to coordinate the pricing of goods without ever speaking to each other about it -- a practice that legal scholars call conscious parallelism.
Lacking detailed, current information, a company might decide to cut prices in a few markets and hope it can steal some market share before a rival catches on, said Jonathan B. Baker, a former F.T.C. official who now teaches at American University's law school. On a business-to-business Web site, however, information travels more quickly and could eliminate the price wars.
The worry is more than than just hypothetical, antitrust experts say. In 1992, the Justice Department sued the nation's large airlines, accusing them of using their computer reservation systems to send up trial balloons on price changes. Smaller airlines also opposed the system, saying they lacked the money to buy computers that had suddenly become necessary to compete.
As a result of the suit, the airlines agreed to stop publishing information about future changes in fares.
Though the legal proceedings surrounding it ended years ago, the airline reservation system has become a frequent topic of discussion among executives, corporate lawyers and government officials today. The central questions it raised in the early 1990's -- of the ways that a network can cause collusion and exclusion -- are the same ones at the core of the new B2B debate, lawyers say.
"It's a fair analogy," said Mark L. Walsh, the chief executive of VerticalNet, which owns 56 B2B marketplaces. Business-to-business exchanges offer "a similar potential for abuse," he added.
Consumer advocates also say that because so many of the exchanges are owned by competitors, the Web sites will allow rivals to make decisions jointly about production levels and inventories, becoming de facto cartels in the mold of OPEC. "These are serious, structural issues," said Mark Cooper, the research director of the Consumer Federation of America.
To address the concerns -- and avoid regulatory run-ins -- the companies setting up the exchanges are including antitrust lawyers at almost every stage of the planning, executives say. The lawyer for MetalSite has attended all of the site's board meetings, and MetalSite executives avoid giving specific data to its board members, who work for the steel companies that own the site, said David B. Bordo, the site's chief operating officer.
"We probably show our board less information than most boards see," Mr. Bordo said. "They only see aggregated data,"
The exchanges hope to convince their customers that the Web sites are independent of the companies that founded them. Covisint, for example, is now negotiating with the F.T.C. over the terms of its formal separation from the car companies that created it, said A. Alan Turfe, the G.M. executive who is the exchange's interim co-chief executive.
The customers, meanwhile, are concerned that proprietary information -- like how much aluminum they are buying and at what price -- will become available to rivals or clients.
Francis P. Lopez, the chief executive of the Aztec Manufacturing Corporation, an auto industry supplier in Romulus, Mich., said B2B Web sites could cut costs and offered "tremendous, tremendous advantages."
"But there are a lot of gray areas people are concerned about," Mr. Lopez added. "We have to make sure we have the ability to protect privacy" of companies' sensitive data.

Over the last year, companies in a wide range of industries have announced plans to form Internet marketplaces where they and their suppliers can buy and sell goods. The flurry of announcements has caused government regulators to begin examining the potential antitrust problems that the exchanges could create.
 
Recent announcements of major marketplaces, known as business-to-business Web sites, include:
 
Covisint -- A joint venture among several major auto companies, including DaimlerChrysler, Ford and General Motors. The automakers have agreed to do all of their purchasing on one Web site.
 
GlobalNetExchange -- Sears, Roebuck and Carrefour of France, together with Oracle, plan to create a global online marketplace for the retail industry, inviting other retailers to join. The joint venture will initially focus on the combined $80 billion in purchases that Sears and Carrefour make from 50,000 suppliers, partners and distributors.
 
Orbitz -- Several airlines have banded together to create a fare site for leisure travelers. Delta, United, Northwest, Continental and American will take part. The site is expected to offer fares similar to the discount tickets available on the airlines' own sites.
 
Transora -- Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Nestle and 46 other consumer-goods makers are investing $250 million in Transora.com, an online marketplace where they can negotiate prices with suppliers, buyers and distributors to lower costs. The companies generate about $500 billion in annual sales.

HEADLINE: As Teacher in the Classroom, Internet Needs Fine-Tuning

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: WEAVERVILLE, Calif.

 BODY:
When it learned last year that a private company was offering college-level Advanced Placement courses on the Web, the lone high school in this remote gold-rush town thought it had finally discovered a perfect way to mine the genuine academic potential of the Internet.
For the school, Trinity High, with 500 students, the prospect of hiring its own Advanced Placement teacher had always been an unaffordable luxury, even though taking such courses has become a near necessity for students to get into the most competitive colleges. 
 So the school, in the redwood-dense mountains halfway between San Francisco and the Oregon border, logged on. In essence, it took the Clinton administration up on its pledge that there was educational salvation in new technology, and that the Web could help the nation's poorest schools approximate the offerings of the wealthiest, particularly in a corner of the curriculum where the discrepancies are most stark.
But so far the results here and elsewhere have been ragged, suggesting that a computer can be a crude substitute for a live teacher, particularly when the students are so young, the stakes for them are so high and the technology is so new.
Several thousand high school students nationwide took college-level courses online this year through a private company, Apex Learning, or one of three state university systems. They included two teenagers here, each of them enrolled in an Advanced Placement government and politics class in which the lessons were transmitted through electronic text and animated short films, with grades reported via e-mail. The teacher was never seen.
One Weaverville student dropped out midway through the spring semester because, he said, he could not summon the stamina to continue, absent a teacher standing in front of him; the other student finished the same course, but two weeks late, frustrated by countless technical glitches that often prevented him from logging onto the Web for hours.
Similar growing pains were felt by other districts, including some of those that also contracted with Apex, of Bellevue, Wash., a leader in providing Advanced Placement courses online. Of the 600 students in 28 states who enrolled in at least one of the company's online Advanced Placement courses in the last school year, two-thirds did not complete enough of the course work to take the final exam, Apex officials said.
"This is still pretty new and we are all learning about it," said Sally Narodick, the chief executive of Apex, incorporated two years ago.
Much is riding on whether such efforts succeed. While President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have heralded the educational possibilities of the Web, most of what has been labeled instruction in cyberspace is supplemental at best -- SAT training, college counseling and virtual field trips.
But online Advanced Placement courses represent something else, one of the first real opportunities to marshal technology to plug gaping holes in the core curriculums of financially pressed rural and inner-city high schools that cannot afford luxuries like college-level courses. Apex charges schools $325 to $400 per student. Hiring a teacher could cost more than $50,000 a year.
Apex, one of the few for-profit ventures in the online Advanced Placement business, has raised $40 million from investors, including Warburg Pincus, a Wall Street firm; Vulcan Ventures, a fund led by Paul G. Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, and Edison Schools, the public school management company led by the entrepreneur Christopher C. Whittle.Michigan State University, the University of Nebraska and Johns Hopkins University are also offering college-level courses to high school students online.
All are seeking to close one of the widest gaps between rich and poor schools. First begun as an experiment in the 1950's involving fewer than 2,000 students and a handful of college-level courses, the Advanced Placement program, run by the College Board, now involves more than 700,000 high school students who took 1.1 million final course exams for college credit this spring.
Enrollment in at least one such course is regarded as an unofficial prerequisite for admission to the nation's most selective colleges, and the University of California system gives applicants who take such courses extra credit on their transcripts. Yet only half of the nation's high school students have access to Advanced Placement courses, which are regarded as a perk in districts strapped for cash.
The Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, has proposed that every high school in the country offer at least one Advanced Placement course by 2002, and add at least one new course each year over the next 10 years. The Clinton administration has asked Congress to spend $10 million to help rural and inner-city schools purchase Advanced Placement courses online.
To Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board, such online courses are a weak stand-in for what he says the country needs: 180,000 teachers trained to offer college-level courses to two million more high school students.
But Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of the University of California at Santa Cruz, says such plans are pipe dreams, considering that many of the districts lacking Advanced Placement courses have a severe shortage of teachers in even basic subjects. Often, Mr. Hernandez said, an online course, however flawed, is the only opportunity a student has. This past school year, the University of California College Prep Initiative, conceived by Mr. Hernandez and operated out of the system's Santa Cruz campus, used state grants to pay for 800 California high school students to take Advanced Placement courses online. They included the two at Weaverville.
"Our intent is not to be an alternative to a high quality teacher and classroom," Mr. Hernandez said. "Our intent is to be an alternative to nothing, and that's what they're getting right now."
In Weaverville, a town of 3,370 people, many of them loggers and forest rangers, the experience of the two students who took Apex's online government course underscored the program's promise and its flaws.
For Brian Jones, 19, a senior who wants to be a record producer, and Jeremy Forbes, 18, a classmate who dreams of becoming a cartoonist, taking college-level "U.S. Government and Politics" introduced them to the concepts of pluralism, federalism, liberalism and conservatism. Both said they now looked at presidential politics in a new light.
But each was tripped up by shortcomings that, so far, are embedded in such courses.
In mid-March, in the 7th week of the 15-week course, Mr. Jones was still doing work he should have completed in the second week. He said he was overwhelmed by the idea of writing a two-page essay twice a week and taking an exam every three weeks. And with his professor, Steve Sandweiss, 448 miles away in Tacoma, Wash., where he is a professor at a community college, Mr. Jones dropped out, enrolling instead in his high school's civics course.
"I didn't feel like doing any work," he said. "I'm just not organized a lot of the time."
Mr. Forbes was far more dogged, but he had continual problems signing onto the Apex Web site -- sometimes because of problems on Apex's end, and sometimes because of the limited capacity of the computers in his school. Mr. Forbes finished the course two weeks late, and took the Advanced Placement exam. He will know his grade soon -- but said that for all the disruption he felt well-prepared for the exam.
Apex officials said that they were already working to rectify the problems, smoothing software miscommunication, extending the course calendar by three weeks and providing training for mentor teachers in students' high schools. But Mr. Forbes's guidance counselor, Noreen Bradbury, said that even in their present form, the online courses were a godsend.
Ms. Bradbury said she already had 11 students signed up to take advanced courses next year in history, statistics, psychology, government and economics.
"It opens the world to our kids," she said. "They're not distant and different from everyone else out there. They're as good."

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Begins Upstate Tour in Familiar Spot, Focusing on Economy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: BINGHAMTON, N.Y., July 6

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton returned to an electronics plant today that was the scene of an event during her early days as a prospective Senate candidate last year. She talked today about reviving the economy in upstate New York and chose this spot to begin a five-day tour throughout this region of the state.
As Mrs. Clinton began her upstate campaign swing, her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, was on the final legs of his trip. In a meeting with about 100 workers at a Lockheed Martin electronics plant and in speaking with reporters, she was quick to point out the differences in her campaign tactics from those of Mr. Lazio. 
 "He's got moderate talk on the trail and extreme rhetoric in his mail," Mrs. Clinton said. "I just think it's hard to tell what he means and where he is from day to day. I'm not going to respond to his personal insults. I'm going to run a campaign on issues, not insults."
In particular, Mrs. Clinton reacted to a fund-raising letter sent to voters this week by Mr. Lazio's campaign in which he attacked Mrs. Clinton and President Clinton for having "embarrassed our country and disgraced their powerful posts." Mrs. Clinton, the letter states, "covets power and control and thinks she should be dictating how other people run their lives."
Mr. Lazio has said he had not reviewed the fund-raising letter before it was sent. "It's hard for me to get this straight," Mrs. Clinton said, speaking to reporters. "Last week he was telling New Yorkers that he wasn't responsible for his voting record. And this week he's telling us that he's not responsible for his fund-raising letters. I think he ought to rename his bus. Instead of the Mainstream Express, he ought to call it the Double-Talk Express."
Speaking at a news briefing outside a senior housing apartment building in Syracuse today, Mr. Lazio said he still had not seen the letter and he continued to decline to specify what the president and Mrs. Clinton had done to embarrass the country.
"I think you can make a big distinction between a solicitation letter for funds among your supporters and communicating with commercials," Mr. Lazio said, referring to television ads by Mrs. Clinton's campaign that he has characterized as attack ads.
At the plant, where electronic controls are made, Mrs. Clinton met today with managers, took a tour and experienced simulated flying in a military aircraft. Meeting with employees, she answered questions on topics ranging from transportation in the Southern Tier region of the state to federal spending on research and development.
Mrs. Clinton also attended a cookout with about 1,500 people in Endicott, N.Y., sponsored by the Democratic Party organizations in Broome, Tioga, Tompkins and Cortland Counties. Her trip throughout the region comes a year after she unofficially entered the race for the United States Senate when she visited the farm of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whom she hopes to succeed.
On this trip, however, Mrs. Clinton is a full-fledged candidate and her tour across the state's western half is focused on economic issues. She has produced a pamphlet that is being distributed to voters discussing various ideas, including tax credits for investments in new technology and making high-speed Internet access more widely available.

RUPIAH WEAK AGAINST DOLLAR

BYLINE: By Seth Mydans 

 BODY:
The Indonesian currency, the rupiah, traded against the dollar at its lowest exchange rate in 16 months, and analysts in Indonesia said it was unlikely to rebound soon. The rupiah settled in Jakarta at 9,290 to the dollar and in New York at 9,252.50. Analysts said politics, not the economy, was pushing down the currency, adding that they did not expect a significant upturn in the currency's value until after a session of Parliament next month that is expected to be volatile.

HEADLINE: The Price of Gas, Here and There

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Steep Rise Is Forecast for Winter Heating Bills" (front page, July 5): 
 I get the impression that someone has forgotten to tell America that natural gas and oil are nonrenewable resources. Prices are not only bound to continue to rise; eventually, these resources are going to run out!
Instead of complaining, perhaps Americans could spare a thought for the rest of humanity and for coming generations, including their own children and grandchildren.
Unlike the Apollo astronauts, we have nowhere to get back to. We have to sort the problem out while still on board, changing from a nonsustainable to a sustainable economy and to lifestyles that do not threaten our planet's life-supporting ecosystems.
At the moment things are not looking good. Most people do not even seem to realize that we have a problem, or have deluded themselves by believing that it is being addressed.

HEADLINE: By The Boom That Threatens Chinatown

BYLINE: By John Wang; John Wang is president of the Asian-American Business Development Center in Manhattan.

 BODY:
Boom times are the worst thing ever to have hit New York's Chinatown. Twenty-five years ago, New York needed Chinatown. The city was on the brink of bankruptcy, and many neighborhoods were declining. Chinatown was a rare area of growing prosperity in the tight times, emerging from an area occupying few city blocks to transform a dilapidated Lower East Side into a thriving community.
And now that things are good, New York seems to care little about its old friend, turning its attention instead to Silicon Alley entrepreneurs and Wall Street barons. Chinatown has stagnated in the past several years, hurt by rising rents, aggressive enforcement of old city laws and a digital divide. 
 Chinatown's economy, now as in the past, depends largely on a core of small businesses in mature and declining industries: small-scale manufacturing, much of it in the garment industry; restaurants that specialize in Chinese cuisine; retail and wholesale trade; tourism and gift shops. We in Chinatown need the city's help in both preserving our traditional businesses and generating more modern ones.
The garment industry, which once employed 30,000 people in Chinatown, has been hardest hit. Foreign competition, low-cost production overseas and occasional charges of sweatshop operations have driven manufacturers away from Chinatown: its garment factories have decreased from 500 to less than 300. This decline has had a multiplier effect as lost income in the community has sent sales plunging in other businesses. Now garment factories struggle to pay $10 to $12 a square foot for loft space in Chinatown while dot-com companies, which are edging in from the outside, would gladly pay double or triple that. Some provision should be made to keep at least some buildings operating with affordable rents.
Senator Charles Schumer has appointed a task force of prominent business leaders, known as the Group of 35, to find more commercial space in the city for growing companies. Perhaps a representative of a small business or manufacturing industry should be appointed to this task force, too, to reflect more diverse business needs.
Lower Manhattan's residential boom has also hurt Chinatown. In the 1980's and 1990's, the upscale development that started in SoHo began to to hem Chinatown in, causing economic and cultural clashes. The sidewalk fish and vegetable stalls that most New Yorkers once saw as quaint are viewed by some of our new neighbors as dirty and smelly inconveniences. The wholesale trades of poultry and groceries, with their early morning deliveries and congestion on the sidewalks, are seen as a nuisance.
Appeals have been made to the local community boards to restrict certain business operations. The Police Department and Department of Consumer Affairs have dusted off all the rule books, ticketing sidewalk vendors for all types of violations that had not been enforced in decades and, in some cases, are still not enforced elsewhere. Not long ago, the city unearthed a quarter-century-old Little Italy special zoning district, limiting types of businesses and setting requirements for stores, and attempted to force merchants to comply with its rules and regulations -- in an area where properties have been more than 90 percent Chinese-owned and Chinese-occupied for more than a decade.
Of course, Chinatown's own entrepreneurs must recognize the need to modernize. Within New York's Asian-American community, a yawning digital divide has appeared. National studies show that Asian-Americans as a group have the highest computer ownership and Internet connection rates for any ethnic group in the United States, but a recent survey by the Asian American Business Development Center found a different picture in Chinatown. Although 85 percent of the small businesses that responded use computers, most of those are outdated and cannot be connected to the Internet. Most Chinatown entrepreneurs don't yet fully appreciate the need to develop educational and economic resources to turn around declining businesses.
What's most important for the preservation of Chinatown, however, is a recognition by the city itself that this neighborhood is an endangered asset. The City Planning Commission should study how best to preserve Chinatown, whose special character has always been a point of municipal pride. Our city's leaders should recognize, too, that by helping to sustain New York in difficult years, Chinatown helped lay the foundation for today's boom.

HEADLINE: Earmarked for Colombian Rebels, a Region Asks to Be Left Alone

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: YONDO, Colombia

 BODY:
For years, the people of this thriving little oil town on the bank of the Magdalena River complained that the authorities back in Bogota never paid them any attention. But now that they and their neighbors have suddenly become pivotal to a government plan to open peace talks with second-largest guerrilla group here, they want only to be left alone.
When President Andres Pastrana announced the plan in April, it seemed a simple matter. To lure the Marxist rebels of the Army of National Liberation, or E.L.N., into negotiations, Yondo and two other municipalities north of here were to be turned into a "zone of encounter" under guerrilla control, with all army and police units withdrawn. 
 There has never been a shortage of armed groups roaming this area. So the government apparently thought that an end of hostilities would be welcome. Left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and the military have all sought to control this resource rich and strategic region, the Middle Magdalena. And all have left casualties in their wakes.
What the authorities in Bogota did not expect, though, was the popular resistance that has emerged. Soon after the announcement, thousands of protesters blocked the Pan American Highway, cutting off most commerce between central and northern Colombia.
"If they really want to talk peace, all they need to negotiate is a table and chairs," said Leonel Uribe Hernandez, a municipal official here and a leader of the protest. "They don't need all this territory. If the E.L.N. leaders are worried about their safety, let them talk overseas, in Venezuela or Spain or Germany. But we don't want to be a part of this."
After several weeks, Mr. Pastrana relented and agreed to a "dialogue" with residents. As part of a recent accord, the government has agreed to delay formally establishing the zone until undertaking "popular consultations," a phrase that the government seems to interpret as town meetings and workshops, but that residents take to mean a plebiscite.
"This is a democracy, so let the people vote on this and let their will be respected," Councilman Nixon Arrieta said. "If they say yes, then fine. But I don't think that is likely to happen, because we have nothing to gain from this and everything to lose."
The territory that the government has agreed to hand over is roughly the size of Delaware, or barely one-tenth the size of a separate demilitarized zone granted to the largest guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. But the strategic importance of this area is much greater because it sits astride the country's main waterway and is within striking distance of a railway line and the Pan American Highway.
"I don't know what the president was thinking," a teacher here said. "The E.L.N. has a long history of blowing up oil pipelines, power stations and transmission lines. And he wants to put them right across the river from the biggest oil refinery in the country," which processes the bulk of Colombia's gasoline and is in Barrancabermeja.
Like the more sparsely populated FARC zone to the south, which is larger than Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island combined, this is cattle country and abounds in fertile pastures. But cows and water buffaloes have to graze alongside oil wells that produce millions of dollars a year in royalties.
Farther north, the mountains of the Serrania de San Lucas have large deposits of gold, emeralds, nickel and mercury. The gold mines have been shut for years because of the violence but could easily reopen after the fighting stops and soon thereafter begin filling the coffers of the E.L.N., which has met with military reverses in recent months.
The biggest and fastest-growing source of wealth in the area, however, is farming coca. The E.L.N. controlled drug trafficking here until 18 months ago, when it was violently supplanted by paramilitaries of the United Peasant Self-Defense force. And the E.L.N. would clearly like to regain the dominance and the revenues that it once enjoyed.
"This is anything but a fight over ideology," said Mayor Danuil Mecera of San Pablo, a town an hour's boat ride north of here that is in the E.L.N. zone. "This is a struggle for economic control and power, pure and simple, between two illegal armed groups that only want to strengthen their position at the expense of the other."
As government negotiations with protesters drag on, disgruntled E.L.N. forces are staying out of the towns and holing up in their mountain stronghold north of here. In a recent television interview, the senior commander, Nicolas Rodriguez Bautista, acknowledged that "there is much fear" of a peace zone but attributed that to "the pressure of paramilitary groups."
Residents and local officials say their real concern is that violence may increase after the zone has been set up, because the accord between the government and the rebels excludes paramilitary forces. With the army and the police withdrawn, the critics said, residents would be even more likely to be caught in cross-fire between the rebels and adamant paramilitary units.
"This territory is ours," said the local paramilitary leader, who is known as Comandante Julian. The fundamental problem, he added, is that "there are three states here, that of the guerrillas, the real one of the government and that of the self-defense forces."
Nevertheless, he added, "We will respect what the population decides, and if they accept a zone, we will withdraw our troops."
Hoping to win over the residents, the national government arranged for local officials to visit the FARC zone and talk with their counterparts and other residents there. But that effort backfired when the officials returned home with tales of extortion of businesses, summary executions, forced recruitment of teenagers and other guerrilla abuses.
"We can see for ourselves what happened down there, and we've been contacted by people down there who tell us that we should fight by all means to prevent what happened to them from happening to us," a pharmacist in San Pablo said. "The FARC zone has become an independent country, and we don't want that happening here."

RUSSIA: NO TO SECRET POLICE MONUMENT
In a sign of the waning influence of Communists and their allies, the lower house of Parliament voted down a measure calling for the restoration of a monument to the father of the Soviet secret police. A similar bill passed in 1998, but was ignored by Moscow city authorities. The new bill called for the restoration of a Stalin-era bronze statue of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the ruthless Cheka secret police, which evolved into the N.K.V.D. and K.G.B. security forces, responsible for the death of millions. The statue, above, was torn down by jubilant crowds in 1991. (Reuters) 

GERMANY: GAY UNIONS BILL
The government presented Parliament with a bill to permit "gay weddings" in which same-sex partners could officially register their relationship and gain the same tax and inheritance rights as married couples. It could also give foreigners in homosexual relationships with Germans a right to German residency. The bill now goes to a parliamentary committee. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
GERMANY: ACQUITTALS IN BORDER SHOOTINGS
Three former members of East Germany's Politburo were acquitted on manslaughter charges related to the killings of people trying to defect across the Berlin Wall. The court said it had not been proved that Siegfried Lorenz and Herbert Haber, both 69, and Hans-Joachim Bohme, 70, could have stopped the killings. Prosecutors said they would appeal.

BRAZIL: ANTI-VIOLENCE DEMONSTRATIONS
Several million people in cities across the country marched in the largest citizen protest against violence in this nation of 175 million, wearing white and organizing silent vigils in an effort to pressure the government to take a tougher stance against both criminal gangs and police brutality. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
COLOMBIA: AID DECISION POSTPONED
The European Union has delayed action on a Colombian request for economic and social assistance to supplement the $1.3 billion in largely military aid that the United States will supply as part of an effort to curb drug trafficking and finance a peace deal with leftist guerrillas. At a donors' meeting in Madrid, the United Nations said it would supply $130 million and lending agencies agreed to kick in $300 million, but the European group postponed a decision until September. Larry Rohter (NYT)
 
CANADA: ABORTION PILL TESTS
Canada's first clinical trials of RU-486, the French abortion pill, have started in four cities: Vancouver, Toronto, Quebec City and Sherbrooke, Quebec. Dr. Ellen Wiebe, the Vancouver doctor who is directing the study, won a $35,000 government grant to study the pill's health effects on 1,000 women. She hopes the trial will pave the way for government approval for the drug. James Brooke (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
JAPAN: CLAMPDOWN ON MARINES
United States Marines in Okinawa will not be allowed to drink alcohol during the Group of 8 economic meeting this month. The alcohol ban was ordered after the arrest on Monday of a drunken Marine who the police said entered a private home and molested a 14-year-old girl who was sleeping there. The Marines will also be required to be in uniform at all times during the July 20-24 meeting, which President Clinton is to attend. Calvin Sims (NYT)
 
PAKISTAN: OUSTED LEADER'S ALLIES HELD
The police arrested dozens of supporters of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Punjab province in an effort to prevent his wife, Kulsoom Nawaz, from leading a procession from Lahore to Peshawar. Punjab officials said that large political rallies are outlawed, but Ms. Nawaz insisted that her march was to support victims of drought. Mr. Sharif was overthrown in an October coup and is serving a life prison sentence. P. J. Anthony (NYT)
 
SOUTH KOREA: MISSILE PROGRAM ON AGENDA
The assistant secretary of state for nonproliferation, Robert Einhorn, will visit South Korea next week to discuss Seoul's attempt to build longer-range missiles, officials said. The United States and South Korea have held a series of talks over the last two years about Seoul's wish to increase the range of its missiles, now set at 112 miles under a 1979 agreement.

IRAN: STUDENT MEMORIAL
Students said they would hand out flowers in Tehran's streets and light candles today to commemorate a raid on a Tehran University dormitory a year ago in which one student was killed and scores were injured. The pre-dawn raid by hard-line security forces and vigilantes, which came hours after students rallied against the banning of a liberal newspaper, set off six days of nationwide protests by tens of thousands of students -- the worst unrest in Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE PARTY POLICY;
Draft of Democratic Platform Is Echo of Gore's Campaign

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, July 7

 BODY:
The Democrats released a draft of their party platform today that strongly articulates the centrist "new Democratic" views of Vice President Al Gore, but also offers concessions to liberals on several major issues, including trade, the death penalty and gay rights.
In many ways, the 41-page document tries to straddle the same ideological divide that faces Mr. Gore in his quest for the presidency. Even as he tries to reach out to moderate and independent voters this fall, Mr. Gore will need to energize core Democratic voters, who tend to be more liberal. 
 On many major issues, the platform stakes out the centrist views first championed by President Clinton in 1992. It calls for fiscal discipline and paying off the national debt by 2012. It proposes modest tax cuts. It advocates more accountability for schools and teachers. It views global trade as crucial to economic prosperity. It endorses tougher penalties, including the death penalty, for violent criminals.
But on many of those issues, the draft platform -- which will be completed at a meeting in Cleveland later this month -- also includes provisions intended to mitigate the concerns of liberals.
For example, on trade, potentially the most divisive issue for the party, the 2000 platform includes significantly stronger language than the 1996 platform about protecting workers and the environment against the potential downsides of globalization.
"Al Gore will insist on and use the authority to enforce worker rights, human rights and environmental protections" in trade accords, it says. "We should use trade to lift up standards around the world, not drag down standards here at home."
In another tradeoff with labor, the document supports giving the president broad powers to negotiate trade agreements, a policy known as fast track that is strongly opposed by unions. But it also endorses legislation prohibiting the permanent replacement of workers on strike.
In another section, the platform asserts that more police officers and tougher penalties, including capital punishment, have helped reduce crime. But it will also include language advocating that people facing the death sentence have access to DNA testing and adequate counsel.
The crime-fighting section includes another plank sought by minorities: the condemnation of racial profiling by police officers.
In a section with the centrist-sounding title "Valuing our families," the platform will say that the party "supports the full inclusion of gay and lesbian families in the life of a nation." The provision is intended to suggest that the party supports civil unions for gay couples, though perhaps not religious ones.
Where the platform adopts Republican-sounding ideas, it usually criticizes the Republican version of those ideas. On tax cuts, for instance, the platform advocates reductions for "working parents." But it harshly attacks Gov. George W. Bush's proposed across-the-board tax cut with populist language.
"It would let the richest 1 percent of Americans afford a new sports car and middle class Americans afford a warm soda," the platform says.
The draft also echoes Mr. Gore's attacks on Mr. Bush's proposal to let taxpayers invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market.
"Taken together, George W. Bush's $2 trillion tax cut, his campaign-season spending proposals, his support for privatizing Social Security add up to an assault on the surplus, causing Americans to have to choose between drastic cuts in education and health care or a return to the days of deficit spending," the draft reads.
Not surprisingly, the platform highlights Mr. Gore's core campaign proposals to preserve Social Security, expand health care, help the elderly buy prescription drugs, overhaul the campaign finance system and strengthen gun regulations.
And it devotes it largest section to Mr. Gore's education proposals.
On foreign policy, the platform calls for increasing military pay, enacting the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and creating a limited national missile defense system capable of defending against attacks from North Korea or the Middle East.
In its language as well as its policies, the document echoes Mr. Gore's stump speeches. It is divided into three major sections -- prosperity, progress and peace -- which were the themes of a recent campaign swing by the vice president. It paraphrases the title of Mr. Gore's book on the environment, saying, "The Earth truly is in the balance."
And it closes with a pet Gore slogan: "Now, we say to America, 'You ain't seen nothing yet.' "

HEADLINE: World Bank Rejects China's Proposal to Resettle Farmers

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 6

 BODY:
Under heavy pressure from the United States, the World Bank's board overruled the bank leadership today and denied financing for a sensitive Chinese antipoverty proposal that set off a North-South struggle over aid.
The $160 million plan, part of which would have resettled 58,000 mostly ethnic Chinese farmers in an area that nomadic Tibetan herdsman once dominated, divided leading borrowers from rich nations, including the United States. Rarely has any World Bank project aroused as much internal dissent and outside protest. 
 China withdrew the project from consideration this morning, when the board made it clear that it would not agree to finance the project and would reconsider the plan only after a lengthy and potentially intrusive study on its environmental and social effects.
The Chinese delegate to the bank, Zhu Xian, attributed the defeat to "enormous political pressures" brought to bear by wealthy nations and pledged that China would use its own money to finance the proposal.
Numerous outside groups campaigned to stop support for the project. Demonstrators gathered outside the bank headquarters here and cheered the decision.
Advocates for Tibet and human rights groups have argued that resettling the farmers in Qinghai Province would reinforce Chinese claims to historically Tibetan lands.
For the 181 member nations of the bank, the struggle was over controlling the tens of billions of dollars that the bank lends to developing nations each year. Led by China, the bank's No. 1 borrower and a nation that has often successfully defended its interests in international organizations like the United Nations, developing nations pushed the board to finance the project and leave its execution in the hands of bank managers, people involved in the debate said.
But the United States and leading industrial nations argued that the bank management had ignored its internal procedures when approving the project. The United States signaled that it believed that the board had to take a more active role in reviewing lending programs.
"We and numerous other shareholders were not prepared to support this project, because we did not believe that it was in compliance with the bank's own policies," a senior Treasury Department official said. "The bank needs to prepare specific proposals to give the shareholders a greater sense of confidence that management has the internal capacity to apply its established internal policies."
An inspection panel commissioned by the board of the bank reported last month that the bank had violated its guidelines when it approved the proposal. Bank officials acknowledged errors, but dismissed the report as an attempt by some board members to exert more control over day-to-day affairs.
People involved in the discussion said that the United States and Japan wanted to kill the project outright and that Britain, Germany and other European nations were prepared to consider the case again after the bank had studied its effects more thoroughly.
But China objected strenuously to to a fresh review. Mr. Zhu said some nations were using the cover of internal guidelines as a way to inject political control over lending. "Compliance policies have been interpreted by some to an extreme and used for political purposes," Mr. Zhu said.
China's decision to withdraw the project is a setback for the bank president, James D. Wolfensohn. He had urged the board to approve the proposal. Mr. Wolfensohn, recently reappointed with President Clinton's support, favored the plan despite United States opposition.
The bank thinks of China as one of its most successful customers. It has loaned China $4 billion for 31 antipoverty projects and helped 200 million Chinese climb out of poverty in the last 20 years, bank officials say.
But the Qinghai project, which is most likely to be the last one eligible for the bank's most-subsidized loan program because average per capita income in China has risen so high, became the most sensitive.
Supporters of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet who was born in eastern Qinghai, have argued that the bank would have contributed to increasing Chinese domination in the Tibetan region by helping to move mostly Han Chinese and some Hui Muslim farmers into a largely unsettled area of Qinghai. Some Tibetans claim that area as part of their homeland.
The resettlement part of the project had been scheduled to cost $40 million.
"It's like moving people from Denver to a native American reservation in Colorado," said John Ackerly, president of the International Campaign for Tibet, which has fought the project. "This is an area where Tibetans have lived for generations."
The bank said those arguments were unjustified. The project would have paid to move farmers who live in arid eastern Qinghai to irrigated lands farther west in the same province. The bank also said Qinghai, part of China before Beijing invaded Tibet in 1951, was already predominantly Han, the dominant Chinese ethnic group.
Nations that opposed the proposal said they did so more because of how the bank had handled it rather than the project itself. Though the board gave initial approval to the plan last year, it ordered an inspection panel to address concerns that the bank had not sufficiently explored all aspects.
The panel's report said the bank had originally classified the project as needing a relatively low level of review when it should have required the highest level. The report added that the bank had failed to explore alternatives and it strongly implied that China had intimidated bank managers to expedite the approval.
The United States and Japan argued that the panel's conclusion should be enough to end discussion of the plan. But several other wealthy nations thought that it still made sense for the bank to be involved, especially because China intended to pursue the project on its own.
Britain issued a statement today calling the outcome a Pyrrhic victory for opponents. "World Bank involvement," the statement said, "would have ensured that high social and environmental standards were adhered to."

HEADLINE: Sister Cities of the World Find a Common Cause;
Duluth Finds a Key To the Global Economy And Cultural Ties, Too

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

DATELINE: DULUTH, Minn.

 BODY:
On the street here these days you hear French, Swedish, Russian, Japanese and at least half a dozen other foreign tongues. It is not tourists who give the city this cosmopolitan air, but business executives slinging around expressions like informationsteknologi (Swedish for information technology) and keizai kaihatsu (Japanese for economic development).
Not too bad for a city that 80 years ago, under the alias Zenith, was branded as hopelessly small-minded and provincial by Sinclair Lewis in his novel "Babbitt." 
 Duluth is still no New York or Los Angeles, of course. Or even a place like Rochester, Minn., home of the Mayo Clinic. But it has focused more on the wider world not just because of its shipping trade through the Great Lakes but also because of its sister-city program -- the nonprofit city-to-city network inspired by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's suggestion in 1956 that citizen diplomacy might reduce the chance of future world conflict.
The program, which really took off around the country in the 1970's and 80's, began largely with international cultural exchanges, and support for health and education. Now, the emphasis is changing to a more bottom-line approach.
"There is a new interest in business and economic development," said Lewis F. Harwood, a spokesman for Sister Cities International, the United States service association based in Washington that administers the program.
"You could see it last April at an international conference in Merida, Mexico, where representatives from about 20 American cities came looking for international business links and trade opportunities with other municipalities throughout the Americas," Mr. Harwood said. "We think they were quite successful at making these connections."
Economic development has long been pursued at the national level by the Commerce Department, Mr. Harwood acknowledged. And states and large municipalities, which can afford offices of economic development and send trade missions around the world, have long been doing business internationally. Now, however, more and more cities are reaching out internationally through city-to-city relationships. "It's definitely a trend," Mr. Harwood said.
To be sure, some people think the program is a waste of time and money. In the early 1990's, for example, an editorial writer in Duluth wondered aloud what the city's mayor was doing in Japan on what he called a sister city "junket" when he ought to be at home in Minnesota minding the store. But despite such sniping, this city and many others are hoping to use the program more actively to pursue development projects in a globalizing economy.
And in the case of Duluth that switch in emphasis to international business seems to have been, at least in part, a recognition of problems in the local economy. Between 1980 and 1990, for example, the Duluth-Superior, Wis., region lost more than 26,000 people, adding to the incentive of local officials to take advantage of every program they could.
By the end of 1999, about 1,280 American cities were engaged in the sister city program, some more widely than others. Seattle, for example, has 20 sister cities around the world, from Christchurch, New Zealand, to Haiphong, Vietnam. New York City has six, including Madrid and Cairo.
Duluth now has four: Thunder Bay, Ontario; Ohara, Japan; Petrozavodsk, Russia; and Vaxjo, Sweden. These partnerships have generated more than $10 million in direct revenue for the city over the last few years, according to Duluth's mayor, Gary L. Doty.
More important, programs that started out as cultural ties have become in many cases profit-centered enterprises. The Duluth-Vaxjo link, for example, resulted in an ambitious project that its investors, who anted up $24 million, hope will make Duluth a major port city for information technology as it has long been for timber, grain and iron ore.
In 1995, Mayor Doty led a delegation to Vaxjo seeking to expand cultural exchanges based on the Swedish heritage of a large segment of the city's population. But it was something they stumbled on in the nearby town of Ronneby that provided the big inspiration. For a decade, the city of Ronneby had been host to a technology campus that brought together under one roof about 100 high-technology businesses, branches of academic institutions, professors working as research and development consultants, and students taking classes and serving internships. Such interactions at the campus, Soft Center Ronneby, provide, among other things, a sorely needed supply of well-trained information-technology workers.
"This is what we should be doing," Mayor Doty exclaimed.
Michael J. McNamara, who had joined the delegation as a representative of the Duluth Chamber of Commerce, got the message, too. "It's a school-to-work model for the information-technology industry," he said.
In short order, a four-story technology campus rose in downtown Duluth, financed by city, state and private money. It is one of a growing number of such centers throughout the world based on the Ronneby model.
Christened Soft Center Duluth, the enterprise held an open house for prospective tenants last month. Visitors came from England, Scotland, France, Norway, West Africa, South Africa, Canada and many parts of the United States. The building is now 30 percent occupied, by tenants including academic institutions, high-technology concerns and a big-name investment bank.
"The center is attracting the kind of tenants they want at a somewhat slower rate than anticipated," said Kjell Knudsen, dean of the School of Business and Economics at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, who once served as an unpaid board member of the Soft Center. "But the prospect is that it will succeed."
Among those working at the video terminals in the new building recently was Joe Allert, 19, a sophomore majoring in business at the Soft Center branch of the University of Minnesota-Duluth.
"I came here because I like the idea of having educational institutions in the same building as employers and even Salomon Smith Barney and other business," he said.
Not all of Duluth's sister-city partnerships are focused on hard-headed business projects. The relationship with Petrozavodsk is, thus far, purely philanthropic, recently involving an effort to raise funds for clothing and supplies for children in orphanages. And the link with Thunder Bay, only a few hours away by car, is largely cultural. But another tie that may result in a business deal is Duluth's relationship with Ohara, which set the stage for all four of Duluth's sister-city partnerships. This tie began during the United States occupation of Japan.
One night, a gang of sailors from the heavy cruiser Duluth returned from shore leave with a 750-pound, medieval temple gong in tow. The bronze gong, covered with ancient inscriptions and fanciful dragons, is recognized in Japan as a national treasure.
The captain considered the gong a legitimate war trophy and arranged to have it delivered to the ship's namesake: the city of Duluth. For the next decade, the gong was on display first in City Hall and then in Duluth's Enger Park.
In 1951, a visiting Japanese college professor happened to see the gong. He explained to Duluth's mayor how important it was to Japan, and asked to have it returned.
A lengthy correspondence followed, and eventually the gong was sent back to Ohara -- a fishing village 90 miles southeast of Tokyo from which it had been taken. In gratitude, the Japanese delivered a full-scale replica of the gong for display in Enger Park.
In 1990, Duluth and Ohara became sister cities. And last month, a group of 15 visiting Japanese dignitaries and several dozen Duluthians held a ceremony in Enger Park to rededicate the replica as a symbol of peace and mutual understanding.
A soprano sang the Japanese national anthem and then the American. Next, Mayor Doty and Soichiro Oya, a petroleum entrepreneur who led the Japanese sister-city delegation, jointly clanged the gong with a huge striker in the name of everlasting peace.
After the ceremony, the conversation turned to golf.
While golf is an expensive sport in Japan, where the links are crowded and reservations hard to come by, Duluth, by contrast, is a golfer's paradise, ranked by Golf Digest as the best of America's 309 small cities for access to good, affordable links.
So why not market golfing vacations in Duluth for Japanese tourists? Carl Seehus, Duluth's director of parks and recreation and a former director of the city's sister-city program, was talking up the idea. And Mr. Oya, an avid golfer, agreed.
"The last decade was for cultural exchanges," Mr. Oya added. "The next decade will be for business."

Dear Ralph:

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
Nader for president! You say you are serious this time, running as the candidate of the Green Party, and you deride those who say you should get out of Al Gore's way. Fair enough. Third parties are an honorable, if frustrating, American tradition.
What is puzzling to some of your old admirers is what you stand for. You say the two major parties are practically Tweedledum and Tweedledee -- there are "few major differences" between them. Sure, they are both awash in campaign money that keeps them close to business. But no major differences? Are you serious? 
 Take one of your concerns, the environment. When Newt Gingrich & Co. took control of the House, Republicans tried to gut the country's environmental protection laws. They were stopped by President Clinton's skillful use of the veto and veto threats. A Republican from Texas, where environmental regulation is in the hands of the polluters, is not likely to be that kind of president.
Or take law. You and I first met in law school. You have used the legal process well, and I believe you must still have a deep concern for law and the courts.
The prospective Republican candidate has spoken admiringly of the judicial record of Justice Clarence Thomas. The Democrat would almost certainly make appointments to the Supreme Court on the model of President Clinton's moderate-liberal choices, Justices Ruth Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. No major difference?
It is surprising that you pay little or no attention to one area where there is in fact little difference between President Clinton and the Republican Congress -- and the records of both are abysmal. That is civil liberties.
Federal habeas corpus, a fundamental safeguard of freedom, was ravaged by legislation signed without objection by President Clinton. The Republican Congress cut off funds for a handful of resource centers that provided lawyers for prisoners on death row, many of whom had been represented by incompetent counsel.
The Counter-Terrorism Act, drafted by the Clinton administration, imported into our law the loathsome practice of trials on secret evidence. The Immigration Act of 1996 compelled the deportation of people who had committed trivial crimes years before the act was passed.
By attacking those affronts to due process and American decency, a third-party candidate could have a real impact. He could shake the major parties' indifference and touch the country's conscience. Don't you care?
What you mainly seem to care about these days is free trade. You are against it -- or say you want it with so many ifs and buts that it amounts to the same thing. You and your organization, Public Citizen, led the way to the Seattle protests against the World Trade Organization.
You talk about the importance of seeing that other countries have laws like ours to protect fair labor standards, the consumer, pure food and the environment. Those are fine ideals. But the effect of insisting that other countries meet our standards before we trade with them would be, as you must know, devastating.
What South Africans need is jobs; about a third of them are unemployed. The same is true in most of the developing world. Yes, we should worry about underpaid child workers in Asia producing goods for the American market. But efforts that focus attention on such cruelties have been quite effective. To use, instead, the blunderbuss of stopping or handicapping trade would make life harsher for all.
Free trade benefits Americans enormously, too. Your great early achievement was to bring General Motors to heel. But what really forced reform on G.M., and gave us all better cars, was competition from Japanese and other imports.
Your protectionist stance has put you in bed with some of the most reactionary forces in this country. You are a twin of Pat Buchanan on the issue. The New Republic reported that Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch got money from Roger Milliken, the far-right South Carolina textile magnate who has bankrolled the conservative cause from Barry Goldwater on.
Protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the world's poor even more miserable. It is a strange platform for the Ralph Nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Interview With Bushes

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., July 7

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview today with former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, about the presidential campaign of their son Gov. George W. Bush of Texas:
 
 Q. Are you confident your son will win?
 
 GEORGE BUSH. I think he'll win. Again, it's mind-boggling for me, a former president, to think our son will be president. I think a lot of it is that after this primary, where he took such a huge pounding, the press had a massive love affair with John McCain -- nobody can question that, that's just objective, even from a nonobjective guy -- but after that, there was a distorted view of George, I think, and now . . . people are beginning to see what his heartbeat is, what he's really like, that he's a decent person, that he likes people, has done a good job in his state. I don't think in the fall that the press is going to have the same love affair with Gore that they had with John McCain. 

 Q. Why?
 
 MR. BUSH. Well, I think they don't like him so much.
 
 Q. For a good reason?
 
 MR. BUSH. Oh, I don't know about that. I'm going to leave it to George's campaign to define Al Gore. He can identify with people, and I think that's coming through. And also, they're going to want change. And I believe there is a Clinton fatigue. And all of these things will inure to George's benefit just as Gore will be trying to have this good economy inure to his . . .
 
 Q. Why do you think there's Clinton fatigue?
 
 BARBARA BUSH. We took a vow. Can't break it. Never to speak badly about your, your ----
 
 MR. BUSH. We don't get into that because he beat me and then it looks like a poor sport, but I did speak out once in the depths of the Monica Lewinsky thing and said this is disgraceful. But I think it's more than that very unhappy time period of impeachment. I think it's change. I think I was the victim of people wanting change: "Eight years of Reagan, four years of Bush, we want a change." And all the things that I felt strongly about never materialized as issues. And I think the same thing is true now. I think people kind of like change, like the idea of change from time to time. I think that works for George's benefit. I don't think Gore can present himself as a candidate of change. . . .

 Q. Does your son know as much about foreign affairs as you did when you were elected?
 
 MR. BUSH. No. But he knows every bit as much about it as Bill Clinton did.
 
 Q. As much as Gore?
 
 MR. BUSH. Gore's had eight years of experience there. But the way I should be judged . . . is by the kind of people I had around me. Because I didn't know all this stuff. You know, how much reduction you can do on atomic weapons. But Brent Snowcroft did. I didn't know how Gorbachev was going to react when the Iraqis invaded Kuwait, but Jimmy Baker was over there the next day, with Shevardnadze and Gorbachev, and figured it out. I didn't know how the military would work, but we had Colin Powell and Norm Schwarzkopf. We had confidence in generals and officers who were right when all the critics were wrong. So how do you know? You get good people. George knows enough to do that . . .
 
 Q. If you were campaigning against your son, wouldn't you be calling his tax cut too large?
 
 MR. BUSH. You won't believe this. I literally don't go into the analysis of these issues. If you asked me, life or death, "You've got to tell me how big the tax cut is that George is proposing," I couldn't tell you. I don't give a damn. Because I'm out of it. I'm out of it. And I don't do television and I don't do interviews because the minute I said I would differ with Jeb or with George, you would have an obligation to rush down there and say, "Your nutty father doesn't agree with you, what do you think?"

HEADLINE: Payrolls Grew Modestly as Jobless Rate Slipped to 4%

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
After a disastrous drop in jobs in May, American companies added modestly to their payrolls in June, creating 206,000 new jobs, the Labor Department reported yesterday, reinforcing the impression that the economy is slowing.
Job creation in the private sector has now fallen from an average of 244,000 a month in the first quarter to only 110,000 a month from April through June. But if companies are reluctant to hire, they are still hiring in sufficient numbers to keep the unemployment rate at only 4 percent last month, down from 4.1 percent in May -- the lowest levels since the late 1960's. 
 "Economic growth is slowing, but gently, so far," said James Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
The coming and going of thousands of census takers skewed the overall job numbers in both May and June. The total number of jobs created in June -- covering government employees as well as the private sector -- was only 11,000. That was mainly because 190,000 census takers, having finished their work, left the Census Bureau's payroll.
In May, the hiring of 356,000 census takers swelled the total job count to 171,000. Without them, private-sector employment fell by 165,000, the largest drop in eight years and the first of any size since the economy began to soar in the mid-1990's. The May loss had been estimated as 116,000 but was revised yesterday to 165,000.
"You still have about 428,000 temporary census takers out there, and they will come off the payroll, probably in July and August," said Thomas Nardone, chief of the division that prepares the employment data at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The Clinton administration acknowledged that the new job report added to the evidence that the economy is slowing. "We do see signs of moderation," Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said, "but the economy is still steady and stable and strong."
Stock prices soared yesterday in response to the new evidence of slowing, the expectation being that the Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting, on Aug. 22. Rising rates encourage investors to switch their money out of stocks and into interest-bearing investments.
"Another weak month would kill an August rate hike," Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics, advised his clients yesterday, referring to the June job report.
But some Wall Street economists argue that although job creation may be slowing, inflation remains an issue, even in a weakening economy, and the Fed will have to deal with it. Labor shortages and competition for workers, this argument goes, must eventually force up wages and then prices, although that has not happened yet to a significant degree.
"The market is discounting any further Fed rate increases, which I think is a mistake," said Peter Hooper, chief domestic economist of Deutsche Bank North America. Mortgage rates and other consumer rates, he argued, are not yet high enough to dampen demand sufficiently to discourage price increases.
Others pointed to wages. Average hourly earnings for production workers, representing about 75 percent of the 131.6 million people in the work force, rose by 5 cents in June, to $13.71, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. The increase in May was only 2 cents.
When viewed over 12 months, the rate of increase is a mild 3.6 percent. But since January the average hourly pay for production workers turns out to have risen at an accelerated 4 percent annual rate.
"The hourly wage increase was not comforting at all," said Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. But the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, saw the glass as half full. It noted that recent improvements in productivity had more than paid for the hourly wage increase. The productivity growth rate measures an average worker's output during each hour on the job. The higher the output, the more revenue the worker brings in for his employer to pay for wage increases without raising prices.
"The wage path implies an underlying rate of inflation of only about 1 percent a year," Jerry Jasinowski, president of the manufacturers' group, said in a statement. The manufacturers have been arguing against any further rate increases by the Fed, insisting that more will slow the economy too much.
The Fed has raised rates six times since June 1999, for a total of 1.75 percentage points, and the effect on demand helps to explain why the economy has begun to slow down, economists say. Another reason cited is gasoline price increases, which divert family income from other spending. Still another is heavy buying of homes, cars, appliances, furniture -- to the point that demand is sated.
The stock market wealth effect no longer has its old kick, others argue. With stock prices going sideways in recent months, or falling in the high-technology sector, consumers no longer feel as confident about their wealth and limit their spending. And a strong dollar is restricting exports, particularly manufactured exports.
Most job growth in June was in the service sector, particularly business services, which added 54,000 jobs, and in retailing, which added 49,000 jobs, mostly at restaurants. Consultants led the growth in business services, with healthy increases also in temporary help, health services, engineering and hotels.
Employment in the financial sector seemed to show the effects of the slowing economy and higher rates. Jobs in this sector fell by 6,000 last month and 20,000 so far this year, with cutbacks in commercial and mortgage banking, insurance and real estate.
Construction employment, which has fluctuated sharply with the weather, grew by 3,000 jobs in June, raising the average monthly gain to 20,000 this year, down from 25,000 a month for 1999.
Still, the June figures gave evidence of the tight labor market. The unemployment rate for women who support families fell in June, as it did for teenagers and people with a high school education or less. The number of people holding part-time jobs because they could not get full-time work also fell.
Among blacks and Hispanic people, however, the unemployment rate, which jumped in May, did not fall back in June. And the percentage of people who quit a job confident that they can get another in a strong economy fell by 1.1 points in June, to 12.1 percent, its lowest level in months.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE CANDIDATES;
Forget Third Party, These Presidential Hopefuls Offer Array of Choices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

 BODY:
If only she had more money, Paula Bennett said, she could get her message out. For now, she talks to relatives, civic groups and social service workers. "I've only raised a few hundred dollars," she said.
Ms. Bennett, a political independent from Lincoln, Neb., is running for president this year in a field that is far more crowded than one might think. As of last month, 226 people had filed papers with the Federal Election Commission indicating their intention of seeking the White House. The list includes major party candidates like Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas but also candidates so far on the political fringe -- in some cases, even beyond -- that they make people like Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party seem like mainstream contenders. 
 Take Martin J. McNally, for example. His filing says he represents the National Christian Party, but it is unlikely anyone might find him on the campaign trail. He is serving a life sentence for aircraft piracy at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind.
Nor is Julian Starr of Huntington, N.Y., likely to upset any favorites. He is only 18 years old, a high school graduate headed for the State University of New York at Stony Brook this fall. He said he filed this year in anticipation of running for president in 2016, when he will turn 35, the youngest age a president can be. "This should be a very good learning experience," he said.
Presidential elections historically attract a wide variety of contenders. Over the years, voters have cast ballots for Free Soilers, Know Nothings, Prohibitionists, Greenbacks, Bull Moose Progressives and States Righters as well as for members of mainstream parties, like Republicans, Democrats, Federalists and Whigs. In 1996, besides casting ballots for the Republican, Democratic and Reform tickets, voters also supported at least eight other parties. This year, the party choices include Socialist, Corrective Action, Progressive, Common Sense, Fly Birds, Veterans Industrial, Populist-Democratic Viking, Priorities, Light, Anti-Hypocrisy, Freedom, Church and Family Values.
And it has been a slow year, perhaps reflecting a nation enjoying peace and economic stability. The number who have filed the single form required by the election commission is the fewest since the commission was formed in 1974, and a sizable drop from the record year of 1988, when 330 people filed. Candidates who expect to raise at least $5,000 must file; all others file voluntarily.
In either case, most of those running this year will slip through the campaign without so much as a nod of acknowledgment. Not only do they lack the money and staff to compete, they take no steps to comply with state regulations to get onto the ballot, leaving them to gain votes only as a write-in. It is the rare member of the fringe who has the resources to finance a campaign, although it happens. Heather Harder, a Democrat from Crown Point, Ind., said she has addressed groups in 42 states, talking about her pet issue, structural change in government to bring it closer to average citizens.
In that regard, Ms. Harder is typical of the outsiders who filed papers. At best, many say, they hope to influence Mr. Gore or Mr. Bush on an issue or two. But even better-known alternative candidates, like Ralph Nader of the Greens, Harry Browne of the Libertarians or Ross Perot, who represented the Reform Party in 1992 and 1996, do little more than draw new focus to old issues.
"Some of the fringe parties take up a cause they feel is important and not being addressed," said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University.
But as Alan Brinkley, a history professor at Columbia University, noted: "It's very hard for a third-party candidate to do more than influence the behavior of the Republicans or Democrats. It's slightly unusual to have two, perhaps three, alternatives who could claim to be taken seriously, but I don't see any major new party emerging."
For many candidates, running for president is a quadrennial affair. Ms. Harder, an author and bookstore owner, engaged in a "practice" campaign four years ago and is running what she called "a symbolic campaign" to draw attention to government reform.
Four years ago, she probably did not notice her competitor from Newburyport, Mass., Michael T. Strauss, the standard bearer for Mike's Party, of which he is the only member. In 1996, Mr. Strauss said, his campaign slogan was, "Vote for Mike or don't vote at all." How successful was he? "More than half the people registered didn't vote that year," he said, referring to the 49 percent turnout in 1996. "So I did quite well, actually."
For this year's campaign he bought 1,000 wooden nickels to pass out. They say, "Re-elect Mike Strauss."
"It makes me sound more experienced," Mr. Strauss said.
Some candidates seem more serious. Bernard Palicki of Huntsville, Ala., who ran for Congress six years ago as a Republican and now heads the Corrective Action Party, has an Internet site to rail against global trade and federal banking laws.
"I'm using my candidacy as a vehicle to get ideas across," Mr. Palicki said. "But I'm not accepting any money, and I'm not making speeches. I'm strictly on the Internet."
Temperance Lance-Council, a local activist in Los Angeles, formed the Anti-Hypocrisy Party last year as a protest against what she called the arrogance of public officials. A candidate from Mill Valley, Calif., named Da Vid (who was born 56 years ago in Manhattan as Dolph Ornstein), founded the Light Party to highlight the relationship between environment and health. Ernest Lee Easton of South Bend, Ind., head of the Veterans Industrial Party, is a Vietnam veteran who is concerned about veteran rights, campaign finance reform and issues related to job security.
But others leave the clear impression they do not really expect to dwell in the White House anytime soon. Daniel Pearlman, an independent candidate from Taos, N.M., believes presidential ballots should contain no names so voters can select anyone they choose. To enhance his political stature, Mr. Pearlman has already declared himself "President of New Mexico." Freddy Sitnick of Owings Mills, Md., an independent, said he had written to all 50 states asking to be placed on the ballot. So far, none have responded. Maybe that is because Mr. Sitnick tells people he is the Messiah.
And Clay Oliver Hill of Kissimmee, Fla., another independent, said he was worried about the international terrorist rings that he believed had headquarters near his house.
"I doubt I'll be invited to the debates," Mr. Hill said.
But among those who have filed with the election commission, maybe Raymond Kenneth Petry, an independent from Honolulu, chose the most realistic path to power.
He declared himself a candidate for vice president.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Stocks Rally As Data Hints At Slower Pace

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Both stocks and bonds rallied yesterday after the June employment report brought investors news of slower growth and the hope that the Federal Reserve might now refrain from another increase in interest rates next month.
The Nasdaq composite index jumped over the 4,000 mark for the first time since April, and cut its loss for the year to a little more than 1 percent. The Standard & 
 Poor's 500-stock index popped back into the plus column for the year, while the Dow Jones industrial average narrowed its decline. In the bond market, interest rates slipped.
But both stocks and bonds are still locked in their recent trading ranges, and are likely to remain there until it is clear that the Federal Reserve has finished raising its short-term interest rate target to slow the blistering pace of economic growth and dampen inflationary pressures.
While private-sector jobs continued to increase, the June data showed that the pace of growth was slowing. At the same time, income growth -- as measured by average hourly earnings -- remained moderate. And the increase in aggregate hours worked slowed some, signaling that worker productivity is still strong.
Investors seemed to conclude that the pace of growth might be decelerating enough to keep Fed policy makers from raising interest rates when they meet again on Aug. 22. Inflationary pressures, as measured by wages and productivity, are also not too threatening.
At the same time, economic growth is still robust enough to keep the corporate earnings outlook positive. The reporting season for second-quarter earnings gets into full swing next week and forecasters are still expecting a robust quarter, with growth of about 19 percent over the second quarter of 1999.
"People have become less certain that the Fed will tighten at the August meeting, while that was the forecast after the June meeting," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
That sentiment was reflected in the slight decline yesterday in the yield on federal funds futures for August, to 6.53 percent from 6.545 percent. The federal funds rate, which is the interest charged on overnight loans between banks, is the Federal Reserve's target for short-term interest rates. It is now at 6.5 percent after an increase of half of a percentage point in May. Policy makers left the rate unchanged in June but warned that it might be raised again if the economy did not slow more.
And, Mr. Liro added, investors can be "confident that there will be enough aggregate demand out there to keep the economy growing."
The Nasdaq composite index jumped 62.63 points, or 1.6 percent, to 4,023.20 yesterday, while the S.& P. 500 climbed 22.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,478.90. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.51 points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,635.98. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was moderate, with 931.8 million shares changing hands. The daily average for the year is 1.02 billion shares a day.
Yesterday's rally turned the week into a nice positive. The Nasdaq rose 1.4 percent for the week and the technology-heavy index is now down just 1.1 percent for the year. But it is still 20.3 percent below its high for the year, set in March. The S.& P. was up 1.7 percent for the week and is now up 0.7 percent for the year. But it is still 3.2 percent below its high set in March. The Dow finished the week 1.8 percent higher. It is still the worst performer of the three indexes, down 7.5 percent for the year and is 9.3 percent from its record high in January.
Mr. Liro noted that while investors seemed to worry about the impact of the monthly jobs data on the stock market, the data has usually been a help to the stock market on the day it is released. He said that on 15 of the 18 Fridays on which the employment report has been issued since January 1999, the S.& P. index has rallied. And in 12 of those rallies, the S.& P. has risen 1 percent or more.
There are several reasons for this sunny response, he said. One is that investors who are worried about the Fed's raising interest rates are calmed by signs that the economy is slowing a bit. The underlying growth, meanwhile, is a natural balm to the market. And often, just getting the news out of the way, even if it is negative, is a relief to many investors.
Stocks were led higher yesterday by Hewlett-Packard, Wal-Mart Stores, Home Depot, I.B.M., Citigroup, Intel and Dell Computer. The stocks that fell included Qualcomm, BroadVision, Yahoo, Pfizer, Merck, Alcoa and General Motors.
In the bond market, prices were higher as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 6.00 percent from 6.04 percent on Thursday, while the price rose 8/32, to 103 19/32. The yield on the 10-year note has been fighting to get back below 6 percent for the last four weeks. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 5.87 percent from 5.90 percent Thursday.
After one day of trading a cent below $30 a barrel, the price of crude oil rose yesterday. Oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was up 29 cents, or 1 percent, to $30.28. It is still unclear how much the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will actually increase its crude oil production. Saudi Arabia said Monday that it would raise its production by 500,000 barrels a day -- less than 2 percent of OPEC production -- if the price did not decline soon. But other OPEC members are still discussing how much of an increase they will accept.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Urges Tax Credits to Spur Job Growth Upstate

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: CORNING, N.Y., July 7

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed the creation of tax credits and other federal financing to stimulate job growth among small businesses in this upstate region today on the second day of a tour that is celebrating her first year of campaigning for the United States Senate.
In a speech this afternoon before the Rotary Club, Mrs. Clinton called for a tax credit of up to $3,000 per employee for small businesses that set up operations in communities losing population -- like many she is visiting on this campaign swing. 
 In her remarks to about 300 people at a club luncheon, as well as at an earlier appearance in nearby Elmira, Mrs. Clinton highlighted economic issues in a region that has been considered a Republican stronghold.
She called for more federal funds to develop and improve highways in western New York as well as for airlines to bring more frequent, and and less expensive, air service to this region.
"I will do everything possible to entice some airlines to look more closely at the regional airports," she said. "It's a very big challenge and we have to be vigilant."
At the same time, she continued her attacks on Representative Rick A. Lazio for a fund-raising letter sent this week by his campaign. In the letter, Mr. Lazio said Mrs. Clinton and President Clinton had "embarrassed our country and disgraced their powerful posts." He has said that he did not see the letter before it was sent but that he stood by it.
"I think that is a perfect example of how he tries to be all things to all people," Mrs. Clinton said. "And it's part of the typical political double talk that's marked his campaign."
Mrs. Clinton began her day in Ithaca, where she walked through the Commons, a business district, and visited a coffee shop. And she went on to attend an outdoor rally in Elmira organized by labor groups and Democratic Party officials. As in many of her campaign stops, Mrs. Clinton continued to evoke strong passions from onlookers, garnering a large share of cheers and protests. Today's appearance in Ithaca drew an especially vocal group of protesters, complaining of the continuation of the Navy's bombing on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
Amid the Democratic faithful at both stops were groups of protesters holding signs reading "Stand by Your Man . . . in Arkansas" as well as far cruder slogans.
Speaking to reporters, Mrs. Clinton said that she was not bothered by such protesting. "People have hundreds of millions of opinions," Mrs. Clinton said. "And I have no problem with anybody expressing their opinions in a civil way. It doesn't bother me. It's part of the political process."
Today, Mrs. Clinton departed from her typical pattern of riding in a van with her staff and security detail by boarding the bus carrying the reporters covering her campaign. For the 20-minute ride from Ithaca to Elmira, she spoke with the reporters, reflecting on the year since she formed an exploratory committee to run for the United States Senate.
"This has been a great experience for me," she said, referring to her first attempt at gaining elective office. "I had to learn how to be a candidate. I sure have tried to be more effective at becoming a candidate, which is something I'd never done before."
When asked whether the highly negative tone of the protesters' placards gave her pause, she said: "Oh, they are amateurs. I have been down this road for so many years. Even before I was married to Bill Clinton, people had strong opinions about me. And it hasn't changed ever since I was a little girl and I don't expect it to change any time before the end of this election. It is just part of the background music of my life."

HEADLINE: Dissent on AIDS by South Africa's President: Thoughtfulness or Folly?

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: DURBAN, South Africa, June 7

 BODY:
It was just past midnight when the phone jangled in the home of Malegapuru Makgoba, one of South Africa's most influential scientists. To his astonishment, he heard the voice of President Thabo Mbeki rumbling across the line.
The president was thumbing through scientific journals, surfing the Net and pondering the AIDS epidemic that is ravaging this country. He was calling for advice late that January night, but he ultimately disregarded Mr. Makgoba's counsel and began exploring the work of two Americans who argue that H.I.V. does not cause AIDS. 
 The news of Mr. Mbeki's interest in such a theory -- though he has never explicitly adopted it -- exploded in the news media.
Prominent doctors accused Mr. Mbeki of dabbling in pseudoscience while people were dying. Even government officials wondered why the president had unleashed such a furor. "Why not just keep quiet?" asked Joel Netshitenzhe, the chief of government communications, summing up the comments of some anxious officials.
On Sunday Mr. Mbeki will confront many critics, including Mr. Makgoba, when he addresses thousands of researchers here on the opening day of the 13th International Conference on AIDS. He will stand before them, the leader of a country swept up in the plague, with his reputation bruised and his credibility questioned.
But if he has stumbled in his handling of the crisis, his struggle also offers rare insight into the thinking of an intensely private leader in his first year in office.
Over the past two months, as he has tried to clarify his stance, Mr. Mbeki has painted a self-portrait of a restless intellectual, a meticulous hands-on manager who rarely delegates decisions, a chief executive who challenges convention, even when advisers suggest otherwise.
"I didn't go into this work, into this office, in search of popularity," Mr. Mbeki said, according to Mr. Netshitenzhe, when some officials suggested that the president should have shied away from the fray. "If there are issues to be dealt with, they need to be pursued."
For South Africa, it is a striking shift in substance and style. Nelson Mandela, the country's first democratically elected leader, delegated many responsibilities, serving as a charismatic caretaker president. Mr. Mbeki thrives on details, closely manages his cabinet and often analyzes important matters way into the night.
Mr. Mbeki's critics say this means that the president sidelines his own ministers and experts. His supporters say this means his ministers must be prepared to study the issues as carefully as the president does. In practice it means that all but his most capable ministers sometimes fade from view.
For instance it was clearly Mr. Mbeki, not the health minister, who drove the government's inquiry into the causes and treatment of AIDS.
He was the one who came across the research by two American biochemists, Peter Duesberg and David Rasnick, who argue that poverty and malnutrition -- not the human immunodeficiency virus -- cause AIDS. He was the one who began questioning the safety of the commonly prescribed drug AZT after reading criticism of the drug on the Internet.
Mr. Mbeki contacted local and foreign researchers, surrounded himself with books and journals and consulted with the minister of health when he came across medical terms he did not understand. And when he noticed opinions that challenged established views, he did not hesitate to pursue them.
He is, after all, no stranger to challenging the establishment. During the apartheid years, he was among the first members of the African National Congress to argue that negotiation with whites -- not armed revolution -- would lead to the demise of apartheid.
As president, he has been willing to challenge his allies, the labor unions, by taking a tough stance on labor talks and vowing to speed privatization and to relax some protections for workers, a position that has helped strengthen investor confidence.
And it was only natural, officials say, that Mr. Mbeki would turn his scrutiny to AIDS. According to the United Nations, South Africa has the largest number of people living with H.I.V., an estimated 4.2 million, or 20 percent, of its residents.
"Fundamentally, he's raising these issues because in South Africa, in our region, we've got to find, we have to find the necessary solutions to enable us to deal with this pandemic," said Essop Pahad, the minister of the office of the presidency and one of Mr. Mbeki's close friends.
"And if he wants to understand something, he will not rely only on other people's views," Mr. Pahad said in an interview. "He wants to understand it for himself."
Mr. Mbeki is not scientifically trained, but was an outstanding student in South Africa and earned a scholarship to the University of Sussex in England, where he got a degree in economics.
His critics say the controversy shows how Mr. Mbeki's singlemindedness and reluctance to defer to experts can be risky. Even some government officials worry that Mr. Mbeki's ruminations on AIDS (and the media's simplification of his views) may have undermined efforts to prevent the disease.
The news of Mr. Mbeki's consultation with the two Americans was widely broadcast on television and radio here. And counselors say they are encountering people who assume they can engage in risky sexual behavior because the president has suggested that H.I.V. is not the real cause of AIDS. There is so much international consternation over Mr. Mbeki's suggestions and the impact they may have that 5,000 scientists from across the world signed a declaration affirming that H.I.V. causes AIDS. The statement was published this week in the magazine Nature.
"People are outraged at what's happening," said Mary Caeser, the national coordinator of the AIDS Legal Network, a human rights and service organization. "While the president has the prerogative to address any issue, people feel that the manner in which he is handling the issue is irresponsible. It's created confusion. We've lost ground in terms of the work we have done."
The government has already begun a quiet retreat. Mr. Mbeki, who angrily described the criticism as a "campaign of intellectual intimidation and terrorism" in a letter to President Clinton, began tempering his comments during a visit to the United States in May.
This week the health minister, Dr. Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, admitted in Parliament that government officials, including Mr. Mbeki, were mistaken when they said AZT was too toxic to prescribe to pregnant mothers. She said research showed that the benefits of the drug clearly outweighed the risks, though she says it is still too expensive.
And an international panel of scientists convened by President Mbeki disbanded this week without making any proclamations on the question of what causes AIDS.
Mr. Netshitenzhe and Mr. Pahad emphasize that Mr. Mbeki did make important points that are rarely mentioned, including the inability of Western science so far to cope with the disease in Africa.
The president highlighted the differences between the virus in Africa, typically transmitted heterosexually, and the strain in the West, which is most commonly transmitted through homosexual contact and intravenous drug use. And the officials praised him for being in the forefront of a push for a vaccine developed in Africa.
Mr. Makgoba, who has become one of Mr. Mbeki's fiercest critics, nevertheless says the president should get credit for financing research into a vaccine and for being willing to evolve in his thinking.
For months, Mr. Makgoba admits, he was angered by the president's public musings about AZT and by his decision to consult with the American researchers. But he describes that as "water under the bridge." In hindsight, he says, the whole issue has helped him better understand the man who is leading the country.
"He's a continuous learner," said Mr. Makgoba, who heads the Medical Research Council, the South African equivalent to the National Institutes of Health. "He wants to understand things. He's basically a man who wants to exercise his power with knowledge derived from his own understanding of things. That sets him apart from presidents in the Western world, where most people rely on being fed information from advisers."
"It means he doesn't take accepted views easily," Mr. Makgoba said. "Sometimes it's part of his strength. It can also be his weakness."

China Backs Linux System
Over Microsoft's Windows Chinese leaders are concerned that the country is growing overly dependent on Microsoft's Windows operating system, which controls computers running everything from banks to President Jiang Zemin's e-mail box.
But the Chinese government, itself a master at monopoly, is taking its case against Microsoft not to the courtroom but to the marketplace, albeit with a bit of administrative fiat. It is backing the Linux operating system, which was created by a Finnish university student in 1991 and is distributed free to anyone who wants it. Page A1. 

F.T.C. Set to Challenge Heinz Deal
H. J. Heinz's proposed $185 million purchase of the closely held Milnot Holdings, maker of Beech-Nut baby foods, was challenged by antitrust enforcers who said the transaction would hurt competition. The Federal Trade Commission voted 3 to 2 to challenge in court the combination of Heinz with Beech-Nut, the No. 2 United States baby food producer. The F.T.C. said the combination would mean just two companies, Heinz and Gerber, a unit of Novartis, would control 98 percent of the United States market for prepared baby foods. Shares of Heinz rose 31.25 cents, to $45.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. C3.
 
Lessons From Nevada for Congress
Nevada has adopted a prescription drug program for the elderly very similar to one approved last month by the House of Representatives, but the program is off to a rocky start. Insurance companies have spurned Nevada's invitation to provide coverage. Nevada's experience offers ominous lessons for Congress, especially Republicans, who want to subsidize insurance companies to entice them into providing drug benefits to elderly and disabled people on Medicare. A1.
 
World Bank Representative Cleared
The World Bank said this week that an eight-month investigation found no evidence to support accusations that a former Russian representative at the World Bank passed confidential information to a Russian commercial bank in 1993. The bank did conclude that the representative, Leonid Grigoriev, had established a business relationship with the defunct Inkombank, and that he received $13,000 for out-of-pocket expenses from the bank in 1993. C2.
 
Students Learn Art of Negotiating
A group of some 50 students from two dozen countries participated in the second Model W.T.O. 2000 -- an idea that the World Trade Organization hopes to export to universities worldwide. The students, sequestered in a conference room in the W.T.O.'s building with spectacular views of Lake Geneva, concentrated on long and tough negotiations on the most sensitive trade issues, oblivious to the sunny weather outside. The mock negotiators were able to spend some time with the trade group's director general, Mike Moore, who told them they were lucky that they did not have to "go home and sell" their trade proposals to their parliaments. C2.
 
A Contempt Ruling Is Overturned
A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., has overturned a criminal contempt citation against a reporter who disclosed details of a sealed legal settlement after documents describing the agreement were inadvertently handed to her by a court clerk. The judges found there was no evidence that Kirsten B. Mitchell, a reporter for The Morning Star in Wilmington, N.C., intended "to violate a court order or confidentiality," and that she acted "wholly innocently." C2.
 
Ex-G.M. Official to Fight Extradition
In an appearance before a Spanish judge, the former General Motors executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua said he would fight extradition to the United States. A grand jury in Detroit indicted Mr. Lopez in May on six criminal counts related to accusations that he stole company secrets from G.M. when he went to work for a rival, Volkswagen. C2.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Latest Surprise For Utica: His Resignation

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: UTICA, N.Y., July 6

 BODY:
Plenty of people in this small but spirited upstate city thought they were long past being surprised by Mayor Edward A. Hanna.
In his 30 years in and out of office, Mr. Hanna -- a blunt, and, some would say, bullying politician -- erected a carillon outside City Hall to chime "My Way" on the hour, and publicly declared his fair city "a lousy place to live." He paid for frequent TV and radio broadcasts to denounce the local newspaper, and for much of this year he restricted news-media access to City Hall information so effectively that the paper stopped running its police blotter. 
 But even Uticans who thought they had heard it all where Ed Hanna is concerned were plenty shocked last month when two current and two former male employees filed a notice accusing the mayor of sexual harassment.
And the crowning surprise came on Monday, when the mayor, 78, announced his resignation in a news release, citing a longstanding heart problem that he said had become worse.
The announcement, Mr. Hanna's only public communication on the subject, made no mention of the sexual harassment allegations, which he had characterized in an earlier news release as "a scam, loaded with outrageous lies."
Even close colleagues were blindsided by the resignation, assuming that the combative mayor would keep up the fight.
"I was certainly surprised," said Timothy Julian, the Common Council president, who started his Monday adding aluminum siding to his house and ended it giving interviews as the city's new mayor.
Mr. Julian, 35, a laundry owner and landlord who has held public office for just six months, said this week that as the Republican running mate of Mr. Hanna, he planned to continue his predecessor's popular policies in economic development, beautification and public safety.
Describing himself, however, as "more laid-back," Mr. Julian suggested that his administration would not offer the drama that Uticans have grown accustomed to during the Hanna years.
Mr. Hanna plastered downtown with placards and parks bearing his name. His normal speaking tone would be considered yelling by most standards, and he sprinkled his public remarks with four-letter words.
People in this city of 63,000 tend to loathe or adore him. He receives high marks for replacing blighted buildings with parks and concert spaces, bolstering neighborhood associations and reviving the sagging morale of business owners, while holding the line on taxes.
"When he started running for office I wasn't too keen about him. He was a little bit too way out," said Barbara Byrne, 69, who heads her neighborhood block association. "Now I'm fully convinced he's the only kind of person who can change anything in Utica."
Some, however, think his take-no-prisoners approach carried a cost. In an editorial today, the city's daily newspaper, The Observer-Dispatch, tempered praise for the former mayor's achievements with harsh criticism of his style.
"In the end, Ed Hanna probably would like to be perceived as a dedicated public servant who challenged Uticans to take pride and do better," the editorial said. "But in fact, he was a demagogue and a bully who had to rely on an eight-year-old medical report in a weak effort to step down from a public office he no longer deserved."
Mr. Hanna, a millionaire who perfected the technique used in coin-operated photo booths, always declared himself a businessman and not a politician. A Democrat-turned-Republican, he was mayor from 1972 to 1975 and returned in 1996. After winning re-election last November with a record-setting 75 percent of the vote, he immediately engaged in creating his trademark turmoil.
From December until May he forced The Observer-Dispatch and other news organizations to submit questions to city officials in writing and await written responses, which often arrived days later, if at all. Mr. Hanna said he was merely combating slanted and error-filled reporting, but many First Amendment watchdogs said the restrictions were among the most severe news blackouts they had heard of.
Newspaper articles involving aspects of city government -- even police and fire reports -- were often laughably incomplete, and some residents complained that they could not keep up with the crime in their neighborhoods. Typical of the hobbled reporting was the caption beneath a photo of a shooting victim in a stretcher that read simply: "The victim is wheeled to an ambulance."
While Mr. Hanna literally broadcast his feud with the media, he all but disappeared after the four current and former employees announced that they intended to file a suit charging a pattern of sexual harassment. The lawyer representing them, Frank Policelli, said he intended to file suit July 14, alleging that the mayor deliberately hired blond-haired, blue-eyed men in their 20's and 30's for City Hall jobs they were not necessarily qualified for, only to pressure them sexually. In some cases, Mr. Policelli said, they were fired for rebuking the mayor.
Mr. Hanna did not return calls seeking comment and it is unclear whether he has chosen a lawyer to defend him. The corporation counsel,John Dillon, said the city would not represent Mr. Hanna in the lawsuit. By Wednesday, the new mayor had already held two news conferences and allowed an Observer-Dispatch reporter to accompany him on a his rounds through the city. "I plan to be more approachable," Mr. Julian said.
Utica being Utica, political waters are already being stirred up. While Mr. Julian and his fellow Republicans contend that the law allows him to remain in office for the next three and a half years, some Democrats immediately grumbled that a special election was necessary in the fall. Regardless, unless Mr. Hanna returns to politics, it is bound to be calmer here.
"Virtually everyone knew Ed Hanna and he was on 78 r.p.m.'s when the rest of the city was at 33 1/3," said John Zogby, a political pollster and a Utica native. "Hanna brought the city to where it needed to be, but he probably carried it as far as he could. Now's the time for a unifier, a caretaker."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
The Bushes Talk of History And How It Favors Their Son

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., July 7

 BODY:
In a rare face-to-face interview about his son's presidential campaign, former President George Bush said today that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas would emerge victorious in November largely because American voters periodically craved change, and because President Clinton's conduct in office had sharpened that appetite.
President Bush, 76, who sat with his wife, Barbara, 75, for a nearly hourlong interview at the family compound here, said that Vice President Al Gore's ties to Mr. Clinton would not allow him to present himself credibly as a fresh start, and that his son's ability to do so would prove decisive. 
 He also cited that same cyclical impulse in the electorate as the reason he was defeated in 1992, after one term in office, by Mr. Clinton.
"I think I was the victim of people wanting change," said Mr. Bush, who served as vice president under President Ronald Reagan for two terms before moving into the White House. He described voters' sentiments in 1992 as "eight years of Reagan, four years of Bush, we want a change."
"And I think the same thing is true now," he said. "I think people kind of like change, like the idea of change from time to time. I think that works for George's benefit."
He and Mrs. Bush also said that they thought the notion of "Clinton fatigue" was real, and that their son's frequent pledge to "restore honor and integrity" to the Oval Office was one that would resonate with voters who felt that those virtues had been compromised by Mr. Clinton.
"It isn't even debatable, in my view," Mr. Bush said.
Aides said that today's joint interview was one of only three or four that the Bushes had done in the last year, and their comments were striking for several reasons, chief among them the way in which Mr. Bush interpreted both his and his son's presidential fortunes in terms of historic forces outside their control.
In assessing his son's prospects, Mr. Bush dwelled longer on the country's itch for something different than on the Texas governor's record and positions on issues, though he did offer hearty praise for both.
And in chalking up his own defeat in 1992 to that same itch, he implicitly rejected the prevailing view that he lost because he failed to articulate coherently a domestic agenda or to run as spirited a campaign as Mr. Clinton did.
The former president and the former first lady also spoke more harshly of Mr. Clinton's behavior in office than they had in the past.
And while they and the Texas governor have dismissed suggestions that his candidacy was an act of redemption and revenge, his parents' words and demeanor -- especially his mother's -- suggested that they had not left 1992 completely behind them.
At the very least, the Bushes exhibited a sensitivity to President Bush's legacy. Mrs. Bush, almost as an aside, murmured that the strong economy the country was enjoying was really her husband's doing, and Mr. Bush mentioned that he was bothered by President Clinton's assertions that Mr. Gore was perhaps the best vice president ever.
"I'd like to argue that on my own behalf," Mr. Bush said, referring to his own years as vice president. "We had the, you know, drug interdiction program. We had the deregulation task force. I headed up the antiterrorist task force. I took the case for American missiles to Germany, the Pershings. I mean, there was a lot of substance there."
He said the Monica Lewinsky affair and Mr. Clinton's impeachment had hurt the country in real, meaningful ways.
"There's been a diminution of respect for the office of the presidency, and it's not just here, it's abroad," he said, adding that voters' concern about that "is going to manifest itself on Election Day."
When Mr. Clinton's name had initially come up, Mrs. Bush signaled that she and her husband would take a pass on the topic, in accordance with a long-held vow not to speak ill of Mr. Bush's successor.
But minutes later, Mrs. Bush was discussing Americans' lowered expectations for public officials, and when her husband said she could not blame that entirely on Mr. Clinton, she responded, "Oh, I can."
The Bushes also addressed the persistent questions about whether their son had enough knowledge of foreign affairs to lead the nation. Mr. Bush, a former U.N. ambassador and an envoy to China who campaigned for the White House on his foreign policy expertise, acknowledged that his son did not know as much as he did when he became president.
But, he added, "He knows every bit as much about it as Bill Clinton did."
Did his son know as much as Mr. Gore?
"Gore's had eight years of experience there," the former president acknowledged. "But the way I should be judged on whether I knew foreign policy is by the kind of people I had around me. Because I didn't know all this stuff."
"You get good people," he added, echoing his son's frequent refrain that a president principally assembles a team, delegates responsibilities and makes final decisions based upon good advice. "George knows enough to do that and enough about the world to have good judgment on his own at this point," Mr. Bush said.
Later, unprompted, he returned to the question of his son's preparedness.
"I'm just going back in my mind," he said. "You had Reagan, Carter, Clinton. What was their foreign affairs experience? They got elected president."
Mrs. Bush then chimed in with a reference to Mr. Gore's awkward toast, during a visit to China in 1997, with Prime Minister Li Peng, who had ordered the violent crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989.
"I don't think we ought to think of Al Gore in China at the time that he was caught with the Champagne glasses," she said. "I'm not going to think about that."
"What are you doing?" Mr. Bush said, acting displeased with her acidic interruptions but never really seeming so. "You're not going to be in this interview if you're going to start talking like that. George will call and he'll be furious."
The Bushes have kept a fairly low public profile throughout their son's presidential campaign, taking care not to overshadow him, not to invite criticism that he was simply riding on his family's name, or to make accidental statements that could become controversial.
But with the Republican convention just weeks away, they have decided to grant a few interviews. They are clearly eager to make the case for his candidacy. They clearly realize that the nostalgia that many Americans now feel for them can work to their son's advantage. ("Time heals a lot of wounds," the former president said.)
And they clearly have a hard time containing their pride in what could be a historic circumstance. If the Texas governor is elected president, it will be only the second time in American history that the son of a president ascended to the same post.
"It's mind-boggling for me," Mr. Bush said during the interview, which began in the living room of the main house, continued over a lunch of lobster salad on a rear terrace overlooking the Atlantic, and ended when he had to rush off with his son Jeb, the Florida governor, for a 12:30 p.m. tee time at a nearby golf course.
Jeb Bush, who joined his parents for lunch, said that his brother, George, was benefiting from a Republican yearning to take back the White House -- a desire so strong that the party was managing to paper over internal divisions that had fractured it in the past.
"Eight years in the wilderness brings a higher tolerance for diversity," Jeb Bush said, adding that 12 years in the wilderness had made the Democratic Party rally in a similar way around Mr. Clinton in 1992.
"If you looked at Bill Clinton's record as governor of Arkansas, he was given a huge break by groups that were anxious to have a Democrat in the White House," Jeb Bush said.
Although he did not make any sort of similar appraisal of his brother's record, he later added, "Well, I think the same thing applies this year and benefits George, rather than Gore."
President and Mrs. Bush acknowledged that in 1992 or 1993 or even the beginning of 1994, they never expected a day like this to come. Mr. Bush left Washington as something of a pariah in the Republican Party, a man who had acquiesced to a tax increase and lost the White House.
"They didn't want to have anything to do with me," he acknowledged.
And George W. Bush had never really demonstrated the sort of political ambition that his brother Jeb had. When he told his mother that he planned to run against the incumbent Texas governor, Ann Richards, in 1994, she told him he would lose. His mother was wrong.
Reflecting on the difference between then and now, his father said, "I'm amazed -- still amazed -- at the way he's done."
His parents said that they never doubted that he had the talent and temperament for politics and governing, and they praised his performance as governor, saying that he had set priorities, stuck to them and delivered on his promises.
But when asked about the reason for his short trajectory from new governor in January 1995 to presidential hopeful as early as 1998, his father again cited an external reality.
"What happened was that he was elected governor of the second biggest state in the nation, and then he was re-elected with 70 percent of the vote, and anybody who's governor of a big state probably thinks, 'Hey, I could be president,' " the former president said. "And somewhere in there, I don't know where it was, George made up his mind. He didn't come ask us, incidentally."
"If George weren't running for president," his father added, "whoever was the nominee of the Republican Party would surely be looking at him, among others, to be vice president. It's a six-inch putt, because of the importance of the electoral votes and the state."
He said that he was not getting involved in his son's search for a vice president, and he denied rumors that he might act as an intermediary to convince Gen. Colin L. Powell, a close friend, to reconsider his reluctance to take the job. He said that General Powell was unequivocally unwilling. In any case, the former president said, he reserved the right simply to be an extraordinarily proud father, generous with emotional support but not with advice on strategies or issues.
"If you asked me, life or death, 'You've got to tell me how big the tax cut is that George is proposing,' I couldn't tell you," he said. "I don't give a damn."
Both Mr. and Mrs. Bush had generally kind words for Mr. Gore, saying that when they were in the White House and he was a senator, they had met and liked him. When asked if Mr. Gore had gone overboard, during the impeachment proceedings, by calling Mr. Clinton one of the greatest American presidents, Mr. Bush expressed sympathy for the political bind in which Mr. Gore found himself.
"Once you accept the vice presidency, then you've got to be a loyal vice president," he said.
"But when the whole nation is embarrassed by something," he added, "that loyalty can hurt you in terms of your own credibility. And if you waffle on it, that hurts you. It's a Catch-22."
"Greatest president, though?" Mrs. Bush asked, referring to Mr. Gore's remark. "In history?"
"You're saying too much," Mr. Bush told her.

HEADLINE: REPORT DIMS HOPE FOR AIDS THERAPY TO PROTECT BABIES

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

DATELINE: DURBAN, South Africa, July 7

 BODY:
A United Nations-sponsored study of AIDS infection among infants has dashed the hopes of scientists who thought they had found a simple way to prevent mothers from giving their infants the AIDS virus during breast-feeding.
The results of the study, discussed during interviews here ahead of an international AIDS conference, confirmed earlier reports that a relatively simple drug regimen can stop many infected mothers from infecting their children during pregnancy and childbirth. But it also found that the protection does not last for as long as experts had hoped, and the therapy appears to leave children vulnerable to infection from breast milk. 
 Scientists had hoped that the treatment would be a powerful weapon in their broad effort to shield very young children from the AIDS epidemic in Africa, without the need to tackle the difficult issue of breast-feeding, which is a medical risk but a cultural, religious or economic necessity for millions of African women.
For about the last five years, doctors have been giving women in the United States and elsewhere infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, one of two treatments during pregnancy to prevent the spread of the disease to their unborn children. The infants were treated in the first few days after birth, and an earlier study showed significant reductions in AIDS infections in the first six weeks of life. The success of that and similar studies had been hailed as one of the rare triumphs in the war against AIDS.
The new study, which involved 1,797 people and was the largest ever performed on the transmission of AIDS from mothers to children, followed children who were born to these mothers and found that by 18 months the initial benefit was completely lost as the infants who had been spared infection at birth later became infected through breast-feeding.
At week six in the study, 6.7 percent of the babies born to mothers who took the two-drug combination were infected or had died, compared with 16.4 percent in the group that received no drugs. But the infection and death rates after 18 months were 21.3 percent in the treatment group compared with 26.8 percent in the placebo group.
The findings are to be reported at the 13th International Conference on AIDS, which begins on Sunday. But the study's leaders disclosed the findings in extensive interviews in advance of the meeting because of their public health importance.
"It's bad news," said Dr. Joep M. A. Lange, of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the study's principal investigator. The study was conducted in South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda by researchers from the three African countries and his Dutch team.
In retrospect, said Prof. Hoosen M. Coovadia, the head of the department of pediatrics and child health at the University of Natal and the AIDS conference's chairman, who helped design the United Nations study, "it was naive to believe that continued breast-feeding would not make an impact."
Nevertheless, said Dr. Glenda Gray, who heads the perinatal research unit at Baragwanath Hospital and the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, "it's not all or nothing because we can still make a difference" by trying other approaches.
The new challenge for AIDS researchers and government officials is to preserve the benefit of drug therapy in pregnancy and find safe alternatives to breast-feeding. That is a formidable task in Africa where the overwhelming majority of women breast-feed their infants for long periods. Poverty limits the ability of women to buy formula and breast-milk substitutes. Widespread contamination of water supplies and poor sanitation make it dangerous to mix formula. Also, male domination leaves many women with little ability to choose an alternative to breast-feeding. And a woman who avoids breast-feeding her infant can be stigmatized as having AIDS.
Further, the findings seem certain to renew the often bitter controversy over breast-feeding, which pits the new public health emergency of AIDS against a fundamental, even ideological, pediatric practice. Proponents say "breast is best" for infant nutrition and that the dangers of contaminated water make the use of formula too risky. But opponents contend that formula and other substitutes are needed in the face of a growing epidemic in which an estimated 570,000 children became H.I.V.-infected last year, mostly in Africa, where more than a third of pregnant women in some countries are infected.
Unaids, a joint United Nations program, has issued recommendations intended to discourage H.I.V.-infected women from breast-feeding, but it said the decision should be left to each mother, in part because the controversy cuts across cultural and religious beliefs.
The new findings could also have political ramifications.
The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, has caused an international furor in recent weeks over his questioning of the use of AZT in combating mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V.
And the findings could bring added pressure on governments in third world countries for wider testing among pregnant women to identify those who can breast-feed safely and to identify and counsel mothers who are infected but whose infants are not.
When the benefits of drug therapy during pregnancy were first reported, AIDS researchers were surprised that a relatively short course of drugs could have such an impact in preventing mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V. But there was no way to know in advance how long the benefit would last.
In the regimen found most effective in that study, a woman takes AZT and another drug, 3TC (lamivudine), for four weeks before her expected delivery date and again during labor. Then both mother and infant take the two drugs for one week after delivery.
The United Nations study was also pivotal in leading to apparent success with an even simpler, cheaper and seemingly more effective therapy -- a single pill of nevirapine given to a mother at the time of delivery and one dose in fluid form to the infant. That study was conducted in Uganda by Johns Hopkins University researchers with funding from the United States National Institutes of Health.
However, Dr. Lange said that "there is no reason to believe that this loss of effect is specific for" the combination of AZT and 3TC.
Indeed, a follow-up of the nevirapine study in Uganda shows the same negating effect in the breast-feeding period, said Francis Mmiro, a professor of obstetrics at Makerere University in Kampala.
In a separate development, Boehringer Ingelheim, which makes and sells nevirapine as Viramune, announced today that it would offer the drug at no charge for five years to prevent mother-to-child transmission in developing countries.
The company said the action was part of its commitment to the collaborative effort of five companies, the United Nations, the World Bank and cooperating governments to explore practical collaborative efforts to make AIDS drugs more affordable and more widely available.
Leaders of the United Nations study said they would have to go back to the drawing board to find new ways to block mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V.
"No single intervention will control pediatric AIDS," said Dr. Coovadia. The challenge now is "to make breast-feeding safer just as we have made sex safer," he said.
Dr. Coovadia and Professor Mmiro of Uganda were among those who said they were concerned that government leaders might stop paying for public programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission on the grounds that breast-feeding reversed many of the early gains.
Geert Haverkamp, who coordinated the United Nations, said his Dutch team from the Academic Medical Center now plans to conduct at least one follow-up study to help identify new ways to prevent infection of newborns.
In the planned study involving 500 children, they will receive either nevirapine or 3TC during the entire period their mother breast-feeds.
In a possible second study, about 500 mothers will receive three anti-H.I.V. drugs (AZT, 3TC and a third to be chosen) for the entire period she breast-feeds.
Reflecting on the new findings, Mr. Haverkamp, a sociologist, said that "we know there are certain limitations to short-term therapy during pregnancy, but we have to fight for what we won."

HEADLINE: Irish Now Face the Other Side of Immigration

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: BIRR, Ireland

 BODY:
It is hard to find anyone in this busy little town with a specific complaint about the 70-odd strangers who abruptly arrived last fall from places like Chechnya and Nigeria. But that does not mean the town wants them here.
"Maybe we're ignorant, but the only colored person you'd ever see before was someone back from England," said a 45-year-old carpenter who refused to give his name, saying that the issue was too fraught and that Birr, with only 4,000 or so people, was too small. 
 "It's not that we're biased," he said, trying to explain why he had not spoken to any of the newcomers, who are living here at government expense while their applications for political asylum are being considered. "It's just that we don't know what to make of these black people. We don't understand them. We're, maybe, afraid of them."
For the last decade, Ireland's membership in the European Union has helped fuel an economic boom, transforming an isolated, desperately poor economy into the proud success that calls itself the Celtic Tiger.
But the boom has brought another European dividend: waves of unwanted newcomers, most of them seeking employment and refuge from politically unstable, war-ravaged areas of Africa and Europe.
And now Ireland, with its history of sending its citizens abroad in search of better lives, has become something it never would have imagined: a magnet for the dispossessed. "This is the real world catching up to us," said Piaras MacEinri, director of the Irish Center for Migration Studies at University College, Cork. "It's not just about refugees. It's about Ireland no longer being a small, white place of emigrants."
By now the Irish are all too familiar with the prejudice and hardships their countrymen suffered over the centuries as they searched for work abroad. It is hard-wired into their sense of themselves.
That is why people like Ned Lawton become so angry when they hear the common complaint, voiced in Birr and elsewhere, that the refugees are here simply to take advantage of Ireland's newfound wealth, not to flee persecution at home.
"In the 1980's when you saw a headline about illegal immigrants, you'd assume the article was talking about Irish immigrants in New York," said Mr. Lawton, a spokesman for the Irish Refugee Council. "This is all a bit rich, coming from us, particularly now that we have a booming economy."
Europe is awash in refugees these days, but Ireland, more than its Continental cousins, has been forced by the rush of events to make up its asylum policy as it goes along.
In 1992 only 39 people applied for asylum in Ireland. In 1999 there were 7,724. Now 1,000 are applying every month, a number that sounds inconsequential until you consider Ireland's relatively tiny size, less than half the size of North Carolina.
With only 3.6 million residents, the country drew more asylum seekers as a percentage of its population last year than any other European country except Austria and Belgium. Most of the new arrivals have gravitated to an already overwhelmed Dublin, forcing the government to scramble for places to put them.
A proposal to build floating detention centers, or "flotels," foundered when port after port found new objections to raise. The current plan is to build some 4,000 housing units where the refugees can live for the 18 months or so it generally takes to process their applications.
In the meantime the Nigerians, Congolese, Romanians, Chechens and Poles living in the Maltings guesthouse, a private rooming house at one end of Birr, are beneficiaries, if that is the right word, of the government's current program of dispersing the asylum seekers around the country, even in rural areas ill equipped to handle them and even less prepared to welcome them.
Compounding the problem, for the refugees and the residents, is the government's decision to forbid asylum seekers to work while their cases are being considered.
"You're having a situation where people are being dispersed, but social services are not dispersed with them," Mr. MacEinri said. "Local government is in a poor state, and we're not really giving it any extra money."
In Birr the program has stirred up a stew of feelings, many of them negative, about where the country is going. Residents say they cannot square the fact that the asylum seekers are living rent-free -- with their meals taken care of and 15 pounds ($18) a week in spending money besides -- with the knowledge that there are still Irish people living on the streets of Dublin.
"They keep to themselves," admitted a 23-year-old man, walking past the Maltings on his way home from work and speaking on condition that his name and occupation not be disclosed. "But most people aren't happy with them. They're living the life of luxury."
Another man, who is in his 50's and runs a tractor-trailer business, stood next to a construction site and said he thought Ireland was taking on more than it could handle. Birr, too.
People tend to know each other here. Smack in the middle of Ireland, the town has several bustling streets of small stores and pubs and makes its living from a handful of factories around its edges and from the tourists who drive through, looking for Birr Castle.
Before the newcomers came, the man said, he had rarely -- if ever -- seen more than one dark-skinned person at a time. "I turned against them completely when I saw them begging in restaurants," he said. He did not know whom he had seen. "Either Romanians or Nigerians," he said. "We don't know the difference. They're all the same. They're all black, and we've never been used to colored people here."
On the other side of the cultural divide are people like Dorcas Balogun, 25. For Mrs. Balogun, a Muslim who fled Nigeria with her husband when both of his parents were killed by Christians who then came looking for them, her exile to Birr has meant long days of idleness, with too much time to fret about the future.
While she waits for her application to be processed -- and only a tiny percentage of Nigerians who applied for asylum in Ireland last year had their applications accepted -- she has had scarcely a conversation, let alone a shared meal, with an actual Irish person.
"Mostly I just sit around the house all day," she said, the house being the two-bedroom apartment she and her husband share with another Nigerian couple. Sometimes they take the long, slow bus ride into Dublin, but they do not feel comfortable walking around.
"It's not too bad," her husband, Adele, said. "But sometimes, when you go out to take some air, they look at you and say: 'Black people -- what are you doing in Ireland? Go back to your country.' "
Some townspeople have reached out. Maeve Garry, who runs the Maltings with her husband, has made several trips to Dublin to buy African food. The Rev. Tony Cahir, the priest at St. Brendan's, the Roman Catholic church in Birr, organized a minivan trip to visit a neighboring town. He also gave refugees used radios and tape recorders donated by his parishioners.
And when he sees the refugees walking past his house on their way to the tiny local library, where they tend to gather, he goes out of his way to greet them.
"If there was somebody passing by, I'd introduce them and say, 'This is Jimmy from Nigeria,' " he said.
Father Cahir said the community had reacted as well as could be expected. "Honestly, I'd say that the attitude has been a positive one," he said. "There has been wonderment, questioning, people asking who these people are, what is going to happen. But then people realized that they were here waiting for a decision from the government, and they saw that there's been absolutely no trouble."
But his optimism does not erase the anger simmering beneath the surface around the country, particularly in the places ordered to accept people they do not want. So far, almost 1,500 refugees are living in small communities outside Dublin.
In the town of Kildare, the outraged Chamber of Commerce has sued to block the arrival of 400 refugees, pointing out that the town had already taken in 300 from Kosovo. And in tiny Clogheen, in County Tipperary, an empty hostel that was being refurbished to house 40 asylum seekers was set on fire.
"We would have liked to consult a lot more, but you have to understand our predicament," said Alan Mulligan, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, explaining the government's policy of dispersing the refugees. "The vast majority -- 90 percent -- were staying in Dublin, and we just didn't have the accommodation for them."
Meanwhile, a country that was so homogeneous until the mid-1990's that the Rough Guide travel book described its residents as having a "uniquely naive brand of racism," is trying as best as it can to figure out what to do next.
"The government accepts its obligation to asylum seekers under international law," Mr. Mulligan said. "Racism will not be tolerated. But no government can go into any village and force people to like each other."

HEADLINE: China Moves To Cut Power Of Microsoft

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, July 6

 BODY:
Janet Reno is not the only one worried about Bill Gates's software monopoly. China's leaders are, too.
They are concerned that the country is growing overly dependent on the Windows operating system, which controls computers running everything from banks to President Jiang Zemin's e-mail box. But the Chinese government, itself a master at monopoly, is taking its case against Microsoft not to the courtroom but to the marketplace, albeit with a bit of administrative fiat. It is backing the Linux operating system, which was created by a Finnish university student in 1991 and is distributed free to anyone. 
 "We don't want one company to monopolize the software market," said Chen Chong, a deputy minister of information industries who oversees the computer industry in China. With Linux, "we can control the security," he added, so "we can control our own destiny."
A growing number of Chinese have likened dependence on Microsoft to leaving the keys to the country's increasingly computerized economy in the hands of a potential enemy. Some warn that secret holes in Microsoft's computer code might allow the United States access to Chinese networks or even enable it, in time of war, to shut those networks down.
Such concerns were only heightened last year when a cryptographer for a Canadian software firm working in the United States said he had found a feature in Windows called an NSAKey -- as in National Security Agency, the United States government agency that gathers electronic signal intelligence worldwide. Though Microsoft said the key was innocuous and no support has been found for any sinister explanation, "no one can guarantee that Windows does not have back doors," said Liu Bo, a former Microsoft executive who is now chief executive of Red Flag, a government-backed company set up to create software based on Linux and to encourage a homegrown software industry.
In addition, various arms of the government have been warning of the security risk posed by the country's reliance on Microsoft. "Without information security, there is no national security in politics, economics and military affairs," declared an editorial in People's Liberation Army Daily earlier this year.
Microsoft calls such fears nonsense and says it continues to enjoy a strong working relationship with the government. "We have shared product information with them," said Michael Rawding, Microsoft's regional director in China, "and I believe that their comfort with our product information led them to allow the launch" of Windows 2000, Microsoft's new business-oriented operating system, in China last spring.
Unlike the Windows source code, which Microsoft keeps secret, the Linux code is open for all to see and is freely distributed with the stipulation that anybody can improve it as long as any modifications are shared with the rest of the world. The almost communistic "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need" approach appeals to China's Marxist leaders.
Despite the government's stand, no one is suggesting that Microsoft is finished in China. Though it will not provide specific sales figures, the company says its software sales in China surged 80 percent last year and continue to grow. But the government's move to diversify reflects a broader dissatisfaction with the company and its founder, Mr. Gates, who just a few years ago was hailed as a hero by China's young technology enthusiasts.
The turning point in Microsoft's image was the introduction of its Chinese-language Windows 95 operating system, which was programmed to display references to "Communist bandits" and to exhort users to "take back the mainland." Beijing, infuriated to learn that Microsoft had used computer programmers in Taiwan to write the software, demanded that the company hire mainland programmers to fix it.
Chief among the company's critics is its former general manager for China, Juliet Wu, who has become a national celebrity with her withering, best-selling expose, "Up Against the Wind: Microsoft, I.B.M. and Me." The picture she paints of Microsoft as an arrogant Goliath feeds into the irritation many Chinese computer users feel toward the company.
Ms. Wu and other critics say Microsoft's pricing -- a software program can cost as much as an average office worker's monthly salary -- forces users to buy pirated copies of the company's software. (The Business Software Alliance, a nonprofit trade group, estimates that as much as 95 percent of all software in China is pirated, though the industry hopes China's expected admission to the World Trade Organization will change that.)
Liu Dongli, an Internet entrepreneur in the southern province of Fujian, was so enraged by having to pay $241 for Windows 98 that he sued the company for unfair pricing. The suit was withdrawn when Mr. Liu realized that Microsoft charges no more for its products in China than it does elsewhere. "But that doesn't mean we lost the case," he fumed, vowing to bring suit again when he has more evidence. "Monopoly is not a good thing."
The news media, meanwhile, have criticized Microsoft for suing a company last year over the sale of pirated software. Microsoft, which was asking for $200,000 in damages, lost the case because the Chinese court ruled that it had sued the wrong company. The defeat only darkened Microsoft's ominous silhouette in the eyes of many Chinese.
"Microsoft is a bully," said Hua Yuqing, a young Internet entrepreneur, who complains that Microsoft's high prices and proprietary computer code squelch creativity. He is building a business creating software programs that run on Linux. "I don't want to feel that I'm subconsciously controlled," Mr. Hua said, referring to the dependence on Microsoft that comes with using its products.
Mr. Hua and a half-dozen computer programmers peck away at their keyboards here in a drab office empty except for computers, desks, chairs and a shelf stocked with bottles of orange soda and boxes of chocolate milk. He and his colleagues are using Linux to start a company that provides services to subscribers over the Internet -- in this case, the use of accounting software and sales-tracking software. The software stays on Mr. Hua's server computer, and customers rent it rather than buy their own.
Microsoft's public relations disaster has been a boon for Linux. So far, several companies -- including Red Flag, which is backed by President Jiang's son, Jiang Mianhang, and TurboLinux, based in San Francisco -- have introduced Chinese-language versions of the Linux operating system in China. Many other companies have started to provide software and services for China's Linux users.
The Chinese government tried for more than a decade to develop an operating system of its own, but was unable to keep up with the fast-changing industry. Linux gives the country the tools to build that system now -- and, in the Chinese view, the fact that the Linux code is not privately held assures that any security it wants to build into its computer systems will not have undetectable vulnerabilities.
But even Linux enthusiasts profess ambivalence about the government's interest. Linux developers in China say some overseas colleagues worry that China may not play by the rules for collaborating and sharing and may adapt Linux to create a proprietary system instead.
In any case, China represents a market potential of such size, and government influence over the market is still so strong, that Beijing's support can turn almost any product into an industry standard domestically. By the end of next year, the country may well be the third-largest PC market in the world, and software sales are expected to grow more than 30 percent a year for the foreseeable future.
As China's economy becomes increasingly integrated with that of the region and the world, much of Asia is likely to follow its lead.
Mr. Liu, the chief executive of Red Flag, says a third of the country's Internet servers -- the computers that power Web sites -- are already using Linux operating systems. He estimates that by the end of next year Linux will run half of all servers in China and as much as a third of the country's desktop computers.
Those estimates may be overblown; the technology research firm IDC Asia-Pacific says its data shows less than 3 percent of all servers shipped to China last year were loaded with Linux. But IDC expects the number to more than double this year, and Linux's real market share is most certainly higher because the operating system can be downloaded free from the Internet.
"Linux, without doubt, has gained some headway among software developers in China," Mr. Rawding said. "However, I have yet to see any mission-critical organization deploy Linux because the truth of the matter is that in businesses, you want the support and service to be available to you instantly when something does go wrong."
Nonetheless, Great Wall Computer, one of China's biggest PC makers, has already shipped 200,000 desktop computers loaded with the Linux operating system, which looks much like Windows though it cannot yet match all of Microsoft's features.
Ma Li, marketing chief at Great Wall, says his company shifted toward Linux at Beijing's urging. "As a leading enterprise," he said, "we should respond to the call of the government."

FRIEDLANDER, MICHAEL

 BODY:
FRIEDLANDER-Michael. Always Loved. Little One. 
An article on June 22 about the historical and racial implications of a plan for a national park on Magnolia Plantation in Louisiana misstated the educational record of Viola Cowles, the mother of the park's historical interpreter. Mrs. Cowles graduated from high school and took some college courses. The article also misspelled the names of the park's superintendent, Laura Soulliere, and a member of the plantation's founding family, Mary Catallo. It also misstated Ms. Catallo's occupation. She is an executive of an engineering firm.
A front-page picture caption described one of the plantation's slave cabins incorrectly. It was not the boyhood home of Leslie Vercher, who is helping restore the cabins (though Mr. Vercher did live on the plantation as a child).

Asian Oddity: Economies Are Up, but Markets Are Down

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, July 7

 BODY:
Southeast Asia's economies are growing again. Its stock markets are getting smaller.
If that contrast sounds odd, it is. Last December, economists and analysts predicted that 2000 would be a boom year for Asian stocks and currencies. They said foreign investors, enriched with gains in high-technology stocks, would snap up Indonesian rupiah, Thai baht and Philippine pesos to buy stocks and bet on the region's continued recovery from the financial crisis that began in mid-1997. 
 Those forecasts have gone astray. Foreign investors have sold Southeast Asian stocks and currencies for much of the year, helping make several of the region's markets among the worst performing in the world.
Analysts and fund managers attribute the sell-off to a perception that Southeast Asia, despite an economic rebound, remains a dangerous place to invest because of political instability, corruption and a lack of technological sophistication.
"No one's looking at fundamentals these days," said Rebecca H. Patterson, a currency strategist at J. P. Morgan in Singapore.
Just how much investment funds from the United States, Europe and Japan have sold is difficult to determine. Securities exchanges in some countries, notably Singapore, do not release figures on foreign trading.
Lipper Analytical Services in New York says that so for this year at least $230 million had been pulled out of United States funds that make investments in Asian markets other than Japan's. But that figure would tend to understate the situation, because it includes funds investing in popular markets like South Korea, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong.
Figures from individual exchanges indicate where withdrawals and investment losses are worst. The Philippine Stock Exchange reports that foreigners have sold roughly $172 million more than they have bought so far this year. In Thailand, foreigners have sold nearly $700 million more in Thai stocks than they have bought. In Indonesia, foreigners had a $20 million net withdrawal in the first five months of the year.
Some of the benchmark stock indexes in the region have dropped 25 percent or more, making the 7.5 percent year-to-date decline of the Dow industrial average look modest. The exchange values of most Southeast Asian currencies have also fallen sharply.
Indonesia's benchmark stock index is down 25 percent. Combined with a 31 percent currency-rate decline, Indonesian stocks have lost nearly 56 percent of their value in dollar terms this year.
"We are concerned that this may balloon into another crisis," said Steven Lim, who manages $500 million in investments in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia for Daiwa International, the Japanese investment bank.
Mr. Lim cites the problems of an Indonesian fishing company, Daya Guna Samudera, to indicate how the investment statistics apply in real terms.
Daya Guna has exclusive licenses to catch and export fish and shrimp from Indonesia's teeming eastern seas. With its costs in Indonesian rupiah and its revenue in dollars, investing in Daya Guna seemed like an obvious opportunity last year.
But in December, the company informed investors that its catch had fallen 15 percent from the previous year. A third of its crew members, it said, had deserted to escape Muslim-Christian clashes in the eastern islands, leaving many new fishing vessels idle and the company in difficulty with creditors.
Seen more broadly, missing fishermen are the least of problems Indonesia is having with foreign investors now. Muslim rebels in the West, secessionists in the east and sectarian clashes on the islands in between have crippled confidence. Skirmishing between President Abdurrahman Wahid, his central bank chief and his cabinet have left the economy rudderless.
Somewhat similar troubles are souring investor sentiment elsewhere in the region. In the Philippines, insurgents in two separate Muslim rebellions have brought bombings to the capital and have kept 20 scuba divers hostage on a jungle island for nearly two months -- situations that do little to entice foreign capital. Nor has an insider-trading scandal involving a friend of President Joseph Estrada helped.
By comparison, Thailand is tamer. But a two-year court battle between the founder of a local plastics maker and its bankers has underlined the troubles still faced by Thai banks as they try to recover the 40 percent of their loans that borrowers cannot or will not repay. Banks make up roughly a quarter of the benchmark stock index, leading Peggy Creveling, who heads Salomon Smith Barney's research in Thailand, to ask, "how can the market go up?"
Malaysian stocks, which had been rising this year in anticipation of their inclusion again in global market indexes, have lately succumbed to the exodus of foreign capital.
And Singapore, famously stable and in the midst of an economic liberalization campaign, is suffering the effects of living in a tough neighborhood.
"I don't get it," said Chia Yeng Boo, 53, a Singaporean investor, as he watched local stock prices dwindle on a television screen. "The economy keeps getting better, but the stocks keep going down."
Local investors expecting a flood of foreign funds this year helped fuel a powerful rally late in 1999, particularly in electronics and telecommunications stocks. Their logic: when Nasdaq's bulls came to bank on a Southeast Asian recovery, they would look for anything remotely related to the Internet.
But smaller markets in the region lacked sufficient Internet appeal for foreign investors. There were just not enough high-end exports, dot-com stock offerings or flashy Internet market statistics, analysts say, to match markets in Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei and Hong Kong.
The Nasdaq rout in technology shares in April made things even worse. Investors, rather than seizing an opportunity to jump into fundamental economic stories like Southeast Asia's, simply lost their appetite for any risk.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
$2-a-Gallon Question: Is This Trip Necessary?

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
HEATHER AND JAMES WESTRIN of Lansing, Mich., looked forward to driving to Traverse City, Mich., for a long Fourth of July weekend. But as gasoline prices soared, the prospect of paying $2 or more a gallon for the 350-mile round trip lost its appeal. "It's too much to pay," said Mrs. Westrin, a travel agent.
Noble Small and his wife, Skip, a retired couple living in Ardmore, Okla., look forward to jumping into their Dodge pickup every August and pulling a trailer to California, then heading back home by way of Colorado. But they will omit California from their itinerary next month. For after estimating the cost of gasoline, Mr. Small, who before retiring owned a wholesale oil company, calculated that by taking the shorter trip they could save as much as $400. 
 In a summer in which 121.9 million American adults planned to take vacations, according to survey results released May 10 by the nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America and the AAA, the Westrins and the Smalls do not represent most adult Americans. But they are representative of an apparently large segment who are canceling or shortening their summer vacations because of gasoline prices that are sky-high. The $1.54 average cost of a gallon of gasoline in March was the highest since July 1981, when it was $1.38, according to the AAA. But by mid-June, after weeks of increases, the average price had risen to $1.65, up from $1 a gallon much of last summer.
At about the same time, regular unleaded gasoline rose above $2 a gallon in parts of Kansas, Michigan and Missouri, and into the $1.90's in Wisconsin and Illinois. In Chicago it climbed as high as $2.33. South Dakotans were paying almost $1.90 for unleaded regular in late June, and $2.03 for premium. Premium gasoline also topped $2 a gallon in Connecticut and Hawaii.
Resistance to rising gas prices should come as no surprise. In the joint Travel Industry Association-AAA survey, conducted in April when gasoline prices were rising but not yet out of sight, 46 percent of respondents (56.1 million adults) said that they would consider canceling summer travel plans if gas prices rose to $2 a gallon.
In a speech to the National Press Club on June 22, William S. Norman, the president of the Travel Industry Association, said that although travelers were worried about rising gas prices, the "average American family traveling by auto will spend only about five percent of its total vacation budget on gasoline." With the average length of a pleasure trip by car about 700 miles round trip, he said, the difference in fuel cost is about $13 -- about the cost of a large pizza at Domino's.
But motorists do not necessarily make such comparisons. "Gas prices tend to be a psychological barrier," said Jerry Cheske, who has monitored fuel prices for the AAA for 27 years.
A random sampling of desinations, including the Six Flags theme parks, the Jersey Shore and the nation's two most popular tourist sites, Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., found no appreciable falloff in visitors. Yet there are many indications that, like Noble and Skip Small, lots of travelers are economizing.
"We haven't had people tell us they won't be driving this summer, but plenty of them have said they're going to downsize," said John A. Craig, the owner of Pathfinder Travel Service in Olathe, Kan. "They say they don't plan to stay as long or go as far."
Aileen Vining, a travel agent in Joplin, Mo., said: "If there are only two or at the most three people traveling together, they'll give a lot of thought to flying, because gas prices are so high around here. But if it's a family of four or more, they'll likely drive or stay home, because there aren't many air-fare bargains this summer."
Not only are there few air-fare bargains; air fares have risen each of the past three months, jumping nearly 16 percent in June. Fuel prices played a big part, according to the Air Transport Association, the airline industry trade organization. It noted that aviation fuel skyrocketed to 77 cents a gallon in the first quarter of this year from 44 cents over the same period last year, and is likely to remain high for much of the rest of 2000. To offset that, seven major airlines imposed a $30 surtax in May on domestic round-trip tickets.
Priceline.com recently added gasoline to its growing list of items for which members can "name your own price," and other Internet companies are said to be working on plans that they say will lower fuel costs for drivers. In the meantime, analysts at Bear, Stearns & Company, J. P. Morgan and Banc of America Securities have warned that even increased oil output by the major producers is not likely to return gasoline prices to anywhere near normal before the end of summer.

But this year, a strong dollar means that even more students -- and a wider range of them -- are jetting abroad for the summer. With recent exchange rates in many countries better for Americans than they have been in more than a decade, students are realizing their dollars will go further, and colleges and groups that sponsor study abroad say they are seeing double-digit increases in the number of students traveling, especially to Europe. 
 Mary Dwyer, president of IES, a 50-year-old organization that runs programs for private and public colleges, said college students realize that "part of the experience is traveling around once you're there, going to dinner and museums, and they realize that they can afford more of that with the currency exchanges now than they could a few years ago."
Many students now track prices abroad on the Web, she said. "These are very intelligent, discerning consumers."
The euro has declined since it was introduced in January 1999, to a low of 88.5 cents to the dollar in May. (It was 95 cents in early July.) As a result, colleges and groups can offer lower prices on trips abroad, and out-of-pocket costs have gone down.
Enrollment in IES's summer programs is up 32 percent to 277 students this year. The Institute of International Education, which tracks overall patterns in study abroad, says enrollment was up 10 percent for the period from the fall of 1998 through the summer of 1999. Todd Davis, who tracks the numbers for the Institute, estimates that about 40,000 college students will be abroad this summer, 25,000 of them in Europe.
The increase in summer enrollment is particularly striking among public university students, who tend to be more price-conscious. For example, during the regular school year, 15 percent of the students who go abroad with IES are enrolled in public universities; in summer, that number jumps to 85 percent.
That may change, though. "Our students have always gone during the summer because it's all they could afford," said Diane Pecknold, who runs study-abroad programs for the University of Illinois at Chicago. "Now, they can afford to go for the semester."
A favorable exchange rate is not the only reason behind the increase. A strong economy in this country helps, too, as does a new notion of a well-rounded education.
"Included in that definition is a sojourn abroad, especially since the end of the Cold War," said Mr. Davis.
For the year overall, he said, 64 percent of students traveling will go to Europe, 6 percent to Asia. The biggest increases in recent years are in Latin America, which now draws 16 percent of those studying abroad.
As for whether a strong dollar is keeping foreign students from traveling to this country, Mr. Davis said apparently not. While those numbers dropped during the Asian currency crisis that began in 1997, they have now begun to rebound.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
A Horse Opera of a Different Sort

BYLINE: By PAUL GRIFFITHS

 BODY:
WHILE Louis Andriessen and Peter Greenaway's "Writing to Vermeer" plays at the New York State Theater beginning on Tuesday as part of the Lincoln Center Festival, the creators' first opera, "Rosa," of 1994 can also be heard, thanks to a new recording (Nonesuch 79559-2; two CD's). There, compensation for the lack of Mr. Greenaway's visual contribution comes in the cover design, featuring a typically energetic and economically brushed horse by Susan Rothenberg.
The image is suitable, for a horse is in some ways the central character of the opera (though, to be sure, it does not sing) and certainly the central symbol. Where, at one crucial point, a live black horse is meant to be lowered onto the stage, the music for the first time loses its smart, emphatic momentum to become a chain of quiet, foggy chords in high strings: one does not need to see the action to know that something ominous is going on. 
 Trapped on a treadmill, the horse is caught in a frame of work and dependence, just like the human characters. Esmeralda, the wife of the composer Juan Manuel de Rosa, was treated by him as an animal by her own account, which is all the opera provides, partly because Rosa is dead before the start of the action. But Rosa, too, was a victim, not only in having been shot but also, before that, in having had to write music for westerns.
Mr. Andriessen and Mr. Greenaway seem to view this as debasement for an artist, and the references Mr. Andriessen makes to movie music in the score are short and cheerless. He must also have been aware of being in the same position as Rosa, composing music to the orders of a film man, as those orders are represented by Mr. Greenaway's formal and unnerving libretto. But for him, the more irksome constraints are elsewhere. As in earlier works, Mr. Andriessen interprets the creative life in social terms, and skeptically. The artist in modern society is, like a workhorse, expected to produce an output steadily and in one direction. Hence the atmosphere of compulsion and resentment that pervades "Rosa," as it does many of Mr. Andriessen's works.
His music is as strongly pulsed, short-phrased and repetitive as Philip Glass's, but it comes out of a sourer and darker harmonic world, and like Kurt Weill's, it uses jazz-band sonorities to convey unease and decay. There is a sense of pacing or, more often, running in place: of being, indeed, on a treadmill. The opening orchestral music -- insistent and edgy, marked by a characteristic welding of saxophone and piano -- keeps rushing and unpredictably stopping, as if in search of an escape that will never be found.
When voices enter, the messages they deliver are at first bleak and disillusioning. Chorus and soloists spend a long time just describing the stage and explaining that it now represents the floor of a slaughterhouse. Gradually the speed of events quickens, right through the continuous two hours of the piece, though the music's speed, of fettered allegro, stays largely the same.
Gradually, too, elements of narrative are set in place, more or less securely. They are elements appropriate to an opera, elements of love and death. Rosa, a composer with a passion for horses and a job in the movies, has been shot while riding. Esmeralda comes from a family of slaughterhouse owners and has complained to her mother of Rosa's debasing behavior toward her. Various clues are presented, and various suspects, including Esmeralda's brothers. There is also an investigator or, as she is called, Investigatrix.
She comes to no definite solution, but the evidence points to a mysterious death by misadventure. Rosa was killed as he rode off into one of his own movies, where perhaps, as an artist, he had been dying all along.
The opera is dominated by two sopranos, who have to contribute a lot, by their sensuality and swing, to establish Mr. Andriessen's view of the opera house as another kind of nightclub, and who have to move through various other roles before they eventually become identified as Esmeralda and the Investigatrix. Both Marie Angel and Miranda van Kralingen meet the demands with vigor and enthusiasm. Lyndon Terracini sings the flashbacks for Rosa, who is rather pushed into a corner by these vocally well-endowed and self-confident women.
Reinbert de Leeuw conducts, as he will also do "Writing to Vermeer" at Lincoln Center. The players of the Asko Ensemble and the Schonberg Ensemble keep up tension through the long passages of similar, driving music and are excellent, too, in those rare sequences where the score becomes slow, refined and delicate.

HEADLINE: British Rail

 BODY:

To the Editor: Certainly the pros and cons of privatization of the British Rail network discussed in "Service Slips, Fares Baffle on British Trains" (Correspondent's Report, May 28) can be argued from political and economic standpoints. As someone involved before and after privatization, I too have my views. A few facts will show why overseas tourists in the hundreds of thousands use the British Rail network and why Britain's railways are in a period of strong growth:
Passenger numbers are up 30 percent in four years, and are now at a billion journeys a year. 
 Ninety-two percent of trains were within 10 minutes of scheduled arrival time for long distance, and within five minutes for local trains.
Seventy-six percent of the British market is satisfied with the rail journey, according to an April 2000 survey of 19,962 passengers.
Many of the travel options mentioned by Alan Cowell in his article are not meant for overseas visitors. He also mentions the simple answer: the unrestricted, economical BritRail Pass.
The variety of passes offered only to non-British residents simplifies travel planning. With a BritRail Pass you can book seats in advance or simply board the train and take a seat. The toll-free number in the United States is (877) 677-1066.

HEADLINE: Rem Koolhaas Builds

BYLINE: By Arthur Lubow; Arthur Lubow is a regular contributor who last wrote about Renata Adler. He is writing a book on the late singer-songwriter Nick Drake.

 BODY:
Before he could build, Rem Koolhaas wrote. Now that buildings of his design are cropping up everywhere, he continues to write. "In my own mind, I am as much a writer as an architect," he says.
An architect of Koolhaas's far-reaching ambition might plausibly prefer sitting at his desk to building in concrete. Remaining within the realm of his own imagination, he need not worry about pesky clients who can dilute a project into mediocrity. But, in fact, part of what Koolhaas likes about architecture is the chance to mesh gears with a client. When I asked him if he would consider designing a house for himself, he replied that the idea bored him. "It would feel too solipsistic," he said. "The whole point of architecture is the engagement with the other. So there wouldn't be any sparks." 
 Koolhaas, 55, is in the business of making sparks. Last month, at a meeting in his New York hotel room, I watched him review the mock-up of a book on shopping, which he produced with Harvard graduate students in a research seminar that he directs. (They meet about every three weeks.) The book had been redesigned since he last saw it. He was not happy. "It's so sedate now," he said as he rapidly turned the pages. "This was supposed to be something with real tension, a kind of schizophrenia where you say something and see another, and now it's too parallel and neat. It's lost an aggressive, invasive quality that it had in the beginning." He delivered all this talk of tension, invasion, aggression and schizophrenia in a polite monotone that barely rose above a murmur.
Koolhaas was an hour and a half late to the meeting, having been detained at a conference on modern architecture at the Guggenheim Museum, where he was a star speaker. "I couldn't sneak out early because they were discussing my work," he said apologetically. These days, Koolhaas's work seems to be constantly under discussion and, even more gratifying to him, under construction. Whereas in the past his cutting-edge designs rarely advanced beyond the model stage, Koolhaas's current commissions include a concert hall in Porto, Portugal; the Seattle Public Library; a student center on the Illinois Institute of Technology campus; three U.S. stores for Prada, the Italian fashion house; and the Dutch Embassy in Berlin. His office is also collaborating with the Basel firm of Herzog & de Meuron on a luxury hotel in downtown New York for Ian Schrager, whose holdings include the Mondrian in Los Angeles and the Delano in Miami.
Koolhaas is at the forefront of what has become arguably the most exciting branch of culture. The wild critical and commercial success of Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Bilbao has made it clear that in architecture, unlike any other art form, the critics' favorites are also the public's favorites. People are flocking to Bilbao to see the building, not its contents; in Berlin, Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum doesn't even have any contents -- the exhibits have not yet been installed -- but the powerful structure is drawing unanticipated throngs. Suddenly, every city wants its own knockout piece of modern architecture. Koolhaas recalls competing for the commission for a new museum of modern art in Rome. "The director said, 'We need a building that does for Rome what the Guggenheim did for Bilbao,"' he recounts. "That is a staggering statement, because Rome doesn't need to be put on the map."
Koolhaas, despite his professed admiration for Gehry, is uncomfortable with buildings that, like the Guggenheim Bilbao, seduce by dazzling. He wants to arrive at beauty as a byproduct, not the goal, of the design process. He is suspicious of the wow factor. "I like to do things that on first sight have a degree of simplicity but show their complexity in the way they are used or at second glance," he says. Although he is not a pop-culture celebrity on the order of Gehry, within his profession Koolhaas is the more influential figure -- because he writes as provocatively as he designs and because his innovative style, unlike Gehry's metallic whorls, has not solidified into a one-of-a-kind signature. "We are flamboyant conceptually, but not formally," Koolhaas says. His firm is known for thoroughly researching and radically addressing a client's needs; this cerebral approach to design undergirds all of his work.
"His intellectual view is a lot more accessible to younger architects coming out," Gehry says. "I look at my work as personal. I'm not trying to create a school." Of Koolhaas's intellect, Gehry says: "He's capable of challenging everything. He's one of the great thinkers of our time." Adding immeasurably to Koolhaas's reputation as a writer is his proven prowess as a builder. His volleys are coming from within the fortress. "When he says that design is not necessary or it's a value not to have it -- if he said all of that and I thought he was an apologist for his own inadequacies, that would be a fascinating position for some mad charlatan," Gehry says. "But it's not about that, because he can do it."
Koolhaas projects the calm of opposing forces held in balance. Although he is mobbed like a rock star at lectures, he disdains the auteur theory of architecture. "It is an insult to me, as well as to the others, to make it all seem like just my work," he says. "If I pride myself on one thing, it is a talent to collaborate." Conspicuously rejecting individual primacy, he gave his Rotterdam firm a blandly anonymous name, Office for Metropolitan Architecture (with the typically droll twist that the acronym OMA means "grandmother" in his native Dutch). This garb of humility, however, barely disguises his estimate of his own abilities. Indeed, if his denunciation of the cult of personality has only enhanced his own mystique, that is the sort of contradiction that he relishes.
Physically, he is a model of functionalism. He is thin, as if to reduce resistance. His aquiline nose, extended ears and penetrating eyes ensure that nothing can escape him. His long legs allow him to outpace the pack. But basically, his body is just a delivery system for his mind. Like Le Corbusier, Koolhaas has the double-barreled power to write brilliant, provocative essays and to design surprising and satisfying spaces. Young architects revere him -- in large part because he has refused to ossify or settle down. "At a certain point, certain architects begin to capitalize on their success, to kind of do it again, rather than look to new territory," says Terence Riley, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art. "I've never seen Rem attracted to that. Instead, there is an unbelievable willingness to keep the thing as a series of new questions. When kids go to a lecture by Rem, they come out with questions, not answers." Koolhaas energetically cultivates his renegade persona, not such an easy task as he attracts grander commissions and prizes. When he confided in March that he was about to be proclaimed the winner of architecture's highest honor, the Pritzker Prize, he relayed the news with a shrug that approached annoyance.
As behooves a superarchitect, Koolhaas travels as often as a supermodel. (He stays in hotels so often that he is excited to be involved in designing one himself: "It is the typology I have experienced most in my life.") His commissions are divided about equally between Europe and the United States. His life in Europe is also divided about equally between an airy apartment in North London, which he occupies mainly on weekends with his wife, the artist Madelon Vriesendorp, and a workweek centered on his Rotterdam office and often shared with his other female companion, Petra Blaisse, an Amsterdam-based designer of interiors and gardens. (He and Vriesendorp have a daughter, 23, and a son, 20.) Vriesendorp's quirky illustrations grace Koolhaas's first book, "Delirious New York," while Blaisse has long held chief responsibility for Koolhaas's curtains, landscaping and exhibition installations. For the Netherlands Dance Theater, constructed in The Hague in 1984, Blaisse did the interiors while Vriesendorp designed an exterior mural.
"Part of the whole thing in London is it's a place away from the office, so I'm protected from the daily invasion," Koolhaas says. "I can do nothing." In the London flat, Vriesendorp's ebullience is on view everywhere -- for example, in a fish motif that recurs on the shower curtain, on the tablecloth and in a puppet that is sailing through the kitchen-door transom -- everywhere, that is, except for Koolhaas's spare, white, book-lined, high-ceilinged studio.
When asked about his domestic equipoise between Vriesendorp and Blaisse, Koolhaas slips into the counterbalanced syntax that distinguishes Rem-speak: "It's all about facets and a kind of extension of territory, not in terms of claiming but in terms of exploration." Refusing to be tied down to one place or person is also a way of defying gravity. Just as he does in his architecture, Koolhaas welcomes tension into the structure of his life. Other people adjust. "I always feel that he is a plug and the whole world is full of sockets," says Vriesendorp, a striking-looking woman with silver hair, sharp blue eyes -- and a talent for blunt metaphors. "He has chosen different sockets in different worlds. It will always be sensitive, because there will always be competition between different sockets. Everything in his life that seems functional gets everyone around him in hysterics." Koolhaas has manufactured a form for his life that radically rethinks convention to accommodate his requirements. The stress lines are visible. And that sums up both his design for living and his design philosophy.
The OMA office occupies the top floor of an undistinguished eight-story building and affords broad views of the banal postwar cityscape of Rotterdam. It is a large room with a few glassed-off enclosures (including one for Koolhaas), all abuzz with multifocal activity. Different teams are working on separate projects, so that OMA at first seems completely decentralized. However, when Koolhaas walks through the office, you can feel the young architects (typically, men with shaved heads and black sweaters) shift slightly in response to his presence, like flowers to the sun. Koolhaas prefers another metaphor to describe his role at OMA. "It's more a kind of lamination, a bonding between layers," he says. The OMA architects appear to adore him, but also to fear him -- knowing from experience that this lamination can scorch. One morning I witnessed Koolhaas unleash an angry dressing-down in Dutch (rather than the office lingua franca, English) that made the young man who was its object whiten in shock.
Amid the hubbub, Koolhaas has the impressive capacity to blinker out distractions, including the project that he has just been reviewing, and concentrate on the next question. "No glass," he said to one architect who came up to him for advice on a parking garage. "It has to be superradical and brutal, from beginning to end." ("Brutal" is one of his favorite words of praise. On the subject of his current Harvard research seminar, the chaotic urban development of Lagos, Nigeria, he says, "What I thought would be depressing was incredibly powerful, inspiring and brutal.") He likes to push in all directions and to keep everything tentative. "Here you have this earthquake factor, everything can change at the last minute," says Markus Schaefer, a young OMA architect. "You struggle, and maybe an unexpected beauty happens." Instead of working with wooden architectural models, as is usually done, the OMA staff whittles plastic foam, quickly cutting, discarding and recutting.
In late March, on the day after Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron visited OMA from Basel for an all-day meeting on Schrager's Manhattan hotel (which will face Cooper Union on Astor Place), a team composed of architects from the two offices was trying to incorporate the collective ideas. One model that the young team proposed at the meeting was of a fairly standard orthogonal tower distinguished by an amoeboid-shaped atrium. "What if you reverse it?" Koolhaas asked suddenly. "Invert it like a sock, and make the outside soft and the inside hard?" Using yellow insulation foam, the group began pulling its tower inside out, trying to translate Koolhaas's koan-like insight into a building model.
Apart from his goading of this particular project, the collaboration with Herzog & de Meuron is in itself an example of how Koolhaas likes to turn the status quo inside out. Schrager had proposed an orthodox architectural competition to determine who would design his latest boutique hotel. Competitions are the bane of a modern architect's existence. Koolhaas returns to the subject repeatedly, like a dog scratching a flea. One afternoon in Milan, I accompanied him on a call he was paying on the architect Giancarlo De Carlo, who, now in his 80's, has had a long, distinguished career.
"How many of your buildings have been realized?" Koolhaas asked.
"Not many," De Carlo said. "Maybe 15 percent."
"Better than me," Koolhaas said. "Ten percent."
De Carlo smiled and said he had been boasting. It was more like 10 percent for him too.
"Now I think it doesn't matter," Koolhaas said. "You do architecture, and whether or not it is realized, it maybe doesn't matter. And with the nature of media today, perhaps you cannot always tell."
Part of Koolhaas believes that, but another part of him ferociously wants his projects to be built. Faced with the offer from Schrager, he had the inspiration of asking Herzog, a rival invitee, to join forces. "We've run against them four times, and each time they've won," Koolhaas says. By combining two of the hottest architectural firms in the world today, the Rotterdam-Basel alliance pre-empted a competition.
Koolhaas speaks ruefully of the weak position in which even the most successful architects find themselves. "It's an interesting topic, the economics of architecture," he says. "You can never say no, because there is someone behind you who will say yes. You can never discuss fees, because there is always someone ready to undercut you." Beyond the professional jockeying lies a larger imbalance. "The architect is completely passive, because his intelligence is only triggered by demands that he doesn't initiate himself," says Koolhaas, who gabs the way I imagine Hegel did -- dialectically. "You must negotiate in terms of your own preoccupations through a field that is defined by the demands of others. It's only satisfying if everything changes because you engage it, and through your own engagement you put the same ideology and values to work on a new set of problems."
Having insisted in various essays on the need of the architect to impose his personality on a project, Koolhaas now wants to expand on this idea. Much of the appeal of the joint effort with Herzog & de Meuron is the opportunity to impose two sets of values simultaneously. Renowned for classically Modernist buildings clad in beautiful "skins," Herzog & de Meuron could be regarded as the antithesis of OMA. This, for Koolhaas, was a compelling reason to collaborate. "We want to see if we can combine with two focuses and generate a third one," he says. "A literal thing where a skin becomes a volume." (That was his motive behind inverting the model with the atrium: suddenly, the skin defined the space within the building. Not that this structure will be going up in lower Manhattan. "We gave up on it, but it's a beautiful metaphor for the process," Koolhaas says, adding that they are now developing a design with "a comparable fusion.") To the ever-present tension between architect and client, he can now add a cultural divide between architectural firms, all in the interest of creative instability.
As unorthodox as it is to team up with a rival, Koolhaas has concocted a still more radical solution to the difficulty of getting projects built: don't even try. He loves the part of design that is devoted to research, and before beginning a major project, he usually persuades his client to underwrite an "investigation." As a prelude to working on the Seattle Public Library, he conducted a three-month study, traveling to check out libraries in Europe and the United States, then producing a book that includes, as he puts it, "everything from first impressions to analysis of what is wrong with libraries." His office performed a similar task for Prada, analyzing such problems as "how you can manage expansion without losing aura." For both these clients, he then progressed to design buildings; however, had he not, he would still have performed a useful (and billable) function as a strategic consultant. Koolhaas likes to see all of this activity as the practice of "architecture in virtual reality" -- and he has started a parallel office, with the mirror-image name of AMO, to pursue it.
This is a new solution to an old problem. In the years that followed its founding in 1975, OMA never got to build. It was the perpetual runner-up in competitions. OMA was a four-person partnership -- of Koolhaas; his wife, Vriesendorp; Elia Zenghelis, who had taught Koolhaas at the Architectural Association School in London; and his wife, Zoe Zenghelis. When the firm did eventually win a major commission in Holland, Koolhaas in 1981 moved headquarters, without the Zenghelises, from London to Rotterdam.
In 1978, Koolhaas made his reputation not with a building but with a book, "Delirious New York," which ingeniously posed as a "retroactive manifesto" for Manhattan architecture. In it, he declared that the city's unique physiognomy resulted from a few factors. Because Manhattan was laid out on a grid, the base of each development could not exceed the size of a rectangular plot. The growth that was thwarted horizontally was permitted, by the invention of the elevator, to sprout upward as the skyscraper. No matter how flamboyant their facades might be, these skyscrapers were at their core generic: each was divided horizontally into autonomous and interchangeable floors, which were unconnected to the formal skin of the tower. And so you had Manhattan: an "archipelago" of island-towers, in which individual buildings and floors could change without affecting the overall stability of the system. Koolhaas told this story in a brashly prophetic style. He generously fleshed out his theoretical skeleton with illustrations executed by Vriesendorp, and a treasure-trove of historical bric-a-brac -- the section on Coney Island is riveting -- that they collected during a five-year sojourn in America. (Koolhaas had won a two-year fellowship. They liked the United States so much that they stayed for five.) Unconventional researchers, they specialized in old postcards, which they tracked down avidly. "When you look for something, you are bound to find something that fits your theory," Vriesendorp says. "He had the theory and fit all the material to the theory."
Architects loved the book. "The writing of 'Delirious New York' was famous before Rem's architecture, and it was better than his architecture," says the British architect and critic Charles Jencks. "His architecture has caught up with it." Aside from its intrinsic panache, the book signaled some of the concerns that would mark Koolhaas's work in the coming years -- from his interest in the generic and the ready-made to his fascination with large-scale planning and building.
Over the next decade, OMA produced a number of thrillingly innovative competition entries that came frustratingly close to realization -- the worst is when you almost win," Vriesendorp says -- and supported itself with the help of an urban development project in Amsterdam. Koolhaas also got to design a few idiosyncratic buildings that were actually built. I visited one of these early works, the Villa Dall'Ava on the outskirts of Paris. The house is carefully responsive to its site, yet with its corrugated aluminum and glass, pointedly stands out from the neighboring traditional turn-of-the-century houses. The client -- Dominique Boudet, an architecture magazine editor -- wanted a modern glass house with a swimming pool on top. Eager to commission a masterpiece, Boudet decided in 1984 that Koolhaas (who had not yet completed a structure) was the architect most likely to create one. "I sent him a flowery letter saying why I wanted him to design my house," he recalls. "He sent me back a telegram: 'Yes, I am interested. Phone me.' I wrote a very romantic letter, and he sent me a very short telegram. Very Rem-like."
For Boudet and his wife, Koolhaas sat a glass box on the middle third of the narrow, sloping site, and over it he cantilevered two wings -- one for the parents, the other for the daughter (who was too old to live there by the time the house, stalled by lawsuits brought by angry neighbors, finally went up). The swimming pool that extends between the two wings enjoys a magical view of the Eiffel Tower, which Koolhaas, in a nose-thumbing gesture, marred with a piece of orange plastic fencing. The design bluntly mixes luxe and demode materials; in the small dining room, there is wood, plastic, concrete, plasterboard and glass. In the Villa Dall'Ava, as in all of Koolhaas's buildings that I visited, there is a discomfort level, supplied, in this case, by narrow passageways and a clanging metal staircase. Koolhaas has a greater tolerance for the ungainly and the unsightly than I do.
The rude also cohabits proudly with the refined in Koolhaas's career-changing project, Euralille, a development that surrounds the Eurostar train station in Lille, France. When it was awarded in 1988, the Euralille commission was on a level entirely new to OMA. A huge planning project that immersed the firm in road mapping and office-tower placement, Euralille is a self-contained city: a thoroughly modern city, with a shopping mall, a hotel, some offices (including a handsome tower by Christian de Portzamparc) and a dizzying interchange of roads and tracks. In addition to the master plan, OMA designed the convention center, Congrexpo. In its trade-show facilities, Congrexpo is uncompromisingly brutal and functional: one wooden skylight in the expo hall highlights the raw concrete of the space. Yet the conference and seminar rooms are surprisingly handsome, their beauty all the greater for having been achieved on a very low budget -- for instance, with a corrugated plastic ceiling and an exposed insulation wall in the large auditorium.
Koolhaas's ostentatious frugality is very Dutch. Similarly, his transparent glass boxes recall the Dutch habit of leaving living rooms undraped -- not, as in a Mies glass house, so that the inhabitants can look out but so that passers-by may look in. And at Villa Dall'Ava, the slanted pillars that support one cantilevered wing resemble the birch woods in Holland's countryside.
Whatever its Dutch inflections, however, Euralille is mainly big, and OMA grew to handle it, tripling in staff until it employed about 60. At the same time, in the late 1980's, the office was entering big competitions. "In the pre-'95 period of the firm, we nearly bankrupted ourselves by participating in important competitions that were open to everyone, or competitions where we were only partly paid," Koolhaas says. "They are life-threatening, but the only potential source of future life." Koolhaas says that the firm was entering about five competitions a year, spending close to $500,000 at a time when OMA's entire annual income was about $2 million. The firm made back some of the money by selling architectural drawings and models.
At last, in 1989, Koolhaas won a major commission, for a center for art and media technology in Karlsruhe, Germany. The project galvanized his imagination. And then those unpredictable forces that buffet the architectural economy swept through OMA. In the final hours, the city fathers of Karslruhe backed off from their audacious building, which, years in advance of the new Times Square, featured a facade that was a projection screen. Karlsruhe having sneezed, OMA caught cold. "At one point, everything collapsed," Vriesendorp says. "Like Karlsruhe -- that was one of his most brilliant buildings. He was really in mourning over that. He was down to designing doorknobs when they stopped it. It was like when you cut off a leg and you still have an itch. It's very hard to stop thinking about it." Along with Koolhaas's deep disappointment came financial embarrassment. "He had to fire everyone almost, there was no money and incredible debts," Vriesendorp says. When Koolhaas tells the story more laconically, he uses his hands to suggest an inflated balloon, then mimics the contraction as the air goes out. The office shrank back to 24 people. "But he doesn't let himself stay depressed," Vriesendorp says. "He immediately throws himself into the next thing." A Dutch engineering company acquired half of OMA and paid off the debts. Koolhaas looked for something new to do.
It was time to write another book. Working with the graphic designer Bruce Mau, he composed a weighty (six pounds) record of his architectural projects, memorializing the unbuilt along with the constructed and categorizing them by size. He included essays he had written as well as buildings he had designed. A long list of quirky quotations, assembled by the book's editor, Jennifer Sigler, runs down the left-side margin. The book, titled "S, M, L, XL," is a ramble through Koolhaas's mind. The elements are in a state of visual and textual collision, and the real and the virtual are given equal importance. Like a three-ring circus, there is more than you can take in. "I have always had a psychological thing of wanting to recreate or destroy," Koolhaas says. "The book was an initial way of examining what we are doing and have been doing. It was also a deliberate suspension of the office to make a new beginning."
Koolhaas resists biographical explanations. "He loves pictures that don't look like him," Vriesendorp says. "I'll say, 'That photo doesn't look at all like you.' He'll say, 'Yeah, I like that one.' I think he's terrified that anyone will know what he's really like."
He was born in Holland at the close of World War II, the eldest of three children, and his sensibility was first marked by that vista of destruction. "Ruins everywhere and really poor," he says. His father, Anton Koolhaas, edited a leftist newspaper that supported the Indonesian struggle for independence. When that cause prevailed, the elder Koolhaas was one of the few Dutchmen welcome in the new state. He took a position as the director of a cultural institute, moving his family there when Rem was 8. They stayed for four years.
If you are looking for the point where radical oppositions and discontinuities entered Koolhaas's consciousness, postindependence Jakarta may be the place to start. The city was divided geographically and psychologically into remnants of the highly structured colonial past and eddies of the chaotic present. "It was a strange coexistence between very ordered sections and disordered sections," he says. "That is the source of a kind of fundamental division of loyalties or stretch of extremes in my work." As unfamiliar as Indonesia was, Holland when he returned was even weirder. "It had gone from postwar suddenly to reconstructed neatness," he says disapprovingly.
Because Koolhaas's maternal grandfather was an architect, the profession always hovered as a possibility. In his youth, however, he worked as a reporter for an Amsterdam weekly. At the same time, he consorted with a theory-laden band of young film devotees and considered a career in the movies. (Jan De Bont, the director of "Speed," became the best-known moviemaker of that group.) Koolhaas dates his professional conversion to a speech on the movies that, at age 24, he gave at the behest of a friend who was studying architecture at the University of Delft. As he was talking about movies to a crowd of architects, Koolhaas says, he realized that he wanted to switch places with his audience. He wanted to build.
Typically, when I asked him about choosing between cinema and architecture, he replied that the two fields are more alike than they are different. "You are considering episodes, and you have to construct the episodes in a way that is interesting and makes sense or is mysterious," he said. "It's about montage also -- whether it's making a book, a film or a building." Whatever the general similarities between the disciplines, it is more interesting to observe that Koolhaas practices architecture in the spirit in which a director makes a film. "It's very scripted, the way people move and the possibilities he leaves for people in his buildings," Vriesendorp points out. "The experiences are laid out. You go up and you have to look where you're meant to look. He sees a space and he sees what could happen -- a scene in a space."
Architecture was the right profession for Koolhaas. Because it is fundamentally concerned with stability, the discipline gave him something to push against -- hard. "All the work I do with Rem is on the edge," says Cecil Balmond, a director at the London-based engineering firm, Ove Arup, who has been collaborating with Koolhaas for 15 years. For the Jussieu Library at the University of Paris, one of OMA's most influential unbuilt projects, Balmond helped Koolhaas design floors that warped until they became continuous without ever losing their separateness (that is, without merging into a spiral ramp, like Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum in New York). In another unbuilt Paris project, the Parc de la Villette, he essentially laid a skyscraper, with its interchangeable generic levels, on its side, dividing the park into bands that could be adapted to different programs as its use changed over time. For a third unrealized Paris scheme, the Tr<heart>s Grande Biblioth<heart>que, Koolhaas proposed an enormous glass block of horizontal storage layers in which public spaces were suspended like blobs, accessed by nine banks of elevators. These plans were so bracingly intelligent that you could feel them redefining what is a park, what is a library.
When OMA fell apart financially, Koolhaas embarked on a course of personal redefinition, seeking, he says, "a replenishment of themes and issues." A crucial step was accepting a teaching position at Harvard in 1995, on condition that he would not have to teach design. Instead, he would direct one small graduate seminar a year on a subject about which he wished to learn more himself. As the first topic, he chose to examine the Pearl River Delta in China, which includes Hong Kong and the area to its north. To say that the region is rapidly urbanizing is a gross understatement: it will triple in population, to 36 million people, in the next 20 years. This building explosion is occurring with only the fleeting supervision of architects. "The Chinese architect is 10 times as rare, 10 times more badly paid and produces 10 times as much as the European architect," Koolhaas says. That the architecture could be critically dismissed did not incline Koolhaas to dismiss it. "I have, as opposed to a love for architecture, an unconditional love for the city," he says.
Even people who could forgive Koolhaas's nonjudgmental examination of the hypertrophy in the Pearl River Delta raised their eyebrows at the subject of his next seminar: shopping. "Shopping is surreptitiously becoming the way in which urban substance is generated," he says. He has compiled figures on the square footage of real estate devoted to shopping, categorized per capita by nation: the United States leads the list, with 31 square feet per person. But the sheer bulk of it is only part of the story. "Shopping has infiltrated every category of building -- churchgoing, education, transport," he says. He notes that when shopping, like a stealthy virus, insinuates itself into another slice of life, sales per square foot increase markedly. The gift shop at the Museum of Modern Art does far better business than stores in a mall -- probably because shopping has been redefined as cultural entertainment. Shopping at London's Heathrow airport does 10 times the average mall's business, preying on captive customers who have been lured early to a territory in which there is nothing else to do. Koolhaas, whose political leanings are progressive, nonetheless seems quite happy working within the capitalist system, analyzing and refining it. "He doesn't have a spiritual agenda, ecological agenda or cosmic agenda," says Charles Jencks, who adds: "It must be hard being Rem. He knows what's going on. He has a heart. But he decided to put that on ice."
In the way that in "Delirious New York" he examined the technological innovations that made the growth of Manhattan possible, Koolhaas directed his students to investigate the mechanical necessities that shoppers take for granted. The escalator, for example, first appeared in world's fairs in the late 19th century; then it was adopted by the department stores that were being developed at the same time. Harrods took the lead in 1895. "The moment that the escalator arose is when consumerism took off," says Sze Tsung Leong, who was one of Koolhaas's students and is now helping prepare books on the Pearl River Delta and shopping, scheduled for publication at the end of the year. The shopping industry continues to pursue technological advances, and Koolhaas has encouraged his students to investigate topics like fake trees, which shopping-mall developers install to bamboozle shoppers alienated by man-made spaces.
It was his casting of a fresh eye on shopping that brought Koolhaas to the attention of Miuccia Prada. By the time the fashion designer called last year, OMA was humming again. It had won a coveted commission to build a headquarters for Universal Studios in Los Angeles. (The project is stalled, waiting for Universal's management to stabilize.) The Dutch government had accepted an OMA design for a new national airport built on a man-made island, one that would function as a self-contained city for global travelers. (This gargantuan scheme is advancing slowly and uncertainly through a political obstacle course.) OMA was also proceeding with a student center at the Illinois Institute of Technology, which ingeniously fragmented the building block along pre-existing paths that people used to cross the campus.
Only in the last couple of years has OMA been able to rely on architectural design, along with urban planning, as a primary source of income. It has reached a point where it is able to negotiate a fixed fee, based on the number of work hours required, instead of exacting a percentage of the total building cost (in Europe, conventionally 4 to 9 percent). OMA now employs 90 architects. In the last year, for the first time, the firm generated enough profit so that some could be distributed to the principals. A lot is going on. Yet it is the Prada work that appears to be closest to Koolhaas's heart these days. In part, it is the potential scope of the relationship, in which he can not only design three buildings but also help to midwife Prada's Web site and rethink the conventions of shopping. He is excited about combining work for a client in both the virtual and actual realms. He is also not immune to the allure of fashion.
I got into Koolhaas's metallic gray Peugeot coupe this spring for a very fast drive to Schiphol Airport. He was off to yet another speaking engagement, one which Miuccia Prada would be attending. I observed that he was wearing the unmistakable blunt-toed Prada loafers and what could have been an entire Prada outfit. I asked. He denied it.
"It would be too craven to be completely Pradified," he said.
Later, when he removed his long brown coat, I discreetly checked the label. Prada.
OMA and its virtual twin, AMO, are rethinking Prada. The same Harvard-trained team that is shepherding the China and shopping books into publication is also pondering what purpose the Prada Web site should serve. "We're in a very luxurious position with AMO," says Jeffrey Inaba, who coordinates Koolhaas's Harvard course. "It's like a think tank, really. What should this thing be? What are its possibilities? Why would some avenues have more potential than others?"
Lest all this theory seem too airy, consider the Prada store that is under construction in downtown Manhattan. "SoHo is perhaps the most dramatic territory to document the changes in the city," Koolhaas says. "Ten years ago, this entire domain was a cultural domain or an industrial domain, and now virtually every ground floor is commercial space." Capitalizing on the insight that people spend more money in spaces that are not seen as purely commercial, Koolhaas has designed the Prada store in New York to be adaptable to cultural performances. Most of the garments on display will be in movable overhead towers that can be pushed to the back of the store. A sine-curve ramp that cleverly divides the space into two levels and ordinarily displays shoes can be converted into seating. A stage flips out of the upswing end of the undulating ramp. Voil! A clothing store has become a theater.
True to its all-encompassing mission, OMA is reformulating not only the space in which you shop but also the way in which you shop. The office team compiled a list of the annoyances in shopping and devised many clever improvements. The dressing room, like the escalator, has not been updated since its invention -- and it could use updating. Why should you swelter when trying on a winter coat? The Prada dressing rooms will provide microclimates. Why should you have to put on your shoes and leave the dressing room, all so that your companion can assess whether you look like a complete fool in that bathing suit? The glass door on the changing room will adjust in transparency. Do you want to try on the blouse in a different size or color? You will be able to communicate directly with the inventory room via telephone. How can you judge whether that skirt makes your rear end look enormous? A video camera, linked to a plasma screen beneath the surface of the mirror, will present all sides of you in real time if you turn slowly, with a delay if you move fast.
Once you think about it, it seems obvious.
Nowhere is Koolhaas's sensibility expressed more beautifully than in the house he completed two years ago in Bordeaux for a newspaper publisher, his wife and three children. In the early 90's, the husband had been in an automobile accident that left him paralyzed. The family wanted an architect who could accommodate the husband's requirements. "We really needed to have someone that it would be easy to talk to about all these very intimate details, like the shower, that my husband had to face," says the wife. At the same time, they wanted a house for the whole family. "It's a combination of two lives -- his life and our regular ordinary lives," the wife says. "We wanted a house where my husband is free, but not a house for disabled people." The site, on a hillside overlooking the French city, was also hampered by a web of restrictions: the house could only be nine meters high, it had to be surfaced with local materials and so on. Despite these constraints, Koolhaas eagerly took on the project. "For Rem, the more difficulties you give him, the better he is," the wife says.
When Koolhaas speaks, in the way that he speaks, about the need "to negotiate in terms of your own preoccupations through a field that is defined by the demands of others," you might wonder what, if anything, he means. The design process for the house in Bordeaux illustrates what he means.
Preoccupation 1: Horizontal layering. The architect designed a house that is a sandwich. Below, partly buried into the hillside, is a concrete kitchen and a wine cellar. Above is a massive concrete box divided into separate wings -- one for the parents, one for the children. Between is a living area that is bounded entirely in glass, a void above which the bulk of the house floats. Passing through these layers is a circular platform at the core of the house that moves up and down on a piston. It is a levitating study that allows the husband to go from his bedroom level to the wine cellar without leaving his desk. Near the desk is a wall of shelves; by raising and lowering the platform, the husband can reach his books with ease.
Preoccupation 2: Scripting the space. The upstairs concrete box affords a view of Bordeaux through portholes. "We didn't want a panoramic view over the city, but something more intimate," the wife says. The portholes were placed very precisely. For instance, an OMA team measured the height of the wife's eyes when she was standing, sitting or lying in bed. Other drawings calculated her line of vision from the bathtub. The portholes dictate what she sees.
Preoccupation 3: An insistence on instability. In the Bordeaux house, a mirrored cylinder contains a staircase for the wife and children to move between floors. The cylinder is also a column that helps to support the upper level. Had it been placed in the center of the house, the engineering would have been relatively simple. But Koolhaas wanted asymmetry. Accordingly, his engineer, Cecil Balmond, tied a cable to the house's overhead beam, which rests on the cylinder and from which the upper floor is in part suspended; he then attached a counterweight to the other end of the cable to compensate for the asymmetrical placement of the beam. When Koolhaas heard the idea, he was thrilled. "Rem said: 'Great! Let's have a boulder to accentuate the instability,"' Balmond recalls. "I said, 'No way."' Leaving the counterweight as a boulder above ground would be dangerous. But even as it is now -- sunk deep into the earth -- the cable evokes, in a poignantly apposite place, Koolhaas's constant theme: instability is inescapable; contain it, don't conceal it.
Ever mindful of uncertainty, Koolhaas is perpetually trying to exercise control. "The moment he gets up, he rings everyone to see if they are all in place, all the chess pieces," Vriesendorp says. "He rings, 'Is everything O.K.?' And then I say, 'Rem, let me ask you something.' And he says: 'I can't talk now. I'm in a meeting,' or 'I'm in a taxi."'
Because he spends so much time traveling, Koolhaas holds on to what continuity he can. He will stay in the same hotel each time he returns to a city. He determinedly finds a swimming pool wherever he lands. He once swam in seven different pools -- from Lagos to Basel to Milan to Bordeaux -- in one week.
With the newfound commercial success, the demands on his time have become staggering. "I don't have a mobile" -- phone -- because I would be completely at their mercy," he says. But like a reformed smoker, he will bum one from companions.
It was hard for me to imagine him in a relaxed mode, yet he assures me that he has that dial on his control panel. "I can be on the beach for two weeks with no problem," he says. "I can go completely nothing."
Last year, he was forced to "go completely nothing" after he underwent 15 vaccinations in preparation for a visit to Lagos. "The 14th injection went wrong and I developed meningitis and almost died," he says. "It completely changed my character. For a period of eight-months' recovery, I became a peaceful observer with a contemplation of architecture." And the end result of this meditative respite? He grew "very invigorated but very intolerant of any delay," he says. He fired a client who kept posing new objections to a residential commission. He rushed into the Porto music-center project, which has a punishingly short deadline. In short, he worked even harder.
He is not driven by materialist ambition. After a lecture he gave in Milan, a student asked why he hasn't designed prototypes for consumer products. "I'm a hopelessly uncommercial person," he replied. "It's not my interest to become rich. It's my interest to have an interesting life." He has an international group of friends -- museum directors, graphic designers, journalists, philosophers. They provide him with information, which does not go to waste. "Everything he knows, he uses," Vriesendorp says. When you talk to him, he emanates the calm of a frog at the edge of a pond. If you say something that intrigues or amuses him, he grins slightly, signifying -- as with the flick of a frog's tongue -- that he has assimilated it.
He has been thinking recently about filmmaking. "For a very long time I was never interested in making film myself again," he says. "But being in Lagos has made me want to document it in a way that is more movielike than you could do in a book. It's a really curious city. If you take photographs, you almost never capture what is going on."
At times, he gives the impression that he has taken up architecture in the way that Michelangelo or Raphael or Jefferson did: not as a primary vocation, but as an intellectual and humanistic challenge to undertake before moving on to something else. With the possibilities created by new technology, architecture has recently become more compelling for him. "There is an extremely new domain being constructed, which partly undermines architecture or eliminates the reason for being of architecture -- the electronic domain," he says. "Now is an existential moment for a discipline that will decide whether it will be a dinosaur or whether it will be reinvented." It is this passion for upending tradition, more than architecture itself, that keeps Koolhaas engaged. He loves to rethink dinosaurs. Reinvention is his calling.

Still Here and Kicking Tires at 80

BYLINE: By LYNNE AMES

 BODY:
BERNARD F. CURRY JR. of Scarsdale loves a good party. The chairman of CurryCorp Auto Group recently celebrated his 80th birthday with 80 -- the number was no coincidence -- family members and friends at the restaurant Le Cirque 2000 in Manhattan.
The guests included former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a personal friend of Mr. Curry's son-in-law, William O'Shaughnessy, owner of WVOX and WRTN radio stations in New Rochelle and something of a celebrity in his own right. Among those extending birthday wishes were Andrew P. O'Rourke, former county executive and now judge of the New York State Court of Claims, and Sirio Maccione, owner of Le Cirque, and his wife, Egidiana, who were in the pleasant position of being party guests at their own establishment. And from Madison Avenue came a hand-delivered note from Archbishop Edward M. Egan, the first official letter he had written as archbishop of New York. 
 But fun and celebrities are something that Mr. Curry can dispense with in a minute when he has to; in fact, he is an admitted workaholic. At 80, he still goes in every day to his office on Central Avenue, across the street from his flagship dealership, Curry Chevrolet. His company, which includes eight dealerships in Yorktown and Scarsdale and one in Atlanta, had sales of $280 million last year, selling 10,500 cars and trucks. It is one of the last remaining independent, privately owned auto groups in the United States, he said.
Ask about his success, and the answer is almost terse.
"Hard work," he said. "Just a lot of hard work. I'm up every day at 6 a.m. and make the one-minute commute from my house and go to my office. I don't know what else I would do with my time."
The automobile business is part of Mr. Curry's pedigree. He was born in Washington Heights, where his father, Bernard F. Curry, owned a dealership. In 1928, when he was 8, the family moved to the Tudor-style house on Inverness Road in Edgemont that he still lives in. Sundays, he recalled, everyone would get into the car and go for a drive on the Bronx River Parkway.
By the late 1930's, weekends also meant visits from a customer who had become a family friend: "My father and I played golf with Babe Ruth. That was kind of neat."
From the time Bernard F. Curry Jr. was old enough to work, he did, beginning as a mechanic's helper. After high school he went to Dartmouth, where he majored in economics; during summer and winter breaks, he could be found working at one of the dealerships his father opened in Westchester.
"I always assumed I'd go into the family business," he said. He began selling in 1949 and in 1955 he opened a dealership of his own, Curry Chevrolet on Central Avenue. He sold coupes and sedans that retailed new for about $1,200.
By 1980, the company had expanded to include Honda vehicles as well as Chevrolets. "The Americans were building cars that just did not step to it," he said. "But the Japanese were doing a bang-up job." American cars, however, have now improved, he conceded: he drives a 1994 eight-cylinder Cadillac Brougham.
When he wasn't working, Mr. Curry played golf almost obsessively and became a member of Winged Foot Golf Club of Mamaroneck. He learned to ski and bought a home in Sun Valley, Idaho, where he still skis and does skeet shooting. He also became a licensed jet pilot, flying his own private plane until 10 years ago, when deteriorating eyesight grounded him.
"If I couldn't do something well, I didn't want to do it," he said. "If I wanted something, I dogged it to death till I got it."
Mr. Curry, who is divorced, raised six children: Nancy Curry O'Shaughnessy of New Rochelle, Robin Bernacchia of Yonkers, Leigh Young of Mount Kisco, Diane Trimper of Palm Beach, Fla., Barbara Curry James of St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, and Bernard Curry III of Rye.
At the birthday celebration, they exuded the same kind of physically fit, sun-tanned self-confidence as their father, and they spoke of him with obvious pride. "He taught us to ski, swim, to do anything; he was very strict, but loving," Ms. Bernacchia said.
Ms. O'Shaughnessy added: "He is a great golfer, skier, businessman. At business, it was all business, no fooling around. He taught us, Don't expect anything. You have to work for everything."
Mr. Curry himself, however, he was clearly enjoying the party, the lobster salad, the fillet of sea bass, the rack of lamb, the hot chocolate souffle and the dark chocolate birthday cake, the vintage wines and the Champagne toasts raised in his honor. He liked going from table to table, greeting friends, family and business associates. But when people asked him, "How are you doing?" he merely laughed and replied, "I'm still above ground, so that's pretty good."

HEADLINE: A Place of Their Own, With a Difference

BYLINE: By NANCY DONIGER

 BODY:
JOSEPHINE BOJNOWSKI, 83, surveys her small but cheerful apartment at Lockwood Lodge, an assisted living center associated with Ashlar of Newtown, and smiles at the place she has called home for the past year.
Ms. Bojnowski, a former teacher and reading supervisor for the Newington school system, lived alone in a single-family house after her husband died but she could no longer manage after breaking her leg. "There were too many stairs," she said. "I needed a place that served food and provided assistance." 
 Ms. Bojnowski reflects a growing number of elderly Americans who need help with some of the activities of daily living but otherwise want to retain their independence.
Assisted living is the fastest growing residential alternative for elderly people with incomes high enough to support the monthly fees, averaging $2,500 or more, since Medicare does not cover assisted-living expenses.
Assisted living is defined as a living arrangement in which residents buy or rent their own apartment, where they live independently with medical and housekeeping assistance. They receive three meals a day in a common dining room and share many common areas with other residents. There also is a nurse on call 24 hours a day.
The adoption of assisted living regulations by the Connecticut Legislature in November 1994 paved the way for growth, according to industry officials. Since the regulations were adopted, 70 assisted-living service centers have been licensed in the state.
Colonel John Kulp, 86, who retired from the United States Army, chose Lockwood Lodge because of its attractive ambience, services and proximity to his daughter in Redding.
"It's bigger than Thoreau's cabin at Walden Pond," he said about his one-bedroom apartment. "I would rather be climbing the Alps, or out running around, but I decided to move here when I began to have trouble with my vision. I need someone to look out for me as I get more absent-minded."
With the explosion of new centers, many still under construction, have come vacancies, particularly at some of the older complexes and at those with studio apartments. No longer is a waiting list the rule at most centers. This is due in part to the newness of the industry in Connecticut and a lack of awareness about it by the consumer, industry officials said.
But Chris Carter, the executive director of the Connecticut Assisted Living Association, disputes the notion that assisted-living centers in the state are overbuilt. CALA was founded in June 1995 and offers education, training and information to raise the level of awareness about assisted living, in addition to fostering ethical standards and serving as a legislative ally.
"Connecticut has 175,000 residents over the age of 75," he said. "It's our belief that 50,000 of these individuals need assistance with daily living, of which 20,000 have an annual income of more than $25,000, making them eligible for assisted living.
"Connecticut has 70 assisted living sites with a total of 4,000 units," he continued. "The market is not overbuilt. With education, all the units will find themselves in demand."
The Greens at Canondale in Wilton opened two years ago and has full occupancy. Its monthly fees range from $3,750 to $5,850. A certain number of units are designated for people with lower incomes.
"We have residents who have been here since we opened," said Sandra Sajec, executive director at the Greens. "This is their home. We haven't lost too many."
By and large, residents must foot the bill for assisted living without Medicare reimbursement. But long-term care insurance is a growing commodity, offered by private insurers such as General Electric, John Hancock and Travelers. Some companies are even offering long-term care insurance for their employees' parents, according to Tim Hodges, vice president of marketing for Kensington Green of Southbury.
Kensington Green is a 120-unit facility that will emphasize a healthy life style, focusing on diet, exercise and social relationships. It will have 24 separate apartments for people living with Alzheimer's disease. The facility is scheduled to open in March 2001.
"We did a market feasibility study to find out the demand and determined it was there," Mr. Hodges said.
The average age of assisted living residents is 84-85, and their average stay is two years, according to Mr. Carter. He said residents either die or require greater care at a nursing home.
Ginny Carroll, the Lockwood Lodge marketing director, said there is an industry-wide problem of people waiting until they are physically incapacitated before looking into assisted living, which is geared to people who enjoy relatively good health.
"I'm trying to get people to think about assisted living before a crisis occurs," said Tony Copeland, a spokesman for the AARP, "so they can take the time they need to find a facility, research it and make sure it meets their needs."
Ms. Carroll also mentioned an unanticipated phenomenon.
"We're finding the demand to be different than we expected," she said. "Through our studies, we expected more people to want studio apartments, due to the economics. We're finding people don't want to give up their space. They want to bring their memories. One-bedroom apartments are much more popular than studios."
Mark Ryan, secretary of the state for the Office of Policy and Management, said the state has been studying assisted living with interest, in an effort to deal with an aging population whose ranks are expected to surge over the next 30 years with the graying of the baby boomers.
According to Mr. Ryan, Connecticut has one of the highest percentages of elderly residents in the nation.
The statistics are dramatic, with 34 million Americans 65 or older, up from 20 million in 1970, and the numbers are expected to swell to 70 million by 2030, according to AARP statistics.
The number of elderly residents in Connecticut is proportionately higher. Nationwide, the percentage of people 65 or over is 12 percent, compared with 14.3 percent in Connecticut, according to 1990 state and federal census reports. By 2030, 20 percent of the national population will be over 65 and Mr. Ryan said Connecticut's population is expected to be elderly about 10 years sooner.
"We're making major investments in assisted living," Mr. Ryan said. "We believe there is a good chunk of people in nursing homes who are poor but could manage well with assisted living, while improving their independence, respect and dignity."
The Office of Policy and Management and other state agencies are planning a pilot program with 300 assisted-living beds in five or six urban and lower-middle-class suburban communities for people living on Medicaid. A bill is pending in the state legislature that would allow assisted living to be layered into existing congregate care housing for the elderly, based on the belief it will provide a less costly and more desirable alternative to nursing homes for low-income elderly residents, according to Mr. Ryan. If the bill passes, some or all of the costs could be covered by Medicare.
Martha Meng, a lawyer with Murtha, Cullina LLP of Hartford and New Haven, was part of a working group convened in 1991 by the Department of Health to write regulations for assisted living. The group completed the task in November 1994.
"The assisted-living services agency is the licensed entity and must provide services within a managed residential agency that is registered with the state but is not itself licensed," she said. "The managed residential agency is the platform, or physical plant for the services that must be provided to qualify as assisted living."
Services include three meals a day, housekeeping, laundry, transportation, access to health care, 24-hour security and staff availability, an emergency call system, medication management, social and recreational activities; and assistance, as needed, with eating, bathing, dressing, and mobility.
Assisted living is as popular with baby boom children as it is with their older parents.
Diane Mauriello of Newtown and her husband have school-age children living at home and they also have primary responsibility for their aging parents. Ms. Mauriello's father-in-law had a stroke last year and had to move to a nursing home in Southbury. Her mother-in-law, Cara Mauriello, 82, is frail, but not incapacitated. Although she does not need a nursing home, she can no longer live alone.
"She was depressed and was not eating," Ms. Mauriello said of her mother-in-law. "She didn't like living alone and needed companionship."
Since moving to Lockwood Lodge, she has blossomed, Ms. Mauriello said. "She looks good, is well cared for 24 hours a day and never lonely. My husband and I were able to go on a cruise and leave her. We wouldn't have been able to do that before."
Darlene O'Connor, director of integrated care for the Connecticut Department of Social Services, offered the following advice for anyone considering assisted living for themselves or a loved one: "Make sure you know what you are purchasing now and down the road, when you need more support. What conditions can the facility handle? What happens when your assets are gone?"

HEADLINE: IN THE GARDEN;
Some Lessons of Old From Williamsburg

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG

 BODY:
I WENT to Colonial Williamsburg not long ago. It was Garden Week in Virginia, and, like thousands of my fellow enthusiasts, I was eager to see some of the extraordinary private gardens that were open for the festivities. I also wanted to find out what a 21st-century Northeastern gardener can learn from gardens that have been recreated over the past 60 years to resemble those that existed in 18th-century Virginia.
I am not the only one with such interests. Historic gardens are very hot right now. Expensive subdivisions seem to be full of people willing to spend vast sums of money to adorn the grounds of their new McMansions with everything from Victorian bedding-out schemes to French parterres. 
 The McMansionites are clearly the spiritual descendants of the colonial governor, Alexander Spotswood, who was convinced that he could create a fashionable watering hole within the confines of a colonial backwater by installing an ornamental water feature at the rear of the governor's mansion. The governor's canal and fishpond have been recreated, and are sited conveniently near another of his innovations, a boxwood maze. He would undoubtedly be gratified to learn that water features and mazes have become fashionable again.
But pleasure gardens were not the only gardens flourishing within the colonial capital. Neatly planted symmetrical kitchen gardens, containing combinations of edible plants, herbs, ornamentals and even fruit trees, existed near the homes of working class, professional and wealthy residents. According to Kent Brinkley, director of horticulture for the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, it is these gardens that have the most relevance for today's gardeners.
"Most of the gardens at Colonial Williamsburg are comparable in size to today's home lots," he said. "This helps modern gardeners relate to them in a more intimate way." Large estate gardens may be inspiring, added Mr. Brinkley, but it is easier to translate ideas when they are presented on a residential scale.
Williamsburg's gardens were also full of old-fashioned plant varieties that are identical or at least similar to varieties that were cultivated during the 18th century. Contemporary gardeners are becoming interested in older varieties, and a look at Williamsburg's plant lists can serve as a jumping-off point for selection of specific cultivars for a period bed or garden area. In an era when even the most devoted amateur gardeners are pressed for time, the tough plants favored by colonists merit attention. One example of such toughness, Mr. Brinkley said, is the roses grown in some of colonial gardens. The plants may not have the largest blossoms, but they are very hardy.
Perhaps the most important lesson that I learned from Williamsburg is also the least tangible. Over the course of the past 15 years, changes in scholarship and developments in landscape archaeology have led Mr. Brinkley and other horticulturists to reexamine the way colonial gardens have been portrayed. The gardens that were reconstructed in the 1930's and 40's when Colonial Williamsburg was a new venture, were Colonial Revival rather than true colonial gardens. The difference between the two is sometimes subtle, according to Mr. Brinkley, but in general the Colonial Revival gardens in the historic area, while presenting an elegant period feel, did not reflect the economic and social status of the colonial-era owners of specific properties. Now, that has become an integral part of garden restoration. "The use of finely crafted pickets instead of plain boards for fences says something about the status of the owner of a garden," Mr. Brinkley said. Personal wealth might also have led a colonial homeowner to install brick walks between garden beds, as opposed to dirt paths covered with a less costly material.
This emphasis on class distinctions does not please everybody, but it made me feel closer to the original gardeners, many of whom were also busy working people, with gardens that were not necessarily tidy.
The other lesson that I learned from Mr. Brinkley and the gardens of Williamsburg is that in historic garden recreation, as in any kind of gardening, there is no such thing as being finished. Mr. Brinkley's cited the example of the Taliafero (pronounced toliver) Apple, a variety discovered by the father-in-law of a prominent Williamsburg resident George Wythe and cultivated by Thomas Jefferson. The apple has disappeared from cultivation, but Mr. Brinkley hopes that somewhere, on an abandoned farmstead, a Taliafero apple tree clings to life. If such a tree exists, he looks forward to providing a safe haven for it in Williamsburg, and eventually, returning both the tree and its fruit to commerce.

HEADLINE: MUSIC;
Odetta, Still Singing the Blues

BYLINE: By E. KYLE MINOR

 BODY:
WHEN Odetta, the unofficial queen of American folk music, last released a blues album 38 years ago folk purists wagged their admonishing fingers at her for betraying them.
"Blues Everywhere I Go," her latest blues album, proves once again that Odetta's talent transcends any one style. 
 "Back then there were people who wanted to make sure that the music stayed where it was," said the 70-year-old singer, who performs an outdoors blues concert from 4 to 6 p.m. on Saturday at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield. "But I'm not a purist in any way, shape or form."
Odetta may be a folk icon, but her music includes the blues, jazz, spirituals, Appalachian songs and English folk songs. "Blues Everywhere I Go," her 27th solo album, pays homage to the great blueswomen of the 20's and 30's: Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Victoria Spivey, Sippie Wallace and Memphis Minnie. "T.B. Blues," "Unemployment Blues," "Rich Man's Blues," "WPA Blues," and "Please Send Me Someone To Love," a duet with Dr. John, are among the recording's dozen songs.
"One of the many reasons I wanted to do the blues album is that I get pretty fed up with stereotyping of our black community as being represented by prurient sex or 'I'm gonna shoot you or I'm gonna cut you'," she said in a phone conversation from her home in New York. "There was blues in the 20's and 30's that dealt with society's foot stepping on our throats."
That oppression, Odetta continued, included sending black soldiers to Europe during World War I and II and their returning to segregation and unemployment.
This kind of social protest has long been evident in Odetta's vast song repertory. The seeds of social conscience were planted during her childhood in Los Angeles. "They didn't have signs for black and whites, but you knew where you could and couldn't go," she said. "There were no signs, but there was attitude."
Odetta left home at 18 to perform in the chorus of a national tour of "Finian's Rainbow," a musical, appropriately enough, about prejudice. She then settled in San Francisco where she learned to play the guitar and began performing in the folk clubs. She worked across town from a young, aspiring performer named Maya Angelou. "I was playing the Tin Angel and Maya was at the Purple Onion," said Odetta, who has remained friends with the poet. "She's done pretty good since then."
So has Odetta. Her reputation is that of a singer of uncompromising integrity as a result of performances at the Newport Festival, at Carnegie Hall and for President John F. Kennedy on the nationally televised program, "Dinner With the President." She marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma and she sang at the 1963 March on Washington. Odetta was also an influence on Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin and younger singer-songwriters including Tracy Chapman.
Odetta still acts when afforded the opportunity ("I'm a big ham," she said with a laugh).
Her film credits include Tony Richardson's "Sanctuary" (1960) with Yves Montand and Lee Remick. And on television she appeared with Cicely Tyson in "The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman." She has also appeared with the Stratford Shakespeare Company in Ontario and at the Neptune Theater in Halifax.
Odetta's folk identity, however, remains. Since the social injustices that primed her singing career 50 years ago show no signs of relenting, she still has plenty to sing about.
"The song is the result of something," she said. "I'm infuriated. Does it take 41 bullets to kill someone? I'm infuriated that a cop has a license to kill an innocent person and that a jury lets him get away with it."
The worst thing that could happen to Odetta's career, it would seem, would be to have a perfect world. "Then I'd have nothing to sing about," she laughed.
That wouldn't be so perfect.
Odetta performs out of doors on Saturday from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, 258 Main Street, Ridgefield. Tickets are $15 and $20. The number to call for ticket information is (203) 438-4519.

SERIES: A Diverse Island

BYLINE: By JOAN SWIRSKY

DATELINE: PORT WASHINGTON

 BODY:
KEEPING a low profile comes naturally to Ananta P. Mukherjee, the owner of Colonial Wines and Liquors on Main Street, which he bought in 1997. Both by temperament and by life experience, Mr. Mukherjee, who is known as Tony, has relied more on hard work than on stirring the pot.
But all that changed when Mr. Mukherjee, who is 57 and a native of Calcutta, recently petitioned the Chamber of Commerce and the Port Washington Police Department to correct a situation that he says is hurting his business: a forbidding No Parking sign in front of his store. 
 The parking ban, he says, hampers the drivers who deliver his stock 10 times a week. Customers are sometimes unable to pick up large orders without getting tickets.
Many neighboring storekeepers have the same complaint, but none have been as determined as Mr. Mukherjee to change the status quo.
Unlike many immigrants, who may come from societies where aggressive action is frowned upon, or who may avoid public discourse because they are embarrassed by their imperfect English, Mr. Mukherjee -- perhaps emboldened by the maelstrom of political activity characteristic of Long Island -- comes to his current mission from a background of trailblazing action.
Mr. Mukherjee first demonstrated a flair for independence when he graduated from high school and left his parents and seven siblings in Calcutta to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering in Manchester, England.
Although his family was accomplished -- two brothers are lawyers and another a plastic surgeon, his four sisters graduated from college and his father and paternal grandfather were renowned lawyers -- he thought a degree from an English school "would help me fulfill my childhood dream of going abroad and pursuing my ambitions."
After paying his own way through school and graduating, he looked for jobs in England, but a petroleum crisis and widespread job layoffs made prospects there grim. He sought the help of the United Nations, which referred him to the International Committee for European Migration to Latin America. Within months, he was working for General Motors in Sao Paolo, Brazil.
He and his wife, Shiuli, who is also from Calcutta, had three children, but when their eldest, a boy, was on the threshold of college, Mr. Mukherjee decided that colleges in Brazil were not for his children, and he sent his son to Texas A&M University.
"I wanted my children to have the kind of opportunities to prosper that are only offered by the American dream," he said. "I knew that they would grow in America's increasingly diverse society and that being U.S. citizens, along with their ability to speak different languages, would open many doors to them in this global world." The Mukherjee children speak English, Spanish, Portuguese and Bengali.
Mr. Mukherjee's aspirations derive in large part from early experiences. Born in 1943, during one of India's worst famines, he remembers vividly the tales his family told of the conflict between Britain and Japan, and of having to flee Japanese bombing raids in Calcutta to a village in what is now Bangladesh.
"My father always believed in the concept of simple living and high thinking," he said. "And my wife and I also believe that it is better to live modestly and put a greater emphasis on education and the preservation of our cultural heritage."
After their son began studying in Texas, the Mukherjees moved to New York, living first in Huntington, then in Texas, and finally moving to Port Washington. Mr. Mukherjee had done well in Brazil, but "I spent a lot of my savings trying to make a life here," he said. "It wasn't easy, but I never experienced any discrimination, thank God."
"I went to the library every day," he said, "looking in the newspapers for jobs. I calculated my family's needs, but I was already in my 50's and it was difficult. I saw that jobs like working in a newsstand or gas station or repairing cars wouldn't earn me enough money to educate my children. When I saw an ad for a liquor store that I could afford, I bought it."
His travels in Brazil and Europe for General Motors had given him the opportunity to visit several wine regions. "I've always been interested in wines," he said, adding that he drinks two glasses of wine each night (and runs four miles every day), "so learning about other kinds of liquors was interesting to me too."
The Mukherjees, who are Hindu, have permanent resident status. After five years' residence in the United States, they will be eligible to apply for citizenship.
Learning about parking bans has also been instructive. When the response to his complaints to the Chamber of Commerce and the police department proved less than encouraging, Mr. Mukherjee wrote a letter to his community newspaper, suggesting that the shopkeepers "work out a series of compromises" with officials.
When the letter initially yielded no response other than encouraging words from neighbors, he circulated a petition that he plans to present to May Newburger, the Supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead.
Mr. Mukherjee has rallied like-minded neighboring storekeepers, including Linda Yau, the owner of the Lucky Star Chinese takeout restaurant, and Kenny Louie, the owner of Hime, a Japanese restaurant, who said: "There's no reason trucks can't park in front for 5 or 10 minutes. It makes sense."
The police chief, William J. Kilfoil, while acknowledging "there's definitely a problem," explained that when people park in the heavily trafficked area in front of Mr. Mukherjee's store, "traffic backs up eastbound and parking there creates a dangerous situation for motorists and pedestrians, the worse stop on Main Street."
"We do the best we can, but there's no easy solution," added Chief Kilfoil, who once walked patrol on Main Street. "Maybe this can be worked out with the town, but sometimes delivery people just have to use hand trucks like they do in the City. If someone's parking there, we'll tell them to move. But if they don't, it's a $25 ticket."
Mr. Mukherjee's efforts may soon pay off. In the words of Warren Schein, the president of the Chamber of Commerce for nine years, "We have to help each other so the community is a better place to live."
To that end Mr. Schein, who is also the deputy commissioner of parks and recreation for the Town of North Hempstead, which runs the Port Washington Parking District, said he had proposed a "red meter zone" to allow commercial vehicles to park for deliveries from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.
"I've seen this in Great Neck and Glen Cove and the Hamptons, and it works," Mr. Schein said. "This would make it easier for storekeepers to do business, for shoppers to avoid double-parking and having to drive around double-parked trucks, and for truck drivers who won't have to hunt for spots."
The plan is subject to town board approval, "but I'm sure it will be approved," Mr. Schein said.
In the meantime Mr. Mukherjee continues to collect signatures on his petition and to deliver to customers who tell him they do not have the time or patience to find a parking spot near his store. And he and his wife continue to work hard to support their children.
Their elder son, Shoummo, a graduate of Hofstra University, now works in the financial department of Citibank. Their daughter, Shilpi, studies computer graphics at SUNY Stony Brook. Their younger son, Sergio, a recent graduate of Schreiber High School in Port Washington, will attend Cornell University in the fall.
As for his foray into community politics, Mr. Mukherjee said: "Apathy is the great enemy of our society. I believe in the American way of life, being thankful for every freedom, and also having the right and the privilege of trying to redress a grievance."
 
A Diverse Island
Articles in this series are looking beyond the stereotypes that sometimes taint relations between immigrants and native-born Long Islanders. Future articles will examine immigrants' lives and how they are being woven -- or not -- into the social and economic fabric. Previous articles examined the lives and aspirations of Muslims on the Island, a Korean entrepreneur and her American-raised son, and a Colombian landscaping entrepreneur.

HEADLINE: Island Awash With Film Festivals

BYLINE: By BARBARA DELATINER

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to films and film festivals, can there be too much of a good thing?
Starting Friday, when the Long Island International Film Expo 2000 opens in Malverne, and continuing with the 2000 Stony Brook Festival, then ending with the Huntington International Film Festival, more than 50 feature films will be screened over 17 days. That's after the Long Island Film Festival showed 20 features at three sites in Suffolk in May, and before the Hamptons International makes its splash in October. 
 In its third year under the umbrella of the Long Island Film and TV Foundation, the Nassau-based International Film Expo is meant to bring industry to the area. In that goal it is similiar to the Long Island Film Festival, which began 17 years ago as an Island-wide effort, but currently grows out of the Suffolk County's Office of Economic Development.
"We want to keep our local filmmakers here and attract others from all over the world and convince them to make their films on the Island," said Debra Markowitz, director of cinema-TV promotion for the Nassau County Department of Commerce and Industry. "It brings jobs and money here."
"Jingle Hell," a first-time feature produced and co-written by Carter Ann McGowan of Garden City and directed by Will Tully of Hampton Bays, spent about $150,000 on the Island, shooting in Quogue, Smithtown, St. James, Mattituck and Hampton Bays. The comedy, about a family reunion, had its premiere at the Long Island Film Festival and will be screened in Malverne and Stony Brook.
The Hamptons event was created in part to provide off-season business in the resort area.
"As your festival grows, and along with it your level of notoriety, you attract more established filmmakers and more people from out of town who stay at local hotels and eat at local restaurants," said Alan Inkles, director of the Stony Brook event, which began five years ago as a way of keeping the Staller Center on the Stony Brook campus of the State University productive in the summer. Mr. Inkles emphasizes independent films, with the goal of eventually joining the ranks of major festivals like the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, and the Toronto International Festival.
Mr. Inkles believes he is approaching that level. Three established distributors have given him films that will make their New York premieres in Stony Brook before starting commercial runs. They are "Thomas and the Magic Railroad," a live action-animated family film with Alec Baldwin and Peter Fonda; "Steal This Movie," based on the life of Abbie Hoffman, with Vincent D'Onofio and Janeane Garofolo, and "Mr. Rice's Secret," a Canadian coming-of-age drama with David Bowie.
The Cinema Arts Center's fourth annual Huntington International Film Festival is intended to address a problem for foreign films.
"With this international globalization of filmmaking -- a few big companies controlling the production and distribution in the whole industry -- we're seeing the death of national cinema all over the world," said Charlotte Skye, co-founder and co-director of the center.
"Those of us who grew up on Fellini and Bergman couldn't do that anymore," added Vic Skolnick, her co-founder and co-director. "Only the foreign films that look like potential big box office hits are distributed now and most of them are dubbed."
