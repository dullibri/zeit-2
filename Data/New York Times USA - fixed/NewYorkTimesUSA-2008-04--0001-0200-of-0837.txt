HEADLINE: New Plays Exploring Difficult Relations

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky. 

 BODY:
The schisms in American society, both macro and micro, were on vivid display at this year's Humana Festival of New American Plays at the Actors Theater of Louisville. The divisions between the religious right and the secular left, the tech-fueled widening of the generation gap and the ever-relevant question of what makes a modern marriage function smoothly were among the themes explored by playwrights at the festival.
 Gina Gionfriddo's ''Becky Shaw,'' an absorbing comedy-drama about a blind date that threatens to become a marriage-devouring black hole, was the festival's heat-generating event, surely destined for New York and beyond. Ms. Gionfriddo's ''After Ashley'' had its debut at the festival in 2004 and was later seen in New York, while her lively if contrived black comedy ''U.S. Drag'' just concluded a run Off Broadway. The new play marks an impressive stride for a writer with a saw-toothed wit and a seductive interest in exploring the rewards and responsibilities of emotional interdependence. 
 Devoted yentas and their grateful customers beware: ''Becky Shaw'' depicts an innocuous set-up gone spectacularly awry. We do not meet the toxic title character until midway through the first act, which begins in a New York hotel room where Suzanna (Mia Barron) listlessly mourns her father's death, while Max (David Wilson Barnes), more or less adopted by Suzanna's parents when he was 10, tries to shake her out of it. 
 He is also trying to plug the holes in the family's financial affairs, left in disarray by Suzanna's father, possibly because his business manager was also his lover. Suzanna's mother, Susan (Janis Dardaris), an imperious woman whose multiple sclerosis has not stopped her from taking up with a much younger and disreputable man, remains as impervious to Max's warnings of dire economic straits as Suzanna is to his tough-love approach to healing her grief. 
 Max's role as the family fixer takes an unexpected turn at the end of this crackling first scene. Ms. Gionfriddo, a writer for ''Law and Order,'' has acquired a savvy aptitude for the deftly sprung plot twist. Firecrackers of revelation explode every few minutes in ''Becky Shaw,'' which is almost as quotably funny as Broadway's scabrous ''August: Osage County'' -- and that's saying plenty.
 Most of the choicest apercus come from the superciliously pursed lips of Max, played with chilly, magnetic allure by Mr. Barnes in the festival's standout performance. (It would be a shame if he were not allowed to reprise it should the play have a future life; Mr. Barnes was also in ''The Scene'' by Theresa Rebeck at this festival two years ago, a play in a similar vein that was mostly recast with higher-profile actors -- to deleterious effect -- when it came to New York.)
 Max is cynical about all things romantic, and defines marriage as ''two people coming together because each has something the other wants.'' Suzanna, who is studying to become a therapist, at least likes to believe that she's a true believer in love. By the second scene she is happily married to Andrew (Davis Duffield), a good-hearted would-be novelist scraping a living by working at a law firm. There he meets the lovely but lonely title character (Annie Parisse), whom they hope to pair off with the likewise single Max.
 This is a bit like suggesting that a snake mate with a mouse, or so it first appears when the nervous Becky arrives for their first date glaringly overdressed and emotionally naked. But Ms. Gionfriddo keeps us guessing about the character (ditsy or wily? victim, manipulator or a little of both?) as divided allegiances -- Suzanna's to Max, Andrew's to Becky -- put a strain on the marriage and expose unexpected vulnerabilities. 
 Intricately plotted and studded with scathing one-liners, ''Becky Shaw'' also burrows into the ideas it engages about moral, intellectual and financial compatibility in romance, as well as the level of emotional commitment various relationships require. On the down side, virtually every scene would benefit from some pruning, and the title character is the least convincing in the play, at this point more a plot device than a credible woman. (It does not help that the director, Peter DuBois, and Ms. Parisse, who may simply be too gorgeous for the role, don't seem to have settled on a consistent style for the performance.) 
 Still, ''Becky Shaw'' is a thoroughly enjoyable play, suspenseful, witty and infused with an unsettling sense of the potential for psychic disaster inherent in almost any close relationship. 
 The other significant show at the festival this year was ''This Beautiful City,'' an ambitious, talent-stretching production from the New York troupe the Civilians. Written by Steven Cosson and Jim Lewis, directed by Mr. Cosson, and with songs by Michael Friedman, this collagelike revue addresses the rise of the evangelical Christian movement. 
 Fans of this gifted troupe may be surprised at the sincerity -- and generosity -- of the company's approach to material that a hip New York theater company might be expected to put across with a wink and a wry smile. The production is close kin to ''The Laramie Project,'' the affecting documentary drama from Moises Kaufman's Tectonic Theater Company about the cultural repercussions of the murder of Matthew Shepard, a gay student in Wyoming.
 As in their previous shows ''Gone Missing'' and ''(I Am) Nobody's Lunch,'' the text is largely drawn from interviews conducted by the company. The timing of the Civilians' visit to Colorado Springs, where mega-churches are as numerous as McDonald's franchises, was propitious. They were apparently on the scene when Ted Haggard, pastor of the New Life Church and a leader in the movement, was forced to step down after he was linked to a male prostitute. 
 But ''This Beautiful City'' is not a polemical expose in the Michael Moore mold. It is a thoughtful, exploratory foray into a world that, as the interviews make clear, was alien territory to the show's creators. Voices of faithful believers are juxtaposed with those of critics of the movement's power and its prerogatives. The history of the evangelical explosion in Colorado Springs is presented from various perspectives, as is the controversy over the powerful sway evangelicals supposedly came to wield at the Air Force Academy there.
 Playing several roles each, the half-dozen leading performers -- some Civilians regulars, some not -- are all superb. None stoop to caricature, even when portraying characters on the far side of religious fanaticism. The fresh-faced Stephen Plunkett is a natural as a New Life pastor leading a youth group, and later as Mr. Haggard's son Marcus, who addresses his father's troubles in a speech that is surprisingly moving and eloquent. Marsha Stephanie Blake brings down the house as a fiery preacher who takes over a major black church when its pastor is forced out after he discloses his homosexuality. 
 ''This Beautiful City'' could use some editing too. The scenes set at a small church called the Revolutionary House of Prayer consume excessive stage time, and the ending is seriously flat. Mr. Friedman's pleasant but unexceptional songs don't add as much as they usually do to Civilians shows, perhaps because most of them are straightforward imitations of bland, folk-inflected Christian pop. You naturally miss the Cole Porteresque wordplay and sardonic humor of his best compositions.
 The rest of the work at the festival varied from respectable to -- well, to quote an irresistible assessment from a man I overheard fleeing one show at intermission, ''not good is much too generous.''
 On the respectable front Lee Blessing, the elder statesman among the participating playwrights, provided a solid if sleepy two-hander in ''Great Falls.'' Directed by Lucie Tiberghien and starring Tom Nelis and Halley Wegryn Gross as a stepfather and his stepdaughter on a road trip, the play is a well-observed but unspectacular voyage into familiar territory, perhaps fixated a little too exclusively on the sexuality of the young woman, a glib wiseacre in the ''Juno'' mold (and facing a similar problem).
 If the title ''Neighborhood 3: Requisition of Doom'' sounds like something you'd fire up on a PlayStation, that is entirely intentional. This play by Jennifer Haley uses a kill-the-zombies video game as a template for a thriller about the growing distance between distracted, self-absorbed parents and indulged, alienated teenagers in suburban America.
 Ms. Haley writes credible dialogue for her younger characters -- a delicate mission often bungled -- but this material ill suits the stage. When worlds virtual and real eventually must collide, the result is a dramatic fizzle, although the production, directed by Kip Fagan, was convincingly acted and sleekly if simply designed. 
 The divided soul of a black man is exposed in ''the break/s,'' written and performed by Marc Bamuthi Joseph and directed by Michael John Garces. Mr. Joseph is a naturally captivating dancer, moving with transfixing grace at any number of speeds. The performance is gloriously eloquent in its physicality, but less engaging when Mr. Joseph stops shredding the air with his limbs and simply delivers the opaque and meandering text about his various cultural travels. 
 I have been casting about for something charitable to say about ''All Hail Hurricane Gordo,'' a comedy by Carly Mensch (still a playwriting fellow at Juilliard) about two kooky, emotionally stunted brothers (Matthew Dellapina and Patrick James Lynch); one kooky, emotionally stunted young woman (Tracee Chimo); and a refreshingly well-adjusted white rabbit (name unavailable).
 Perhaps I'll just say that I loved the rabbit, and leave it at that.

HEADLINE: In Village, A Proposal That Erases History

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
 The passionate battles surrounding the birth of New York's preservation movement nearly a half-century ago seem like distant memories now. For some New Yorkers the main threat to architecture in the city is no longer the demolition of its great landmarks, but a trite nostalgia that disdains the new.
 Well, think again. Over the last few years the growing clout of developers has gradually chipped away at the city's resolve to protect its architectural legacy. The agency most responsible for defending that legacy, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, has sometimes been accused of putting developers' interests above the well-being of the city's inhabitants. 
 A proposal before the commission to tear down several buildings in the Greenwich Village Historic District is shaping up as a crucial test of whether those critics are right. A hearing on the issue is scheduled for Tuesday morning, and New Yorkers would do well to follow the proceedings if they care about the city's future.
 The application by the St. Vincent Catholic Medical Center calls for the demolition of nine structures on West 11th and 12th Streets, near Seventh Avenue, to make way for a towering new co-op building and a hospital. The threatened buildings range from the 1924 Student Nurses Residence Building to the 1963 O'Toole Building, one of the first buildings in the city to break with the Modernist mainstream as it was congealing into formulaic dogma. 
 The question facing the commission is which, if any, of these buildings contribute to the character of the neighborhood, a protected historic district. (If the agency sides with preservationists, the battle is not necessarily won; St. Vincent's, which is financially troubled, still has the option of pleading economic hardship.)
 Sadly, the hospital's application reflects the pernicious but prevalent notion that any single building that is not a major historical landmark -- or stands outside the historical mainstream -- is unworthy of our protection. Pursue that logic to its conclusion, and you replace genuine urban history with a watered-down substitute. It's historical censorship.
 St. Vincent's board would like you to believe that this is a purely practical decision. The project, planned in partnership with the Rudin Organization, a local developer, would be built in two phases. In the first the five-story O'Toole Building would be demolished to make room for a 21-story tower that would house the entire hospital. (Because of the floors' unusual height, this is roughly equivalent to a 30-story building.) A 21-story residential tower, flanked by rows of town houses, would replace the hospital's seven other buildings between 11th and 12th Streets. 
 The hospital expects to get $310 million from the sale of that land, which would go toward the construction of its new $830 million tower. (It would raise the remainder through private donations and other sources.)
 In patronizing fashion, hospital officials have suggested that preservationists are choosing buildings over lives, as if the two were in direct opposition. This is the kind of developer's cant that is ruining our city. The addition of up to 400 co-op apartments is about money, not saving lives. There are plenty of other ways that the hospital could upgrade its facilities. 
 The existing buildings that make up the hospital's main campus east of Seventh Avenue do not rank as major historic landmarks. Even preservationists concede that the George Link Jr. Memorial Building, a bland brick box dating from the mid-1980s, is not worth saving. 
 But it is not their status as individual objects that makes these buildings important; it's their relationship to the historic fabric of the neighborhood. The designation of the neighborhood as a landmark district in 1969 was intended to protect humble structures like these. Established after local activists brought attention to the destruction wreaked by urban renewal projects, the designation was an affirmation that the city's character is rooted in the small grain of everyday life.
 The threatened demolition of the O'Toole Building is most troubling of all. Designed by the New Orleans architect Albert C. Ledner, it is significant both as a work of architecture and as a repository of cultural memory. 
 It was built to house the National Maritime Union, as the era of longshoremen and merchant sailors was nearing an end. Its glistening white facade and scalloped overhangs, boldly cantilevered over the lower floors, were meant to conjure an ocean voyage and a bright new face for the union. (Think of ''On the Waterfront.'') Its glass brick base, once the site of union halls, suggests an urban aquarium.
 In short, you don't need to love the building to grasp its historical value. Like Ledner's Maritime dormitory building on Ninth Avenue or Edward Durell Stone's 2 Columbus Circle, the O'Toole represents a moment when some architects rebelled against Modernism's glass-box aesthetic in favor of ornamental facades.
 Viewed in that context, the O'Toole Building is part of a complex historical narrative in which competing values are always jostling for attention. This is not simply a question of losing a building; it's about masking those complexities and reducing New York history to a caricature. Ultimately, it's a form of collective amnesia.
 At St. Vincent's, the damage is likely to be only compounded by the design of these new co-op buildings, a sentimental faux version of the past.
 If we continue down this path, we'll end up with the urban equivalent of a patient on meds: safe, numb, soulless. Is this choosing lives?

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2 2008

 CORRECTION:
 The architecture column on Tuesday, about a development proposal by St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan and the Rudin Management Company, misstated the number of buildings they are seeking to raze to make way for a new hospital and residences in Greenwich Village. It is nine, not eight.

HEADLINE: Parts Maker Talks of Strikebreakers and Labor Abroad

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
American Axle and Manufacturing, the auto parts maker, is trying to force an end to the industry's longest strike in a decade by calling back laid-off employees, advertising for replacement workers and threatening to move production out of the United States.
 The company is feeling increasing pressure from its largest customer, General Motors, to end the monthlong strike. G.M. temporarily closed its Detroit sedan plant on Monday and is expected to close its sedan plant in Lordstown, Ohio, later this week, when it will run out of some parts. 
 Until now, the strike had affected only the production of slower-selling pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, but analysts say that halting the production of cars like the compact Chevrolet Cobalt, which is built in Lordstown, could quickly hurt G.M. sales.
 A total of 30 G.M. factories, including a transmission plant in Ohio that also closed Monday, have been fully or partly shut down, along with dozens of factories run by other G.M. parts suppliers, since 3,650 members of the United Automobile Workers union at American Axle walked out on Feb. 26.
 Formal negotiations broke off, and officials said no new talks had been scheduled. The strike began when the U.A.W. refused to go along with American Axle's plan to cut wages by as much as half, citing a need to remain competitive with lower-cost rivals like the Dana Corporation.
 The union, in turn, says that a profitable company should not be reducing its workers' pay. (American Axle earned $37 million in 2007.)
 ''If a company making profits can break the union, then any company can,'' said Adrian King, the president of U.A.W. Local 235, which represents American Axle workers in Detroit. ''We're willing to be out here one day longer than the company to get a fair and equitable contract.''
 On Monday morning, about 400 people who had recently been laid off by American Axle joined picket lines in Michigan and New York after the company recalled them over the weekend. The workers were given the choice of either returning to their jobs or risk losing their unemployment benefits, but there was no indication that anyone had crossed the picket lines.
 Striking workers were incensed on Monday after American Axle ran help-wanted ads in newspapers near its factories in Detroit and Three Rivers, Mich., and in the Buffalo, N.Y., area. The ads describe the jobs as ''anticipated attrition replacement openings after negotiations or in place of employees involved in this strike.'' 
 The U.A.W. is assuming that the company intends to bring in nonunion replacements.
 A spokeswoman for American Axle, Renee B. Rogers, said the company merely wanted to have new hires ready when current employees leave through a buyout program after the strike is settled. But Ms. Rogers left open the possibility that some striking workers could be replaced ''on a temporary basis.''
 ''The main purpose of this is to get this pool of potential associates when people taking the buyouts and early retirements exit,'' she said.
 The U.A.W. was also angered last week by a regulatory filing showing that American Axle raised the salary for its chief executive, Richard E. Dauch, by 9.5 percent in 2007, to $10.2 million, and by Mr. Dauch's statement that he would shift production to plants in Mexico, South America or other regions if the union continued to refuse his demands.
 ''We have the flexibility to source all of our business to other locations around the world, and we have the right to do so,'' he told The Detroit Free Press. ''If we cannot compete for new contracts in the U.S., there will be no work in the original plants.''
 Ms. Rogers said Monday that Mr. Dauch did not want to take part in additional interviews.
 Workers said threats of a closing of their plants did not change their opinion of the company's proposed wage scale.
 ''If he wants to take it to Mexico, let him,'' said Nate Mitchell, 41, a machine operator at the Detroit plant. ''I'm not working for nothing.''
 David Gregory, a professor of labor law at St. John's University School of Law in New York, said the U.A.W.'s hard line against American Axle had as much to do with its overall future as a union as it did with workers at that particular company.
 The U.A.W.'s membership fell below 500,000 in 2007, the lowest since World War II, according to a filing by the union on Friday. In the 1970s, the U.A.W. reported a membership of 1.5 million. But employment at the automakers and their suppliers has since fallen steadily, particularly in the last few years as the Detroit carmakers began a succession of sweeping corporate cutbacks.
 ''The U.A.W. is sending a signal that as a union they are still formidable, and can't be underestimated,'' Mr. Gregory said ''It's critically important that they send that signal, or they really could be headed for oblivion.''

HEADLINE: A Deli Destination, Now a Pastrami-Scented Memory

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: SUNNY ISLES BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
Elaine Rothman could hardly believe her eyes. Two construction workers tearing up one of Rascal House's old red booths? The kitchen of her favorite deli being drilled to pieces? It was almost too much for a not-so-young lady in a hot-pink T-shirt to take. 
 ''People used to come here and have vacations and eat,'' Mrs. Rothman said, staring at a fresh set of condominium towers across Collins Avenue at 172nd Street. ''Now, it's all big money, honey. You know what I'm talking about.'' 
 Jason Starkman knew. He and his family were the culprits, the rascals some might say, who decided that after 54 years, Rascal House had to close. And like a patient rabbi, he listened to Mrs. Rothman quietly, nodding, smiling, familiar with her complaints. After owning the restaurant for 11 years, he knew that all the kibitzing was just a form of saying goodbye. 
 ''We love it ourselves,'' he said. ''We waited until the last possible moment.''
 As it turns out, Mrs. Rothman's assessment was just about right. The area where Wolfie Cohen opened Rascal House and his other long-gone deli restaurants is indeed a world away from its past. 
 Rascal House's reliable customer base, made up mainly of Jewish New Yorkers who came for the winter, has been shrinking for decades. Here and in Miami Beach a few miles south, roughly two-thirds of residents speak a language other than English at home, according to the 2000 census. And the younger newcomers -- often from South America and Europe -- have proved far less interested in items like pastrami or potato pancakes. 
 Stir in a shrinking economy and you have what Mr. Starkman calls a need for ''newer stuff.'' He said he plans to open a second branch of Epicure, a gourmet market his family owns in South Beach, on the Rascal House site by September. 
 Mrs. Rothman seemed unimpressed. ''Epicure, I love the food, don't get me wrong,'' she said. ''But this place -- you can't replace it.''
 On Sunday night, the final corned beef rolled out of the Rascal House kitchen. The ''last supper,'' as some patrons called it, brought a burst of lines and long waits reminiscent of the restaurant's heyday. 
 Monday felt more like a funeral. 
 Mrs. Rothman was one of dozens who stopped by to stare in the windows through cupped hands or buy some small piece of the restaurant they loved. 
 Demolition had begun. The city had selected a booth and decorations to keep for posterity. A half-dozen workers moved furniture, cut through equipment and discussed who would get the TVs. 
 The red counter stools were empty. Wide plastic menus sold for $25 each. Platters once full of food cost $5. 
 The restaurant's more famous items were priced like antiques. That large photo of Jackie Gleason, young, arms wide, smiling on Miami Beach; it cost $2,500, according to the tag. The restaurant's interior signs with the Rascal logo ran too high for Mrs. Rothman's budget at $5,000 each. She said she had hoped to pay $500. 
 Ken Joyce, 70, a law professor in Buffalo who always ordered the corned beef, said he was deciding whether to buy a board with a Damon Runyon quotation: ''As I see it, there are two kinds of people in this world; people who love delis, and people you shouldn't associate with.'' It was $250, even though the ''it'' had fallen off. 
 ''This was the place that as soon as we got off the plane, we'd come here,'' Mr. Joyce said. ''I probably ate here three times in the last four days.''
 His face was sunburned. He was carrying a black-and-white plastic sign for parties of two, harking back to a time when waits for a table could last hours. At $50, he figured it was a good deal. 
 His wife, Rita, 71, had already bought a few pictures and several platters. She said they would give many of the items to their son or other relatives. 
 That seemed to be the trend. 
 Those who came back on Monday seemed to be searching for more than knickknacks. Many were buying for relatives, part of fond Rascal House memories -- long dinners, countless cups of coffee, the buzz of a restaurant that smells awake and alive at sunup. 
 Mrs. Rothman, who was buying for her brother-in-law, Richie Weinstein, remembered happily waiting more than an hour for her party of 10 relatives to be seated.
 Mrs. Joyce said there were too many memories to count. ''To me, it's saying goodbye to my parents and my uncle's generation,'' she said. ''They're the ones who brought us here.''
 And on Monday, there seemed to be no going back. Mr. Starkman said that he would recreate some Rascal House items at the gourmet market, but that the local palate had moved on. 
 Indeed, at one point, a man in a flowered shirt asked Mr. Starkman a simple question: ''So is there anyplace to get something to eat around here?''
 Mr. Starkman smiled. ''You like Peruvian food?''

HEADLINE: Business Off In Several U.S. Regions, Indexes Show

BYLINE: BYREUTERS

 BODY:
Business activity declined in several regions of the United States this month, according to new data released on Monday.
 The index from the National Association of Purchasing Management-New York showed that local business activity fell to 425.8 in March, from 427.7 in February. 
 Separate reports also showed that business activity in the Milwaukee area and manufacturing activity in Texas also contracted in March.
 In the factory-heavy Midwest, business activity also shrank in March, for the second consecutive month, while a price component rose, highlighting worries of recession and inflation.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago business barometer rose to 48.2, from 44.5 in February, but remained below the 50 level that separates contraction from expansion.
 ''This report has a strong stagflationary feel to it with activity continuing to contract, but with prices pressures intensifying,'' analysts at Bear Stearns said in a note on the Chicago report.
 Still, the Chicago index figure was better than the 46.0 result from a Reuters poll, and Wall Street took an optimistic view of the data. 
 The good news for economic bulls came in the form of a sharp rise in the Chicago report's employment index, to 44.6 in March, from 33.5 in February. That was the biggest one-month employment gain since February 2002.
 Also, the new-orders index jumped to 53.9 in March, from 48.8 in February. The measure of prices paid jumped to 83.9 in March, however, from 79.4 in February. That is its highest since June 2006.
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's Texas monthly manufacturing index of general business activity slid to minus 22.7 in March, from a negative 21.4 in February. It was the ninth consecutive reading below zero, indicating contraction.
 Another report showed help-wanted postings on major American-based Internet job boards were down 0.6 percent in March from a year ago, the measure's first decline ever, year over year.

HEADLINE: Reining In Medicare: The Budget Director's View

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In your March 28 editorial ''Medicare's Financial Woes,'' you describe the symptoms but offer no remedy. 
 Medicare needs small adjustments now to prevent a drastic overhaul later. People can disagree with the specifics, but the president has proposed a responsible option that reflects common sense: Medicare should grow at a healthy 5 percent instead of growing at an unsustainable clip of 7.2 percent.
 The size of the president's proposal is slightly smaller than the bipartisan Medicare agreement from a decade ago -- and this proposal will shave off nearly 30 percent of the $36 trillion unfunded obligation in Medicare over the next 75 years. I'd call that a smart start that's good for taxpayers, beneficiaries and the budget.
 You say that Congress ''wisely balked'' at the administration's specific proposals, but what did Congressional Democrats offer? So far, nothing. Doing nothing is irresponsible and unfair to future generations.
 Finally, your editorial suggests that health care inflation -- not Medicare -- is the real problem. But this ignores the fact the government is the largest purchaser of health care and that Medicare policies are a primary driver of health care inflation.

HEADLINE: Food Prices Rise, Farmers Respond

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Faced with strong worldwide food demand and the accompanying higher prices, American farmers are beginning to respond to the signals of the market. In a new government report, farmers said they would make significant cuts in corn acreage this year in favor of soybeans.
 If they carry through with their intentions, the resulting additional soybean oil could help alleviate global shortages of cooking oil that have led to sharply higher prices, hitting poor countries hard. 
 But a smaller corn harvest would most likely raise prices for that crop, which could also increase the prices Americans pay for meat. Most corn is used as animal feed.Higher corn prices may also compound the difficulties of companies that use corn to produce ethanol as a motor fuel. Despite government mandates for the use of ethanol, those companies are struggling. They expanded so rapidly in recent years that an oversupply of ethanol depressed prices, even as the cost of their main feedstock -- corn -- was rising.
 The release Monday morning of the Agriculture Department's report on farmers' plans, based on interviews with growers during the first two weeks of March, caused the price of corn in the commodities markets to rise past $6 a bushel for the first time, before falling back. Soybean prices, meanwhile, fell 70 cents to $10.89 on expectations of a greater supply.
 The commodities markets have been extremely volatile recently, with prices swinging more widely in a few days than they used to move in a year. Overall the trend has been sharply upward, making for an uneasy winter.
 Consumers are confronting sticker shock at the grocery store, while farmers insist they are not getting rich because their own costs, like diesel fuel, are up. Wheat and soybean stockpiles have fallen in the last year, the government said in a separate report, meaning there is little buffer if the weather is not favorable this year and harvests are disappointing.
 ''We're hoping for good yields,'' said David Orden, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington. ''If we get bad yields and tight commodity markets are pushed even tighter, we'll get food prices skyrocketing, inflationary pressures and food riots in developing countries, and countries cutting off their exports.''
 Many of those unfortunate trends, Mr. Orden said, are happening already.
 Soybean producers told the government they would plant 74.8 million acres, up 18 percent from last year and just below the record high in 2006. Corn growers said they would plant 86 million acres, down 8 percent from 2007. 
 The soybean number was a little higher than analysts had been predicting, while the corn number was a little lower. The 2007 corn crop was the biggest since 1944 as growers rushed to capitalize on the government-mandated demand for ethanol. Three years ago, before the ethanol mandates, the price was less than $2.50 a bushel.
 ''In February, we were thinking farmers would plant as much as 90 million acres of corn,'' said the Agriculture Department's chief economist, Joseph Glauber. But the relatively high prices of soybeans might have caused some of them to switch. Soybeans also require less fertilizer, another commodity whose prices have been breaking records.
 Mr. Glauber cautioned that the planting report not only reflected the intentions of farmers, but could affect them too. Last year's report underestimated actual corn plantings by three million acres. A rise in corn prices and a drop in soybean prices might inspire other farmers to change their minds.
 That is what the ethanol industry is hoping. ''We do certainly use corn and it is going to have an impact,'' said Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. ''But I'm sure the marketplace will respond to this signal.''
 Joe Victor, an analyst with the market research firm Allendale, said he expected corn to rise as high as $7.50 by summer. 
 Farmers are not necessarily planting less corn for economic reasons, Mr. Victor said: ''They're going back to a more normal crop rotation. They needed to give their corn acres a bit of a rest.'' Next year, he predicted, the ratio will shift again, and farmers will cut back on soybeans in favor of corn.
 A handful of farmers, principally in Texas and California, told the government they were planning to grow more corn. But in the heart of the Corn Belt, it was a different story. Indiana is projected to be down 800,000 acres, Illinois 600,000, Nebraska 600,000, Iowa 1 million.
 Ray Gaesser in Corning, Iowa, said he would devote about 48 percent of his 6,000 acres to corn, down from 52 percent last year. The rest would be soybeans.
 ''Last year, the price ratio of corn to soybeans was telling us we should plant more corn,'' said Mr. Gaesser, a former president of the Iowa Soybean Association. Now the ratio is more in line with historical norms. The result is that ''many of the increased corn acres in 2007 are going back to soybeans,'' he said.
 Mr. Gaesser sells his corn to the local ethanol plant, where he is an investor. ''If corn prices get low, we make money at the plant,'' he said. ''If they're high, we make money in our core business, which is agriculture.'' He had already contracted to sell his corn, he said, which meant he would not benefit from any further price rises.
 For bakers worried about the price of flour, the plantings report offered a little relief. Wheat farmers said they planned to plant 63.8 million acres, up 6 percent, about what the commodities markets had been expecting. Cotton plantings are expected to fall 13 percent to 9.39 million acres. Cotton farmers have been abandoning the crop for corn and wheat. 
 The Agriculture Department said farmers would devote 323.8 million acres to 19 principal crops this year, up 3.8 million acres from last year and 7.8 million acres from 2006. Some of the increase has come from land pulled out of conservation programs, some from pasture, and some from the double-cropping of wheat and soybeans. 
 Despite the back-to-back increases, the number of acres under cultivation is still about six million below the level of a decade ago. The government is not entirely sure why that is happening, but one possibility is that some land has been swallowed up by suburban construction.

HEADLINE: As Fight for Water Heats Up, Prized Fish Suffer

BYLINE: By JIM ROBBINS

DATELINE: WISDOM, Mont. 

 BODY:
It's a simple fact of life across the rural West, as it is here in Montana's mountain-ringed Big Hole River Valley. Flooding river bottoms to grow hay sustains the economy but means less water in the river for the prized wild trout population. 
 The competition for water is not new, but it is intensifying as the climate here gets warmer and drier. 
 ''The biggest worry for trout is that smaller streams will simply run dry in late summer and temperatures in the remaining pools will exceed lethal levels,'' said Steven W. Running, a climate scientist at the University of Montana in Missoula who is a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ''Even if the stream has good flow 11 months of the year, fish have to survive the highest stress conditions in late summer. We could lose the populations in these smaller streams, and they won't come back.''
 By all accounts, these kinds of changes in the West's celebrated trout fisheries are happening quickly -- faster, experts say, than in other parts of the country. A new report by the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization, based on research by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shows temperatures in the West the last five years increased by 1.7 percent, compared with 1 percent elsewhere. 
 In a February paper in the journal Science, researchers said they expected the changes to accelerate. 
 ''We'll see less snow, even if there is the same amount of moisture,'' said the lead author, Tim Barnett, a researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. ''The snow there will melt sooner and the flow will end sooner. It's not a nice picture that emerges.'' 
 Floods, wildfires, livestock grazing and roads only make the picture worse. Some studies project the loss of Western trout populations in some regions could be more than 60 percent, and the loss of bull trout could exceed 90 percent by 2050. Salmon will also see a decline, up to 40 percent. 
 In the Big Hole River, the grayling are bearing the brunt of the changes. Grayling are the most imperiled of Montana's fish, largely because of warming temperatures. In the 1990s, studies showed 60 grayling per mile, a number that has dropped to 5 to 15. So far, the ranchers and the fish and environmentalists have been able, in unusual cooperation, to work things out so both are assured water at crucial times. 
 Some conservationists, though, say it is not enough and have filed a federal lawsuit to list the grayling as a threatened species, which could force ranchers to keep more water in the river. 
 ''It's pretty bleak for the grayling,'' said Noah Greenwald of the Center for Biological Diversity, which filed the lawsuit in November. ''The river has almost run dry every year for the last seven years because of irrigation.'' 
 Ranchers say they can protect the fish on their own. ''If they take water away from agriculture, it will wreck us,'' said Guy Peterson, who is part of an agreement to protect fish. ''And that won't be good for the fishery.''
 Peter Lamothe, the Arctic grayling biologist for the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said the number of grayling was so low he was concerned about whether genetic traits important for survival might have been lost. A genetic analysis is being done.
 A striking fish with a large top fin and iridescent colors, the grayling, common in the Arctic, had a range that extended south to Michigan and Montana. The Big Hole now holds the only river population in the lower 48 states. Climate change is having other affects on the fisheries. Last year sections of 20 rivers in the state were closed to fishing because of warm water temperatures, while in 2001 none were closed. 
 Water temperatures are now reaching dangerous levels earlier in the summer. Trout fishing is being shut down in July, rather than August. Most rivers in Montana run high in the spring when snow melts in the mountains. The run-off once stretched into late June and even July, but now it ends as much as three weeks earlier than it did a half century ago. And in that time the average temperature in the month of March in parts of Montana has risen by nearly six degrees, Dr. Running said.
 Last year, rivers in Yellowstone National Park also faced record warm temperatures. ''In early July we were looking at angling closures, because the temperatures were already approaching lethal levels,'' said Todd Koel, fisheries biologist in the park. ''That's early.'' 
 In large rivers like the Yellowstone and the Missouri, warmer-water-loving small-mouth bass are moving upstream, and biologists say they may supplant trout in some places. 
 The key to keeping fish in smaller rivers is to keep water flowing in the summer, but water law in Montana complicates strategies to assure flow. State law has a ''use it or lose it'' rule: If one rancher does not take his entitlement, the next user downstream can. 
 So as water temperatures reach critical levels in the summer, Mr. Lamothe asks a rancher near Wisdom to forgo some of his water to keep it in-stream for fish survival. He then follows that slug of water down the river, driving from ranch to ranch, asking ranchers to let the water pass. One positive note, researchers say, is that wild trout are better suited to survive changes, and most trout in Montana are wild.
 The key to protecting trout as the climate warms is habitat improvement, experts say. That means removing culverts, reconnecting blocked sections of rivers and reclaiming vegetation. On the Big Hole, volunteers have planted willows and grasses to shade and slow the water. Ranchers here are fencing cows off stream banks and drilling wells to water stock instead of diverting it.
 While things look gloomy for grayling, Mr. Lamothe says not to count them out. In some places where willows were planted the number of fish have recovered to 60 to 70 per mile. ''There's hope yet for the grayling,'' he said.

PERSON: Jules Dassin 

HEADLINE: Jules Dassin, Filmmaker On Blacklist, Dies at 96

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
Jules Dassin, an American director, screenwriter and actor who found success making movies in Europe after he was blacklisted in the United States because of his earlier ties to the Communist Party, died Monday in Athens, where he had lived since the 1970s. He was 96.
 A spokeswoman for Hygeia Hospital confirmed his death but did not give a cause, The Associated Press reported.
 Mr. Dassin is most widely remembered for films he made after he fled Hollywood in the 1950s, including ''Never on Sunday'' (1960), with the Greek actress Melina Mercouri, whom he later married; ''Topkapi'' (1964), with Ms. Mercouri, Peter Ustinov and Maximilian Schell; and the 1954 French thriller ''Rififi.''
 But before his blacklisting he had also carved out a successful Hollywood career making noir movies like ''Brute Force'' (1947), a prison drama starring Burt Lancaster and Hume Cronyn; ''The Naked City'' (1948), an influential New York City police yarn that won Academy Awards for cinematography and editing; and ''Thieves' Highway'' (1949), about criminals who try to coerce truckers in California. 
 Mr. Dassin's last major effort before his exile was ''Night and the City'' (1950), a film shot in London starring Richard Widmark (who died last Monday) as a shady but naive wrestling promoter and Francis L. Sullivan as a predatory nightclub owner. Some critics called it Mr. Dassin's masterpiece.
 ''Dassin turned Londontown into a city of busted dreams and nightmare alleys,'' Michael Sragow wrote on salon.com in 2000. ''He mixed the fantastic and the real with masterly ease.''
 The producer Darryl F. Zanuck had assigned the film to Mr. Dassin just as Mr. Dassin was to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He never did testify, but testimony by the directors Edward Dmytryk and Frank Tuttle, who recalled Mr. Dassin's Communist Party membership in the 1930s, was damning enough to sink his career.
 Mr. Dassin left the United States for France in 1953 because, he said, he was ''unemployable'' in Hollywood. In Paris, unable to speak much more than restaurant French when he arrived, he encountered hard times and remained largely unemployed for five years. In need of money, he agreed to direct ''Rififi,'' a low-budget production about a jewelry heist. A memorable sequence is of the robbery itself, lasting about a half-hour and filmed without music or dialogue. 
 Mr. Dassin also acted in the movie, under the name Perlo Vita, playing an Italian safe expert. He won a best-director award for the film at the 1955 Cannes Film Festival. By the time he wrote and directed ''Never on Sunday,'' a comedy about a good-hearted prostitute (Ms. Mercouri), the anti-Communist witch hunt in the United States had been discredited, and he had been accepted again. 
 Mr. Dassin also had a role in the movie, as a bookish American from -- like Mr. Dassin himself -- Middletown, Conn., who tries to reform the prostitute. His directing and screenwriting were nominated for Academy Awards. 
 The movie was a moneymaker and its title song was a hit, though some critics found the script predictable. Ms. Mercouri became Mr. Dassin's second wife in 1966, two years after he directed her in ''Topkapi,'' another film about jewel thieves, the prize in this case being gems from the Topkapi Palace Museum in Istanbul.
 Jules Dassin was born in Middletown on Dec. 18, 1911, one of eight children of Samuel Dassin, an immigrant barber from Russia, and the former Berthe Vogel. Shortly after Jules was born, his father moved the family to Harlem. Jules attended Morris High School in the Bronx.
 He joined the Communist Party in 1930s, a decision he recalled in 2002 in an interview with The Guardian in London. ''You grow up in Harlem where there's trouble getting fed and keeping families warm, and live very close to Fifth Avenue, which is elegant,'' he told the newspaper. ''You fret, you get ideas, seeing a lot of poverty around you, and it's a very natural process.'' 
 He left the party in 1939, he said, disillusioned after the Soviet Union signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler.
 In the mid-1930s, Mr. Dassin studied drama in Europe before returning to New York, where he made his debut as an actor in the Yiddish Theater. He also wrote radio scripts.
 He went to Hollywood shortly before World War II erupted in Europe and was hired as an apprentice to the directors Alfred Hitchcock and Garson Kanin. Soon he was directing films for MGM, including ''Reunion in France,'' a Joan Crawford vehicle with John Wayne in which her character comes to believe that her fiance is a Nazi collaborator. 
 His later movies were often joint efforts with Ms. Mercouri. They included ''He Who Must Die'' (1957), about life overtaking a Passion play in a village on Crete; and ''La Legge'' (1959), a noirish melodrama with Gina Lollobrigida, Marcello Mastroianni and Yves Montand. 
 One film without Ms. Mercouri was ''Up Tight!'' (1968), a remake of a John Ford classic, ''The Informer,'' set in a poor black neighborhood, with a script by its star, Ruby Dee. It was Mr. Dassin's first film in the United States since he had left.
 The year before, Mr. Dassin had directed the Broadway musical comedy ''Ilya Darling,'' based on ''Never on Sunday,'' for which Ms. Mercouri won a Tony Award. The couple lived in Manhattan during the run.
 The same year, 1967, Ms. Mercouri, an ardent anti-Facist, lost her Greek citizenship for engaging in what Greece's rightist government called ''anti-national activities.'' In 1970, Mr. Dassin was accused of sponsoring a plot to overthrow the junta. The charges were later dropped. 
 When the regime lost power in 1974, he and Ms. Mercouri returned from exile, which had been spent mainly in Paris. Ms. Mercouri entered politics, becoming a member of Parliament and later culture minister. They had homes in Athens and on the Greek island of Spetsai. Ms. Mercouri died in 1994. They had no children.
 Mr. Dassin's first marriage, to Beatrice Launer, from 1933 to 1962, ended in divorce. Their son, Joseph, who became a popular French singer, died in 1980. Mr. Dassin is survived by two other children from his first marriage, Richelle and Julie Dassin, an actress, as well as grandchildren.
 Toward the end of his life, Mr. Dassin ran the Melina Mercouri Foundation, which tried to induce the British Museum to return the Elgin Marbles, sculptures taken from the Parthenon nearly 200 years ago. In September, a museum is set to open at the foot of the Acropolis displaying plaster casts of the works.
 Mr. Dassin ended his directing career in his late 60s on a disheartened note, when his film ''Circle of Two'' (1980) -- about an aging artist (Richard Burton) who is infatuated with a teenage student (Tatum O'Neal) -- did poorly at the box office. Mr. Dassin never made another film.
 He had always been demanding of himself and often critical of his own work. In 1962, with his best films largely behind him, Mr. Dassin told Cue magazine: ''Of my own films, there's only one I've really liked -- 'He Who Must Die.' That is, I like what it had to say. But that doesn't mean I'm completely satisfied with it. I'd do it all over again, if I could.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Tuesday about the filmmaker Jules Dassin misspelled part of the title of the Broadway musical he directed and misstated the Tony Award history of Melina Mercouri's performance in the show. The title is ''Illya Darling,'' not ''Ilya Darling,'' and Ms. Mercouri, who was Mr. Dassin's wife, was nominated for a Tony as best actress in a musical; she did not win the award. (It went to both Patricia Routledge, in ''Darling of the Day,'' and Leslie Uggams, in ''Hallelujah, Baby!'')

HEADLINE: Professor Puts a Face on the Performance of Baseball Managers

BYLINE: By ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
The baseball season began in earnest this week, with 750 major league players and 2,430 games ready to collide and create countless millions of data -- which the game's devotees (who have included Nobel laureates) will assay with the statistical equivalent of an electron microscope.
 Many of the numbers that measure the performance of hitters, pitchers and fielders are familiar to every fan. But now attention is being turned to a genus of baseball creature rarely examined through statistics: the manager, who sets the lineups, calls for hit-and-runs and otherwise turns the cranks of in-game strategy. 
 Aside from won-lost records, few metrics quantify what these men actually do and the tendencies they exhibit. But an associate professor of statistics at Swarthmore College is trying to set that right, quite literally putting a face on managerial performance. 
 The mathematician, Steve C. Wang, applied a method called Chernoff faces, in which data points in many dimensions are presented in a form that people react to more intuitively: the human face. 
 While reams of categorical data can be imposing and hard to parse, translating the differences among them into facial characteristics can communicate distinctions with striking clarity. By turning rates of bunting, stealing and pinch-hitting into hair sizes, nose shapes and smile widths, Dr. Wang used a kind of statistical Mr. Potato Head to portray the spectrum of managerial characteristics in a way that intrigued even the skippers themselves.
 ''It's easy for people to think that all managers are the same, that we all pull the levers the same way,'' said Willie Randolph of the New York Mets, surveying his own Chernoff face alongside those of his 29 contemporaries. ''Looking at this, I really never thought of it this way, but we all have our own characteristics.''
 Delightfully, science here has imitated real life. Lou Piniella, the excitable manager of the Chicago Cubs, scowls and looks as if his hair might jump right off his scalp. Joe Torre, formerly of the Yankees and now with the Los Angeles Dodgers, appears downright serene. And Bruce Bochy with the San Francisco Giants, whose teammates once dubbed him ''Bucket Head,'' is depicted with a noggin roughly the size of a Rose Bowl float.
 More accustomed to applying statistical methods to paleontology and evolutionary biology, Dr. Wang is also a lifelong New York Yankees fan and member of baseball's bustling community of numerologists. He considered the fact that a player's statistics conjured certain images -- a hitter with a .330 batting average and 50 stolen bases immediately connotes ''speedy leadoff man,'' while a .220 average and 40 home runs say ''slow-footed slugger'' -- and suspected that managers might do the same, that they were less homogeneous than most people assumed.
 ''People think of managers as 'good' or 'bad,' but there's little evidence usually about what these guys actually do and what their styles may be,'' said Dr. Wang, 37, who wrote his master's thesis at the University of Chicago on Markov models of baseball lineups. ''And in numerical form it's pretty overwhelming. You're not sure what the standards are, which numbers are high or low.''
 Indeed, the 2007 managerial statistics, as presented in an annual register published by the baseball analyst Bill James, are a relatively dull grid of digits. But the facial maps make comparisons much easier to grasp. 
 The St. Louis Cardinals' Tony La Russa, known as a constant tinkerer, had his National League-leading 150 different batting orders (in 162 games) translate into an elongated head and wider eyes. 
 By contrast, the Philadelphia Phillies' Charlie Manuel -- who said this spring that he used far fewer lineups because he preferred to ''get into a routine and stay with it'' -- had a much squatter face and dots for eyes.
 Despite his Mets' squandering a playoff spot in the last week of the season, Mr. Randolph earned a wide smile because of his off-the-charts number of stolen-base attempts. And in several ways, he noticeably resembled Mr. Torre, who was his managerial mentor when both were with the Yankees.
 As he looked at the printouts, Manny Acta of the Washington Nationals was heartened that he looked like Terry Francona of the Boston Red Sox and Eric Wedge of the Cleveland Indians, who won division titles last year. (Mr. Acta also joked that his friend Mr. Randolph ''really doesn't smile like that.'') 
 But Mr. Acta also pointed out an important factor regarding all managerial statistics, regardless of how they were displayed -- that managers' tendencies were often a reflection more of the players on the roster than of the manager's personal inclinations. While the Mets speedster Jose Reyes cannot decide to hit 50 home runs and the Red Sox slugger David Ortiz cannot will himself to 50 stolen bases, managers can and will shape their decisions around the tools at their disposal.
 ''I'll adjust to what I have,'' Mr. Acta said. ''If I had a Gold Glove first baseman, I wouldn't have led the league in defensive substitutions.''
 Mr. Randolph agreed and said: ''I think managers want to have a certain style, but it depends really on what you have. Lou Piniella loves to talk about how he likes to be aggressive and steal bases, but sometimes he just doesn't have the people. You have to adapt and adjust to the personnel, but you do have a desire to express yourself.''
 Managers often distinguish themselves in how they handle pitchers -- how often they use relief pitchers and issue intentional walks, for example -- but Dr. Wang's study focused solely on their tendencies on offense. This was because using too many variables left each subject looking so different from the others that there was no way to spot similarities.
 Finding clusters among otherwise unrecognizable data was what inspired Herman Chernoff to explore his faces concept in the first place. Now a statistics professor emeritus at Harvard, Dr. Chernoff, 84, said in a telephone interview that he was merely trying to devise a way to project data points in multiple dimensions onto a two-dimensional space in the hope that something would jump out.
 ''Humans are very susceptible in slight variations in the human face -- as I understand it, the psychologists claim that a different part of the brain processes faces than those that process other geometric quantities,'' said Dr. Chernoff, who introduced his method in 1973 and has seen it applied in fields like economics and psychology. ''I did the cartoons because I couldn't do anything fancier. I'm not very artistic.''
 Dr. Chernoff also, alas, is not much of a baseball fan. ''I had intended for it to be used for much more subtle reasons,'' he said with a laugh. ''I wanted it to identify what variables were important. But most people use it where you know what's going on but you want to display it for an audience.''
 That is just what Dr. Wang, a former next-door neighbor of Dr. Chernoff's in Cambridge, Mass., did with baseball managers. Dr. Wang said he did not expect his work to change managers' personal strategies, but he added that it might speak to fans in a way that slates of numbers never could.
 ''It's a facet of the game we haven't looked at this way,'' he said. ''It doesn't have a use like players' statistics do. But it is a new way of looking at things.''

HEADLINE: Big Plans Are Slow to Bear Fruit in New Orleans

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
In March 2007, city officials finally unveiled their plan to redevelop New Orleans and begin to move out of the post-Hurricane Katrina morass. It was billed as the plan to end all plans, with Paris-like streetscape renderings and promises of parks, playgrounds and ''cranes on the skyline'' within months. 
 But a year after a celebratory City Hall kickoff, there have been no cranes and no Parisian boulevards. A modest paved walking path behind a derelict old market building is held up as a marquee accomplishment of the yet-to-be-realized plan.
 There has been nothing to signal a transformation in the sea of blight and abandonment that still defines much of the city. Weary and bewildered residents, forced to bring back the hard-hit city on their own, have searched the plan's 17 ''target recovery zones'' for any sign that the city's promises should not be consigned to the municipal filing cabinet, along with their predecessors. On their one-year anniversary, the designated ''zones'' have hardly budged. 
 ''To my knowledge, I don't think they've done anything to any of them,'' said Cynthia Nolan, standing near a still-padlocked, derelict library in the once-flooded Broadmoor section, which is in the plan. 
 ''I haven't seen anything they've done to even initiate anything,'' said Ms. Nolan, a manager in a state motor vehicles office who has painstakingly raised her house here nearly four feet. ''It's too long. A year later, and they still haven't initiated anything they decided to do?''
 The library still bears the cross-hatch markings made by emergency teams in the days immediately after Hurricane Katrina, to indicate whether any bodies were inside (there were none). 
 The city official in charge of the recovery effort, Edward J. Blakely, said the public's frustration was understandable, but he suggested that bureaucratic hurdles had made moving faster impossible. Mr. Blakely said crucial federal money had only recently become available, the process of designing reconstruction projects within the 17 zones was time-consuming, and ethics constraints on free spending were acute, given a local history of corruption.
 ''It took us 11 years to do downtown Oakland,'' said Mr. Blakely, an academic from California who specializes in helping cities recover from disasters. ''This is a process of urban redevelopment. You cannot do this overnight, no city, anyplace in the world.''
 Mr. Blakely has been given broad authority -- a staff of more than 200 and jurisdiction over eight agencies -- in a municipal hierarchy where the mayor, C. Ray Nagin, has adopted a hands-off role. Criticized last year for frequent trips to Australia, where he holds a university post, Mr. Blakely said he had not been there for some months.
 The growing frustration points up what has been a recurring theme in New Orleans's sketchy, on-again, off-again recovery from Hurricane Katrina: grandiose official promises, apparently made to lift the public's morale, that soon prove unrealistic. 
 ''They come up with these plans that look great and sound great,'' said Sheila White, a Mid-City resident. ''They give people hope. Then, they fall into the background. Promises are made, and they are not kept.'' 
 Donna Brown, president of a neighborhood group in the Gentilly section, said she had seen no movement from the Nagin administration. 
 ''I was told there would be groundbreaking Sept. 1, but I haven't seen anything,'' Ms. Brown said. ''I'm not sure what's going on. My neighbors are quite frustrated. I'm sure we're all pretty much aggravated and frustrated about not seeing results.''
 Many of the hardest-hit neighborhoods remain stuck where they have been for months, with a few houses on a block occupied and the rest in varying stages of abandonment or repair. In Broadmoor, one block might appear carefully restored by residents, while another will seem derelict. Vacant grassy lots newly pepper the city, ambiguous signs of progress: blighted houses recently sat on them, but construction has often not followed demolition. 
 The grim housing projects have started to come down, part of a federal replacement plan. But an acute shortage of low-cost housing spurred hundreds to wait hours in line for rental assistance vouchers in mid-March, the biggest crowd officials said they had ever seen. Financing for dozens of developments in New Orleans now appears uncertain, thanks to the national downturn.
 Meanwhile, the repopulation of the city after the storm that emptied it has slowed notably. The Census Bureau's latest estimate, 239,000, represents barely over half the former population -- and well under what local officials and New Orleans demographers have been claiming for months. Unemployment is lower than the national average, at 4.1 percent, thanks largely to construction, but high-end jobs are few, more expensive homes sit unsold for months, and the biggest economic development project in sight, a medical complex including a new Department of Veterans Affairs hospital, is years away. The French Quarter, hub of the vital tourism business, is crowded on weekends but empty during the week.
 Mayor Nagin remains an elusive figure, occasionally surfacing to take strong issue with local news media portrayals of him, but otherwise delegating much responsibility for the recovery to Mr. Blakely. In one recent venture into the public light, Mr. Nagin complained bitterly when The Times-Picayune published a photograph of him playfully brandishing an M-4 rifle at the police chief during a news conference; the newspaper then published a front-page apology. 
 Civic leaders are relatively unguarded in their criticism. ''The question is, is he relevant anymore?'' asked Rob Couhig, a lawyer who ran against Mr. Nagin and then served as an unpaid adviser to him.
 ''What does he do that the city couldn't do without him?'' asked Mr. Couhig, who is the secretary of the New Orleans Redevelopment Authority, a city agency.
 ''Obviously, Mayor Nagin continues to serve as mayor of this city, making him the leader of the recovery efforts,'' a spokesman responded by e-mail, adding: ''Just two weeks ago he led a delegation to Washington, D.C., to lobby Congress regarding our most pressing recovery priorities.''
 In the city's renewal plan, most of the 17 redevelopment areas still bear tentative designations like ''preliminary design'' or ''planning'' on a municipal Web site that officials say is up to date. In some areas, no development projects are indicated at all, and on the few that indicate ''construction,'' actual results seem small-scale -- new paving on a basketball court and a new corrugated metal roof over it, in an otherwise forlorn playground, next to an empty, boarded-up school, in a neighborhood, Hoffman Triangle, full of abandoned houses and teenagers hanging out at midday. Another project under ''construction'' nearby involves replacing ''damaged ceiling tiles'' at a police station. 
 Mr. Blakely conceded that progress so far was ''still light stuff. I think people were expecting they'd wake up one morning and it would be nirvana. But little things are happening, cleanups, fixups, and so on.'' On a driving tour, he pointed to new grass in the median of St. Claude Avenue, and street improvements. Buildings on either side, though, were dilapidated or appeared unused.
 Three weeks ago Mr. Blakely announced more projects, including playgrounds, ball fields and swimming pools, as part of the recovery plan. 
 There have been some uniquely New Orleans hang-ups as well, said the recovery director; ''lot of tensions in the staff,'' revolving around race. ''Black people have a hard time taking instruction from white people,'' said Mr. Blakely, who is black. There is resentment ''if a white person asks them to do something. It's really bad. I've never encountered anything like this.''
 His staff is under pressure from residents -- ''the people are on them every day, about when are things going to be done'' -- and the tension was evident in glum faces last week at a staff meeting presided over by Mr. Blakely in a downtown building. 
 In the neighborhoods, the verdict is still out on Mr. Blakely and his plan.
 Leonard Montegut, asked for his assessment of the recovery director, said: ''Right now, I can't think of anything. I think time will tell.''
 Mr. Montegut was mowing the grass in front of the apartment building he owns in the Hoffman Triangle, next to the playground that has been one of the few beneficiaries so far. 
 Stacy Head, a city councilwoman, said: ''I'm trying to remain hopeful. I'm ready for some action. Their approaches are smart. But we're still waiting.''

HEADLINE: Lending Plan Won Prize, But Will It Work Here?

BYLINE: By AMANDA M. FAIRBANKS

 BODY:
The maroon couch was big enough to take up half the living room, but by the time the 10th woman arrived it could hold no more. 
 The room temperature was rising from all the body heat. Chairs were brought in from the kitchen. Even the floor was called into service. 
 ''I'd like to start the collection,'' Alethia Mendez announced after the last of the 15 women had arrived on a recent Saturday morning. 
 Therese Prentice counted out crisp bills, divided them, tucked them in envelopes and recorded the amount in a flimsy green book. The next woman repeated the exercise, until all 15 had made their payments for the week. 
 Then the money was handed to Ms. Mendez, the group's 24-year-old banker. 
 ''This is the way it was done in Bangladesh, so we do the same thing here,'' Ms. Prentice said. ''It's our ritual.''
 The women are clients of Grameen Bank, the international organization that pioneered ''microloans'' to third-world entrepreneurs and that, along with its founder, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. 
 But the women were not in one of the abjectly poor villages in Bangladesh where Grameen usually does business; they were in a modest two-story brick house in St. Albans, Queens.
 Since the beginning of January, 11 Grameen lending groups have sprung up throughout Queens in the bank's first venture in the United States. They have lent more than $250,000, in amounts ranging from $500 to $3,000, to more than 100 women for income-generating activity like elder care, housecleaning and flower-arranging businesses.
 ''Of the entire U.S. population, 40 percent is underbanked, and as a result end up using payday lenders, check cashers and other, more expensive services,'' said Vidar Jorgensen, president of Grameen America. ''We're here to meet this huge need.''
 If the program works well, Grameen intends to expand nationwide. But while it has flourished elsewhere, it is not clear whether Grameen's model -- which relies on peer pressure rather than collateral to make sure women repay their debts -- will work here, and whether such small loans can actually help lift its borrowers out of poverty. 
 ''In parts of the United States it may very well work, but I have real doubts about it working in places like New York City,'' said David R. Jones, president and chief executive officer of the Community Service Society of New York. 
 His group gives cash grants averaging $3,000 to city residents in financial distress -- for instance, to people who have fallen behind on their rent or who cannot pay their medical bills. But Mr. Jones said that $3,000 is generally not enough to stabilize a New York resident. 
 Still, Grameen's experiment here is being closely watched. Elaine L. Edgcomb of the Aspen Institute in Washington, who co-wrote a 2005 study of more than 100 microlending programs in the United States, said that borrowers do ''move out of poverty, and the business can be an important contributor to that, but it's not always the only contributor.'' 
 ''For many families, the increase in income is sufficient to take them above the poverty line,'' she said.
 Grameen's distinguishing feature is its mandatory weekly meetings at which borrowers learn money management skills from their banker and from one another and must make their payments in front of everyone else in the group. If one person defaults on a loan, Grameen will not call a lawyer or a collection agency or confiscate any assets. Instead, no one in the group will be eligible for a new loan.
 ''You have 30 eyeballs who are looking at you and making you accountable,'' said Myriam Pericles, a 41-year-old first-generation Haitian-American, who will use her $3,000 loan to expand her computer consulting business. She was a little skeptical about the process. ''Maybe all this works in Bangladesh, but this is America, where people are different -- our value system gets warped, our word is not our bond.'' 
 Nicole Brown, 30, who immigrated from Jamaica as a child, is using her $2,000 loan to start a day care business. ''I didn't have it in my head to start my own business, but if you want to be great in life, you have to have your own stuff,'' she said. She added that she was drawn to Grameen through her sister, Wendy Brown, who is using her $3,000 loan to expand her apartment-cleaning business, Meticulous Cleaning Service L.L.C.
 As the other group members looked on, Wendy Brown, 36, made her first payment on the $3,000 loan: $60 toward principal, $6 for interest and $2 toward a savings account. If she makes all her payments, she will retire the debt within a year and be eligible for another loan. ''It's very simple, as opposed to getting it through a normal bank and going through the red tape and getting denied,'' she said.
 Grameen America's managers, who are based in Jackson Heights, say that all the women in Queens are paying back their loans on time. But adapting its model to the United States has not been easy. 
 While Grameen officially requires a home visit to verify that borrowers are truly poor -- they must fall below the United States Census Bureau's poverty line, currently defined as $21,027 for a four-person household with two children -- some borrowers at the St. Albans meeting still had not received a visit. Grameen organizers said last week that all borrowers would receive home visits in the next few weeks. 
 Finding potential borrowers has been another challenge.
 ''Here, the women are not working in the community where they are living,'' said Shah Newaz, the general manager of the Jackson Heights office, who has worked with Grameen for 26 years all over the world. It is hard to meet with the women ''because they are not in their houses in the daytime, and in the evening they are very tired and preparing meals, taking care of children and getting ready for the next day.''
 Grameen aims its loans at women, saying it has found them more responsible than men and more comfortable with the group model. So far, the Queens operation has lent only to women.
 But the organization says it will lend to men here, and is aware that it cannot discriminate on the basis of gender. ''We want a female candidate, but in the U.S. you can't say that in advertisements,'' Mr. Newaz said. ''That is a problem.''
 The idea behind Grameen Bank began in Bangladesh in 1976, when Muhammad Yunus, an economics professor, lent a total of $27 to a group of 42 women in Jobra, a southern village. All of the women repaid their loans. Since 1983, when Mr. Yunus formally founded Grameen, it has lent $6.8 billion to 7.4 million Bangladeshis; 97 percent of its borrowers are women.
 Mr. Yunus tried to start a microlending program in the United States in 1985, when he was invited to rural southern Arkansas by Bill Clinton, who was then the governor. But the program Mr. Yunus helped start, called the Good Faith Fund, failed. The group lending model never caught on. If given the choice, ''any human being on earth would want to borrow as an individual rather than as a group member. It didn't work very well in this country,'' explained Mary Houghton, founder of ShoreBank, who helped advise the Arkansas experiment.
 Another microfinance organization, Accion USA, which has lent money to more than 20,000 people since 1991, also attempted the group lending model in its early days. ''We found that the group methodology did not work well because there was a general lack of trust among potential borrowers and an unwillingness to guarantee another person's loan,'' said Bill Burrus, president and chief executive of Accion USA. The organization has since adopted a more traditional individual lending model in almost all cases, and its default rate has ranged from 4 to 7 percent in recent years. Grameen says its default rate in Bangladesh was less than 1 percent, though higher in times of flooding.
 Grameen America is aiming to reach 21,000 borrowers within five years, the number that its organizers say would allow it to break even. To improve its chances of success, it relies upon dense social networks, the kind often found in immigrant communities, to help form its groups of borrowers. The center in St. Albans consists predominantly of Caribbean and African-American women.
 Not long ago, they would wait out winter afternoons between cleaning jobs on subway platforms, unable to afford lunch or dinner. 
 ''We'd starve until we got home,'' Nicole Brown said. The sisters, who had moved back in with their mother, did not want to ask for more help from her, so they turned to Grameen. 
 ''Last year, I had $3 in my pocket,'' Wendy Brown said. ''This loan could help be the turning point.''

Grameen America, in Queens, is the international organization's first foray in the United States. Since January, its loans have exceeded $250,000, in amounts ranging from $500 to $3,000.

HEADLINE: New Competition and Cancellations at Heathrow Vex British Airways

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and NICOLA CLARK; Julia Werdigier reported from London and Nicola Clark from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
British Airways canceled 54 more flights at its new terminal at Heathrow Airport here on Monday as it struggled with a computerized baggage-handling system that has already led to the misdirecting of at least 15,000 pieces of luggage. 
 The airline, which has canceled more than 250 flights since the gleaming Terminal 5 opened last Thursday, said Monday that the situation was improving and that it hoped to fly at full capacity again soon. 
 But the disruptions at Heathrow, one of the most congested airports in Europe, are expected to last for at least the rest of this week and could not come at a worse time for British Airways. 
 In addition to the high fuel prices and declining consumer confidence that weigh on the whole industry, British Airways will face increasing competition on the North Atlantic routes, its most important long-haul market, because of the open-skies agreement between the European Union and the United States that took effect on Sunday night.
 ''It's a mess,'' said Gert Zonneveld, an analyst at the brokerage firm of Panmure Gordon in London. ''The reputation damage from Terminal 5 is their biggest headache, and there's a real chance that people will book away from British Airways.''
 Mr. Zonneveld estimated that the disruptions and flight cancellations could cost British Airways more than $:25 million ($49.6 million).
 Teething problems are not unusual for large new airports. Terminal 4 in Madrid struggled with luggage handling after it opened in 2006, but is now cited in surveys as popular. Chek Lap Kok Airport in Hong Kong, which opened in 1998, had a variety of technical and organizational problems in its first three months.
 And the opening of Denver International Airport was delayed more than a year, until early 1995, and its automated baggage system was ultimately abandoned.
 But British Airways had promised that the glass-walled Terminal 5, designed by the British architect Richard Rogers, would restore the joys of air travel that have been lost in long lines for security checks through windowless corridors at some of Heathrow's other terminals. Instead, the troubled first days of Terminal 5, which cost some $8 billion to build, were expected to give the carrier trouble beyond monetary issues.
 ''The whole point of the exercise was to bring British Airways out of the situation where they had to deal with the least popular airport among business travelers,'' Marko Lukovic, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan, said.
 The long lines of passengers in the Terminal 5 check-in area on Thursday brought back the image of an overcrowded and overstretched airport that the new terminal was supposed to change. By Monday, a British Airways spokesman said, the lines were clearing and ''the atmosphere is calm.''
 As of Sunday night, British Airways was also dealing with the new ground rules for air routes as the Europeans and the United States abandoned decades-old rules that had restricted trans-Atlantic competition. All United States air carriers now have the right to offer flights into Heathrow, while European airlines are permitted to fly to any destination in the United States from any European airport.
 Previously, only British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and American Airlines had the right to serve routes between the United States and Heathrow. But on Sunday, Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines all began flights into Heathrow, and Air France-KLM operated its first nonstop flight from Heathrow to Los Angeles under a code-sharing deal with Delta, its partner in the SkyTeam alliance.
 ''Without a doubt, there is going to be a dilution of revenues from premium passengers for British Airways because of open skies,'' said Peter Morris, chief economist with Ascend, an aviation industry consulting firm here.
 He said the new entrants to Heathrow would be under competitive pressure to keep fares down, reducing near-term profit margins on the trans-Atlantic routes. 
 Analysts at Goldman Sachs lowered their recommendation on British Airways shares Monday to sell, suggesting that the share price could drop because of the increased North Atlantic competition, weaker demand and the continuing ''operational challenges of Heathrow.'' 
 In London trading Monday, British Airways stock fell 2.4 percent.
 Despite other problems at Heathrow, including the terror alerts that disrupted travel in August 2006, Mr. Morris said that British Airways ''seemed to have retained its brand and a high degree of loyalty from business passengers.''
 ''Now you have a situation when even Sicilian shepherds are aware of what's going on,'' he said. ''I can't see how it cannot start to chip away at the B.A. brand.''

King, a Republican from Long Island who is known for his independent streak, is quietly exploring the possibility of mounting a bid for governor in two years, according to people close to him. ''We have to get our act together as a party,'' Mr King said of New York's Republican Party. ''We have to stand for more. We have to come up with an agenda.'' PAGE B3 
 PASSIONS HIGH IN PRESERVATION FIGHT
 At a highly anticipated public landmarks hearing, preservationists are expected to battle a controversial development proposal for St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan in Greenwich Village. The preservation battle pits historic-district protection against the hospital's goal of providing a top-level trauma center to serve more than a million people living, working or visiting in the hospital's treatment area.

 The controversial proposal to charge drivers in and below Midtown Manhattan took a major step forward, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Speaker Christine C. Quinn wrenching approval from the City Council by a slim margin. The ultimate fate of the proposal now resides in Albany, where the intentions of lawmakers whose approval is needed remained unclear.

 WALL STREET SEES OPPORTUNITY
 In Paulson's Blueprint
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. released his blueprint for a new regulatory framework to stem the credit crisis of 2007-2008. It may well go nowhere. But if adopted, the plan would hand Wall Street investment banks a major victory in their years-long effort to streamline regulation. PAGE C1

HEADLINE: Carrying Primary Scars Into the General Election

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
President Jimmy Carter and Senator Edward M. Kennedy had been sharp adversaries with a bad history, and in the 1980 presidential campaign they let it bleed into a bitter nomination fight. The Carter administration challenged Mr. Kennedy's patriotism and refused to debate, while Mr. Kennedy dragged out their fight for nine months, all the way to the Democratic convention. A weakened Mr. Carter prevailed and won the nomination, but he went on to lose in November. 
 Convention fights often spell ruin for a party. The 1980 experience for Democrats -- as well as a fight in 1968, and one in 1976 for Republicans -- all suggest that a bruising primary carried through the summer can contribute to defeat in November.
 Today, nervous Democrats are worried that history will repeat itself as Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who lags in delegates and the popular vote, has refused to concede the nomination to Senator Barack Obama. Despite the increasing rancor of the campaign, Mrs. Clinton says she is staying in until the voting is over. 
 Former President Bill Clinton reinforced that point on Sunday. ''There is somehow the suggestion that because we are having a vigorous debate about who would be the best president, we are going to weaken this party in the fall,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Chill out.''
 For all the sirens warning of disaster, history offers mixed guidance on whether spirited primary fights are fatal. Many historians and analysts say that while protracted primaries can weaken a nominee, bigger factors are usually at play. Voters are often swayed by whether they feel the country is headed in the right direction. They take into account whether primary battles are personal or political. They want to see whether the winner and the loser can patch things up. And time can make a difference. 
 No one, however, really knows where the tipping point is and whether this year's nominee will be too damaged to fend off Senator John McCain, the presumed Republican nominee, in what polls suggest is a Democratic year.
 ''There are interesting patterns of convention fights weakening the parties going into the election,'' said Ted Widmer, a presidential historian at Brown. ''But I don't think that's going to happen this year. All the issues favor the Democrats. There's a wobbly economy, the war in Iraq, and huge numbers of Democrats are ready to go vote for anyone but the Republican nominee. It would take considerable effort by the Democratic Party to lose this election.''
 In the case of Mr. Carter, many analysts say he would have lost anyway, even without a primary fight. The economy was mired in ''stagflation,'' Americans were held hostage in Iran and his approval ratings were in the low 30s. A primary challenge was almost inevitable, and an independent, John Anderson, was also drawn into the race.
 Still, it could not have helped Mr. Carter that a prominent member of his own party took him on, or that Mr. Kennedy left the convention with a defiant vow that ''the dream shall never die.''
 Robert Shrum, a longtime Democratic operative who wrote that speech for Mr. Kennedy, said a bitter extended primary challenge in itself did not doom the outcome.
 ''It's not the going to the convention, it's how sulfurous and negative this gets,'' Mr. Shrum said of the Clinton-Obama battle.
 ''What would hurt is if we had three or four months of escalating negative attacks and a huge fight over Michigan and Florida,'' Mr. Shrum said. ''We could have a situation where we set gender and race against each other, and we could lose the unlosable election in the bonfire of the vanities.'' 
 Some Democrats fear just such a trajectory.
 ''This contest will get even more contentious, and there will be more charges and countercharges,'' Donna Brazile, who managed Al Gore's campaign in 2000 and is neutral in this race, said after Mr. Clinton told Democrats last week to ''saddle up.''
 ''People were excited; now they're exhausted,'' Ms. Brazile said. ''In the beginning, they liked one candidate and respected the other; now they love one and hate the other.''
 A Gallup poll last week found that as of March, 28 percent of Clinton backers would vote for Mr. McCain over Mr. Obama, and 19 percent of Obama supporters would vote for Mr. McCain over Mrs. Clinton.
 But in the Republican primary in 2000, more than half of those who originally supported Mr. McCain said they would vote for Mr. Gore over George W. Bush in the fall, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center. By November, about 30 percent of those potential defectors had returned to the party fold, said Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at American University.
 That year, Mr. Bush had seven months to unite his party. If the Democrats fight through their convention, in late August, they would have just two months.
 ''The earlier they wrap it up, the more likely they are to bring people back into the party for the fall,'' Mr. Schaffner said. ''But I don't think you'll see as many defections as in 2000 because we're more polarized than we were in 2000. In 2000, a quarter of the public said they didn't care who won. More people care now, they see major differences between the parties.''
 A study by the University of New Mexico in 1998 found that a divisive presidential primary could have a ''marginal or even nonexistent effect'' on the outcome in November. Choosing a primary foe as vice president, as Ronald Reagan did with George Bush in 1980, can help, as can a meaningful reconciliation.
 In 1952, after Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Senator Robert A. Taft battled for the Republican nomination -- with Mr. Taft's campaign convinced that Eisenhower forces had ''stolen'' the nomination -- the two mapped out a fall strategy with a clear role for Mr. Taft. Mr. Eisenhower went on to win the White House.
 But some fights are ruinous. The presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin cited 1968 as the ''prime example'' of a primary battle that seriously damaged the Democrats. 
 ''There you had a bruising fight that became so contentious that it split the convention in two with violence, as well as internal dissension,'' Ms. Goodwin said. ''Nixon's victory was helped very much by that split in the party.''
 Equally difficult was the fight four years earlier on the Republican side. The relationship between Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller was so antagonistic that Mr. Rockefeller was booed off the convention stage. Lyndon B. Johnson went on to beat Mr. Goldwater in a landslide.
 Another disastrous year for the Republicans was 1976, when Mr. Reagan challenged the incumbent, President Gerald R. Ford. Mr. Ford later said that Mr. Reagan's failure to campaign vigorously for him in the fall was partly responsible for his loss to Mr. Carter. Yet Mr. Ford was also weakened by a sour economy, Watergate and his pardon of President Richard M. Nixon.
 While intraparty squabbles can toughen a candidate, they can also provide ammunition for the other side.
 ''The Republicans are not asleep,'' said Paul Kirk, who was chairman of the Democratic Party from 1985 to 1989 and was the political director for Mr. Kennedy in 1980. ''They'll use all that stuff for cannon fodder.'' 
 Mr. Kirk said that was the case in 1984, when Gary Hart branded Walter F. Mondale the candidate of ''special interests,'' a phrase that was used against him after he won the nomination.
 Mr. Hart, who was the candidate of ''new ideas,'' recalled the difficulties of patching up the party, especially with some of his supporters -- who, he said, stayed home instead of casting a vote for Mr. Mondale.
 ''I think they just didn't feel he had the ideas about the future I had,'' Mr. Hart said, an edge in his voice nearly 25 years later. ''Mondale wasn't able to close the sale.'' 
 Mr. Mondale, who was running against a popular incumbent, Mr. Reagan, lost 49 states.

HEADLINE: Democrats Hit the Campaign Trail in Pennsylvania

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Michael Powell contributed reporting from Reading, Pa., and Michael Cooper from Meridian, Miss.

DATELINE: FAIRLESS HILLS, Pa. 

 BODY:
The Democratic campaign took on the feel of the early voting states on Monday, back when the candidates' buses would crisscross paths in a single state. Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama were both in eastern Pennsylvania courting voters, on a day in which Mr. Obama gained a superdelegate.
 Senator Amy Klobuchar, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, announced her support for Mr. Obama in a conference call with reporters, describing him as ''a new kind of leader -- he speaks with a different voice, he brings a new perspective.'' 
 Ms. Klobuchar described both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama as friends and colleagues but said, ''To continue to stay silent would be, as my 12-year-old daughter, Abigail, likes to say, 'Awkward, Mom, awkward.' ''
 Mr. Obama already leads in pledged delegates, and Ms. Klobuchar's endorsement continues to narrow the gap in superdelegates. Mrs. Clinton, by a New York Times count, now leads Mr. Obama by little more than a dozen.
 Ms. Klobuchar brings to 65 the number of superdelegates to endorse Mr. Obama since Feb. 5, compared with 9 for Mrs. Clinton, although she has also lost a few since then. Each has 13 senators.
 But Mrs. Clinton said she had no intention of conceding.
 ''I see the sign that says, 'Please Don't Quit,' '' Mrs. Clinton said at a rally Monday night. ''Well, one thing you know about me, I don't quit.'' Music from ''Rocky'' then blared over the sound system.
 Mrs. Clinton was beginning a three-day tour of Pennsylvania as Mr. Obama went into the fourth day of a six-day tour of it. He stopped in Lancaster and Reading, while she spoke in Harrisburg and here in suburban Philadelphia.
 Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumed Republican nominee, was beginning a tour to highlight his family's long tradition of military service. In Meridian, Miss., he regaled reporters on his bus with tales of his exploits as a young pilot, including when he was disciplined for flying too close to another plane. That was on a field that happened to be named for his grandfather.
 Mr. McCain said he was surprised by the latest events in Iraq, where Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki tried to oust Shiite militias from Basra without consulting American officials. 
 ''I just am surprised that he would take it on himself to go down and take charge of a military offensive,'' Mr. McCain said.
 While campaigning in Pennsylvania, Mrs. Clinton was also conducting satellite interviews with television stations in North Carolina, Montana and Indiana, which vote after Pennsylvania, and she tried to turn recent calls for her concession by Obama supporters into a motivating force for voters.
 ''I didn't understand why Senator Obama and some of his supporters wanted to prevent you and other states from actually being able to vote,'' she told a television station in Wilmington, N.C. (Mr. Obama has said that she should stay in the race.)
 In Pennsylvania, voters continued to encourage Mrs. Clinton.
 ''Don't you give up!'' a woman yelled to her Monday afternoon as she entered the Capitol Diner in Harrisburg for a round-table discussion with local residents about their economic situations.
 ''If you help me, we'll make it to the finish line,'' Mrs. Clinton responded.
 Mr. Obama continued to soak up some small-town flavor, stopping in Lititz to visit its chocolate factory. His campaign announced that his wife, Michelle, would be campaigning in Pittsburgh on Wednesday with Teresa Heinz Kerry, the wife of Senator John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee.
 Mr. McCain, after delivering a speech and visiting a home for abused children, rode on his bus with Rachel Lee, whose son, Cpl. Dustin J. Lee, a 20-year-old marine, was killed by an improvised explosive device last year in Iraq. After Corporal Lee's death, the family adopted Lex, an explosives-detecting dog that was with him the day he died. 
 Lex stretched out in Mr. McCain's bus as Mrs. Lee told Mr. McCain and his wife, Cindy, about her son. As she talked, Mr. McCain held a card with pictures of him. Mrs. McCain's eyes filled with tears, and she cried silently for the rest of the ride.

HEADLINE: On Paper, Wall Street Gets Its Way

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
More than a year ago, when the markets were flying high, a chorus of alarm went up on Wall Street. Talk spread that the United States risked losing its edge in the financial world. 
 But the threat that many executives saw was not the credit crisis then looming -- it was the threat of excessive litigation and overregulation. Wall Street urged Washington to lighten up. 
 The financial industry could not get what it wanted then, but it may get what it wants now. 
 If adopted, the sweeping overhaul of the system overseeing the American financial system proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. on Monday could hand Wall Street investment banks a major victory in their years of effort to streamline regulation. 
 While the plan is unlikely to gain Congressional approval soon, and may go nowhere in a partisan election year, it echoes many of the seemingly subtle and yet profound changes that Wall Street has been lobbying for all along. 
 One change Wall Street wants is for regulators to shift from policing the industry with hard and fast rules -- do this, don't do that -- to using looser ''principles'' that might be open to interpretation. Another is to modernize the hodgepodge of state and federal regulators that sometimes overlap and compete with one another. 
 Mr. Paulson's plan would take a step toward both of these changes by consolidating banking and insurance regulators and potentially merging the Securities and Exchange Commission with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, then stripping the combined entity of much of its regulatory authority. Many on Wall Street applaud those proposals. 
 ''I thought it was a major step forward,'' Thomas A. Russo, chief legal officer of Lehman Brothers, said of the proposal. ''The world became homogenized, but the regulatory structure stayed within the same straitjacket.''
 Proponents of the principles approach say it is more efficient. They point to the meteoric rise of London as a global financial center, which has fueled worries that New York might one day lose its title as the world capital of capital. The Financial Services Authority, Britain's main financial regulator, relies on principles rather than rules. 
 Some former American regulators, however, wonder whether Wall Street deserves a longer leash, especially at such a chaotic time in the markets and the broader economy. After all, the financial industry has had plenty of scrapes with regulators in recent years, over issues ranging from conflicted stock research to questionable mortgage investments. 
 ''Some advocates want broad principles that will not be enforced,'' said Harvey J. Goldschmid, a former Democratic commissioner at the S.E.C. who now teaches at Columbia Law School. ''You take that approach and the problems of subprime and securitization will look like minor bumps compared to the mess we will have in the future.''
 Richard C. Breeden, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and chairman of Breeden Capital Management, questions whether the Treasury's proposals will end up hurting rather than helping the investing public. 
 ''I don't see what's in it for the public in this plan,'' Mr. Breeden said. ''What's in it for the taxpayers and the customers of these firms?'' 
 But Wall Street, among the most deep-pocketed and politically savvy industries in America, senses opportunity. 
 In November 2006, the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation released a report concluding, ''It is the committee's view that in the shift of regulatory intensity balance has been lost to the competitive disadvantage of U.S. financial markets.'' 
 A separate report, released two months later by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Senator Charles E. Schumer, stated in stark terms that the United States was falling behind. 
 ''The last thing that New York and the country, for that matter, need is to wake up one morning and find we are no longer the financial capital of the world,'' Senator Schumer, Democrat of New York, said at the time. 
 Hal S. Scott, the Harvard Law School professor who directed the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, said on Monday that he agreed with many of the Treasury's short-term recommendations. But he argued that the government should not waste its time with the medium-term proposals and instead move directly toward more radical reform with a principles-based system. 
 ''Too often we have a problem and we say 'here's a rule' and then people figure out a way to get around the rule,'' Mr. Scott said. ''We'd be better off with a principle.'' 
 Still, Wall Street has until recently flourished despite -- and sometimes because of -- the current regulatory system. Markets for some complex investments, like collateralized debt obligations, do not appear to have been policed by anyone. And no agency has effectively addressed the huge leverage in the system, a problem that seriously compounded the recent crisis. 
 Indeed, as the industry has increased its profits geometrically in recent years, the size of agencies like the S.E.C. has not kept pace. As a result, regulators have struggled to react to seismic changes in the industry, like the rise of hedge funds and the proliferation of financial products that are traded in the shadows among firms, rather than openly on exchanges. That has former S.E.C. commissioners wondering why turning the commission into a different agency would improve things. 
 ''It's the height of disregard to America's investors to abolish the one agency that has done something to protect the public from the baser urges of Wall Street,'' Mr. Breeden said. 
 But he admitted change was hard. ''It's not so clear that just because you draw simpler charts and simpler boxes, the system works better,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Moving to Down-to-Earth Oratory for Working People

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

DATELINE: STATE COLLEGE, Pa. 

 BODY:
The Speech is his finely polished sword, a transcendent weapon. Seen and heard on a thousand YouTube postings, Senator Barack Obama's speeches have made a happening of that hoariest of campaign forms, the stump speech. 
 But Mr. Obama sheaths that sword more often now. He is grounding his lofty rhetoric in the more prosaic language of white-working-class discontent, adjusting it to the less welcoming terrain of Pennsylvania. His preferred communication now is the town-hall-style meeting.
 So in Johnstown, a small, economically depressed city tucked in a valley hard by the Little Conemaugh River, Mr. Obama on Saturday spoke to the gritty reality of a city that ranks dead last on the Census Bureau's list of places likely to attract American workers. His traveling companion, Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, introduced the candidate as an ''underdog fighter for an underdog state.'' 
 Mr. Obama, a quicksilver political student, picked up that cue. He often mentions his background as a community organizer but in passing, a parenthetical. Not this time. ''I got into public service as an organizer,'' Mr. Obama told these 1,200 mostly white Pennsylvanians in a local high school gymnasium. ''There were a group of churches, mostly Catholic parishes, and they hired me for $12,000 plus car fare.''
 That detail drew knowing chuckles in a town where the median income hovers at just over $20,000. ''So I got myself believing that the most important thing is not to be an elected official but to hold them accountable.''
 Then, echoing Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's focus on bread-and-butter concerns, Mr. Obama went on to talk about the price of gas and to offer the precise amount of his health care premium and to explain exactly what he would do about the foreclosure rate and Big Oil and Big Energy and how he would stop companies from moving to China. 
 On Monday, he added a dollop of denunciation of corporate salaries at Countrywide, a company at the center of the subprime loan implosion. ''So they get a $19 million bonus while other folks are losing their homes,'' he said in Lancaster. ''What's wrong with this picture?''
 Mr. Obama's effort to master a plain-spoken and blunt language that extends back centuries in Pennsylvania is accompanied by no small stakes. Voters here, as in neighboring Ohio, where Mr. Obama lost the white and aging blue-collar vote, tend to elect politicians whose language rarely soars and whose policy prescriptions come studded with detail.
 ''The problem with talking about hope all the time is that these are not hopeful lands; Obama is talking change to people who equate change with life getting worse,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic Party consultant who has studied the political culture of these working-class states with a Talmudic intensity.
 Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama's Democratic rival, has studied this argot. Her style of declamation tends toward that of the school valedictorian, but she grounds her talks in detail after detail after detail -- her plan for stanching foreclosures, for tuberculosis, for tax breaks and so on and on, every program coming with a precise dollar sign attached. 
 A thrill these talks are not, but G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College, noted that politics that attended to the precarious details of life could provide comfort to the hard-pressed.
 ''If you're an unemployed steelworker, a former coal miner, you want to know about job training, who pays your health care,'' Dr. Madonna said. ''Obama's speeches are uplifting but without much specificity, and that's a tough sell for working people who don't live in a world of ideas.''
 Mr. Obama grabbed a big chunk of the male working-class vote in Wisconsin, and another chunk in Virginia and in Maryland. But Pennsylvania is both blue-collar and aging -- it has the third highest median age in the nation. And that has proved to be a troublesome demographic for him and a rich target for Mrs. Clinton.
 So, noted David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's chief political strategist, voters can expect to hear the candidate emphasizing his organizing roots. ''What we want to do is acquaint people with that dimension of his history,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''A lot of this can be pleasing, but empty patter unless you can establish your authenticity.''
 His challenge comes laden with complication. Pennsylvania's culture, as the historian David Hackett Fischer noted in his book ''Albion's Seed,'' is rooted in the English midlands, where Scandinavian and English left a muscular and literal imprint. These are people distrustful of rank, and finery, and high-flown words. It should come as no surprise that the word ''blather'' originated here.
 Mr. Obama does not shrink from arguing that the days when high school graduates could find good-paying union job in mills and factories are gone. In Johnstown, he spoke of retrofitting shuttered steel mills into high-tech factories to build wind-powered turbines.
 ''I don't want to make a promise that I can bring back every job that was in Johnstown,'' he said. ''That's not true.''
 Some in the audience applauded; others sat stolidly.
 ''There is a romance in the Rust Belt about bringing back those old industrial jobs and the culture those jobs represented,'' Mr. Sheinkopf said. ''Their message to a politician is, Restore our jobs, restore our culture.''
 (Senator John McCain, now the presumptive Republican nominee, took this same lesson in the Michigan primary, when he suggested that high-paying industrial jobs were a thing of the past. His opponent, Mitt Romney, insisted he could somehow summon that lost time, and he won handily).
 The candidate's best weapon in this race just might be Senator Casey. Laconic to the core, a politician who dominates the working-class cities of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, he seems intent on refashioning his candidate -- still very much a long shot in the primary. In his telling, Mr. Obama is nearly a shot-and-a-beer guy. 
 ''We can't just curse the darkness. We have to do our best to roll up our sleeves,'' Mr. Casey said. ''He'll fight for your jobs, and your families' jobs. Understand this: All of our battles are his battles.''
 Mr. Obama stood and watched; he might as well have been taking notes.

HEADLINE: The Bursting Of a Bubble In Shanghai

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and Chen Yang contributed research from Shanghai.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
A year ago, investors like Guan Ling were ebullient. Chinese share prices had climbed over 500 percent in the span of two years, setting off a nationwide stock buying frenzy. 
 When experts periodically warned about the possibility of a bubble, prices would dip temporarily then soar even higher, breaking records and inciting another mad dash to snap up equities. 
 ''The market was going wild,'' says Mr. Guan, 49, who a few years ago closed his real estate company to invest in stocks full time. ''Everybody was talking about how much they had earned, how much more they would invest, and which stocks had jumped 20 times, or even 30 times.'' 
 That was last year. The Shanghai composite index has plunged 45 percent from its high, reached last October. The first quarter of this year, which ended Monday with a huge sell-off, was the worst ever for the market. 
 Suddenly, millions of small investors who were crowding into brokerage houses, spending the entire day there playing cards, trading stocks, eating noodles and cheering on the markets with other day traders and retirees, are feeling depressed and angry. 
 ''These days my family quarrels a lot,'' says Zhang Liying, 55, a retired hotel waitress who with her husband invested all their savings in the stock market. ''My husband asked me to sell; I wanted to hold for a while. Now my husband condemns me as so stupid that we lost our family's savings.'' 
 Si Dansu, 68, and a retired engineer, is even more distraught, but she blames the government. 
 ''I devoted my whole life to the country. I went to the countryside after graduation, and worked as an engineer in a Shanghai factory until retirement. I invested almost all my savings and retirement fund in the market 10 years ago. But now I'm totally penniless. All my stocks went down.'' 
 Other parts of Asia are as bad, or worse. In India, stock prices have plunged 31 percent in Mumbai; they are off 31 percent in Japan and a whopping 53 percent in Vietnam, another booming economy. Angry investors have burned a securities regulator in effigy in Mumbai, and some are in tears in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 
 ''Some of them have cried,'' says Nguyen Quang Tri, 74, a retired cement company manager who was visiting a Ho Chi Minh City brokerage house this week. ''I have my own equity, but most of the people here borrowed money from the bank.'' 
 The market mayhem began after concerns grew late last year about inflation at home and an American financial crisis. Now, even though China's economy is growing at its fastest pace in over a decade, stock prices have fallen back to earth, crushing small investors on the way down. 
 Few experts say the stock plunge is a major threat to growth in the real economy here. But there are worries that a prolonged downturn could reverberate through China's financial markets -- especially since a large number of corporations had aggressively shifted money, sometimes secretly, to play the market. 
 By some estimates, 15 to 20 percent of the profits reported last year by publicly listed companies in Shanghai that are not involved in banking or finance (which usually invest in stocks) came from stock trading gains.
 Companies with primary businesses like selling electricity, or even sports jackets, were moonlighting by trading stocks, hoping to bolster their earnings.
 ''Companies had a lot of excess cash,'' said Jing Ulrich, a market analyst at JPMorgan in Hong Kong. ''And a lot of that cash did leak into the stock market.'' 
 But the big companies were following the small investor. JPMorgan estimates that 150 million people in China were invested in the Chinese stock market as of the end of last year. That may still be a small slice of China's 1.3 billion people, but it is a huge new constituency, and it has led to the birth of both a new source of potential popular discontent and a new lifestyle: the diehard investor.
 Chen Donghao is one convert. A 22-year-old recent college graduate, he is now a fixture at a Shanghai brokerage house. 
 In April 2006, when he was still a student majoring in art design, his family gave him about $70,000 to invest in the stock market.
 It was an ideal time to get in.
 ''When I started the stock market was around 1,700,'' he says, noting that today, despite the drop, the Shanghai composite index is still up at about 3,400. ''I made a lot of money. So since the beginning of this year I decided to open a restaurant. I'd like to open a chain of famous restaurants in Shanghai.'' 
 Shopkeepers, real estate brokers, even maids and watermelon hawkers are said to have become day traders. 
 A new version of the national anthem made its way around the country last year, beginning, ''Arise! Ye who haven't opened an account! Pour your gold and silver into the hot market!''
 The anthem went on: ''The Chinese nation faces its craziest time. The passionate roar of our peoples will be heard!''
 People responded. Here in Shanghai, brokerage houses with giant electronic screens started to draw huge crowds, including many retirees who were content to spend the entire day transfixed by the sight of rising prices.
 In some brokerage houses, entire floors are divided into small and midsize rooms that investors camp out in, from opening to closing bell, with their lunch bags, knitting gear, playing cards and newspapers to help them feel at home.
 Only now, many investors cannot bear to look at their screens.
 ''I'm getting out of the game,'' said Yuan Yuan, 23, a researcher at a fund company in Shenzhen who also invests on his own. ''The game is over. Big institutions pulled out first, only leaving the small investors.''
 In China, the government fears that angry investors can be a social problem. And so while the state-run media report on the ups and downs of the market, and even warn investors of the risks and pitfalls of investing, the press does not usually report on investors' anger.
 ''Actually there are a lot of complaints, but the Chinese media can't report this,'' says Mr. Guan, the former real estate company owner. 
 Now, in the brokerage house corridors -- corridors of pain -- one can hear complaints about all the market flaws: the government doesn't regulate the stock market and it participates in it by allowing mostly big state-owned companies to go public. 
 There are also complaints about insider trading, stock manipulation, and big investors with government connections, pumping and dumping stocks on small investors.
 But in China, experts say, the small investor also tends to be a speculator, a gambler, and that may be why the market is so volatile, and so unforgiving.
 ''You know Warren Buffett?'' says Chen Weihua, a 69-year-old retired engineer who once worked in Egypt. ''He's a master. He has a theory to hold stocks for a long time. But this theory doesn't work in China. Look at Ping An.''
 Ping An is a state-owned insurance company that went public last year, with shares that soared to $144 a share in Shanghai, then sank. Today, it is trading at about $50 a share, despite strong profit growth.
 This was not the way it was supposed to end. Many investors had been betting that Beijing would not allow the stock market to crash before the Olympic Games come to Beijing in August.
 After the Games, the powerful rumor went, everyone would sell, leading to a steep market plunge. 
 And if anything serious happened before the Olympics, the government would certainly do something to prop up the market.
 They are still waiting. 
 ''It's a deformed market, an unhealthy market,'' Mr. Guan says. ''We've always had long bear markets and short bull markets.''
 ''Look,'' he said, ''it took two years to go from 1,000 to 6,000 but two months to go from 6,000 to 3,500.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street-Bound Graduates Watch, Wait and Worry

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
AT business schools, nail-biting has become a career strategy.
 As the turmoil on Wall Street continues, M.B.A. students are nervously watching and waiting, hopeful that the jobs they found last fall will still be there a few months from now. 
 ''Positive thinking, positive thinking, that's what I tell myself,'' said Matt Fink, 25, in his first year at Columbia Business School and a summer intern-to-be at a major bank. ''You hear Bank of America, Citigroup, Merrill, Lehman, Bear. Every day, one of them is the lead story in the news. And that's where many of us have jobs. You just have to hope for the best.'' 
 Since June, Wall Street banks have disclosed more than 30,000 job cuts, and more are expected. It is unclear whether these cuts will include the thousands of students that firms have already hired from colleges and business schools. The anxiety increased last month when Bear Stearns collapsed, prompting scores of students on spring break to call their career offices to check on the status of their jobs.
 The jitters extend beyond the business-school set. Steve Fraser, author of the new book ''Wall Street: America's Dream Palace,'' said he had noticed rising fear among undergraduates in his Wall Street seminar at the University of Pennsylvania.
 In the beginning of the semester, Mr. Fraser noticed that students seemed to think the housing crisis was unrelated to their goals in finance and was caused mostly by irresponsible borrowers. But after the collapse of Bear Sterns, he said, they had ''a great deal more sympathy for people who have already been affected by this crisis. 
 ''There's a sense in the class now that things are more worrying, that this may affect them.'' 
 The situation today is not nearly as dire as it was during the 2001 recession -- yet. But even students at the most elite business schools are concerned that conditions on Wall Street will worsen, pulling their jobs into the claws of the credit crunch.
 Christopher Sanger, 28, was a senior at the University of Notre Dame in 2002. At the time, he said, many of his friends had signed job offers that were then taken away. Now a second-year M.B.A. student at the Yale School of Management, Mr. Sanger said he thought that his position at Merrill Lynch would be secure because it was in investment banking, not trading.
 Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and Lehman Brothers said they did not plan to change their internships and job offers. A spokesman for JPMorgan Chase, which is acquiring Bear Stearns, said the bank would honor its own hiring commitments, but the spokesman would not comment on how JPMorgan planned to handle internships and job offers made by Bear Stearns. 
 Many students have been uneasy since July, when the credit markets first seized up. ''When the class of '09 entered business school last fall, they had spent the summer listening to the subprime mortgage news, so they came in saying, Wow, have I made the right decision?'' said Roxanne Hori, director of career management at the Kellogg School.
 Even so, business school administrators said that hiring this year -- which was mainly completed in the fall -- remained strong. Career counselors said that not a single bank had reneged on its offers and that bank recruiters had said they did not plan to do so, either. ''So far, we're tracking well compared to last year,'' Ms. Hori said.
 Career advisers at universities say that in the downturn of 2001 and 2002 the banks were not the main employers to rescind offers. Several technology companies, including Nortel Networks and Cisco Systems, changed their minds on offers, and consulting firms like PricewaterhouseCoopers and Booz Allen Hamilton delayed students' start dates to save money. Intel offered students the option of a ''reverse signing bonus'': they could have two months' pay and could keep their signing bonus in exchange for giving up their jobs. 
 But the effects were also felt at financial firms. Credit Suisse offered students a chance to take off a year before starting, in exchange for $20,000. Mercer management consulting and Charles Schwab canceled summer internships altogether.
 In that downturn, financial firms focused on laying off thousands of workers, many of whom had been out of college or business school for only a year or two.
 Many young graduates with M.B.A.'s worry that history will repeat itself. In the last month, the alumni career center at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University has been getting worried calls from recent graduates concerned that they will be laid off, said Pamela Mittman, assistant dean of career services and student activities at Stern. 
 If companies decide to lay off employees who are one or two years in, rather than lay off the cheaper new recruits, business school administrators said that decision could hurt the companies' reputations. For example, the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management set up a limited-access Web site to record which firms had laid off recent graduates in the last decline. That way, future students could look at employers' actions before accepting job offers, even in good economic years.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Britain at Odds Over Guantanamo Inmate

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The Bush administration and the British government are at odds over how to treat one of the last two British residents held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, officials from the countries involved in the case and his lawyer say.
 Over objections from the British government, the Pentagon plans to file terrorism-related charges against the detainee, Binyam Mohamed. 
 It is not clear what the precise charges will be, but the Pentagon has said previously that Mr. Mohamed was trained for months at camps run by Al Qaeda in 2001 and that he was involved in preparing for attacks in the United States. 
 American military prosecutors have told the British government that they believe that they have a strong case against him. Prosecutors have previously linked Mr. Mohamed to Abu Zubaydah and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, senior Qaeda members who were subjected to waterboarding at secret locations, the director of the C.I.A. said in testimony to Congress last month.
 But Britain has questioned the fairness of the military commissions system under which Guantanamo detainees are being tried, and is worried about what might be revealed about its intelligence agencies if there is a trial, American and British officials said.
 Mr. Mohamed's case reflects the quandary for the United States, Britain and other countries as they seek to deal with men accused of having undergone terrorism training and who are considered serious security threats. 
 Mr. Mohamed was detained in Pakistan in April 2002, and the C.I.A. secretly took him to Morocco, his lawyers say. They say they will use a trial to try to elicit information about the Bush administration's policy of extraordinary rendition, in which terrorism suspects are sent for questioning to other countries, including some accused of torture, and about Britain's possible involvement and accusations that prisoners taken to other countries for detention were tortured.
 ''There is some discomfort with what the defense will try to drag out,'' a senior American official involved in the negotiations with the British acknowledged in an interview last weekend. The British and American officials who spoke of the case did so on the condition of anonymity because diplomacy was involved and negotiations were continuing.
 Late on Friday, lawyers for Mr. Mohamed sent by fax an ''extremely urgent'' four-page letter to the British Foreign Office. One of the lawyers provided a copy to The New York Times. The lawyers sought information about Mr. Mohamed's rendition to Morocco, including the names of the American personnel involved, ''so that they can be traced and interviewed or subpoenaed.'' This would be necessary to rebut the American contentions that Mr. Mohamed had not been tortured, the lawyers wrote.
 Mr. Mohamed, who is 29, says he was tortured in Morocco. At one point, his interrogators sliced his chest with a razor and then made cuts on his genitals, his lawyer Clive Stafford Smith wrote in a recent book, ''Eight O'Clock Ferry to the Windward Side: Seeking Justice in Guantanamo Bay'' (Nation Books). Mr. Mohamed told his lawyer that an American servicewoman had photographed his injuries. His injuries have not been independently confirmed. 
 In their letter, the lawyers also asked for information about whether the British intelligence agency MI6 was involved in the interrogation of Mr. Mohamed in Morocco.
 The possibility that this information will come out at a trial has the British government particularly nervous, the American official said.
 The British Foreign Office declined to comment on the letter. Mr. Mohamed, a native of Ethiopia, lived in the Washington area for two years before he moved to Britain with his parents and acquired legal residency. At 19, he was unemployed, drifting and abusing drugs, he has told his lawyer. In the spring of 2001, he went to Afghanistan. He says that he wanted to get off drugs and that the Taliban rulers had a strict policy against drug use.
 American prosecutors have said that he was trained at several Qaeda camps.
 In April 2002, he was detained at an airport in Karachi, Pakistan, with a ticket back to Britain and a false British passport. He said that his passport had been stolen and that a friend had given him one.
 His lawyer said that Mr. Mohamed was held in Pakistan for three months, during which he was interrogated and tortured, then taken to Morocco, where he was held for 18 months, and then taken to Guantanamo. 
 At one time, 15 British citizens or residents were held at Guantanamo, but 13 have been released. One is to be sent to Saudi Arabia, leaving Mr. Mohamed's status to be resolved.
 Charges were first filed against him in 2005 but were dismissed after the Supreme Court ruled, in June 2006, that a system of military commissions in effect at that time was unconstitutional.
 A trial now could be avoided if Mr. Mohamed pleaded guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence, which the prosecution is pursuing, said a person who has knowledge of the prosecutor's desire for a plea bargain. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because talks about a plea bargain were continuing.
 Mr. Stafford Smith appears to have anticipated this. ''This gambit by the U.S. stands to embarrass the U.K. deeply,'' he wrote in another letter to the Foreign Office last week. Mr. Mohamed would plead guilty to anything at this point to end his time at Guantanamo, even ''to being the pope,'' Mr. Stafford Smith wrote.

HEADLINE: Harlem Councilwoman Opposes Rezoning Plan

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
City Councilwoman Inez E. Dickens said on Tuesday that she would not support the current proposal for the redevelopment of 125th Street, a plan intended to transform the street into one of the city's major business and commercial corridors.
 Ms. Dickens, who represents central Harlem, holds a key vote on the rezoning because City Council members traditionally follow the lead of the council member who represents the district where rezoning has been proposed. 
 The proposal was approved last month by the City Planning Commission. It needs the approval of the City Council in order to take effect.
 On Tuesday, during a public hearing before the City Council's Zoning and Franchises Subcommittee, Ms. Dickens said she was willing to continue negotiating with the Bloomberg administration on the rezoning. The Council has until the end of April to approve, reject or modify the plan.
 Among the items Ms. Dickens said she would insist upon are the inclusion of more new housing that would be affordable to Harlem residents, whose average income lags behind that of the rest of Manhattan; greater attention to public health issues like asthma and AIDS; expanding recreation programs; and government aid to 71 businesses that would be displaced by the rezoning.
 ''Displacement, overdevelopment and gentrification are serious concerns,'' Ms. Dickens said. ''There will be no rezoning plan signed into law if I do not get the protection for my community.''
 Ms. Dickens's position had been eagerly awaited by the Bloomberg administration and community groups since last fall, when the proposal began to encounter widespread community opposition, some of which came forth at a series of raucous public hearings. 
 Even after the proposal was approved by the Planning Commission last month, Ms. Dickens declined to state her position publicly.
 The proposed rezoning encompasses 24 blocks of Harlem, stretching from Broadway east to Second Avenue, and from 124th to 126th Street.
 Proponents of the proposal say the street -- a low-rise mix of small shops, shopping malls, apartments and brownstones -- is in dire need of improvement, including more uniform zoning rules.
 Advocates say new construction for homes and businesses expected to be spurred by the rezoning would create thousands of jobs, provide hundreds of units of new affordable housing, and lead to a greater variety of restaurants and shops. The plan also includes incentives for arts and entertainment ventures to locate on 125th Street.
 Testifying at the hearing, Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the Planning Commission, said the proposal had been ''carefully crafted'' during four and a half years of community meetings.
 ''This rezoning will result in a rich range of retail and arts and entertainment offerings creating an economic engine for Harlem with over two million square feet of office space and more than 8,200 jobs,'' Ms. Burden said.
 She said she planned to work with the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone and the city's Economic Development Corporation to seek ways to aid the displaced businesses.
 Opponents of the rezoning say that most of the housing -- about 2,000 of the 2,500 planned new units -- would be offered at market rates that most people living in Harlem, which has poverty rates among the highest in the city, could not afford.
 Those opposed to the plan also say that historic buildings could be torn down as part of the proposal and that residents have not had enough of a voice in the process. 
 Most of the more than 100 speakers who testified at the public hearing on Tuesday said they opposed the rezoning.
 ''It is not in the interest of people living and working in Harlem at this time,'' said Jim Carroll, a Harlem resident. ''It's more for people who don't live there, but who will be coming in with higher incomes.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Alarmed as Some Exports Veer Off Course in the Mideast

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON; Nada El Sawy contributed reporting from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Roadside bombings of American troops in Iraq were occurring with unnerving regularity when military investigators made a disturbing discovery: American-made computer circuits sold to a trading company in the United Arab Emirates had turned up in the bomb detonators.
 That finding set off a clash with Washington last year when the Bush administration cited the diversion of the computer circuits to Iran, and eventually Iraq, as proof that the United Arab Emirates were failing to prevent American technology from slipping into the wrong hands. Administration officials said aircraft parts, specialized metals and gas detectors that have a potential military use had also moved through Dubai, one of the emirates, to Iran, Syria or Pakistan.
 The diplomatic face-off, which drew little public attention, prompted the United States to threaten tough new controls on exports to the United Arab Emirates, an ally. The nation had invested billions to become a global trading hub and had begun a campaign to burnish its image in the United States after the uproar in 2006 over a proposal to allow a Dubai company manage some American port terminals. 
 The administration backed down only after the emirates promised to pass their own export control law. But it is unclear that much has changed nearly a year after the confrontation. 
 Yousef al-Otaiba, an adviser to the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, said his country was more closely monitoring goods that it re-exported while blocking items that might help Iran build weapons systems. But trade experts and Iranian traders in Dubai said there was little evidence that the new export control law was being broadly enforced.
 ''It has virtually had no effect, to be honest,'' said Nasser Hashempour, deputy president of the Iranian Business Council in Dubai. ''If someone wants to move something -- get it to Iran -- it is easy to be done.''
 Relations with the United Arab Emirates have long been delicate for the United States. Dubai, for example, is the host for more Navy ships than any port outside the United States and is an important listening post for American intelligence personnel. Emirates officials have complied with a Bush administration request to inspect American-bound ship containers for nuclear threats as they move through Dubai.
 But the country, which is made up of the emirates Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Umm al Qaywayn and Ras al Khaymah, has deep economic and cultural ties with Iran, which is only about 70 miles across the Persian Gulf from Dubai. As many as 400,000 Iranians live in the emirates, many of them traders who track down goods in the sprawling consumer bazaar of Dubai and then re-export them to Iran, at times ignoring United Nations trade sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program and a broader United States embargo. 
 Emirates Blame U.S.
 Nearly $12 billion worth of American goods flowed into the emirates in 2007. Officials in the emirates say the United States -- which prohibits American companies from directly selling most goods to Iran and bars foreign companies from reselling dual-use products there -- has complicated efforts to follow the rules. 
 The officials, with trade experts, blame America for overstating the potential dangers of certain goods or passing on tips about illicit shipments that are inaccurate or too vague to act. 
 ''They like to exaggerate, or at least try to point to some strategic significance of the item, like saying, 'This software program could be used to design nuclear power plants,' even if someone is just buying it to draw puppies and flowers,'' said Clif Burns, an export control lawyer at Powell Goldstein in Washington.
 American officials have been increasingly alarmed about trade in the United Arab Emirates since 2002, when the Commerce Department sent an inspector, Mary O'Brien, there. From her spot checks of factories, freight forwarders and other companies that had ordered American products subject to export controls, Commerce officials say, it was clear that dual-use goods, including computer equipment, were being diverted on a grander scale than imagined.
 An entity said to be a woodworking shop, for example, had ordered a sophisticated American machine for making metal parts. The device, Ms. O'Brien knew, could also shape components for a missile system. The supposed factory contained almost no sawdust, and the few employees could not explain how they intended to use the machine.
 ''This is not right,'' Ms. O'Brien said she had said to herself, convinced that she had turned up her first ''briefcase business''-- open for inspection, but closed for good as soon as she walked out.
 She pressed a Dubai pistachio wholesaler on why he had bought an American infrared camera, which can detect living objects in the dark, and where it had gone. Later she found he had arranged its return from Iran, where it had apparently been diverted, while stalling a follow-up inspection.
 In nearly 40 percent of her inspections in four years, she found that regulated items were missing or that the recipient would not cooperate. Many of those companies were placed on a list, warning American exporters to be careful when selling to them.
 ''This was a huge sieve,'' said Lisa A. Prager, a former top Commerce export control official. ''Almost nothing that said it was going to U.A.E. was staying in U.A.E.''
 Ms. O'Brien's efforts helped jump-start criminal investigations into the diversion of American-made goods to Iran. As of last year, 58 inquiries, nearly half of the total, involved the United Arab Emirates. A number of companies were fined or charged criminally, including Mine Safety Appliances of Pittsburgh, which admitted last year that its shipments of gas masks and other goods had been rerouted by its agent in Abu Dhabi to Iran and Syria. (In this case, the company turned itself in.) 
 The Bush administration turned up the diplomatic heat, sending top-level officials, including Frances F. Townsend, then the White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser -- to push emirates' officials to confront the problem.
 From Polite to Nasty
 In 2005, the discovery of a American-made computer circuit in an unexploded roadside bomb in Iraq transformed what had been a polite diplomatic exchange into a nasty dispute.
 By reading a serial number on the chip and studying shipping records, American investigators determined that it had moved from the manufacturer, AMD of Sunnyvale, Calif., to Mayrow General Trading in Dubai. It went to Iran, then turned up in Iraq in ''limited numbers'' of roadside bombs, a federal official involved in the inquiry said. No known deaths have been linked to the bombs, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 Officials at the Commerce and Defense Departments would not discuss how they had connected Mayrow to the unexploded bomb. But Michael D. Turner, who until last year was director of the Commerce Department's enforcement office, said investigators uncovered evidence definitively connecting the two. A spokesman for AMD said the company cooperated with the inquiry, adding that its customers are bound by agreements not to re-export its products to Iran. 
 American officials had no authority to act against Mayrow, a foreign company, and the Commerce Department had not required AMD to get an export license restricting resale of the chip because it was not considered particularly powerful. But American officials were angry that their United Arab Emirates counterparts had not immediately moved to close Mayrow.
 ''TheMayrow case is just one example of an alarming lack of export oversight by the government of the U.A.E.,'' Christopher A. Padilla, a senior Commerce Department official, said in a December 2006 speech in Washington. ''We continue to discuss this issue with U.A.E. authorities, but time for action is running short.''
 To back up that threat, the Commerce Department proposed a new export controls for ''governments unwilling or unable to cooperate with the U.S. in interdiction efforts.'' The rules would mandate special reviews before certain dual-use American products could be exported to those nations. Emirati diplomats and lobbyists appealed to officials in the State Department and White House, and promised the Commerce Department that the emirates would adopt their own export control law, a commitment they carried out by August.
 Mr. Otaiba, the international affairs director for the crown prince, said that the emirates' officials now had a clearer legal ground to intercept dual-use goods being exported to Iran or elsewhere -- and that they had already started to do so.
 Late last year, his government shut down more than 12 companies suspected of exporting goods illegally or money laundering. It recently arrested a Jordanian businessman who was trying to import a metal used in nuclear reactors, with the intention of selling it to another country.
 Progress and Prospects
 At the Commerce and State Departments, officials said they were encouraged by actions the Emirates had taken in some recent cases -- the details of which are classified -- that relied on their new authority under the export law. But they said an export licensing system must still be introduced and other enforcement steps taken.
 ''The UAE has made progress,'' said Mario Mancuso, the Commerce under secretary for export administration. ''But more needs to be done.''
 The Commerce Department, however, declined requests by The New York Times and Congressional investigators in recent months to publicly release any updated figures on how frequently inspections by American authorities turned up problems.
 Mr. Turner, who still works in export control, said he still was awaiting evidence that the new law was being enforced. ''I still don't see any real change in what the U.A.E. is doing,'' he said.
 Nasir Khan, the Commerce Department investigator who has the job once held by Ms. O'Brien, said in a brief interview about the new export law, ''Things are still very nascent,'' he said.
 Executives at several of the companies suspected of violating American export controls, said they had faced no increased scrutiny in Dubai. 
 S. M. Mir Ebrhimi, chief executive of Reza Nezam Trading, which operates mostly out of Iran, said he continued sending products with American-made components as usual. Mohammad Kazem, supervisor at Al Musafer Tourism and Cargo, said he had not even known his business was on the warning list. He said that the company followed the law, disputing any suggestion by American authorities that he had shipped prohibited items to Iran. He also said that he had seen no more inspections or spot checks by Emirati authorities.
 ''There is no problem in Dubai,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Tighten Your Belt, Strengthen Your Mind

BYLINE: By SANDRA AAMODT and SAM WANG. 
Sandra Aamodt, the editor in chief of Nature Neuroscience, and Sam Wang, an associate professor of molecular biology and neuroscience at Princeton, are the authors of ''Welcome to Your Brain: Why You Lose Your Car Keys but Never Forget How to Drive and Other Puzzles of Everyday Life.''

 BODY:
DECLINING house prices, rising job layoffs, skyrocketing oil costs and a major credit crunch have brought consumer confidence to its lowest point in five years. With a relatively long recession looking increasingly likely, many American families may be planning to tighten their belts. 
 Interestingly, restraining our consumer spending, in the short term, may cause us to actually loosen the belts around our waists. What's the connection? The brain has a limited capacity for self-regulation, so exerting willpower in one area often leads to backsliding in others. The good news, however, is that practice increases willpower capacity, so that in the long run, buying less now may improve our ability to achieve future goals -- like losing those 10 pounds we gained when we weren't out shopping. 
 The brain's store of willpower is depleted when people control their thoughts, feelings or impulses, or when they modify their behavior in pursuit of goals. Psychologist Roy Baumeister and others have found that people who successfully accomplish one task requiring self-control are less persistent on a second, seemingly unrelated task. 
 In one pioneering study, some people were asked to eat radishes while others received freshly baked chocolate chip cookies before trying to solve an impossible puzzle. The radish-eaters abandoned the puzzle in eight minutes on average, working less than half as long as people who got cookies or those who were excused from eating radishes. Similarly, people who were asked to circle every ''e'' on a page of text then showed less persistence in watching a video of an unchanging table and wall.
 Other activities that deplete willpower include resisting food or drink, suppressing emotional responses, restraining aggressive or sexual impulses, taking exams and trying to impress someone. Task persistence is also reduced when people are stressed or tired from exertion or lack of sleep.
 What limits willpower? Some have suggested that it is blood sugar, which brain cells use as their main energy source and cannot do without for even a few minutes. Most cognitive functions are unaffected by minor blood sugar fluctuations over the course of a day, but planning and self-control are sensitive to such small changes. Exerting self-control lowers blood sugar, which reduces the capacity for further self-control. People who drink a glass of lemonade between completing one task requiring self-control and beginning a second one perform equally well on both tasks, while people who drink sugarless diet lemonade make more errors on the second task than on the first. Foods that persistently elevate blood sugar, like those containing protein or complex carbohydrates, might enhance willpower for longer periods.
 In the short term, you should spend your limited willpower budget wisely. For example, if you do not want to drink too much at a party, then on the way to the festivities, you should not deplete your willpower by window shopping for items you cannot afford. Taking an alternative route to avoid passing the store would be a better strategy. 
 On the other hand, if you need to study for a big exam, it might be smart to let the housecleaning slide to conserve your willpower for the more important job. Similarly, it can be counterproductive to work toward multiple goals at the same time if your willpower cannot cover all the efforts that are required. Concentrating your effort on one or at most a few goals at a time increases the odds of success. 
 Focusing on success is important because willpower can grow in the long term. Like a muscle, willpower seems to become stronger with use. The idea of exercising willpower is seen in military boot camp, where recruits are trained to overcome one challenge after another. 
 In psychological studies, even something as simple as using your nondominant hand to brush your teeth for two weeks can increase willpower capacity. People who stick to an exercise program for two months report reducing their impulsive spending, junk food intake, alcohol use and smoking. They also study more, watch less television and do more housework. Other forms of willpower training, like money-management classes, work as well.
 No one knows why willpower can grow with practice but it must reflect some biological change in the brain. Perhaps neurons in the frontal cortex, which is responsible for planning behavior, or in the anterior cingulate cortex, which is associated with cognitive control, use blood sugar more efficiently after repeated challenges. Or maybe one of the chemical messengers that neurons use to communicate with one another is produced in larger quantities after it has been used up repeatedly, thereby improving the brain's willpower capacity.
 Whatever the explanation, consistently doing any activity that requires self-control seems to increase willpower -- and the ability to resist impulses and delay gratification is highly associated with success in life.

HEADLINE: How Immigrants Saved Social Security

 BODY:
Immigration is good for the financial health of Social Security because more workers mean more tax revenue. Illegal immigration, it turns out, is even better than legal immigration. In the fine print of the 2008 annual report on Social Security, released last week, the program's trustees noted that growing numbers of ''other than legal'' workers are expected to bolster the program over the coming decades. 
 One reason is that many undocumented workers pay taxes during their work lives but don't collect benefits later. Another is that undocumented workers are entering the United States at ever younger ages and are expected to have more children while they're here than if they arrived at later ages. The result is a substantial increase in the number of working-age people paying taxes, but a relatively smaller increase in the number of retirees who receive benefits -- a double boon to Social Security's bottom line. 
 We're not talking chump change. According to the report, the taxes paid by other-than-legal immigrants will close 15 percent of the system's projected long-term deficit. That's equivalent to raising the payroll tax by 0.3 percentage points, starting today. 
 That is not to suggest that illegal immigration is a legitimate fix to Social Security's problems. It is another reminder, however, of the nation's complex relationship with undocumented workers. Would the people who want to deport all undocumented workers be willing to make up the difference and pay the taxes that the undocumented are currently paying? 
 It is also a reminder of Social Security's dynamism. As society and the economy evolve, so does the system, responding not only to changes in immigration and fertility, but also in wage growth and other variables. As such, it is adaptable to the 21st century, if only the political will can be found to champion the necessary changes. Those include modest tax increases and moderate benefit cuts that could be phased in over decades -- provided the country gets started soon.

HEADLINE: An Asian Art Moment: Indonesia's Contemporary Painters Ride a Market Bubble

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia 

 BODY:
Thirty years ago a young painter named Ronald Manullang followed his heart, joining the avant garde of Indonesia's artists and producing fresh new images. 
 Nobody wanted them. 
 ''I was hungry, I needed money,'' he said in a recent interview. ''So I quit and went into advertising.'' 
 But in the past year, Indonesian art has caught fire on the international market, and collectors, galleries and auction houses are buying up everything they can. 
 Mr. Manullang, now 54, is painting again, and he is making money. ''It's a very strange time,'' he said. ''It used to be we couldn't sell any of our paintings. Now the collector needs that painting very badly. Before the painting is ready, they already come to my house and ask the price.'' 
 Whatever the price, it is cheaper than Chinese art, and that is what it is all about. Chinese art is hot now and commanding huge prices. In a sort of trickle-down effect, collectors are looking to Indonesia as the next Asian tiger. 
 But while Chinese art is selling well in the United States and Europe, Indonesian art has not yet crossed the Pacific, and its buyers come mostly from Asia's wealthy classes. Indian and Vietnamese art is also rising in China's slipstream.
 Experts date the run on Indonesian art to the ''May 2007 incidents,'' two auctions at which prices for contemporary Indonesian artists suddenly and surprisingly went up. 
 The first of the auctions was actually in April, at Sotheby's in Singapore, where a painting by a young artist named Putu Sutawijaya sold for close to $60,000, 10 times the estimated price. In May, Indonesian paintings drew even higher prices at a Christie's auction in Hong Kong, and the race was on. 
 Throughout the year, prices rose higher and higher, some works selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars, though that is still far less than the millions paid for some Chinese art. 
 In a perverse effect, art dealers said, the prices for Indonesian masters have weakened, overwhelmed by the stampede for the next new thing. 
 ''Now there is a big battle of the collectors,'' said Oei Hong Djien, a leading Indonesian collector. ''They are coming to the artists and begging for works. It is easy for the gallery to sell but difficult to get good painters because every gallery is fighting for them.'' 
 One auction house sent a truck to Yogyakarta, a center of Indonesian art, to collect paintings from young unknown artists, said Eddy Soetriyono, chief editor of C-Arts, a magazine of Asian contemporary art and culture. ''They actually gave directions to young artists to paint what was selling in the market,'' he said. 
 That is one danger of Indonesia's hot streak, art experts say. Instead of developing their own vision, young artists will look around, see what is selling and ''paint for the market.'' 
 ''What worries us is that the young artists are still immature,'' Mr. Oei said. ''They make work just for the auction houses.'' 
 Mr. Manullang said he succumbed for a time, promising all his work to a broker and losing his creative edge. 
 ''Sometimes that person will come to you and say, 'Hey, I need like this, I love like this, I love like this,' '' he said. ''I started painting very, very poorly, very monotonous, because I was just making paintings for one person. So I stopped the contract.'' 
 A struggle is under way for the soul of the Indonesian artist. It takes a strong will today to produce art for art's sake. ''Now I just worry about how greedy I am,'' Mr. Manullang said. ''Can I control my greed for money?'' 
 What the market wants today, Mr. Oei said, is Pop Art with hyperrealistic techniques, paintings by people like Nyoman Masriadi, who he said is one of the young artists commanding the highest prices. 
 Mr. Oei has one of Mr. Masriadi's paintings in his gallery, a hyperrealist Batman with a flowing cloak and meticulously painted clouds in a pristine sky, given a dash of spice with seemingly careless black scribbles. ''You are stupid,'' reads one in black marker, though some of the words have been ostentatiously defaced. 
 ''This painting could have come from anywhere,'' Mr. Oei said. ''It could come from a Chinese artist; that's why it's so expensive. In fact, if he was Chinese, his works would be selling much higher.'' 
 People are buying Mr. Masriadi's paintings without seeing them, Mr. Oei added, sometimes before they have been painted: ''They already have a price.'' 
 In an art gambler's market, such purchases carry risk. The faster prices rise and the more crowded the market becomes, the more quickly the fire may burn out, experts said. 
 ''Those who live and die by the art market,'' wrote Mr. Soetriyono in his magazine, ''are certain that it will not last.''

HEADLINE: Barred From Russia, He Refocuses His Strategy on the Middle East

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
One of the largest investors in Russia has turned his eye to the Middle East, hoping to make a profit before the growing bubble there bursts.
 For more than a decade, William F. Browder built Hermitage Capital Management into a force in the Russian marketplace. Mr. Browder, the grandson of a leader of the American Communist Party, agitated for corporate governance improvements in some of Russia's biggest companies. 
 But in 2005 Mr. Browder was denied re-entry into Russia after the government sent him a letter deeming him a threat to national security and public order.
 Living in London since then, he has turned to the Middle East as the next land of investment profitability. Last year, he set up a $1.5 billion fund, Hermitage Global, to act on his new strategy.
 Mr. Browder recently sat down to discuss his investment views. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
 Q.How did you develop your approach at your new fund? 
 A. The wealth transfer that is happening due to $100 oil is relentless and it will reshape the world for a long time to come.
 We want to be on the right side of this wealth transfer, so one of our big investment themes is investing in the markets of oil-producing nations that are beneficiaries of this ongoing transfer of capital.
 Second, in a world with a credit crunch, where capital is scarce, we want to be in countries that are suppliers of capital rather than countries that are consumers of capital and that are therefore dependent upon borrowing to stay afloat.
 Moreover, it turns out that most of the countries that export oil and supply capital to the rest of the world have artificially low currencies due to historic pegs to the U.S. dollar or other government policies. Particularly in the Middle East, this has created inflation -- much more than they ever expected.
 As a result, we think most dollar pegs will collapse this year and most of these currencies will appreciate, possibly quite rapidly. We have positioned the portfolio in locally listed equities in the markets that will experience this currency appreciation, which in turn will boost our dollar-based returns.
 Q.So which countries are you investing in?
 A. Given our worldview, we're focused now on the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
 Q. What's your investing strategy?
 A. At the end of the day it is all about finding cheap companies in countries that fit our worldview and that are also off the radar of the international investment community. You always make more money when you are the first to a trade -- or when the trade is ''uncrowded'' -- and most of the markets in the Middle East fit this description. There are still very few guys in suits like us running around looking for cheap stocks out there.
 Q. You took an activist role in Russia. Are you using that strategy in companies you've invested in at your new fund?
 A. In the new fund we are able to employ a less confrontational version of activism, because a majority of the companies we invest in are responsive to our suggestions as to how to increase shareholder value. We find ourselves working with -- rather than against -- management a lot more now.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Apartment Prices Hit Record High Despite Slump

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
While most of the nation plods through a housing slowdown, Manhattan is experiencing its highest prices in history. 
 The average price of a Manhattan apartment in the first three months of this year was $1.7 million, up 33.5 percent from the same period last year, according to the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc., which processed the numbers for the brokerage firm Prudential Douglas Elliman. 
 But the record prices do not tell the entire story of Manhattan's real estate. Although prices are rising, sales are slowing, and executives of the four largest brokerage firms in Manhattan said they see some trouble, though not disaster, ahead for Manhattan's real estate. 
 The huge price increase reflects the sale of an unusually large number of very expensive apartments, which skewed the average. In this year's first quarter, 71 apartments sold for more than $10 million, compared with 17 apartments in that range for all of 2007. This year's first quarter also included the sale of dozens of apartments at the extremely high-priced 15 Central Park West and the Plaza Hotel. 
 A number of brokerage firms released data about the first quarter that generally showed the same trends. All showed that the median price of an apartment grew. According to Miller Samuel, it was up to $917,000 from $840,000, suggesting high prices for many types of apartments. 
 The median price for studios rose by 22 percent, to $490,000 from $401,000; and the median price for one-bedroom apartments grew by 12 percent, to $750,000 from $669,000, according to the Corcoran Group, a real estate brokerage firm.
 The firms disagree, however, on the extent of the slowdown in sales in the first quarter. According to Prudential Douglas Elliman, the number of sales fell by 34 percent in the first quarter, to 2,282 apartments from 3,474 last year. Data analyzed by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property showed a 1 percent drop in sales. Corcoran also said it saw a slight drop. 
 No one disputes the fact, however, that inventory is rising, and after a wave of bad news in the financial world, a crucial underpinning of New York's economy, fewer buyers are signing contracts. ''We're starting to see a hesitancy in the marketplace,'' said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead. ''What I look at very carefully is the signed contracts, the deals that are coming to us right now. I'm starting to see a slowdown.''
 So far, wealthy Wall Street executives and foreign buyers have stayed in the market, paying record prices in a range of buildings. The high average price of Manhattan apartments reflects the popularity of luxury condos. The average price of a co-op rose to $1.3 million in the first quarter of this year from $996,000 last year, and the average price of a condo rose to $1.9 million from $1.3 million during the same period, according to Halstead. Corcoran and Prudential Douglas Elliman reported similar figures. 
 The value of a co-op with four or more bedrooms rose an average of 86 percent this past quarter, to $12.9 million from $6.9 million the year before, according to Halstead. 
 The rising prices are not just concentrated among Thurston Howell III types who want to live near Central Park. Apartments in less expensive areas like Inwood, Harlem and Hudson Heights also saw price increases, according to Halstead's data. The average price of a studio rose by 2 percent, one- and two- bedroom apartments by 9 percent and three-bedroom apartments by 57 percent, according to Halstead. 
 Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said that in Harlem, prices rose in new condo projects like the one at 111 Central Park North. In Inwood and Hudson Heights, the prices of co-ops increased.
 ''In Inwood and Hudson Heights, that just shows you it's a decent resale market,'' he said.
 Contrary to the trend in Manhattan, in Brooklyn, overall prices have started to drop. Median and average sale prices dropped by 2 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to data tracked by the Corcoran Group. Median prices in Brooklyn dipped to $549,000 from $560,000, according to the data. Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, said this pattern was typical of any slowdown. ''When buyers become more cautious, the first markets to feel it are those that have been considered to be emerging neighborhoods,'' Ms. Liebman said.
 All five boroughs are also facing an escalating number of foreclosures. The number jumped by 65.7 percent, to 918 foreclosures in the first quarter of this year, compared with 554 during the same time last year, according to PropertyShark.com, a real estate data company based in Brooklyn. 
 The numbers make up a small percentage of New York City's three million households, according to PropertyShark.com. The foreclosures are concentrated in Queens neighborhoods like Jamaica and Howard Beach, and Staten Island's Mid-Island and North Island.
 Brokers are not as optimistic, however, about the next few quarters in Manhattan. Sales in the first quarter were strong in part because nearly a third of the apartments that closed were for condos that buyers signed contracts for at least a year ago, according to data tracked by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead.
 Now buyers have more choices, with an inventory of 6,194 apartments compared with 5,923 at this time last year, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman. The brokerage firms reported that the number of buyers who went to contract in the first quarter was far lower compared with buyers last year.
 Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that in the first quarter, the number of contracts signed in Manhattan fell by 21 percent even though the average price rose by 3 percent. 
 Ms. Liebman said she had fielded calls from several Bear Stearns executives wanting to sell their apartments in the wake of the buyout of their firm. She said that a couple of Bear Stearns executives put their homes on the market.
 ''Wall Street's pain is definitely real,'' she said. ''We will see less transactions, but stable prices.''
 But while the brokerage firms say prices may eventually decline, they do not expect Manhattan's real estate market to suffer as much as the rest of the nation's.
 ''I don't think you're going to see the next quarter being the end of the world,'' said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''You're going to see a market that's a lot more conservative, and things are going to be on the market longer.''

HEADLINE: To Court or Shun the Wealth of Nations

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
A PROMINENT American financier, weary from weeks on the money trail that leads through Abu Dhabi, Riyadh, Doha and Dubai, called in recently with these impressions from the road: ''They are scratching their heads, they don't want to be underappreciated or made a fool of,'' he said of the executives managing more than $1 trillion in sovereign and central bank funds.
 ''They invest in these financial institutions, lose their shirts and then they are criticized in Congress.'' They are really upset, he said.
 And get this, he added: ''If you are a Saudi, you have to get your visa signed off by Homeland Security. I mean, why would you want to bail out a bank -- you couldn't even come to the closing dinner.'' 
 The relationship between client and banker is perhaps the most delicate of Wall Street's minuets, so this executive asked to remain anonymous.
 But his concerns are shared by more and more Wall Street executives who criticize the increased scrutiny imposed on sovereign funds, which invest the wealth of their governments. The scrutiny ranges from calls for increased transparency to Congressional inquiries into their tax status, and runs the risk of driving away the world's largest pool of capital just when the United States economy needs it most.
 ''Why are we attacking sovereign funds when the core problem is hedge fund transparency,'' said Laurence D. Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, which manages $1 trillion in assets, and who has sovereign funds among his largest clients. ''No one questioned them when they bought the billions of dollars of our bonds. I mean, they are financing our deficit. What this scrutiny will do is force them to invest elsewhere.''
 As always with Wall Street, there is much self-interest going on here. For decades, sovereign funds, which now top $2 trillion in assets and are expected to surpass $12 trillion by 2015, have been major clients of financial firms. According to a recent survey, half of that $2 trillion is externally managed.
 Besides paying fees, funds have become something of a lender of last resort for banks traumatized by the credit crunch. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, managing an estimated $600 billion to $800 billion, has paid $7.6 billion for a 4.9 percent stake in Citigroup.
 The Kuwait Investment Authority, the oldest of all the sovereign funds, which manages about $250 billion, has invested $5 billion in Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, while Morgan Stanley and Blackstone have received cash infusions from the China Investment Corporation.
 All told, according to Dealogic, a financial services research firm, sovereign funds invested $48 billion in deals in 2007 and $16 billion so far this year.
 Still, there may be something to Wall Street's lament.
 With the balance sheets of many investment banks exposed to toxic, illiquid mortgage-linked securities, and with the collapse of Bear Stearns so fresh, no one is discounting the possibility of more visits by chief executives to distant capitals. The disclosure on Tuesday that UBS will seek new funds of about $15 billion underscores this view.
 The question is whether the funds, especially those in the Middle East, where capital is accumulating the fastest and where sensitivities surrounding disclosure have been most acute, will be as eager to invest the second time around.
 Citic Securities, an investment bank with ties to the Chinese government, provided a vivid reminder of the perils of buying stakes in Wall Street banks before the depths of their problems are known. Citic committed to invest $1 billion in Bear Stearns, but luckily never closed the deal. 
 What sovereign funds will do is a question that looms all the larger, given that the United States economy is weak and growth remains relatively vibrant in economies like those of China, India, Brazil and Turkey.
 ''There is a concern in the financial community that there have been signals of hostility to sovereign wealth investors,'' said Todd M. Malan, the president of the Organization for International Investment, a lobbying group representing corporations investing in the United States. ''That has the potential to be negative for the U.S. economy at a moment that we need foreign investment.''
 There have been recent signs of an accommodation addressing concerns in Washington that the funds need to disclose more. For their part, the funds want to preserve their tradition of not showing too much of their investment hand. Abu Dhabi and Singapore reached an agreement with the Treasury in which their funds would invest using commercial, not political, criteria and the United States would not impose restrictions on such investments.
 While the accord stated the obvious -- the two funds are recognized as the most professional of the sovereign funds -- it was hailed by lawmakers. Still, rumblings persist that Congressional inquiry may continue.
 Earlier this month, the two ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee sent a letter to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan group in Congress that monitors tax policy, asking that it examine how these entities are taxed so as to help ''understand the role of tax policy in the sovereign wealth fund puzzle.''
 Currently, there is no tax imposed on passive income accruing to foreign governments from investments in the United States. But any hint that sovereign funds may have their tax status questioned would be one more reason for them to take their business elsewhere.
 ''These inquiries are broadly healthy,'' said Douglas Rediker, a former investment banker who studies sovereign funds for the New America Foundation. ''But we should be doing our fair share to see that we get investment rather than pushing it away.''
 The suspicion surrounding these funds has mainly focused on the Middle East -- a holdover, perhaps, from the failure of the proposed sale of six United States seaports to DP World of Dubai.
 Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are by nature cautious, sensitive to maintaining the broad contours of their long strategic relationship with the United States. Even so, some comments by the executives of the funds betray frustration.
 ''Sovereign wealth funds have been found guilty before being proven innocent,'' said Muhammad al-Jasser, the vice governor of the Saudi Monetary Agency, earlier this year. The agency oversees $300 billion in government funds and has yet to make a publicly disclosed investment in a troubled American financial institution.
 ''There is a lot of worry about sovereign wealth funds, but all of them are assumptions,'' said Bader al-Saad, who heads the Kuwait Investment Authority, at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in February.
 So far, there is no sign of a buyers' strike. And the region's continued support of a policy that links Middle East currencies to the sinking dollar suggests a willingness to help United States financial policy.
 But, as in all complicated relationships, there are limits.
 ''Since 9/11, Middle Eastern investors feel very frustrated in how they have been treated in the U.S.,'' said Shibley Telhami, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at the University of Maryland. ''The question is if the lingering bitterness from the port deal is going to outweigh the stretched hand of needy institutions. So far, it has not.''

HEADLINE: A Battalion's Worth of Good Ideas

BYLINE: By JOHN A. NAGL. 
John A. Nagl, an Army lieutenant colonel, is the author of ''Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife: Counterinsurgency Lessons from Malaya and Vietnam.'' He was one of the writers of the new Army-Marine Corps counterinsurgency field manual.

 BODY:
THE ''surge'' of American forces in Iraq, coupled with an adherence to classic counterinsurgency principles, has gone a long way toward improving security there. Ultimately, though, success must be handled by the Iraqis themselves. And the key to success -- in Afghanistan as well -- rests largely with a small group of American military advisers who live and fight alongside foreign forces.
 In a speech last fall to the Association of the United States Army, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates argued that the most important military component of what the Pentagon calls the ''long war'' against radical extremists will not be the fighting we do ourselves but how we ''empower our partners to defend and govern their own countries.'' This is something we know how to do, though we often move too slowly in shifting the burden of fighting from our own troops to those we are trying to help. 
 Based on American experiences in Korea, Vietnam, El Salvador and now in Iraq and Afghanistan, an advisory strategy can help the Iraqi Army and security forces beat Al Qaeda and protect their country. (Obviously, these are my personal views, and do not represent those of the Army.) However, doing so will require America's ground forces to provide at least 20,000 combat advisers for the duration of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- men and women specially equipped and trained to help foreign forces bear a greater share of the combat load. 
 Unfortunately, America's military did not have the advisory capacity it should have had after major combat operations ceased. The first attempt to create a new Iraqi Army was farmed out to private contractors. When that effort failed, and it became clear that the assistance needed to help the fledgling Iraqi Army far exceeded the capability of the Army's Special Forces, regular Army troops were called on to fill the gap. Given their lack of training, these soldiers did remarkably well, but it was always a stopgap measure.
 Fortunately, the advisory effort has been improved in the last couple of years. No longer do our troops receive training of varying quality conducted at different Army posts; since 2006, all Army, Navy and Air Force adviser training has been centralized at Fort Riley, Kan., under the Army's First Infantry Division, where I lead one of the training battalions engaged in this effort. 
 Graduates deploy in 10- to 16-person teams that embed with Iraqi and Afghan security forces, assist in their training and accompany them into combat. Not only does this give those foreign troops exposure to our military tactics, it also provides a critical link to American artillery, air support and logistics during operations. Still, we have not seen the urgency the mission requires. 
 Doctrine -- a standard enumeration of the purpose of a military organization and how it will accomplish its goals -- is still nonexistent for the adviser mission. Organization is inconsistent, for example, with most Afghanistan teams consisting of 16 soldiers with no medic, while most Iraq teams contain 11 soldiers, including a medic. The fact is, both types of teams are too small for the tasks they have been assigned, and many consequently have been augmented on the ground by regular troops on an ad hoc basis.
 This is simply because not enough advisers are being produced -- just 5,000 per year. We are going to need ever more experienced, trained advisers as the size and complexity of the Iraqi and Afghan police forces and armies grow and as the combat burden increasingly shifts to them. 
 Part of the problem is institutional. The United States military's ability in battle is unmatched, but we have a spotty history in terms of helping allies fight for themselves. Advisers who live and fight with a struggling ''poor cousin'' local army often do their dangerous and sometimes frustrating work out of sight of the brass, and it can be a career-killer for ambitious young officers.
 In Vietnam, the advisory effort got off to a slow start and was too often neglected in favor of United States-only operations. Only after Washington committed in 1969 to so-called Vietnamization at the direction of President Richard M. Nixon did advisers get the resources and recognition they deserved, and by then it was too late. In the words of an (anonymous) Army officer who served in that war, ''Our military institution seems to be prevented by its own doctrinal rigidity from understanding the nature of this war and from making the necessary modifications to apply its power more intelligently, more economically and, above all, more relevantly.'' 
 Too much of that statement still rings true today. In the long term, we need to institutionalize our ability to field advisers and provide effective military assistance to allies. As it stands now, the troops we train at Fort Riley do their tour and are then moved back into conventional roles, while the embedded training teams are demobilized. This is as senseless as if in World War II we had decided that the First Infantry Division, which had gone ashore in North Africa and Sicily, was to be disbanded and replaced on D-Day with a division that had no experience landing on hostile ground. What we need, even after the Iraq and Afghanistan missions have ended, is a standing advisory corps of about 20,000 troops that can deploy wherever in the world we need to get our allies up to speed. 
 Ultimately, a successful shift of the combat load from American forces to the Iraqi and Afghan armies depends on four things. 
 First, United States military and civilian leadership must recognize that resources to support this major shift in strategy have to be re-routed from our regular forces. Left to themselves, the military services will inevitably neglect advisory efforts to sustain conventional forces. It took presidential direction to Vietnamize the war in Southeast Asia, and it will take a similar push to successfully ''Iraqify'' this war. 
 Second, shifting the burden from our forces to Iraqi and Afghan troops will call for close coordination between our civilian leadership and commanders in the field. Even as American combat forces draw down in favor of adviser-supported local armies, American combat support in the form of firepower, intelligence and logistics will continue to be crucial, possibly to the tune of tens of thousands of Americans in the combat zone. Politically, that may be a tough sell at home, but the success we're finally seeing will falter without a continued American presence. 
 Third, the United States' success depends on the willingness of the Iraqi and Afghan armies to fight with tenacity and skill. Soldiers of both countries are good fighters when well led. But we'll let them down if we don't send more and larger teams to embed with locals. 
 Finally, the American people must continue to be patient. In the 20th century, the average counterinsurgency campaign took nine years. The campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan are likely to run longer, and other commitments loom in this protracted struggle against Al Qaeda and its imitators. Bitter experience has long recognized that only local armies can ultimately prevail in counterinsurgency operations. 
 For the United States, helping our friends defend themselves will be critical for victory in the long war, and improving our adviser capacity will be the foundation of a long-term strategy.

HEADLINE: Equal Time for Mental Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Murky Politics of Mind-Body'' (Week in Review, March 30) addresses the debate over mental health insurance parity legislation passed by the House of Representatives in March. This long-overdue legislation requires insurance companies to provide coverage for mental illnesses on a par with other medical coverage.
 Regarding the ''mind-body problem'' described in the article, the brain is part of the body, and mental illnesses have clear physical as well as behavioral indicators. It's not murky. Mental illnesses are real illnesses that can be accurately diagnosed and effectively treated, with success rates that rival treatments for heart disease and cancer. 
 Research shows that parity can be achieved without a significant increase in cost. It's time to end discrimination in health insurance coverage. 
 Carolyn B. Robinowitz
 Washington, April 1, 2008
 The writer is president of the American Psychiatric Association.
 To the Editor:
 Neuroscience has been making progress in understanding the correlates of mental disorders (as well as in understanding how successful psychotherapy alters the brain), but the case for mental health parity does not depend on resolving the age-old question of the mind-body relationship.
 An equally good reason to favor parity is that it would encourage therapy for millions whose untreated conditions result in lost time from work, impaired productivity, accidents and neglect of health in general, not to mention the costs of personal suffering and family stress. 
 While some conditions are indeed chronic (as in medicine), a large body of research supports the overall effectiveness of mental health treatment. Your generalization that mental illness typically ''never ends'' applies to a small subset of those with emotional problems. 
 George H. Northrup
 New Hyde Park, N.Y., March 30, 2008
 The writer is president-elect, New York State Psychological Association.
 To the Editor:
 As a practicing psychiatrist, I read your article with interest. Diseases like depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and many others are not diagnosed by a patient reporting, ''Doctor, I feel hopeless.'' Research has shown that many psychiatric diagnoses are at least as reliable and valid as medical diagnoses.
 Also, the idea that treating an illness is justified only when it can be tested for, would show up on autopsy or can be cured would be news to the millions of Americans who suffer from chronic pain, migraines and many other chronic diseases that would not fit those criteria. 
 It is not true that ''mental illness never ends.'' The suffering of mental illness can be effectively treated. 
 I feel extremely fortunate to be practicing medicine in Massachusetts, where we have a mental health parity law that allows me to offer my patients appropriate and compassionate care.
 Richard Gomberg
 Newton, Mass., March 31, 2008
 The writer served as a Congressional fellow working on mental health policy for Senator Paul Wellstone.
 To the Editor:
 One of the advantages of questioning how ''real'' mental illnesses are and whether health insurance should cover its treatments is that society gets to avoid acknowledging how much we are already paying dearly for its effects. 
 Philosophical and biological questions aside, mental illnesses cost billions in health care costs, disability benefits, economic underproductivity, the criminal justice system and foster care, among others. These all affect insurance companies as well as taxpayers and businesses. So the question is more how who pays and how much, not whether we should pay.
 The better the coverage, the better the access to effective treatment, and the other costs decrease. Whether we'd rather have higher premiums, higher taxes or lower profits and wages may be a politically unpalatable framing of the problem, but that's the problem.
 Richard J. Moldawsky

 To the Editor: 
 ''Glamorized'' suicide attempts, ''fashionable'' bipolar or post-traumatic stress disorders -- tell that to the person who attempted suicide and who hangs on to life by a thread or to the veteran who lives over and over the vivid details of being left on the battlefield for dead.
 Not a physical disorder -- tell that to the emergency room physician who fights to save the life of a suicide victim who has shot himself or taken too many pills. Parity is finally a recognition that a mental disorder is a physical disorder that can threaten life just as diabetes, heart disease and cancer can.
 I am a glamorous and fashionable suicide survivor. Susan Olney
 San Francisco, April 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Even in a favorable discussion of mental illness, addiction is treated as a stepchild with behavioral problems. Other mental illnesses like depression and schizophrenia, increasingly described as brain diseases, are as close as they've ever been to securing a place in the insurance reimbursement family alongside the more highly esteemed physical illnesses. 
 Maybe it's because the addiction treatment field is its own worst enemy. The loud chorus arguing that addiction is a behavioral and social problem, even a choice, but not a disease, is not doing substance abusers any favors in the race-for-resources parity debate. 
 The scientific advances that are identifying biological and neurological connections for a host of mental illnesses also include addiction. Addiction incontrovertibly has genetic, biological and chemical determinants that predispose some to its tragic course. 
 Including addiction with other mental illnesses is a chance to destigmatize a disease that brings pain and suffering to millions of Americans and their families. 
 Peter Provet
 President, Odyssey House
 New York, April 1, 2008
 To the Editor:
 You say that Representative Patrick J. Kennedy ''has admitted to struggling with addiction and depression.'' Would you similarly say someone has ''admitted'' to struggling with cancer, a cold or a broken arm? Hank Wallace

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
 WHEN Wall Streeters pack their bags for Dubai or Shanghai, they get much more than a plane ticket and coverage of per-diem expenses. These days, moving abroad can mean scoring a nanny, a driver or even a bodyguard. In some locations, it means a tax-free income, depending on how you read the rules.
 As the financial industry becomes more global, bankers are taking advantage of perks that investment banks have long offered to induce their top employees to relocate to another country. Some are even arbitraging the benefits, hopscotching from post to post, collecting perquisites like frequent-flier miles. 
 Recent economic shifts have raised the stakes. Cross-border deals and sovereign wealth funds are big business, putting pressure on American financial firms to staff up abroad. But the flagging dollar has made relocating workers even more costly.
 Many investment banks must now dig deeper to create relocation packages, sometimes dangling chauffeur-driven cars, club memberships and bodyguards when asking workers to move abroad, whether it is to gain experience in established financial hubs or to set up new offices in regions like Russia. 
 Relocating employees ''is an expensive procedure, which is not taken lightly by investment banks,'' said Jason Kennedy of Kennedy Associates, a London-based recruitment firm. ''But banks continue to see the upside.''
 An estimated 224,000 Americans currently live in Britain, for example, and many more are being sent around the world by their employers. Most multinational companies are moving from 0.5 to 1 percent of their employees abroad, and about 68 percent expect that amount to increase, according to a survey by GMAC Global Relocation Services.
 Deals vary by country. In Shanghai, where there are about 70,000 expatriates from around the world, a car and chauffeur are standard parts of a relocation package. In Hong Kong, allowances often include a maid and a membership to one of the city's many clubs, like the Aberdeen Boat Club or the Hong Kong Club, which cost about 140,000 Hong Kong dollars, or $18,000, to join. In places like Colombia or some Middle Eastern cities, it is common to get security personnel, insurance against kidnapping and a bulletproof car.
 What can Wall Street workers expect when they pick up stakes?
 Moving packages differ depending on the destination but are similar among investment banks, Mr. Kennedy said. The minimum standard package includes the plane ticket and at least two more round trips home a year; fees for a real estate agency, moving expenses and a storage facility; at least one month of temporary accommodation; and language classes, if required. 
 If an entire family is involved, the bill increases. Companies usually pay fees for private schools, help spouses with immigration matters and provide advice on how to put together a resume and apply for jobs or pay for training. Some companies cover child care.
 To smooth the transition, employers may also offer lessons with a cultural trainer to help workers acclimate to the peculiarities of a new country, like how to use public transportation, which way to look when crossing the street or even how to order in a bar.
 To ensure that workers will not be burdened by a higher tax rate in a new country, investment banks usually equalize their tax, meaning that the company picks up any tax bill that is higher than it would be at home. 
 Banks set compensation for workers sent abroad by using a table compiled by Employment Conditions Abroad, a relocation agency, which compares the price for a basket of 128 items, including food, clothing, cars and meals, across various cities. Moscow is currently the most expensive financial center for expatriates, followed by Geneva and London. Hong Kong ranks 79, Beijing 95 and New Delhi 178.
 ''The general idea is to have the expat not worse off than before the move,'' said Scott T. Sullivan, a senior vice president at GMAC.

HEADLINE: As a Weaker Office Market Looms, Landlords Bargain

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Just months ago, the Manhattan office market was so red-hot that it was easy for a major landlord to ignore a small company seeking a modest amount of space.
 But when Richard M. Warshauer, a commercial real estate broker in Manhattan, made an offer recently for 3,500 square feet of space near Grand Central Terminal, it took only two hours for the landlord's agent to respond. A week later, they had a deal.
 ''The alacrity with which they shepherded this process was very unusual,'' said Mr. Warshauer, a senior managing director at GVA Williams. ''I just found the response time amazing.''
 The credit squeeze that began last summer put an end to the frenzied drive to buy and sell Manhattan office towers and is likely to slow or derail some major development projects. Now many people in real estate are bracing for repercussions in the leasing market from the sudden collapse of Bear Stearns and the loss of thousands of jobs at other financial services companies. 
 So far, however, the main consequence appears to be a shift in attitude, with office landlords more willing than before to be flexible and accommodating -- by granting short-term leases, say, or installing new bathrooms or returning telephone calls faster. 
 The standard signs of a weakening market -- rising vacancies and lower rents -- are expected to take several more months to materialize, industry leaders said. Rents typically fall when tenants start subletting large blocks of their space, because they are usually willing to take a loss. But at present, financial services firms are not rushing to dump excess space on the sublease market. And asking rents have actually risen slightly, according to some brokerage firms. 
 ''While we certainly believe there will be sublease space coming to market, we are having a hard time getting the firms that have announced layoffs to commit to us what, if any, space they will be subleasing,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, the regional chief executive for CB Richard Ellis.
 She also pointed out that many firms have declined to provide a geographical breakdown of job cuts, making it difficult to ascertain how hard Manhattan will be hit. Even before the failure of Bear Stearns, the city had lost about 8,000 financial services jobs since July, according to the New York State Department of Labor. Economists say each job eliminated on Wall Street eventually results in a loss of two other jobs. 
 It takes time for tenants to shift their smaller work forces to create large chunks of space for the sublease market, so the lag is not surprising, said Mitchell S. Steir, chief executive of Studley, a company that represents tenants. After the stock market crashed in October 1987, it was not until late 1988 that the volume of space offered for sublease swelled appreciably, he said.
 Some companies may hesitate to give up space because the downturn that followed the collapse of the dot-com industry and the 2001 terrorist attacks did not last very long. Companies that shed space found themselves paying higher rents when they needed to expand.
 According to Studley, about 3.3 million square feet of sublet space is currently on the market -- a minuscule part of Manhattan's office inventory of 412 million square feet. Most of that space is being vacated by Goldman Sachs, which is developing a new headquarters building in Battery Park City.
 Only a few of the subleases being offered -- by Nomura at 2 World Financial Center, iStar at 1095 Avenue of the Americas and UBS at 1251 Avenue of the Americas -- can be tied directly to troubles in the financial services industry.
 Leasing volume has slowed as brokers advise tenants not to move unless they have to. Even so, Studley found that 1.5 million more square feet was leased in the quarter that ended Monday than in the previous quarter. The greater volume can be explained by the fact that two-thirds of those leases were for short-term extensions, which many landlords were unwilling to grant in the recent past, said Steven E. Coutts, the brokerage firm's director of national research services. 
 Studley's first-quarter report also shows that the amount of office space that is empty now or will be available within a year has increased by 700,000 square feet since the fourth quarter, raising the so-called availability rate to 7.8 percent from 7.6 percent.
 Annual asking rents are still rising -- to $70.88 a square foot for Manhattan as a whole, up 8.8 percent from the previous quarter -- but Mr. Coutts said the increase was probably not meaningful. At the height of the market, many landlords in the most prime office towers did not quote asking rents, which seemed to be rising minute by minute, so their buildings were not counted. Now that the market has slowed, the high-priced buildings are included in the data.
 One landlord who has continued to raise rents is Larry A. Silverstein. He has 10 vacant floors at 7 World Trade Center, the 52-story building he completed in 2006, and seems in no hurry to fill them. He recently increased the annual asking rent to $75 to $85 a square foot. ''If there's no surplus, and there is massive demand for large blocks of space, there's no basis for reducing rents,'' he said. ''No one is doing it.''
 As building prices escalated during the flurry of sales in 2006 and 2007, many buyers projected robust rent growth to their lenders and are now under pressure to meet those numbers, Mr. Steir said. Instead of reducing rents, they are paying more of the cost of refurbishing the space and providing more free months of rent.
 In addition, some owners are assuming the costs for installing new bathrooms, upgrading heating and air-conditioning systems, and tearing down walls, according to another brokerage company, Jones Lang LaSalle. Such inducements were not being offered last year, the firm said. 
 Some landlords are even agreeing to spare tenants from doing the renovation by taking on the work themselves, said Mark Maltz, who specializes in lease transactions at the law firm of Davis & Gilbert. ''That's happening a little more now,'' he said.
 But though the market may be shifting in favor of tenants, the industry finds consolation that there has been very little speculative office building in Manhattan.
 Mr. Silverstein said work had begun on two of the three spec office towers he is developing at the World Trade Center site (in addition to the Freedom Tower, which will have government agency tenants). In Midtown, two buildings are now under construction without anchor tenants -- the 40-story 11 Times Square, at 41st Street and Eighth Avenue, and the 30-story 510 Madison Avenue, at 53rd Street -- but these days, similar projects are unlikely to secure financing, industry specialists agreed.
 Brookfield Properties, for example, has put off plans for an office tower at Ninth Avenue and 33rd Street, said Richard B. Clark, the chief executive. But he said his company intended to go forward with a $600 million deck over the railway tracks there -- a project scheduled to take two years -- so construction of the building can start quickly when the economy turns around.
 ''We have confidence in the future of the West Side market,'' Mr. Clark said.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Are Down Again, but G.M. and Toyota Are Optimistic

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Sales for each of the nation's four largest automakers fell last month, prompting some executives to forecast a gloomy spring, a period that typically posts strong sales.
 General Motors and Toyota, however, said they were optimistic about the benefits of declining interest rates and tax rebate checks that most Americans will get starting in May as part of the federal economic stimulus package. But executives at the Ford Motor Company said they did not think the industry had hit bottom yet.
 ''I'd like to be able to tell you the worst is behind us, but I really can't give you that assurance,'' Ford's marketing chief, James D. Farley, said on Tuesday. ''At this point, our sense is that the next quarter may be our most difficult.'' 
 A research firm, Global Insight, projects that industry sales will reach a low point in the second quarter, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 14.8 million vehicles, before rebounding moderately later this year. The rate was 15.11 million in March, down from 16.29 million a year earlier, according to the Autodata Corporation, an industry statistics firm.
 ''We definitely have the second quarter the worst,'' said a Global Insight analyst, Rebecca Lindland. ''All of this year is going to be a challenge. Until the credit crunch eases and until consumers feel better about themselves, I just don't see a significant recovery.''
 Honda and Nissan, which rank fifth and sixth in terms of United States sales, were the largest automakers to report an increase on Tuesday. The actual number of vehicles that both companies sold in March was lower than a year earlier, but after adjusting for the two fewer selling days in the period, Honda's sales were up 4.2 percent and Nissan's were up 3.6 percent. 
 Toyota's sales fell 3.4 percent from a year ago, though its market share rose slightly, to 16 percent. Toyota has not posted a year-over-year sales increase so far this year, a streak it has not experienced since the 1980s, according to WardsAuto.com.
 ''We're not immune to economic cycles and downturns in the automotive industry,'' said Robert Carter, who heads the company's Toyota brand division. ''We hope to sustain sales somewhere around the same level as last year.''
 The Detroit automakers will have even more difficulty keeping sales anywhere close to last year's numbers because their lineups include more of the pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles that have experiened sizable drops in demand. Over all, passenger cars outsold light trucks in March for the first time since May 2002, according to Autodata -- though another data source, Ward's AutoInfoBank, which categorizes some models differently, said cars also outsold trucks last June.
 Sales by the three Detroit companies are down 10.4 percent so far this year. Their combined market share in March was 48.4 percent, nearly a record low. Ford's sales were off 7.6 percent last month, and G.M. and Chrysler both reported declines of about 13 percent.
 ''I don't know if I can take another March like this one,'' said Steven J. Landry, Chrysler's vice president for North American sales and marketing.
 Toyota said on Tuesday that it was revising downward its forecast for total industry sales this year, from its original projection of 16 million. Mr. Carter, chief of the brand division, said the new forecast probably would be in ''the mid-15s'' but that the number was not final. The last year that industry sales fell below 16 million was 1998.
 Ford and G.M. said they had not reduced their forecasts but left open the possibility that they would if April and May do not show improvements.
 G.M.'s chief sales analyst, Michael C. DiGiovanni, called the economic stimulus checks, which will be at least $600 for most individuals and include an extra $300 for each dependent child, ''the most important reason we haven't changed our forecast.'' 
 ''We don't expect to see nirvana in the next 60 days, but we expect to see some positive signs,'' said Mr. DiGiovanni, who estimated that 40 percent of consumers would spend their checks rather than save them or pay down bills.
 But Ms. Lindland, the Global Insight analyst, is doubtful that the checks will generate much traffic at car dealerships.
 ''They're not really very big comparatively, and if they're big you've got a lot of kids and a lot of expenses,'' she said. ''The people who are in the position to buy a car based on a $600 check probably aren't getting'' a check because their income is too high to qualify.
 In addition, the high price of gasoline could help sales slow. ''We don't see it coming down,'' Mr. DiGiovanni said. ''I think it's foolish to say that it's going to drop down to numbers that we heard a year ago, like $50 or $60 a barrel or even $80 a barrel.''

HEADLINE: In Frontier Markets, Steely Nerves Required

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

 BODY:
FORGET Hong Kong, Beijing, Moscow and Mumbai. Intrepid bankers, investors and hedge fund managers are journeying to farther corners to do deals. 
 As the subprime crisis and economic slowdown ripple through the United States and Europe, and overinvestment in China and India threaten to create asset bubbles, some long-ignored areas are experiencing unrivaled growth. Financial pioneers are entering the scene from many of the largest Wall Street banks, along with hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds. 
 Many of the new investment targets are mineral- or oil-rich nations, like Ghana, where high commodity prices are spurring domestic economic growth, the political framework is solid or stabilizing, and doors are opening to foreign investment. Others, like Vietnam, are adopting capitalism and creating industries. Most of these places have large young populations that are moving from rural economies into cities, eager for cellphones and cars. 
 Some investors and deal-makers call them ''frontier'' markets, but there are plenty of other names for these nations. A Merrill Lynch analyst refers to them as ''emerging emerging'' markets, while Goldman Sachs focuses on the N-11, or Next 11, developing countries. 
 Deal-making in these countries involves local connections, long courtships of governments and industry titans, as well as a double layer of due diligence. Many of the most successful bankers in the Next 11 have personal ties to the area. They also need a healthy respect for what one banker calls the ''hell in a handbasket'' factor -- political stability that can turn into chaos practically overnight. 
 ''We're looking for new markets and new areas to add to our bottom line,'' said Yvonne Ike, senior country officer for sub-Saharan Africa at JPMorgan Chase. ''There are deals to be done where valuations can be quite rich and yields are much higher'' than in Europe or elsewhere, she said. 
 Companies and governments are eager to find money for projects that range from bridge building to telecommunications tower installations. Investors looking for higher returns are racing to provide this cash, and deal-makers are reaping the rewards. ''Too many people think of emerging markets in a general basket,'' but they have very definite stages of development, said Norman Villamin, head of research and strategy group investments for Citi Global Wealth Management, Asia Pacific. Citi is advising investors to concentrate on markets that are ''one step below the recent maturation seen in markets like China and Korea,'' he said. 
 These markets face a ''two steps forward, one step back'' approach to financial liberalization, Mr. Villamin said. ''The banking systems don't function that efficiently yet,'' he said, so foreign money flowing in tends to be quick, sometimes inflating prices and causing an overdone regulatory reaction. 
 Investors in emerging-emerging markets are willing to take that risk. ''If you do an overall move away from risk, you do an overall move away from profits as well,'' Ms. Ike said. 
 AFRICA
 Tutu Agyare is so certain that the time is right to invest in Africa that he left the bank he worked at for 20 years to do so. Mr. Agyare, who until November was the global head of European emerging markets at UBS in London, left to start Nubuke Investments, a two-fund shop that will invest only in Africa. The London firm will have several hundred million dollars under management and a dozen analysts when it opens in the next few weeks, he said. 
 Mr. Agyare, 45, was born in London, grew up in Ghana, and has spent nearly all his career in London, where he started trading derivatives for the Chicago firm O'Connor Securities in 1986. He was the first black trader on the floor of the London Stock Exchange. 
 ''Africa is not just commodity led,'' he said. ''We're seeing a lot more balanced growth, consumer spending and investment in infrastructure.'' 
 Africa amassed $60.1 billion in announced mergers and acquisitions in 2007, according to Thomson Financial, up nearly 47 percent from the year before. Foreign direct investment in African countries reached $35.6 billion in 2007, according to the United Nations Council on Trade and Development, twice the amount in 2004. 
 Even the most stable African markets, however, have been rocked by turmoil. The Nairobi Stock Exchange in Kenya was one of the best-performing markets in 2006, but shares plummeted because of ethnic violence that led to at least 1,000 deaths after the presidential election last December. ''There are significant risks,'' Mr. Agyare said, that require a ''deep knowledge and understanding of the history and people involved.'' 
 Big projects loom on the horizon. South Africa needs to add 17,000 megawatts of electricity and Algeria needs to spend $50 billion in the next five years to create new housing, Mr. Agyare said. 
 Mr. Agyare said he expected his financial analysts to spend half their time in Africa. He plans to spend a third of his time there. To do well in Africa, ''You need to have an affinity for the country, and affinity for emerging markets and curiosity,'' which prompt you to look below the surface, he said. ''You can't just take the annual report and use it as a given.''
 INDONESIA
 When Gita Wirjawan, senior country officer for JPMorgan Chase in Indonesia, flew to the cold plains of Wisconsin from Jakarta for school when he was 17 years old, his intention was to become a famous jazz pianist. When he transferred to the University of Texas at Austin and warmer climes, he was already an accomplished musician.
 But, he said, his parents thought better of all that. ''I was a music nut,'' he said. ''But they didn't like me majoring in music, so I walked down to the registrar's office and asked what the most popular major was. They said accounting.'' Two decades later, at age 42, Mr. Wirjawan is one of the most highly respected deal-makers in Jakarta. He is on the verge of successfully negotiating the merger of Bank Niaga and Bank Lippo, an essential first step in Indonesia's plan to consolidate its consumer banking industry.
 Last December, he transacted a 16 percent sale of Indonesia's third-largest mobile phone company, Excelcomindo, to Emirates Telecommunications for nearly $438 million, a major investment in Indonesia from the Middle East.
 ''I am happy here because the complexities are very interesting and that keeps me stimulated,'' Mr. Wirjawan said. ''I mean, for example, many people ask me about what the tariff structure will look like in the next five years. In other countries you can have a ballpark view of what it will be. Try answering that question here. I often just say, I don't know.''
 Mr. Wirjawan worked at Citibank and a securities firm before going back to school at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, where he became friends with Felipe Calderon, now the president of Mexico.
 It was at Harvard that he began to see what he calls his endgame materialize. ''I see myself in public service,'' he said, adding that he didn't intend to run for office but to help good governance. 
 ''I take a very long view of Indonesia; it's the only way I can justify staying here. Despite the mediocrity within the leadership here in the past, our economy is still growing 6 or more percent. So you are looking at a huge economy 20 years down the line. That should make Indonesia pretty relevant.'' PETER GELLING
 KAZAKHSTAN
 Last spring, Adel Kambar, a British banker, left a job at Merrill Lynch in London to work with a Russian investment bank's office in Almaty here. At the best of times, this would hardly be an obvious career move. As it happens, Mr. Kambar's jump from London to Central Asia also coincided with an unraveling in the international lending that had sustained Kazakhstan's banking sector. So by the time he stepped off the plane to become a banker in Kazakhstan, the financial sector there was drying up as surely as the cracked-mud surface of the shrinking Aral Sea.
 Still, Mr. Kambar said he had no regrets. He called the move emblematic of a shift under way in the financial world. Financial services, he said, are moving from London and New York to emerging markets. Bankers are moving, too. 
 ''I'm a long-term believer in emerging markets,'' Mr. Kambar said. ''This is a generational thing.'' 
 Meanwhile, Kazakhstan's cushion of oil wealth caught the banking sector's collapse last fall. Now, paradoxically, Mr. Kambar's job might look more secure than those of his colleagues in New York, though steely nerves are still part of the job description. 
 Like many emerging-market bankers, his own background is global. His father is from Kuwait and his mother from Russia. He left Merrill Lynch for Renaissance Capital, which is based in Moscow. He is its chief executive for Central Asia, working in Almaty. 
 The country holds two-thirds of the crude reserves in the Caspian Sea region and is a magnet for Western oil giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, as well as competitors that include Gazprom, the Russian state gas company, and the China National Petroleum Corporation.
 Mr. Kambar said that living here was essential for building client relations. Kazakhstan's society is built around allegiance to clans or tribes where personal and family ties play a huge role.
 ''There's always something unusual about it,'' Mr. Kambar said of his new beat. ''It's more than the generic G-7 banking.'' ANDREW E. KRAMER
 SAUDI ARABIA
 Bassam Yammine, a managing director and co-chief executive of the Middle East at Credit Suisse, recently took a colleague from the bank's London office to see a client in Saudi Arabia. He noticed his guest's discomfort when, 40 minutes into the meeting, Mr. Yammine, a 40-year-old Lebanese banker, and the client were still chatting about politics and the weather. His colleague shot him a panicked look when everyone got up to leave, still not having mentioned business deals. Halfway out the door, Mr. Yammine turned around, quickly discussed the deal and he and his colleague left the meeting with a check.
 ''In this part of the world, that's how you do business,'' said Mr. Yammine, who spends his time in Riyadh or Dubai and traveling the region. ''Relationships are an important factor in clients' decisions.'' Mr. Yammine is proud of his relationships, including one with Saudi Telecom and some family offices, which he started to build in the mid-1990s, when he helped set up Lebanon Invest, Lebanon's first investment bank.
 Much has changed since then, he said, recalling how he had managed the first private placement in the region for the Lebanese bank Byblos and helped raise debt and equity to finance the refurbishment of the old InterContinental Hotel in Beirut. Of course, rising oil prices created wealth and helped the economy boom, but the 9/11 attacks were also a major turning point for the region's development, said Mr. Yammine, who has an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago.
 ''Before 2001, the Arab world was fragmented, and investments either stayed within one country or moved to the United States or the U.K.,'' he said. ''Sept. 11 made the Arab world think more about investing in their own region.''
 Mr. Yammine, who likes to return to Lebanon for skiing and hiking trips with his wife and two daughters, perceives opportunities in linking Credit Suisse's investment bank, private bank and asset management closer together and in advising sovereign wealth funds on how to make their dealings more transparent. This way, they can try to avoid a backlash from the United States two or three years from now, when their money may not be needed that desperately anymore. JULIA WERDIGIER 
 BRAZIL
 Most days, Patrice Etlin runs the Sao Paulo office of Advent International, a private equity firm. But he relaxes by heliskiing, jumping onto untouched pistes. On two occasions, he watched his guide and his brother get swallowed up by avalanches. Both times he emerged unscathed and got help. ''I escaped,'' he said, before adding with a laugh, ''I am in a risky business.''
 There could be a message to investors in those close calls. Mr. Etlin might take a chance. But he is a survivor.
 He opened Advent's Brazil office in 1996, arriving in a boom that was inevitably followed by bust, with the Russian crisis, the Asian crisis, a Brazilian devaluation, economic collapse in Argentina, the bursting of the Internet bubble and Sept. 11 taking their toll.
 Mr. Etlin, who is half-Brazilian, half-French and a former electronics engineer, made it through what he called ''the nuclear winter'' and is now reaping the benefits. His first two funds, in 1996 and 2001, raised $235 million and $265 million, respectively. Last year, his third brought in $1.35 billion.
 Latin America's private equity firms are enjoying plenty of interest from emerging-market investors. Firms raised a record $4.4 billion in 2007, according to the Latin American Venture Capital Association. Initial public offerings on the Brazilian stock exchange took in a record $32 billion last year.
 The newfound clout of Brazilian companies, particularly metals, mining and agricultural firms, means they are now buying overseas competitors. Domestically, where Advent is most active, business is also booming. Advent specializes in taking over family-run firms, so that Mr. Etlin's efforts are spent forging relationships and building trust.
 That methodical approach seems to suit a man who says he considered becoming a professional chess player. But it doesn't mean he is ready to forsake the adrenaline rushes of deal-making. ''There will be volatility,'' he said. ''But I know how to navigate the risk. In the long term, the appetite for Brazil will remain.'' ANDREW DOWNIE

HEADLINE: Thornburg Raises $1.35 Billion to Avoid Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Thornburg Mortgage shares rose nearly 20 percent Tuesday after the company, which provides large residential mortgages, said it successfully raised $1.35 billion in a last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy. 
 In a statement late Monday, Thornburg said it sold subordinated secured notes with an initial 18 percent interest rate, warrants to buy common stock at 1 cent a share and a stake in some mortgage assets.
 The company said it had received $1.15 billion of the proceeds and expected to receive the remaining $200 million after a tender offer for preferred stock.
 ''It should keep them out of bankruptcy,'' said Jason Arnold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco. ''They gave away everything and the kitchen sink to get the deal done. Thornburg will have a lot of constraints on how it uses capital, and now has reputational challenges to overcome.''
 Thornburg, based in Santa Fe, specializes in ''jumbo'' mortgages above $417,000, which have typically gone to buyers of more expensive homes who have good credit.
 The company had long boasted of the credit quality of its $35.2 billion portfolio of adjustable-rate mortgages, but it proved vulnerable to tightening credit markets as investors stopped buying those home loans.
 Until recently, jumbo mortgages were also too large to be acquired by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 The terms of the offering were more costly to shareholders than Thornburg had estimated when it announced plans on March 25 to sell the notes, a Credit Suisse analyst, Moshe Orenbuch, wrote.
 Existing shareholders are expected to retain just a 5.5 percent stake in the company. An earlier plan for Thornburg to raise $1 billion by selling convertible debt with a 12 percent interest rate failed.

HEADLINE: In Fight for Pennsylvania, a Few Heated Rounds

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Michael Cooper contributed reporting from Alexandria, Va., and Michael Powell from Wilkes-Barre.

DATELINE: WILKES-BARRE, Pa. 

 BODY:
The Democratic presidential candidates hopscotched across eastern Pennsylvania on Tuesday, with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton comparing herself to Rocky Balboa in rebuffing suggestions that she quit the race. Her opponent, Senator Barack Obama, struck into the heart of Clinton territory, courting voters in the Scranton area where Mrs. Clinton has deep family ties.
 Mrs. Clinton used the setting of a state A.F.L.-C.I.O. gathering in Philadelphia to begin a blistering attack on the presumptive Republican nominee, Senator John McCain, saying that Mr. McCain ''admits he doesn't understand the economy, and unfortunately he's proving that day after day on the campaign trail.'' 
 ''He looked at the housing crisis, and he blamed consumers,'' she said. ''His plan for the economy is to extend George Bush's tax cuts for billionaires and give a $100 billion additional corporate tax cut.''
 Her remarks came as Mr. McCain was in the second day of a tour to highlight his own biography, and he called attention to what he portrayed as his rebellious adolescent background in a stop at Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Va., where he was a member of the class of 1954.
 ''As a young man, I would respond aggressively and sometimes irresponsibly to anyone whom I perceived to have questioned my sense of honor and self-respect,'' Mr. McCain said. ''Those responses often got me in a fair amount of trouble.'' 
 But it was on the Democratic side where the battles continued to play out, with Mrs. Clinton suggesting -- in what turned out to be an April Fools' Day joke -- that she and Mr. Obama should settle their battle in a bowl-off.
 ''It's time for his campaign to get out of the gutter,'' she said. ''For all the pins to be counted. And when this game is over the American people will know they'll have a president who's ready to bowl on Day 1.''
 Mrs. Clinton continues to lead in polls in Pennsylvania, where her grandparents settled and her father grew up, but Mr. Obama is in the midst of a six-day bus tour there and just began an advertising blitz to try to narrow the gap.
 For her part, Mrs. Clinton seemed to be reveling in playing the underdog, saying: ''When it comes to finishing the fight, Rocky and I have a lot in common. I never quit.'' She made the allusion even though the boxer lost in the first ''Rocky'' film (there were rematches), and the actor who portrayed him, Sylvester Stallone, has expressed support for Mr. McCain.
 Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama campaigned in the Scranton area, with Mr. Obama seizing on the foreclosure crisis to drive home the increasingly populist themes he has been using in Pennsylvania. He scorned corporate executives as reaping lush bonuses while employees are laid off and homes foreclosed upon. 
 ''They call it an ownership society, but basically the idea is that you're on your own,'' he said in a speech in Wilkes-Barre. ''Well, that's not what America is about. It's not the America that immigrants travel to reach. It's not the kind of America that you believe in; it's not the kind of America I believe in.''
 Mrs. Clinton appeared later at King's College in the same city, where she spoke to about 2,000 people, saying the campaign was about ''jobs, jobs, jobs and jobs.''

HEADLINE: Untangling Housing And Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In late 2005, when a panel of tax experts appointed by President Bush came out with a plan to overhaul the tax code, my editors assigned me to see how it might affect the housing market. My first call was to David Rosenbaum, a Washington correspondent for The Times who was writing the main article about the plan.
 The year before, at the Republican National Convention, Mr. Bush had talked about the need for tax reform, and after winning re-election, he appointed an impressive bipartisan group to make recommendations. Connie Mack, the former Republican senator from Florida, was the chairman, and John Breaux, a Democrat from Louisiana who had also recently left the Senate, was the vice chairman. 
 After almost a year of work, the group called for simplifying the tax code with lower rates and fewer loopholes. Most noteworthy, perhaps, the plan would have limited the tax break for mortgage interest on expensive homes -- but effectively extended the break to many low- and middle-income families who didn't benefit from it. 
 Economists generally hailed the plan. John Snow, the Treasury secretary at the time, said he was optimistic that Congress would enact a version of it. News accounts gave prominent play to Mr. Snow's prediction.
 But my colleague was more skeptical. David, who died in 2006, had the ability to be at once knowing and upbeat, and he cheerfully advised me that day not to spend much time on the report. It had no chance of becoming law, he said, because the White House had other priorities. In the third paragraph of his article for the next day's paper, he wrote, ''President Bush had nothing to say about the report.''
 The panel's recommendations indeed went nowhere. And the willful neglect seems especially unfortunate these days, as Bush administration officials and members of Congress are scurrying to clean up the housing mess. As it turns out, the tax panel came up with an important part of the answer -- maybe more important, over the long term, than the new financial regulations proposed this week by Henry Paulson, the current Treasury secretary. Changing the tax code now won't end the current crisis, but it still makes enormous sense. 
 The real estate bubble of the last decade had many fathers. Investment bankers stopped worrying about whether borrowers could repay their mortgages. Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, ignored pleas to crack down on this faith-based lending. Home buyers decided that house prices would soar forever. Real estate agents and mortgage brokers encouraged the fantasy. 
 Yet the people who created the current tax code -- in the White House and in Congress, both Democrat and Republican -- deserve some blame, too. They have built a system that treats home purchases more favorably than just about any other form of investment.
 The biggest of the government's real estate subsidies is the well-known and well-loved mortgage-interest deduction. It allows people to avoid taxes on any income that is used to pay interest on mortgages, whether the mortgage is for a primary residence or a vacation home, up to $1 million in combined loan value. ''Effectively,'' said Charles Rossotti, an I.R.S. commissioner under President Bill Clinton who served on the tax panel, ''it encourages people to overinvest in housing.'' 
 On top of the mortgage deduction, the Clinton administration and a Republican Congress added another break in 1997, in the name of encouraging home ownership. The new break essentially exempted families from paying taxes on the first $500,000 of a house's appreciation after they sold it. So homeowners would not only get a better deal than renters on their annual housing costs, they would also get a better deal on their long-term investment than stock or bond holders (who typically had to pay taxes on all their capital gains). The law encouraged people to flip their homes for a profit, and flip they did. 
 In the Boston suburbs, houses that had appreciated by up to $500,000 since their last sale began going on the market more frequently after 1997, according to an analysis of local housing records by Hui Shan, an economics graduate student at M.I.T. (Ms. Shan controlled for the general rise in house sales happening at the time.) Bruce Bartlett, a former Republican Treasury official, has pointed out that the law went into effect just before house prices nationwide began to take off, suggesting that it played some role in creating the bubble.
 Given all this, the truly amazing thing about these tax breaks is that they don't actually do much to accomplish their purported goal of fostering the American dream. 
 The mortgage deduction, in particular, benefits only those homeowners -- roughly half the total -- who itemize their deductions. These itemizers tend to be upper-income families who would own homes even without a tax break. As James Poterba, an M.I.T economist who served on the panel, delicately puts it, the Jeffersonian ideal of a civically engaged nation of landowners ''wouldn't necessarily lead you to a policy that had the biggest benefits at the higher marginal tax rates.''
 Over the last decade, as a result, lower-income families were left to deal with a cascade of rising home prices without the benefit of a generous housing subsidy. Many of these families were receiving meager pay increases at the same time. And many responded -- unwisely -- by taking out larger mortgages than they could afford. Along with the American economy and the global financial system, they are now paying the price.
 The members of the tax panel came up with an elegant solution to this unfairness. They suggested changing the mortgage deduction to a mortgage credit, which would benefit all homeowners regardless of whether they itemized. The panel also recommended reducing the amount of mortgage debt that could receive the full benefit of the credit, to well below $1 million (with regional variation). Why, after all, should someone buying a $500,000 country house get a bigger subsidy than a first-time buyer moving into a $200,000 starter home?
 On Monday, while talking with Mr. Rossotti, the former I.R.S. commissioner, I mentioned that the housing crash had seemed to give new relevance to the panel's ideas, and he laughed. ''This is what happens to these reports,'' he said. ''They get revived years later.''
 Sure enough, Barack Obama has called for a new mortgage tax credit to make the tax code fairer. Politics being what they are, he hasn't proposed a cut in the current deduction, but his idea still represents progress. John McCain has arguably gone further, saying that as president he would want to send Congress a tax plan along the lines of the Bush panel's -- and then demand an up or down vote with no amendments. 
 It would be nice if the next version of the plan also got rid of the needless 1997 tax break for house price appreciation. There's just no reason the government should be encouraging people to invest a spare $100,000 in a bigger house rather than, say, in the stock market, where a company might be able to put the capital to more productive use. 
 By now, it should be obvious that not every dollar spent on real estate is such a good investment.

HEADLINE: Legislators Reach Deal on Health Care in Budget Talks

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
State lawmakers passed the first piece of New York's budget on Tuesday, agreeing on a health care package but remaining at an impasse over several thorny questions including whether to guarantee school financing in future years and what kinds of new taxes and fees to impose.
 By the time the State Senate and Assembly had adjourned on Tuesday afternoon, the health care portion of the budget -- about $59.2 billion, or nearly half of the $124 billion budget -- was the only appropriation that had been approved. 
 The deadline to have a budget in place passed at midnight on Monday, leaving some legislators grumbling about the slow pace.
 ''We're doing one bill a day,'' said Keith L. T. Wright, a Democratic assemblyman from Harlem. ''We've got 11 more bills to go. So at this rate, we'll be here for 11 more days.''
 By resolving the health care funding issue, though, legislators and Gov. David A. Paterson have removed one major budget obstacle. The legislation passed on Tuesday includes a provision to recalculate the formula the state uses to reimburse hospitals for Medicaid expenses -- a key provision of the budget that former Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed before he resigned.
 But the plan ran into resistance from hospital groups, labor unions and the Senate. The version that the Legislature adopted on Tuesday included new reimbursement rates but contained the caveat that the rates would expire after the first year and require reauthorization by the Legislature.
 According to estimates by the state, the new rates would save New York State $57 million in the first year. But the trimming did not go as far as Mr. Spitzer's budget initially had. The Legislature voted to restore $273 million in cuts that Mr. Spitzer had proposed.
 Because the Legislature is restoring many of the funding reductions and program cuts that Mr. Spitzer had asked for, lawmakers have found themselves struggling to find ways to raise enough revenue to pay for the level of spending they want.
 That struggle continued Tuesday, as legislators debated an array of new taxes. It was still undecided how high the state's cigarette tax would be.
 Several of the tax proposals being discussed would target the financial services industry -- New York's economic engine. Other tax changes being considered included raising the cap on the tax liability for financial services companies that suffer losses.
 Lawmakers, who acknowledged that they were walking a delicate line by attempting to tax an industry that is under immense financial pressure now, were also weighing whether to tax credit-card companies that have revenue-generating operations out of state.
 ''Businesses may have to pay a bit more,'' said Jonathan L. Bing, a Democratic assemblyman who represents the Upper East Side. ''But we don't want to force our financial services industry, which kept New York afloat after 9/11, to give up its plans to expand in New York.''
 Lawmakers were also still trying to decide late Tuesday how to pay for public schools. Under one plan, favored by education advocacy groups, schools would receive money through a formula that guaranteed aid increases in future years. Under another plan, favored by many legislators who do not like to be tied down by future financing promises, the money would be guaranteed for just this fiscal year.
 Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver expressed confidence that the budget would be finished by the end of the week at the latest. ''It's going,'' he told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. ''It's going.''

HEADLINE: A Bipartisan Bid On Mortgage Aid Is Gaining Speed

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and VIKAS BAJAJ. 
David M. Herszenhorn reported from Washington and Vikas Bajaj from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Casting aside partisan differences, Senate Democratic and Republican leaders said on Tuesday that they would work urgently on a package of legislation to help millions of homeowners at risk of foreclosure, with the hope of bringing a bill to the floor as early as Wednesday afternoon. 
 The new pledge of cooperation was the latest sign of fast-growing consensus among Congress, the Bush administration and financial regulators that broader government action was needed to prevent a torrent of new foreclosures and further collapse of the housing and residential mortgage markets. 
 And it reflected the mounting pressure on Congressional Republicans and the White House to extend a helping hand to average Americans after the Federal Reserve's intervention in the near collapse and proposed sale of Bear Stearns, the New York investment bank, to JPMorgan Chase. 
 As lawmakers worked Tuesday to refine details of the package, the new spirit of collaboration raised hopes of swift action on broader measures that some Democrats say could potentially help as many as 1.5 million homeowners by refinancing riskier adjustable-rate mortgages into traditional 30-year loans. 
 At a minimum, the bipartisan package was expected to include up to $200 million to expand counseling programs for homeowners at risk of foreclosure, $10 billion in tax-exempt bonds for local housing authorities to refinance subprime loans, $4 billion in grants for local governments to buy foreclosed properties and a $15,000 tax credit for purchasers of foreclosed homes or newly built homes that have been sitting vacant.
 Roughly 4.2 million mortgages were either past due or in foreclosure at the end of last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. An additional three million borrowers may default in the near future. 
 Both the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee have been working on bills that would allow the Federal Housing Administration to insure $300 billion to $400 billion in additional mortgages, with an upfront cost of $10 billion. The Bush administration has been developing a similar plan of its own that would expand an existing refinance program called F.H.A. Secure. 
 Banking trade groups, while eager to see further details, said on Tuesday that they were cautiously supportive of the plans. The proposals would call on lenders or loan-servicing firms to reduce loan balances voluntarily and take sizable losses. In return, the loans would be refinanced and given a government guarantee. 
 Senate Democrats and Republicans announced their plans at a joint news conference, an exercise so rare, given the partisan acrimony that has dominated Capitol Hill in recent months, that the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, felt compelled to offer a disclaimer: ''This is not April Fool's,'' he said. ''This is serious business.'' 
 ''We know that the smoke out there is a housing crisis, the fire is the economy,'' Mr. Reid said. ''This is a crisis that we have. The only way it's going to be solved is working together.''
 The White House said the Democrats were exaggerating how many people would get help. ''The only way to achieve some of these estimates would be to abandon prudent underwriting standards, and that would only create more unsustainable risks,'' said Tony Fratto, the deputy press secretary. 
 In fact, it is impossible to know exactly how many borrowers would be helped by any plan passed by Congress. 
 Analysts estimate that more than five million households, or about 10 percent of all homes with a mortgage, now owe more than their house is worth, and the number is expected to grow as home prices fall. It is unclear how many of those loans are already delinquent or in foreclosure.
 Under all of the competing plans, homeowners would need to meet strict requirements and demonstrate the ability to pay their new loan. Critics warn that taxpayers could get stuck with a huge bill if large numbers of borrowers defaulted yet again. 
 That risk is especially great in places like Las Vegas and Phoenix, where home prices are falling fast, said Dean Baker, the co-director at the Center for Economic Policy Research. 
 ''In the bubble-inflated markets, you still have a long way to go down,'' he said. ''That's one of the things that I don't think people have fully appreciated.'' 
 A more contentious proposal by Democrats to allow bankruptcy judges to modify loans on primary homes, which is widely opposed by Republicans and the mortgage loan industry, was expected to cause heated debate. 
 The rare joint news conference followed a procedural vote in which the Senate agreed, 94 to 1, to open formal debate on a Democratic package of housing legislation, including the expansion of mortgage counseling and the bankruptcy change. 
 Republicans had blocked the measure in late February. Since then, the financial markets have experienced additional turmoil, including the near collapse of Bear Stearns and intervention by the Federal Reserve. 
 That prompted a barrage of criticism from Democrats, who accused the Bush administration and Republicans of rushing to help Wall Street while ignoring Main Street. And lawmakers then went home for a two-week recess where many said they had gotten an earful from constituents on the housing problems as well as rising gasoline prices. 
 And by the time they returned to Washington on Monday, it was clear that senators in both parties felt enormous pressure to make progress on a housing bill. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee, said that the action on Bear Stearns was a turning point. 
 ''When the Fed intervened with Bear Stearns and so forth, then people said, 'Well, gosh, the Fed has intervened, what has Congress done in terms of housing?' And they are inextricably linked, financing and housing.'' 
 Mr. Shelby said that lawmakers were also close to a final deal on a bill intended to modernize the Federal Housing Administration. The Senate and the House have each approved versions of that bill, and the one sticking point seemed to be a disagreement over whether to permanently increase the size of loans that the F.H.A. can insure. 
 That limit was increased temporarily in the economic stimulus bill approved by Congress in February, to $729,750 in the nation's most expensive housing markets. The cap is a percentage of median home prices. 
 Senate leaders said they expected the Democrats' original housing bill would be replaced by a bipartisan bill, which they said they hoped the Banking Committee would have ready by noon on Wednesday. More contentious provisions would then be offered as amendments to that measure, officials said. 
 Many of the initiatives under consideration by the Senate are also part of draft legislation in the House by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Financial Services Committee, making it likely that anything approved in the Senate would have relatively smooth sailing on the other side of the Capitol. 
 After weeks of often heated talk, including warnings from some Republicans that they did not want to commit taxpayer funds to what could be nothing more than a bailout for greedy lenders and irresponsible homeowners, there has been a more reasoned discussion in recent days about taking prudent steps to protect the wider economy.

HEADLINE: Immigration Issues End a Grower's Season

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

DATELINE: CLARKS SUMMIT, Pa. 

 BODY:
As in politics, timing is everything in tomatoes. 
 Finding and keeping the field hands who can pick 10,000 tomatoes a day during the hot months of August and September is no less a test of organizational traction than any get-out-the-vote drive.
 For 35 years, Keith Eckel, 61, one of the largest tomato growers in the Northeast, had the workers and the timing down to a T: seven weeks, 120 men, 125 trailer loads of tomatoes picked, packed and shipped. 
 This year, however, the new politics of immigration -- very much on the mind of many of Pennsylvania's voters, even if overlooked by the presidential candidates campaigning in this state and around the nation -- has put him out of business. 
 State, local and federal crackdowns on illegal immigration have broken his supply chain of laborers. Most of those were Hispanic men who had come every year for decades, and whose immigration status Mr. Eckel recorded with the documents they provided to him. He kept them all in the file cabinets at his neat farm office -- the Migrant Seasonal Farm Worker Protection Act forms, the Labor Department's I-9 forms, the H-2A agricultural visa privilege forms -- though he knew that, for the most part, it was a charade.
 ''It's a ludicrous system,'' he said the other day, sitting behind his desk in a light brown windbreaker that matched the fallow hillside beyond his office window here, 10 miles north of Scranton. ''If the national statistics are correct, 70 percent of the documents in those cabinets are fraudulent.''
 For years Mr. Eckel went along. ''But in the current political climate,'' he said, ''I just can't take the risk of planting two million tomato plants and watching them rot in the field.'' 
 This is the crux of a tense, if largely unspoken, conflict between politics and reality in a state with 40,000 commercial farms. On many of those farms, crops requiring hand-picking are either not being put in this year, or are being planted by farmers who cannot be sure they will have the workers to harvest them, farm experts say.
 Yet, in more than a half dozen state legislative races, getting tough on illegal immigration has become the premier issue in this state, as it has in many others.
 In the 10th Congressional District, where Mr. Eckel's 700-acre farm is located, the incumbent Democrat, Representative Christopher Carney, has made the enforcement of strong penalties for illegal immigrants and their employers a signature issue in a tough re-election campaign; Mr. Carney is one of two dozen incumbent Democrats singled out for defeat by the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. 
 ''Over the last couple of growing seasons, farmers have been feeling a tremendous amount of stress over the way this issue has been playing out,'' said Gary Swann, governmental relations director for the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau. ''And if people think all we have to do is raise wages and hire local workers, they are simply mistaken.'' 
 Local workers will not do the job, Mr. Swann said. 
 It is a claim hard to verify, farm experts say, because harvesting ''specialty crops,'' as the federal government refers to anything that is picked by hand -- in other words, not wheat, corn or other crops harvested by giant machines -- has been the domain of migrant workers since the turn of the last century.
 A temporary federal guest worker program, which briefly made hiring migrant farm workers easier, was not renewed by Congress last year in the rancorous debate over border security. 
 In Pennsylvania, as in many other states, lawmakers have instead busily penned a cascade of bills penalizing those who employ illegal immigrants and making it easier for the police to check their status and turn them over to federal agents for deportation.
 Deportations are part of Mr. Eckel's labor problem. 
 His labor contractor, Ray Vega, told him recently that he could only raise about 75 of the 120 men who have been harvesting his tomatoes. Some had been coming for decades, living in the simple cinder block dormitories at the edge of the Eckel property during the two-month season.
 Since last year, however, some have been deported. Others have become too afraid to travel, Mr. Vega told Mr. Eckel.
 ''Guys are scared,'' Mr. Vega said by telephone from his home outside Albany, Ga. ''They could end up in jail.''
 Neither the two Democratic presidential candidates nor the presumptive Republican presidential nominee have spotlighted the pressure brought on farmers around the country by the newly energized political consensus against illegal immigration. 
 After newspapers and television stations in the Scranton area publicized Mr. Eckel's decision to forgo planting tomatoes, he received a phone call from Senator Barack Obama's agriculture adviser, Marshall Matz, who arranged a meeting for later this month.
 But firestorms of protest have greeted nearly every proposal to regularize and temporarily legalize the supply of workers, like the immigrants who harvested Mr. Eckel's crops. He said he did not expect anything to change until there was a broad new consensus about immigrant labor, which might never happen.
 ''I'm going to wait until February to decide whether I've planted my last tomato crop,'' he said. By then, there will be a new president and a new Congress. But the tractors and seeding equipment in his warehouse will not wait forever. Their resale value is good for another year at most.
 ''This is all about economics,'' added Mr. Eckel, who served as president of the state farm bureau for more than a decade until the mid-1990s, and whose office walls are decorated with photos of himself shaking hands with Ronald Reagan and the two presidents Bush. ''I'm not trying to make some political statement.''
 If one were to want to, though, three weeks before a state presidential primary would be good timing.

HEADLINE: Bush Backs Ukraine's Bid to Join NATO, Despite Putin's Objections

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine 

 BODY:
President Bush expressed strong support on Tuesday for Ukraine's attempt to join the NATO alliance. His stand risked a diplomatic confrontation with Russia even as the administration sought an agreement with President Vladimir V. Putin over American missile defenses in Europe.
 Mr. Bush spoke on the eve of a meeting of NATO leaders in Romania at a time when Ukraine's hopes for putting itself on a clear path to membership appeared increasingly in doubt. Two strong NATO allies, France and Germany, have said they do not favor Ukraine's membership, partly out of concern it would unnecessarily antagonize Russia. 
 NATO has expanded eastward before, incorporating former Warsaw Pact countries, including Poland and Hungary. But Mr. Putin has expressed strong objections to letting either Ukraine or Georgia join the alliance; both were major components of the former Soviet Union. 
 Beginning a weeklong trip through Eastern Europe with his first visit to Ukraine, Mr. Bush vigorously embraced a long-sought goal of the president of Ukraine, Viktor A. Yushchenko, who has made joining NATO a priority despite fierce opposition within Ukraine and from its biggest neighbor, Russia. He said Russia had no right to wield a veto over the alliance's decisions even if they expanded the alliance deeper into the former Soviet bloc.
 ''Your nation has made a bold decision, and the United States strongly supports your request,'' Mr. Bush said, seated beside Mr. Yushchenko. ''Helping Ukraine move toward NATO membership is in the interest of every member in the alliance and will help advance security and freedom in this region and around the world.''
 At the meetings, which begin Wednesday in Bucharest, NATO leaders will decide whether to extend full membership to three countries -- Albania, Croatia and Macedonia -- as well as ''action plans'' for eventual membership for Ukraine and Georgia. Those two nations have met skepticism within the alliance. Citing the fear of upsetting relations with Russia, France on Tuesday joined Germany and other NATO allies who have indicated they would oppose invitations to Ukraine and Georgia.
 ''We are opposed to the entry of Georgia and Ukraine because we think that it is not a good answer to the balance of power within Europe and between Europe and Russia,'' the French prime minister, Francois Fillon, said in a radio interview, Agence France-Presse reported.
 Because NATO operates on consensus, the opposition of any country can block a decision. Macedonia's bid for membership, for example, remains stalled by Greece, which wants Macedonia to change its name, saying it implies territorial claims to the Greek province of Macedonia.
 Mr. Bush dismissed as ''a misperception'' reports suggesting that the United States had agreed to put off the NATO aspirations of Ukraine and Georgia in exchange for cooperation with Russia on the installation of a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. Russia has vehemently opposed those plans, but Mr. Putin appeared receptive to an American proposal to operate the system more openly and to invite Russian cooperation.
 Mr. Bush said he would continue to make the case for Ukraine and Georgia in Bucharest and had already made his point of view clear to Mr. Putin. An administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate diplomatic situation, suggested that a compromise could stop short of a formal invitation to Ukraine and Georgia, while leaving open the possibility in the future.
 Mr. Putin, whose government has opposed even preliminary steps toward including Ukraine and Georgia, is also scheduled to attend the meeting in Bucharest and to meet with Mr. Bush over the weekend in Sochi, a Russian resort on the Black Sea.
 ''I wouldn't prejudge the outcome yet,'' Mr. Bush said of the NATO decisions.
 Mr. Bush said he was hopeful of persuading Mr. Putin that the missile defense system was not a threat to Russia but rather an effort to protect Europe -- and even Russia -- from a limited missile attack. ''A missile from the Middle East can fly north just as easily as it could fly west,'' he said, referring to Iran, which he and others have indicated as a primary missile threat.
 Here in Ukraine, where Mr. Bush's visit has been met with pride and apprehension, the question of NATO membership mirrors sharp ethnic and political divisions between those favoring closer ties to Russia and those seeking to turn the country toward Western Europe.
 On Monday and again on Tuesday, protesters gathered in Independence Square, where tens of thousands gathered in 2004 to protest fraudulent elections, eventually clearing the way for Mr. Yushchenko's election as president in January 2005. The protesters, representing the modern Communist Party of Ukraine and other parties, waved flags with the hammer and sickle and displayed banners that included obscenities directed against Mr. Bush and NATO.
 ''Just because there were a bunch of Soviet-era flags in the street yesterday, you shouldn't read anything into it,'' Mr. Bush said when asked whether Russia was exerting undue pressure on the alliance or on Ukraine by denouncing NATO's expansion as destabilizing.
 He praised the political and economic progress in Ukraine since the 2004 protests and noted that Ukraine had already contributed troops to NATO missions in Kosovo and Afghanistan, as well as to the American-led war in Iraq. ''Ukraine is the only non-NATO nation supporting every NATO mission,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Mr. Yushchenko, whose presidency has been hobbled by political infighting, corruption and tensions with Russia, said he took heart that support for NATO had steadily climbed in polls -- to 33 percent from 17 percent three years ago. He denounced the protesters in Kiev as people carrying ''the flags that caused totalitarianism and suffering that caused the deaths of millions of people.''
 Opponents of NATO, though, also include the largest opposition group, led by the former prime minister and presidential rival, Viktor F. Yanukovich. Mr. Bush met him during a morning reception, but they had no public appearances together.
 Mr. Bush with his wife, Laura, also toured St. Sophia, a cathedral dating from the 11th century, and an English-language school.
 Mr. Yushchenko defended his goal of joining NATO, saying collective security was essential to maintaining Ukraine's sovereignty and overcoming its ethnic divisions, a reference to Russians in Ukraine who favor closer relations with Moscow.
 ''This is not a policy against somebody,'' he said, his demeanor grim compared with Mr. Bush's. ''We're taking care of our national interest.''

HEADLINE: Clinton's Persistence Could Help Obama

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
For someone supposedly in a heap of trouble, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is looking pretty relaxed these days.
 She hopped out of her motorcade at the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre airport on Tuesday afternoon, chatted with some residents and then took a relatively long stroll across the tarmac to her plane. The sun was out for the first time in days. Her bright fuchsia jacket -- gone was the dark coat of winter -- drew the eye, and she gave a jaunty nod as she bounded up the stairs of her plane.
 Earlier, she had staged a somewhat elaborate April Fool's stunt, with a mock-serious news conference, and later she had drolly told reporters about her days playing half-court basketball and bowling at Camp David. Thursday night she is to appear on ''The Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno and on Monday, ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show.'' 
 This is not to say she has gone soft. When it is message time, Mrs. Clinton is focused.
 But at moments she seems almost carefree, which is a jarring image for someone who has been called upon by members of her party to give up her quest for the Democratic presidential nomination. Her rival, Senator Barack Obama, has more delegates and more total popular votes. The longer Mrs. Clinton persists, her critics say, the more damage to the Democrats in the fall.
 So why does she appear so easygoing? Maybe she is confident in her new message.
 Mrs. Clinton has taken the calls for her to quit and recast them as efforts to disenfranchise the voters. In making it clear that Mrs. Clinton is not dropping out, Maggie Williams, her campaign manager, linked Mrs. Clinton's struggle with a signal struggle for Democrats. As Ms. Williams wrote in a memorandum on Tuesday, ''The last time that we were told we'd better cut the process short or the sky would fall was when the Supreme Court stopped the recount in 2000.'' 
 Linking Mrs. Clinton's cause with a larger one has been successful before. Call it the New Hampshire effect. She gets backed into a corner, takes a few days to find her footing (or her voice), then fights back against a perceived injustice -- the ''boys' club,'' the news media, the disenfranchisement of voters. This prompts an outpouring in her favor, whether because of sympathy for a perceived victim or anger at the forces against her or a belief that some injustice is, in fact, occurring. And then she works it, with fund-raising appeals and pleas at rallies, where she makes her fight for survival a fight for the larger cause.
 Perhaps in this case she seems chipper because her message about disenfranchisement has taken hold. Who knows where it will lead, but at the same time, Mrs. Clinton has ceased dropping negative bombs on Mr. Obama. She and her aides have directed their fire instead at President Bush and Senator John McCain, the presumed Republican nominee. On Tuesday, they began a television commercial in Pennsylvania suggesting Mr. McCain is not equipped to handle the nation's economic problems. In a conference call with reporters, her aides did their best to avoid mention of Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Obama has been holding his fire, as well, and has also put Mr. McCain in his sights. The policy differences between the two Democrats are slim. And while they wait for April 22, when Pennsylvania votes, they are engaging in deep discussions with the state's voters about the economy and jobs.
 Most interesting, Mr. Obama has not called for Mrs. Clinton to step aside. While some of his surrogates have, they have backed off in recent days. 
 Is this mutual disarmament? Is it possible that some kind of rapprochement is going on behind the scenes? Perhaps Mrs. Clinton is responding to polls that show voters find her untrustworthy and divisive. 
 It is also possible that Mrs. Clinton is waiting for lightning to strike. Or that the ferocious struggle for superdelegates has simply gone underground.
 Whatever the reason, it is almost as if a tacit understanding has emerged between the two candidates that the process has to play out. To short-circuit it would anger her many supporters, especially those who have not yet voted. Thousands of people continue to go to her rallies, and her campaign has organized events in post-Pennsylvania states where people say they are thrilled to be part of a process from which they are normally excluded.
 On Saturday, for example, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are both going to a state Democratic dinner in Butte, Mont. Normally, about 600 people show up. This year, 1,500 had planned to attend. But once Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton confirmed they would be there, 2,500 more tickets were sold in less than 15 minutes, said Kevin O'Brien, a spokesman for the state party who added, ''This will be the biggest political event in Montana in generations.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton may well recognize that the odds of winning the nomination are long. But by staying in the race, she speaks to the larger issue of all voters having their say. Just a theory, but instead of destroying the party, this may, counterintuitively, help save it. 
 On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton held a jobs seminar here -- not a political rally but a wonky session about economic development. When someone mentioned how Pittsburgh had been retrofitted from a steel-based economy to the knowledge-based industries, she smiled.
 ''I'm a big believer in comebacks,'' she said, to much applause. The comment fit her economic message, as well.

HEADLINE: Bernanke to Face Bear Stearns Queries

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN; Stephen Labaton contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Long before taking office as chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke wrote an article with some other academics calling for the Fed to demystify its actions and pronouncements.
 ''The 'just trust us' approach may work in a period when the chair and the board of governors command widespread support,'' he and three colleagues wrote in Foreign Affairs. ''But the happy state of affairs will not last forever.''
 It certainly did not survive beyond last month. That was when the Fed played midwife in JPMorgan Chase's absorption of the investment firm Bear Stearns, while accepting $30 billion worth of questionable mortgage-related assets as collateral for a Fed loan that enabled the deal.
 The Bear Stearns arrangement, brokered amid fears of a global financial disaster, was accompanied by many other steps, including establishment of a new lending facility for investment banks and efforts to pump liquidity into the turbulent financial markets. 
 Taken together, most experts say that what the Fed has done in the last several months is unparalleled in modern times. Indeed, the Bear Stearns deal relied on a provision of the Federal Reserve Act not used since the 1930s. As a result, investment experts, many Americans and most members of Congress are bursting with questions.
 Mr. Bernanke has yet to explain, for example, exactly how he negotiated the Bear Stearns deal, how he decided to accept the $30 billion in dubious collateral, who set the share price for Bear Stearns and what role was played by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former Goldman Sachs executive.
 On Wednesday the Fed chief begins two days of testimony, his first opportunity to answer some of these questions. They are certain to focus not only on Bear Stearns but also on why the Fed and others let things deteriorate to the point of crisis, and whether their actions should serve as a precedent or guideline for the future of regulation of the financial sector.
 ''There's a lot of concern that this was done ad hoc,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, which is to hold the hearings on Wednesday, referring to Bear Stearns. ''The irony is that very few people are saying, 'You shouldn't have done it.' A lot of people have questions about the before and after.''
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has also signaled that at his panel's hearing on Thursday he will ask Mr. Bernanke about Bear Stearns and why the financial sector's problems were allowed to fester.
 The nation's trust in the Fed and the administration, Mr. Dodd said this week, ''has been shattered -- not because regulators did too much, but because they did too little.'' 
 Both Mr. Bernanke and Timothy F. Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, who worked on the Bear Stearns deal, have an unusually delicate challenge at the hearings, many specialists say.
 On the one hand, they are expected to be quite explicit, detailing the enormous risks they saw in the global financial system if they did not act. On the other hand, they are said to be extremely concerned about not stoking anxieties further; both are known to think that the situation remains perilous.
 ''I think he's going to get more praise than criticism,'' said Alan S. Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton and a former Fed vice chairman, referring to Mr. Bernanke. 
 ''But what nobody's done yet, because Secretary Paulson has been unwilling to, and the Fed is too taciturn, is to explain clearly to the public what they saw happening and the time and why they acted as they did,'' Mr. Blinder added. 
 Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Geithner have also not commented specifically on Mr. Paulson's proposals to overhaul the regulatory superstructure that is charged with overseeing the American financial landscape.
 Many expect them to steer clear of specifics but to warn that if the Fed were given greater authority, it should also be given tools to exercise it, possibly including ways to ensure that financial institutions like investment banks adhere to tough standards of safety and solvency.
 Fed lawyers argue that the agency's actions were consistent with Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which gives it authority to lend not just to banks, but to any corporation or partnership that cannot get credit elsewhere.
 The statute was last used in the 1930s, when the Fed lent small sums in the range of a few hundred thousand dollars to companies with good balance sheets that were engulfed in the banking crisis of the Great Depression. It was revised in the 1960s to provide funds to troubled savings and loan concerns, but was not used at that time.
 The Bear Stearns action may have been consistent with the Fed's mandate, but it also is widely seen to have thrust the Fed into a new world, for the first time making it a holder of a package of mortgage assets, the value and even the content of which have not been disclosed. Much has been made in Congress about the possibility of the Fed taking a loss at the taxpayers' expense.
 To avoid a conflict of interest, the Fed has tapped BlackRock Financial Management, a private company that manages more than $1 trillion in assets, to assess the value of the securities and secure the best value for them.
 ''The Fed has been active, innovative and aggressive, but there are questions about its transparency,'' said Lawrence H. Meyer, an economist and former Fed governor. Its actions, he said, ''go against a longstanding principle of the Fed not taking on such an explicit credit risk.''
 A final question that Mr. Bernanke is certain to be asked is whether the Fed's actions in shoring up one financial institution conflicts, at least potentially, with its other goal of keeping inflation under control.
 ''The key theoretical question is whether the lender of last resort should also supervise monetary policy,'' said Martin Mayer, author of several books on the banking system. ''Monetary policy really has to be made for the sake of the country and the economy, not one piece of it.''
 But others say that the Fed is accustomed to balancing the goals of preserving economic growth while curbing inflation by raising interest rates.
 ''At times those goals are in conflict,'' said Robert E. Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and longtime economic policy adviser. ''The old saying is, you can't hit two targets with one arrow. You can't hit two targets at the same time, always and all the time. Clearly they've put aside inflation concerns for the moment, because they don't want the economy to tank.''

HEADLINE: Two Big Banks In Europe Hurt By Credit Woes

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and JULIA WERDIGIER; Gregory Roth in New York and David Jolly in Paris contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The mortgage crisis set off fresh shock waves Tuesday, with the biggest banks in Switzerland and Germany announcing huge write-downs totaling $23 billion, adding to the hundreds of billions in losses that financial firms already face from the subprime mortgage fallout.
 Despite the continuing global tide of red ink, investors seized on hopes that the crisis may have hit bottom. Dow Jones industrial average surged more than 3 percent, or nearly 392 points.
 They were also encouraged by announcements that UBS of Switzerland is close to raising $15 billion in fresh capital and Lehman Brothers is close to raising $4 billion, a sign that investors have not given up on banks. 
 Even so, some analysts say that the optimism may be premature, reflecting wishful thinking more than economic realities. 
 ''The market has been consistently wrong each time they tried to find a bottom,'' said Meredith Whitney, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, noting that earlier stock rallies in January and last fall were overwhelmed by more bad news. 
 ''There's a 'hooray' from the stands, but investors don't realize the bench has been weakened,'' she said. ''There's no end in sight in terms of bad news.''
 Indeed, a report issued Tuesday by Morgan Stanley concluded that investment banks face their worst crisis in 30 years, surpassing the global financial upheavals of 1998 as well as the stock market crash of 1987. It projected that investment banking revenue will drop another 20 percent this year, and financial firms will report a further $75 billion in markdowns on top of what they have announced so far.
 ''There have been several false dawns during this crisis,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, who confronted the financial shocks of the late 1990s as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. ''One can't be at all confident the worst of this is behind us.''
 But Mr. Summers added that recent actions by the Federal Reserve, combined with bargain prices for certain financial assets, might be ''enough to permit a process of repair to begin.'' 
 Other market watchers noted that Tuesday's big stock market move was different in important ways from previous rallies. 
 Tuesday represented ''one of the biggest rallies we've had that wasn't on Fed steroids,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, alluding to rate cuts the Federal Reserve made in recent months.
 ''What we're in the process of doing is putting in a bottom,'' he added. 
 Mr. Paulsen also rejected the idea the economy was in recession. ''If we're in recession, why is unemployment 5 percent? Why are 80 percent of nonfinancial companies in the S.& P. 500 still achieving double-digit earnings gains?'' he said, referring to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 Reaction to the news of fresh capital for Lehman and UBS was ''quite good,'' said Tobias Levkovich, a longtime stock market strategist at Citigroup. ''Does it mean all the problems are behind us? No. But it suggests the market is willing to look past the valley to some degree.''
 From a high last October of 1,565 to its low of 1,273 last month, the S.& P. 500 fell 19 percent. That is close to the 20.5 percent median decline stocks have experienced over the last nine recessions, Mr. Levkovich said.
 Even so, enormous losses keep piling up. Germany's biggest bank, Deutsche Bank, said Tuesday that it would take a $4 billion write-down because of the subprime crisis, and warned that market conditions ''have become significantly more challenging during the last few weeks.'' 
 That write-down, while large, paled in comparison to the $19 billion charge that UBS announced Tuesday.
 That brought UBS's total write-downs to nearly $40 billion -- more than any other bank's -- and UBS expects to post a first-quarter loss of $12 billion. But its plan to raise new capital quashed fears that the bank, based in Zurich, was facing deeper threats because of the subprime woes.
 UBS's financial woes caused another casualty, however, in its executive suite. UBS's longtime chairman, Marcel Ospel, abruptly resigned Tuesday after months of criticism from shareholders.
 Last summer, Peter Wuffli, the bank's chief executive, was among the first of a series of high-profile financiers to be forced out by subprime losses. Now, with Mr. Ospel's departure, UBS has joined American giants like Merrill Lynch and Citigroup in cleaning house at the top. UBS said its general counsel, Peter Kurer, would succeed Mr. Ospel.
 Lehman Brothers, the investment firm hit by worries about its ability to weather the downturn, is already close to raising $4 billion in fresh funds from investors. That is far more than the $3 billion it said it would seek, which analysts read as evidence of confidence in its future. 
 Financial stocks in Europe, including those of UBS, Deutsche Bank and Societe Generale, as well as those of their American counterparts -- including Lehman, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs -- surged Tuesday. 
 While the willingness of investors to put up fresh cash for Lehman and UBS underscores that they are in a stronger position than Bear Stearns, which was forced to sell itself to JPMorgan last month, the mortgage mess remains a threat.
 Not only are tens of billions in troubled home loans that remain on the books of banks hard to value, but potential buyers for these assets have evaporated in recent months amid fears that a recession in the United States might threaten swaths of the credit market that were previously thought to be safe.
 ''Everyone is trying to kitchen-sink this thing, but it's hard to do so without knowing the ultimate level of credit losses,'' said Josh Rosner, a managing director of Graham Fisher, an independent consulting firm in New York.
 What is more, delinquency rates are now rising even among homeowners who qualified for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered companies that guarantee the bulk of mortgages in the United States. So the problems facing ordinary homeowners, as well as the big banks that hold their mortgages, could still worsen, according to Mr. Rosner.
 ''In any bear market you have relief rallies, and that's what we're embracing,'' he said. ''But functionally, we've not addressed the underlying problem of illiquid securities.''
 UBS said it still owned $15 billion in subprime debt, even after the latest write-downs. It owns another $16 billion in Alt-A mortgages, which are loans to borrowers with credit that is slightly better but still shaky.
 ''We were compelled to announce further heavy losses, but at the same time we have been able to show our investors and shareholders a clear way out of this crisis,'' UBS's chief executive, Marcel Rohner, said in a conference call Tuesday, referring to the plans to raise $15 billion. ''The next chapter is one of discipline and determination.''
 The planned capital increase would come on top of a $13 billion infusion UBS received from the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and an unidentified Middle Eastern investor this year. 
 UBS's problems of the last year are a stunning reversal for an institution long known for its staid, conservative style. Beginning in 2005, UBS made a huge bet on mortgage securities, seeking the higher yields they offered and trusting that the AAA ratings they bore would protect the bank from outsize losses.
 Eventually, UBS's mortgage portfolio topped $100 billion. 
 ''The losses at UBS are staggering,'' Ms. Whitney of Oppenheimer said. ''It's hard to fathom another quarter of $18 billion or $19 billion write-downs, but this isn't the end of their problems.''
 As for the broader market, over the next few weeks investors will closely follow companies' first-quarter earnings announcements, looking for any sign of the recession that many economists believe is now under way.
 Sharp swings in the stock market have been a hallmark of trading this year, reflecting the deep split on Wall Street between bulls like Mr. Paulsen and bears like Mr. Rosner. On March 18, for example, the Dow leapt 420 points, only to sink 293 points the next day. Similarly, a 307-point plunge on Jan. 17 was followed by a 400-point rally the following week.

HEADLINE: Leveraged Planet

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
JUST before JPMorgan Chase announced its initial $2-a-share deal to buy Bear Stearns, Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, held an extraordinary impromptu conference call. The participants on the Sunday night call, who got a preview of the deal, were Wall Street's biggest power brokers: Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs dialed in from home. John Mack of Morgan Stanley rushed to the office to listen on speakerphone. Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers, who had been directed to return home from a business trip in New Delhi by none other than Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, was patched in, too, among others.
 The half-hour call was a rallying cry for support of Bear Stearns -- and more broadly, the financial markets, which, as it was described on the call, were on the verge of a major meltdown if not for the pre-emptive steps that the Fed and JPMorgan took. ''It was much worse than anyone realized; the markets were on the precipice of a real crisis,'' said one participant. Given that Bear held trading contracts with an outstanding value of $2.5 trillion with firms around the world, ''we were talking about the possibility of a global run on the bank.'' 
 In another era, the participants in the phone call would have been an exclusive fraternity of high-powered Manhattanites. But this conversation was also filled with foreign accents -- from UBS, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and beyond. 
 In truth, though, the call was still more of a courtesy to our foreign neighbors than it was a genuine effort to gather outside views. Call it speakerphone diplomacy. The ''possibility of a global run on the bank'' may have been real, but the important decisions had been made long before the folks in London, Dubai and Hong Kong were let in on the code-red secret. The chief executives of Wall Street's top banks had been taking calls from each other and the Fed all weekend.
 So goes the solipsistic world of Wall Street. The Four Seasons crowd may talk a big game about being global -- sending lieutenants to start offices halfway around the world -- but when it comes to opening up its secret society to foreigners, oddly, doing so is still an afterthought. 
 It is not just a problem in business. While the Fed and the Treasury Department often check in with their foreign counterparts, they still sometimes take a view that is more local than global. Mr. Paulson, formerly of Goldman Sachs, can propose a radical plan to regulate the financial industry in the United States, as he did this week, but it doesn't address the larger problem: we're now so interconnected with the markets abroad, whether it be Japan or even Brazil, that whatever we do on our own is almost beside the point. 
 ''We need much tighter global coordination,'' Bruce Wasserstein, the chairman of Lazard, told me this week. ''It is myopic to look at things in a narrow box. Where we've been moving right, the E.U. is moving left. That doesn't seem sensible.''
 If the United States, for example, were to limit the amount of leverage -- or debt -- that investment banks or hedge funds could use, that wouldn't offer any protection from debt-fueled implosions at rival firms abroad. A blowup at a highly leveraged fund in China would still ripple across the system.
 Superleveraged funds have been a major culprit in the latest downturn, because their use of debt to juice returns has amplified the effects on the downside. (Just ask investors in two of Bear Stearns's now-bankrupt hedge funds.) When things go bad, the fallout doesn't stop at national borders. A fund in London may be connected to another in Thailand and not even know it. Who would have imagined that dentists in Germany owned subprime mortgages in Texas? (They did, or rather, still do -- at a huge loss.)
 The explosion in the use of derivatives has only tightened the global links -- and made a worldwide meltdown easier to imagine. Banks and hedge funds across the world are routinely on opposite sides of contracts tied to debt, interest rates or other, more esoteric benchmarks. The collapse of one party (or sometimes just the possibility of a collapse) can be disastrous for the other. Bear's downfall will very likely induce new calls to address the unnerving problem of ''counterparty risk.'' To be more than just a public-relations campaign, any such effort will need to have global reach.
 In case there's a question about how interconnected we really are, just witness the global markets' near collapse in January when Societe Generale, the French bank, blamed what it said was a rogue trader, Jerome Kerviel, for $7.1 billion in losses. Societe Generale's efforts to unwind its positions -- before announcing them publicly -- came close to creating a market panic. George Soros, who was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, declared at the time: ''This is not a normal crisis. It is the end of an era.''
 The Fed, itself unaware of Societe Generale's ordeal, felt compelled to lower interest rates. But let's be honest: that didn't do much, and three months later, we're in worse shape. As Mr. Soros said then, ''I question how far the Fed can go given the reluctance of people to hold dollars.'' In the end, he agreed, there will have to be worldwide regulation of some sort. ''The financial system needs a global sheriff,'' he said.
 A global financial cop is an idea that has been raised before, but it has never taken flight. E. Gerald Corrigan, who worked at the Fed for 25 years -- as special assistant to the chairman, Paul Volcker, and later as New York Federal Reserve president -- reminisced to me about his efforts to create global standards in the mid-1980s. 
 ''I can tell you it was very challenging,'' Mr. Corrigan said, referring to his work on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an institution created in 1974 by the central bank governors of 10 of the most developed nations. ''How do you get 10 countries to agree on detailed, word-for-word provisions when there are questions about what's the definition of capital? Just start there.''
 Still, he said, ''While it is fair to say the cross-border consultation process has gotten much better, there is no question we need a better framework for international coordination of our policies.''
 But even the thought of a global oversight committee to develop standards stirs fear in the minds of people who can't stand the thought of regulation. And the chance that a coalition of countries could ever agree on a set of standards is probably slim. Just look at the debate over climate change, a much direr problem without an agreement on a global solution or even a basic set of standards.
 The alternative -- a global regulatory patchwork, with havens for leverage junkies -- could be just as messy, however.
 You might ask, why do we need any regulation? After all, it doesn't seem to ever help. Every seven years or so, the markets plummet for one reason or another, followed by hand-wringing and calls for new regulations. Laws get passed in haste and the markets improve again. Then we do it all over. We may not repeat the old mistakes, but we have a knack for finding new ones.
 All of this is true. But Wall Street, long thought to be the front-runner in globalization, is actually just catching up. Rules have always been lax, or at least inconsistent. The cowboy culture that created Bear Stearns has been exported to far-off corners of the world. The only difference is that the far-off corners aren't that far off at all.

HEADLINE: Like the Candidates, TV's Political Pundits Show Signs of Diversity

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
 The historic and long-running presidential campaigns of Senator Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton have injected issues of race and gender into politics as never before. With campaign coverage center stage on the cable channels, producers and critics are again assessing the diversity among pundits, who talk (and talk) about things like Mr. Obama's pastor, the Hispanic vote, Iraq and the economy.
 Both MSNBC and CNN this election season have given new prominence to a handful of contributing commentators from varied backgrounds and perspectives: blacks, Hispanics and women. Whether such moves signal real progress in diversifying the punditocracy or merely reflect the needs of a particular news cycle is the question, some media experts say. The most prominent positions on television remain overwhelmingly with those who are white and male, and some critics note how striking that non-inclusion can seem during this election year. 
 ''Whatever progress has been made with contributors and commentators as of late, the cable networks have a long way to go before they look like the American people,'' said Karl Frisch, the spokesman for Media Matters for America, a liberal television watchdog group. He added that white men were the hosts of all the major Sunday morning talk shows, the major prime-time cable news programs and -- except for Katie Couric, a relative newcomer -- the network evening news broadcasts. 
 But incremental gains should not be dismissed even if more change is needed, said Pamela Newkirk, an associate professor of journalism at New York University and author of ''Within the Veil: Black Journalists, White Media'' (New York University Press, 2000). 
 Black commentators under 40 at CNN, like the journalist and radio host Roland S. Martin; Amy Holmes, a conservative strategist and a former senior speechwriter for Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, the former Senate majority leader; and Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist, Obama supporter and veteran press spokesman with international experience, have been ''breakout stars'' this election, Professor Newkirk said. 
 ''They bring such a fresh perspective that we are unaccustomed to hearing in the mainstream media,'' she said. ''Hopefully, the value of having different perspectives will be appreciated beyond this historic campaign.''
 The 2008 lineup at CNN also includes Alex Castellanos, a Cuban-born Republican strategist, and Leslie Sanchez, a Mexican-American Republican strategist who has also appeared on Fox News.
 Donna Brazile, who is black and a well-known Democratic strategist, is also a regular CNN contributor who was part of the team in 2004. 
 Their counterparts at MSNBC include Michelle Bernard, a lawyer by training, who is black and conservative; Rachel Maddow, who is white and has a show on the liberal Air America Radio; Eugene H. Robinson, a black columnist for The Washington Post; and Joe Watkins, a Republican strategist who is also black. Last week Harold Ford Jr., a former congressman from Tennessee, made his MSNBC debut as a political analyst. Mr. Ford, a black Democrat, had been an analyst at Fox News. 
 Juan Williams, who is black and a National Public Radio correspondent, is a longtime regular on ''Fox News Sunday,'' which also uses minority female analysts like Angela McGlowan, a Republican strategist who is black; Michelle Malkin, a conservative Filipino-American journalist; and Linda Chavez, who is Hispanic and held positions in the Reagan administration. A recent addition is Laura Ingraham, a syndicated radio host who is white.
 All the commentators appear when the networks need them, but are on television more than guest pundits from the outside. While a few are unknown to general audiences, they all come with extensive resumes that mostly include backgrounds in journalism, politics, academe, nonprofit organizations or business. 
 ''We're trying to attract a new audience drawn to the broad interest in this campaign,'' said Phil Griffin, senior vice president of NBC News and the executive in charge of MSNBC. 
 When asked how the network finds its commentators, Mr. Griffin said, ''It's word of mouth -- someone says, 'Let's use this person.' '' He added, ''After the Don Imus situation, we had to reflect and say we've got to make a bigger commitment'' to diversity. 
 Jon Klein, the president of CNN's domestic networks, said he believed that the same historical forces that put Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton on the cusp of the Democratic nomination also meant that more people of color and more women were available as talking heads. The channel did not round them up just because of this election, he said, adding that CNN has a commitment to reflect the country. 
 ''With the advent of the Internet, consumers realized that there are a lot of other voices,'' he said. ''There are an awful lot of people writing, at think tanks, advising campaigns.'' 
 Barbara Ciara, president of the National Association of Black Journalists, said that all the election coverage on television left ''a lot to be desired'' when it comes to her members. The black pundits often disappear as quickly as they arrive, she said, and too often talk only about race. 
 A more saladlike pundit mix has been front and center in the last couple of weeks, she said, because of news developments: Mr. Obama's speech on race, prompted by the controversy over the remarks of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr.; and Geraldine Ferraro's assertion that Mr. Obama's race was a reason for his political success. 
 Diversity is not just good journalism but also good business, Ms. Ciara and others said. 
 ''It doesn't take a brain surgeon to understand that a large number of the audience is black, Hispanic and women,'' said Al Primo, a television news executive who invented the ''Eyewitness News'' format decades ago and helped give many black and Hispanic journalists their first breaks. He added, ''If you're a Hispanic-American or an African-American, you don't want to get a sense that they don't understand your perspective.'' 
 With hours to fill, political coverage consumes the cable channels. During the week that included Feb. 5 (the day of coast-to-coast nominating contests) CNN's ratings among viewers 18 to 34 were up 232 percent over the corresponding week in the 2004 election, and, CNN officials said, its audience on that date was 36 percent black and Hispanic. Fox attracted 78 percent more young viewers, and MSNBC was up 400 percent (although from a much smaller base) from the same week during the 2004 election. 
 Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, said that cable programs relied more and more on people who can analyze campaign developments, rather than just report them. So television needs more pundits and more kinds of pundits, he said. 
 ''In the past week we have seen a distinct difference in commentary on Rev. Wright from people who have spent time in black churches and those who have not,'' said Gwen Ifill, a senior correspondent for ''The Newshour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS and moderator of ''Washington Week.'' 
 Recently, on CNN, when Mr. Martin butted heads with a guest, Tony Beam, a host of ''Christian Worldview Today,'' he was able to say that his listeners at his radio station back in Chicago understood why Mr. Obama stood by Mr. Wright. 
 ''In any other year, when Geraldine Ferraro said what she did, it would have been people saying, 'Oh, no, she didn't mean anything,' '' added Mr. Martin, a nationally syndicated columnist and author. He predicted a growing appetite for more multidimensional analysis. 
 Indeed, Ms. Sanchez indicated that she had plenty of television suitors. ''I'm everywhere,'' she said, adding that in addition to her work for CNN, she had recently been on ''Studio B With Shepard Smith'' on Fox discussing the controversy over Mr. Obama's former pastor, as well as the fight over the primaries in Michigan and Florida. 
 She and Ms. Bernard of MSNBC, like the other analysts, said they were not confined to speaking about race and gender but did not shy away from them, either.
 Ms. Bernard, the president of the Independent Women's Forum, a right-of-center research and education institution in Washington, recalled chiding Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, for calling Mr. Obama ''articulate,'' saying the term, when used to describe an accomplished black person, often carries the connotation of being unexpected. 
 Those different voices have injected some new life into the world of talking heads, some critics said. 
 ''We haven't ever had as much talk about women as voters, except as soccer moms,'' said Marie C. Wilson, president of the White House Project, which seeks to advance women in business, politics and media. ''Now there's talk about white women, African-American women, women over 60, and what about Latinos?'' 
 Mark Anthony Neal, who is black and teaches black popular culture at Duke University, said: ''There is suddenly a demand for smart Negroes. You're seeing a lot less of the Jesse Jacksons and the Al Sharptons and more academics and thought-leaders. This is expressly in response to Barack Obama, less so Hillary. Because of the combination of Hillary and Barack, you're seeing more black women.''
 The shift to more interpretation and less reporting calls for greater transparency about who is talking, said Mr. Rosenstiel of the Project for Excellence in Journalism. Often the channels put labels like ''Clinton supporter'' or ''Republican strategist'' on the screen.
 ''If these are people you don't know well, that's an issue,'' Mr. Rosenstiel said. ''Just because people aren't aligned officially, it doesn't mean that they don't have allegiances.''
 Many of the pundits said they had received an overwhelmingly positive response from viewers. Mr. Martin described getting e-mail messages from junior high school students and being hailed by men who shine shoes. 
 ''Even in this day and age, people have not been exposed to a lot of different kinds of people,'' Ms. Bernard said, ''so it's important for us to all be here on TV together, talking about these things that really matter.''

BYLINE: DARRELL BROWN


HIGHLIGHT: For me, the art and craft of writing a great pop song is based on a few rock-solid principles. 

 BODY:
I had no idea I was going to turn out to be a songwriter. I would bet my next year's royalty checks that when I was getting slapped on the butt and crying out my first melodies as a newborn, my parents were not dreaming of the day that their youngest baby boy would grow up to become a songwriter. The family business was an air freight trucking company. So God bless my parents for knowing by my second year in grade school that music was my first love and it wasn't going to be me driving around in the hot Arizona sun at 18 in an Econoline van full of freight to deliver. So with everything I have in me, I thank my mom and dad for letting me follow my intuition. 
I loved performing but I found out quickly that singing disco cover songs on the "amazing ascending and descending" Coca Cola Tomorrowland Terrace stage at Disneyland six nights a week would pay the bills but it would not bring the likes of Clive Davis or Ahmet Ertegun down to check out the "credo" artist shaking his booty in an orange and purple polyester jumpsuit singing "Le Freak" by Chic - especially when I was singing the back-up vocal ("Aaaahhhhhh, freak out!). So after a year and a half at Mickey and Minnie's house, I saved up enough money and quit. I immediately went out and rented an upright piano from Hollywood Piano Store and started trying to write songs. It was a good move. It worked.

These many years later I usually find myself in in Nashville, Los Angeles, New York, London or some other city, sitting at a piano with my laptop computer, No. 2 pencil and pad with another songwriter or artist. We then proceed to vent and hash out our thoughts and feelings, our anger and frustrations, our longings and hopes and try to gently coax them into the shape of a song. And that song must have the three H's in it: Honesty. Humanity. And hooks. 
First, honesty, because I believe that people will only put up with a lie for so long and I want my songs to last forever. For me, finding out if a song is honest or not is a gut thing. An honest song will show innocence, vulnerability and strength all at the same time: "I Can't Make You Love Me" sung by Bonnie Raitt and written by Mike Reid and Allen Shamblin or Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" or "Sitting on the Dock of the Bay" by Otis Redding and Steve Cropper or Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" or Gershwin's "Someone to Watch Over Me." Songs that rise above the songwriter and performer and have a life of their own. 
Then, it has to be full of humanity, and by that I mean the physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual sides of humanity. The big themes - the brokenness and the triumph of it all. So people can relate to what I am writing and singing about. 
Then, finally - and this is extremely important to a song - it has to be filled with hooks, basically because I don't want to bore people to death with all the honesty and humanity I am parading about. Hooks, as most of you know, are an absolute staple of pop music, bits and pieces of rhyming syllables or words, rhythmic chords and melodies chiming in and out and strung together in some fresh way so they never leave your brain, so you can't stop thinking about or humming that song wherever you go. No hooks? Then it is not a great song and never will be. 
Examples of great hooks? There are so many, but here are a few that come to mind. The chorus of Smokey Robinson's "Tracks of My Tears ("Take a good look at my face...."). The refrain of The Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction" ("I can't get no..."). The very first line of the Beatles' "Yesterday" or of "Killing Me Softly With His Song" sung by (but not written by) Roberta Flack. 
I also know this from experience: Not all of the songs I write will be good ones. Actually, a lot of them will be ridiculously bad (experience has also taught me not to show those songs to anyone for obvious reasons). But when an honest, four-dimensional, hook-filled piece of humanity is finally born, there is a clue to recognizing its timelessness. There is a peaceful, non-judgmental appreciation that falls over me when I hear it, a feeling - or even a knowledge - that we songwriters really had nothing to do with its creation in the first place. It's as if we were archaeologists at a dig and all we had to do was chip away the stone and brush away the sand that hid it from view. We were just lucky enough to be in the room that day when it showed up to sing to us.
In my next post, I'll write about some of the work I have in progress.

Darrell Brown is a songwriter, arranger and producer who has written hit songs for dozens of recording artists, as well as music for film and television. Recently, he has co-written songs for country music stars LeAnn Rimes and Keith Urban (including the Grammy-award-winning song, "You'll Think of Me") and recently collaborated with Neil Young on his records "Living With War" and "Chrome Dreams II." He lives in Los Angeles and Nashville.

 MONARCHY IN NEPAL 
 Sliding Toward an End
 It's good to be king, so the Mel Brooks movie line goes, and perhaps even still in Nepal. But not as good as it once was, to be sure, with a vote next Thursday to decide whether the centuries-old monarchy is to be scrapped. And even if it survives, its piecemeal dismantling is rendering it less and less relevant. PAGE A6
 ISRAEL FAULTED ON GAZA PATIENTS
 The World Health Organization, in a report based largely on interviews in Gaza with relatives and Palestinian medical workers and officials, says that 32 Palestinians from Gaza have died in recent months largely because of Israel delaying their access to urgent medical treatment. Israeli officials reject the findings and say the number of Gazans admitted for advanced medical treatment is increasing. PAGE A9 
 BANK SEEKS INVESTMENT IN AFRICA
 The president of the World Bank wants the major government-owned sovereign wealth funds of Asia and the Middle East to join with the bank in investing in Africa, calling on them to set aside 1 percent of their assets to help private enterprise there. That could provide up to $30 billion a year in private investment for Africa. PAGE A8
 CONTENTIOUS TRAINING GROUND
 A jungle warfare training ground in Suriname for the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps has aroused suspicions there about Dutch intentions. Speculation intensified after a visit by the Dutch defense minister, as newspapers reported erroneously that the Netherlands might be planning to establish a military base in the country. PAGE A8 
 BUSH PUSHES NATO EXPANSION
 President Bush, at the NATO summit meeting in Romania, lobbied for extending membership to Ukraine and Georgia. The pitch did not win support from key allies and annoyed Germany and France, which had said they would block any such invitation. And a senior German official said that position was supported by Italy, Hungary and the Benelux countries. PAGE A6
 NATIONAL
 LEGAL OPINIONS SEEN AS ALLOWING
 Harsh Treatment of Prisoners
 A newly disclosed Justice Department legal memorandum, written in March 2003 and authorizing the military's use of extremely harsh interrogation techniques, offers what could be a revealing clue in an unsolved mystery: What responsibility did top Pentagon and administration officials have for abuses committed by American troops at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison, in Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and elsewhere? PAGE A15 
 TRYING TO FORCE A (GREENER) HAND
 A coalition of states, cities and environmental groups went to court to force the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases from new cars and trucks. The petition argues that the agency has completed an analysis showing that the emissions present a danger to humans, and asks that the agency be required to publish those findings. PAGE A12 
 IDAHO'S CANARIES ALIVE AND WELL
 As the real estate market slows and the price of silver soars, some miners in Idaho are feeling less like fading local color and more like the backbone of the local economy. ''This is the Silver Valley, not the Tourism Valley,'' said a miner at the once-struggling Lucky Friday mine. PAGE A12 
 MCCAIN LOOKING FOR RUNNING MATE
 Senator John McCain revealed that he had begun drawing up a list of potential running mates, joking that the list stands at about 20 people but that there are probably 100 people who think they are on it. Meanwhile, the Democrats tangled in Pennsylvania. PAGE A18

 Cricket to Sports Mix
 Cricket is one of those British things that, for whatever reason, never exactly caught on in Britain's former American colonies. But its supporters say it is the world's second most popular sport (no, baseball is not first), and New York City's Department of Education has just inaugurated cricket as its newest league sport, with about 600 high school students playing on 14 teams during a 12-game season. PAGE C13
 WAGES RISE FAST IN QUEENS
 Weekly wages in Queens rose faster than in all but one other county in the country last year, according to the latest figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, up 12.7 percent to $886 between June 2006 and June 2007. Manhattan did relatively well, too, up 6.4 percent to $1,540. The three other boroughs lagged behind the statewide average of 5.9 percent. During the same period, the average wage for all American workers rose 4.6 percent, to $820 a week. PAGE C14
 A SENATE CHALLENGE
 Representative Robert E. Andrews said he had decided to challenge Senator Frank R. Lautenberg for the Democratic nomination in New Jersey. Mr. Andrews did not cite any fundamental ideological differences, but he did hint at Mr. Lautenberg's age (84) and mentioned the word ''change'' three times. Mr. Lautenberg suggested that he would be happy to remind voters of cross-party similarities between Mr. Andrews and President Bush. PAGE C13
 BUSINESS
 TENTATIVE SENATE DEAL 
 For Homeowner Help
 A tentative Senate deal on help for homeowners facing foreclosure is said to include money for counseling, tax-exempt bonds to let local housing agencies refinance subprime mortgages and grants for local governments to buy foreclosed properties. It is also expected to contain a tax credit for buyers of foreclosed properties or newly built homes that have been sitting vacant. PAGE C1
 CAN THAT CAR STILL TALK?
 You're telling your age if you remember when TV operated on a 39-week first-run schedule, with 13 weeks for reruns or summer replacements. NBC's new approach is for a ''super season'' of shows, which are intended to fill 65 weeks, from this June through August 2009. Mixed in amid the super stuff: a revival of ''Knight Rider.'' PAGE C1
 UNITED GROUNDINGS
 United Airlines grounded 11 percent of its fleet and canceled 31 flights to test dozens of Boeing 777s to make sure components of a cargo fire suppression system were operating effectively. It was the most recent disruption in service, with other airlines having recently taken similar actions in an atmosphere of increased regulatory scrutiny. PAGE C3
 TOWARD REGULATING TOBACCO
 Tobacco opponents want the Food and Drug Administration to have the authority to regulate it, with a mind toward playing down marketing and playing up health warnings. A House committee approved a bill allowing for that authority, which has broad support in the House and the Senate. But the Bush administration and some Republican lawmakers have other plans in mind.

 At an industry screening of the upcoming comedy ''Tropic Thunder,'' Tom Cruise brought down the house with his surprise portrayal of a bald, hairy-chested, foul-mouthed, dirty-dancing movie mogul of the kind who is only too happy to throw an actor to the wolves when his audience cools. Take that, Sumner Redstone. PAGE B1 
 MUSICAL GRADUATES TO THE BIG TIME
 Two old friends from high school start writing songs together -- about being in high school. They put the songs together in ''Glory Days,'' a musical. The right guy hears it, puts it onstage, and now it's transferring to Broadway. The creators, meanwhile, are all of 23 years old. PAGE B1 
 KIROV GOES THROUGH THE MOTIONS
 There is an infinity of detail to be learned from the program performed by the Kirov Ballet at City Center, which on paper reads like a course in ballet classicism.

 Making Sure It Sells. Now.
 Maybe it's the economy. Maybe it's just the competitive pressure to produce winners, and fast. Whatever the reasons, venerable brands that have gone stale expect instant revivals from newly hired designers, and if it doesn't sell, it doesn't work. And so it has become more common for designers to be suddenly fired or replaced. PAGE E1
 MORE REASON FOR JOB ANGST
 Time was, the anxiety-inspiring job interview with a potential boss was enough to put a prospective employee on edge. Things aren't getting better: These days, employers are also increasingly relying on profiling ''instruments'' (tests) when deciding to hire or promote someone. Creators say they shouldn't be the only factor used in evaluations, but that doesn't make them any more fun to take. PAGE E1
 ANY EXCUSE FOR LEATHER
 Leather jackets have been evolving every few years since the 1980s, with the WWII bomber followed by the motorcycle jacket followed by the hip-length jacket followed by the streamlined ''cafe racer,'' with some zipper-rich Michael Jackson influence somewhere along the way. Now? It's all of the above. PAGE E5
 GETTING RIPPED AT 60
 The prime muscle-building and fat-avoiding years come before the 40s, as pretty much anybody post-40s who has tried doing either can bear witness. But that doesn't mean it isn't still possible to get those ripped abs and other spots into the 60s and 70s -- perhaps even without performance-enhancing help -- and compete in bodybuilding contests.

 Mark Robbins, dean of the Syracuse University School of Architecture, tries to get his students to make ''aesthetically provocative buildings that can change the way a city functions.'' And to demonstrate his investment in the city, he has done what he says no previous dean has done: live in downtown Syracuse; and he bought a 6,400-square-foot, 1898 bank building to spread out in.

 FEAR OF REGULATING
 To understand the White House's blueprint for regulating the financial markets, start with what the Bush administration did not do. It did not offer America a plan to respond to the ongoing credit crisis or to the Federal Reserve's dramatic intervention to prevent the collapse of Bear Stearns. It certainly did not provide a roadmap for avoiding this sort of collapse in the future. PAGE A22
 ADRIFT IN THE MIDDLE EAST
 Surely, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice understands that Woody Allen's ''80 percent of success is showing up'' does not apply to the deadly serious business of Middle East peacemaking. Yet despite 14 trips to the region in the past 15 months -- and the November peace conference in Annapolis -- Ms. Rice has frighteningly little to show for her presence. PAGE A22

HEADLINE: No Quick Fixes, but Walsh Has Promise of So Much More

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Lawyer that he is, Donnie Walsh mumbled ''habeas corpus'' as he sat down to meet the print media Wednesday in his first charming minutes as president of the decidedly uncharming Knicks.
 Because he is a lawyer, Walsh toyed with us as we tried to get him to give us a Perry Mason-style admission of what he intended to do with Isiah Thomas and the mismatched set of incompetents collected by Thomas and the ownership. 
 At one point, Walsh said, ''I just got here yesterday,'' which is not the same thing as saying, ''I was born yesterday,'' which he was not, at age 67. Even Indianapolis is connected to the rest of the league via Internet and cellphones and television and stuff like that. 
 The N.B.A. is essentially a small village, and small villages gossip, and surely Walsh has done his due diligence and knows that the Knicks are one of the most ghastly nonteams in the history of the N.B.A. and need to be broken up, starting at the top.
 Walsh demonstrated respect for Thomas, saying he had been hesitant to approve of Larry Bird's firing Thomas in Indiana when Thomas was a promising younger coach. Walsh said that Thomas, anybody, deserved a professional private conversation before any decisions were made. He was discreet and polite and yet interesting. We are not used to that at Madison Square Garden. 
 Undoubtedly, Walsh knows from the thousands of grapevines available to him that Thomas has been a dead man walking for weeks and months, the fire gone out of him. The great player put together a rotten team and coached it in rotten fashion, and now the easiest part of Walsh's job will be to make Thomas a consultant or some other face-saving title.
 The hard part will be getting rid of the plodders who are contractually attached to the Knicks for years to come. That will be Thomas's legacy. 
 The nice part about Walsh was that he did not condescend. He still has Noo Yawk concrete in his speech, having moved from Manhattan to Brooklyn to Astoria, Queens, to upstate to the Riverdale section of the Bronx as a child, and all his subsequent terms in the Carolinas and Denver and Indianapolis did not boil it out of him. 
 He told of getting a telephone message the other night in the unmistakable confessional whisper of Looie Carnesecca, New York's coach emeritus, telling Walsh: ''Frank McGuire and Buck Freeman are looking at you. God bless.'' Looie was invoking the two legendary St. John's coaches as moral pressure on Walsh to come on board (and save these horrible Knicks, although Walsh would never put it that way). 
 How did Walsh know it was Looie on his answering machine? Walsh swiveled and smiled, as if to say, ''Don't kid a kidder.''
 Walsh is a basketball guy who supervised the creation of the Pacers' Conseco Fieldhouse, with glorious Indiana hoops artifacts displayed everywhere. On Wednesday, he referred to Madison Square Garden as one of the great sports arenas, leaving room for others, including the one in Indianapolis. May he never lose that perspective. 
 The new president is formidable enough to have wrested autonomy from James L. Dolan, the owner, who has employed assorted watchdogs and listening devices as a form of intimidation toward his coaches Larry Brown and Thomas. Walsh apparently would not take the job without the freedom to speak without an underling sticking a recording device in his face. Things are improving around this dreadful organization.
 Walsh said he would try to learn more about Stephon Marbury, as if he did not know that the Knicks' players had psychologically voted Marbury off their island. Even the Knicks have standards. Walsh talked with some enthusiasm about Jamal Crawford and Jared Jeffries and Renaldo Balkman, three relatively lithe and young players, but never mentioned David Lee, the only role player on the Knicks who may actually improve a good team but who has regressed this year.
 Asked about the best trade he made in Indiana, Walsh came up with sending Detlef Schrempf to Seattle for Derrick McKey, saying the trade improved both teams because of their different compositions. There are no Detlef Schrempfs on the Knicks. Not much of anything, really. 
 First things first. Walsh said Wednesday that he had run through the three shirts he had brought with him to New York, and needed to go back to Indianapolis to change clothing. He said he and his wife would move to New York, under orders from their grown children to include a guest room wherever they move. Real estate prices in New York may shock all of them, but inflation has nothing on the incredible salaries the Knicks are stuck with. 
 Walsh promised no quick fixes. Just having him on board felt like something is happening, finally.

HEADLINE: Rise in Wages in Queens Is Almost Highest in U.S.

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Fear of more trouble on Wall Street has sent tremors throughout New York City, but in Queens, what may matter more to the borough's economy is the continued flow of tourists and imports through the city's two big airports.
 Buoyed by the boom in the travel and transportation business -- much of it dependent on Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports -- wages rose faster in Queens than in all but one other county in the country last year, according to the latest figures from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Between June 2006 and June 2007, the average weekly wage in the borough rose by 12.7 percent to $886, the bureau reported on Wednesday. 
 Within the city, Queens was the only borough where wages rose faster than in Manhattan. In Manhattan, which has the highest average weekly wage of all big counties in America, the average paycheck grew by 6.4 percent to $1,540, the new figures show.
 In the three other boroughs, wage growth in the year that ended in June lagged behind the statewide average of 5.9 percent. In the Bronx, average weekly wages grew by 5.6 percent, to $805; in Brooklyn, they rose 3.8 percent, to $714; and on Staten Island, they rose 3.7 percent, to $734.
 During the same period, the average wage for all American workers rose 4.6 percent, to $820 a week. 
 The labor bureau data were gathered before turmoil in the financial markets threatened to end the long surge in the city's economy. Those troubles boiled over last summer and have led to huge losses and layoffs at the biggest banks on Wall Street.
 The financial industry is the main engine of the city, largely because its employees are so highly paid. But the city's appeal to foreign tourists and immigrants has also helped to stave off the sort of downturn that some other regions of the country are suffering, economists and labor market analysts said.
 ''The Queens economy is materially different from Manhattan's,'' said Terrence F. Martell, director of the Weissman Center for International Business at Baruch College. ''To the extent it's growing, that gives us a diversification that we don't typically talk about.''
 Dr. Martell said he suspected that companies that ship freight in and out of Kennedy accounted for some of the wage increase. He added that he thought growth in Queens was also supported by enterprises started by immigrants from Korea, Bangladesh and other places.
 ''Many of them, at their root, are import-export businesses,'' Dr. Martell said.
 The growth in those businesses coincided with a steep rise in pay for workers in transportation and wholesale trade, which includes importers and exporters. For transportation workers in Queens, which includes airline workers and those at cargo companies, the average weekly wage rose more than 20 percent, to $1,147, in the year that ended in June, according to the bureau.
 Demand for workers at Kennedy and La Guardia, which combined make up one of the borough's biggest industries, has remained steady, but not everyone is sharing in the gains, said John Perry, executive director of the Council for Airport Opportunity, an agency that helps people find entry-level jobs.
 Most of the airline jobs the council fills pay little more than $10 an hour, Mr. Perry said. One big airline recently raised its starting pay by 20 cents an hour to $10.18, he said. Still, that would amount to only about $400 a week, a long leap away from the average wage reported by the bureau.
 Mr. Perry said he was not aware of any jobs whose pay jumped by $200 or more per week, as the new data indicated. 
 The only county with a faster increase in wages than Queens had was Clayton County in Georgia, the bureau reported.
 Clayton, a suburban area just south of Atlanta, appears to have little in common with Queens except airports; Clayton is home to Atlanta's busy Hartsfield airport. 
 In Clayton County, wages soared 87 percent, to $1,358 a week, according to the report. The average wage there ranked third in the country, behind those in Manhattan and Santa Clara, Calif., the report said.
 Clayton County economic development officials did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Coming to New York, a Science Event for the Masses

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
Vowing to make New York City the center of the scientific universe -- as it is for commerce, art and expensive dining -- a panel of university presidents, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein of New York, the actor Alan Alda, the Columbia physicist Brian Greene and a Muppet announced plans on Wednesday for a World Science Festival to be held here at the end of May.
 ''The most exciting city in the world is going to be a little more exciting,'' Mr. Alda said at a news conference at New York University. 
 From May 28 through June 1, festival organizers say, the canyons of the city will be alive with the sound of science. Biologists will discuss the perils and promises of humans' knowing their own genetic codes. Quantum physicists will debate the nature of reality. Neuroscientists will ponder the mysteries of creativity. The Abyssinian Baptist Church Sanctuary Choir will serenade scientists to demonstrate the effects of music on the brain.
 The festival, the first of what is expected to be an annual event, is the brainchild of Dr. Greene, and his companion, Tracy Day, a former Emmy Award-winning television producer. They said they were concerned that the public was missing out on the excitement and relevance of science.
 ''The general public by and large doesn't connect with science in a significant way,'' Dr. Greene said, adding, ''Science is inspirational, it's exciting, it can influence lives.''
 This will not be ''fun'' science, he said, ''this is the real thing.''
 In an interview before the news conference, Dr. Greene said that if he had to sum up the goal in one sentence, it would be ''to move science from the cultural fringes to the center.''
 That sentiment struck a chord with a long list of organizations that have supplied various forms of support, both financial and logistical, including the Sloan Foundation, the James Simons Foundation, the Templeton Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Cullman Foundation, Columbia and New York Universities, Cooper Union, Rockefeller University and the City University of New York. The festival's main corporate sponsor is Credit Suisse.
 New York University will be the epicenter, and the host of a daylong street fair on May 31. But events will be held all over, from Columbia to the Guggenheim to the Metropolitan Museum to the Museum of Modern Art, and at smaller theaters and lecture halls. A couple of events, on the science of sports, will be at the Coles Sports Center at N.Y.U.
 The festival will kick off with a closed one-day gathering at Columbia called the World Science Summit. Modeled after the World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland, it will consist of about 100 scientists and thinkers, including Nobel laureates and business, academic, cultural and government leaders talking about the impact of cutting-edge science on the world. Science is often included at Davos as a sort of entertainment, Dr. Greene said. 
 Ms. Day, who serves as the festival's executive director, described the New York festival as an occasion on which ''science can drive a conversation that usually leaves it behind.''
 The rest of the program, she said, was divided into three parts. There are so-called signature events, like a discussion of parallel universes and one on the investigation of genius and creativity, aimed at general audiences. Several others are geared toward audiences who may not know that they are interested in science but are hungry for art and culture.
 Among those offerings will be a discussion of memory and the brain as reflected in the film ''The Bourne Identity,'' about an amnesiac secret agent, and a discussion with its director, Doug Liman. At the Guggenheim the choreographer Karole Armitage will present a dance based on the concepts in Dr. Greene's book on string theory, ''The Elegant Universe.''
 ''Audiences can come in for the art and leave with the science,'' Ms. Day said.
 As the presence of the Muppet, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, on the program suggests, another large segment of the festival includes programs featuring magicians, robots, a ''mathemagician'' and the Disney Imagineers, who will explain how science and engineering are used to create illusions. 
 Popping up from behind the lectern, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, who described himself as being from Muppet Labs, extolled the family-oriented programs. The most important thing they could show, he said, was ''that science can be as explosive and violent as any TV program.''
 Then he sprayed Dr. Greene with a can of silly string.
 Mr. Alda said that as a young student he had fallen for the idea that art and science could not be combined. He called the fields ''two lovers who have long been separated and long to reunite.''
 He added, ''They'll have a honeymoon at the World Science Festival.''

HEADLINE: The Politics of the Shoe Shine

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of societies: those where you can get a shoe shine and those where you can't.
 France falls into the latter category. Search Paris high and low for a seat to kick back and se faire cirer les bottes: you'll search in vain.
 There's something about the idea of having someone stooped at the feet of a client applying polish to his or her boots that rubs the Gallic egalitarian spirit the wrong way. It's just not what 1789 was about. 
 In the United States, of course, it's a different story. Unlike humor, which is in short supply, or banned, a shoe shine is freely available at U.S. airports. Walk a few Manhattan or Chicago blocks and someone will be there to make your shoes gleam.
 There's something about having someone applying polish to a blithe client's boots that comforts American notions of free enterprise, make-a-buck opportunism, and the survival of the fittest.
 But free enterprise is a little suspect in Europe. The continent prefers free-ish enterprise.
 Germany is much like France in its resistance to the shoe shine. That makes 145 million Europeans or so, spread from Bordeaux to Berlin, with scant access to this particular micro-service. Odd when you think about it.
 Or perhaps not, for the shoe-shine rule goes something like this: if you can't find one, you are probably in a society with a developed sense of egalitarianism and social solidarity, high taxation, a broad safety net, universal health care, extensive entitlements and high unemployment. Read a European society like France or Germany.
 If you can, you're probably in a place with low unemployment and little of the above social security, a place where capitalism is crueler and more vital, a place not unlike America.
 What I find interesting right now is that no-shine countries are taking a hard look at the state-heavy system that created societies where the incentive to take a job like polishing shoes was low to nonexistent, while shine-rife nations are asking if unfettered capitalism's hidden hand might not need a little more state guidance.
 Call it a rare case of trans-Atlantic convergence.
 The Sarkozy revolution in France, of still uncertain outcome, was essentially about the French realization that a country where it was often more profitable not to work than to work was a country with a problem.
 It was about the admission that the pursuit of a 35-hour week, as the Chinese and Indians strive for a 35-hour day, was suicidal. It was about looking at facts and trashing taboos, not least one that made praise of U.S. business punishable by (political) death.
 President Nicolas Sarkozy and his finance minister, Christine Lagarde, have had the courage to say that tax cuts, the curtailment of unemployment benefits and other entitlements, later retirement and incentives for those working more than 35 hours are essential to usher France from the Big Sleep of the Mitterrand-Chirac years.
 Like other European countries that have beaten high unemployment, including Sweden, France is waking up to the fact that good education is a better way to cut income inequality than high taxes. France has been a country where an entrepreneur ready to shine shoes would have been taxed out of existence before polish hit leather.
 In the United States, rethinking is moving the other way. President Bush has pushed for an America of ''low taxes, weak government and strong religion,'' in the words of David Schulz, an attorney. That's been the culmination of a 40-year period in which Republican administrations have governed for all but 12 years.
 No wonder the country is skewed. What you get over time is collapsing bridges in Minneapolis, decaying infrastructure, massive national debt, rising inequality, a derisory dollar and the unregulated financial markets that have produced the current mayhem all ''under God,'' it is true, but scarcely more lovely for that.
 Even the Bush administration, trying to trump yet another Democratic election card, is now proposing more oversight for financial markets. But only the Democrats have the courage to say that more government and more equitable taxation are needed if you're serious about better schools, new infrastructure, health care and minimum social cohesion. It's past time the balance swung back from Republican excess.
 So, do I prefer shoe-shine or no-shine societies? I favor the former because they give freer rein to the human spirit, but of course I'd like some attributes of the shine-free world, especially universal health care. That's doable while avoiding the entitlement-excess that sent France into its protracted doze.
 If convergence goes far enough, look for shoe shines in France (as long as polisher and client are placed at the same eye level), and a tax on your U.S. shine. I'll believe it when I see it.

HEADLINE: Fear of Regulating

 BODY:
To understand the White House's blueprint for regulating the financial markets, start with what the Bush administration did not do. It did not offer America a plan to respond to the ongoing credit crisis or to the Federal Reserve's dramatic intervention to prevent the collapse of Bear Stearns. It certainly did not provide a roadmap for avoiding this sort of meltdown in the future.
 The Fed's role in the Bear debacle has put taxpayers at risk of having to shoulder big losses, but the administration's so-called regulatory reform does not address what the Bear mess made obvious: if something goes badly wrong in under-regulated or unregulated corners of the financial markets, it could topple the whole system. 
 In fact, the blueprint was mostly developed before the current financial crisis and accordingly comes across as outdated. The message of the administration's proposals is that the markets will -- and should -- return to where they were before the near-collapse of Bear Stearns. It's doubtful whether many of its suggested policies would have been apt even in that earlier context. It's indisputable that they are inapt now. 
 It will be up to Congress -- and the next administration -- to create the necessary new rules for 21st-century financial markets. These include requirements that firms engaged in risky financial behavior maintain large amounts of high-quality capital, other limits on borrowed money and complex derivatives and incentives for bankers' pay that hold them accountable for losses.
 There may be nuggets in the administration's blueprint that would be worth saving for that serious work. The proposal for a regulator whose authority is defined by the type of financial product, rather than by industry, could benefit consumers and investors -- if the regulator has the power to enforce standards. But as Congress moves forward with its investigations of the credit crisis, it's important for lawmakers and the public to realize that the administration's ideas are fundamentally flawed.
 Its proposals are premised on the notion that market discipline is the most effective tool to limit risks to the financial system. Current events show how absurd that is. Discipline was utterly lacking as today's problems were being created. In the absence of rules -- and regulators who are willing and empowered to enforce them -- market discipline is a fantasy.
 Sure enough, the Bush blueprint is weakest when it comes to regulation of the financial system beyond banks. One key proposal would allow the Fed to gather more information from such entities as Wall Street firms, hedge funds and private equity partnerships, but it could take action only if overall financial stability was threatened. That would institutionalize the Fed's role as bystander while bubbles inflate and crisis manager when they burst. That's a recipe for more crises. Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told Congress on Wednesday that broader reach would have to be accompanied by ''adequate powers, authorities, expertise and so on.''
 It's probably useless to hope for anything better from Bush administration officials. They are complicit in the credit crisis because the anti-regulatory ethos and practices of the administration fostered the conditions for the debacle. It's difficult to solve problems of one's own making and impossible to respond effectively if you don't first face up to your role in causing them. The administration apparently prefers to perpetuate the myth of self-policing, self-correcting global free markets, rather than own up to the fatal flaws that are now so evident in that myth.
 In the end, Mr. Bush's regulatory blueprint will allow him to leave office with that ideology in tact -- in his mind at least. The real work will be left to others.

HEADLINE: The Would-Be Revivalist

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

DATELINE: SYRACUSE 

 BODY:
 SEDGWICK, less than a mile from downtown Syracuse, is a neighborhood of tree-lined boulevards, where outsized 1920s Tudor homes with in-ground pools can be had for prices in the low six figures. 
 Mark Robbins doesn't live there.
 In 2004, when Mr. Robbins, an architect and curator who had been based full- or part-time in New York, Washington or Columbus, Ohio, for most of the previous 20 years, became dean of Syracuse University School of Architecture, he resolved to find a place in the city's struggling downtown. His goal was not just to find a space to renovate as a showplace for his modernist leanings, or to demonstrate to visiting architects that Syracuse -- not exactly a must-stop on the global circuit -- might be an inexpensive place to test innovation. His ambition was to help revive, and even remake, the city. 
 ''When I first looked at this job, some people said to me, you'll only be here three days a week. You'll go back and forth to New York,'' he said. ''But what's the point of that?'' 
 As dean, he has exhorted his students to make ''aesthetically provocative buildings that can change the way a city functions.'' And, he added in an interview in March: ''The only way you can get that stuff to happen is if people believe you are invested. The only way to get people to believe you are invested is to live here.''
 No previous dean has lived downtown, Mr. Robbins said. Like many upstate areas, Syracuse had been economically hobbled for decades, and the downtown, which was cut off from the surrounding city by Interstate 81 in the 1960s, had deteriorated. Buildings were abandoned, crime rose, and street life all but disappeared. In recent years, according to Matthew J. Driscoll, the city's mayor, more attention has been paid to the core, and one prominent set of buildings was remodeled as a popular pedestrian shopping and dining area. Still, there was a long way to go. Or, as Mr. Robbins puts it, ''The big resource in Syracuse is basically surface parking lots and vacant buildings.''
 In fact, there was such a surplus of beguiling options that it took him a year to pick a place to remodel. At one point, he considered an empty multistory medical office building from the 1970s that had Mies van der Rohe simplicity. But in the end, he settled on a property that a guide from the university had first shown him when he was undecided about taking the job, offering it as an example of all the great, easy-to-acquire buildings available. ''They were smart,'' he said. ''It really kind of hooked me.''
 An 1898 bank building overlooking a historic square, it had been all but abandoned since 2000, with a bar as its sole remaining tenant. Mr. Robbins bought the whole thing, all 6,400 square feet, complete with its Beaux-Arts limestone facade and a vaulted ceiling running its full length. The building was listed for $300,000, but according to property records, he paid $200,000. 
 In one way, moving to Syracuse is a homecoming for Mr. Robbins, who is 51 and got his master's degree in architecture here back in 1981. But Mr. Robbins, a Queens native who still speaks in the rat-a-tat manner of that borough and dresses in slim gray trousers even for tooling around town, feels like a fast-forward character in a real-time town.
 He grew up in Floral Park, commuting daily for an hour and half to Music and Art High School, then went to Colgate University. His life changed direction when he got an internship at the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, an atelier-style school in Manhattan run by the architect Peter Eisenman, which he remembers as the kind of place where Philip Johnson would drop by and take students to lunch at a local deli. After getting his master's degree from Syracuse, he worked in New York for a few years as an architect and artist specializing in small constructed objects, then moved on to other activities, including curating architectural exhibitions at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, and directing the design program of the National Endowment of the Arts for a few years during the Clinton administration. He also did larger-scale sculptural installations, and spent a year in Italy in 1997 after winning the Prix de Rome. 
 When he returned to Syracuse, the challenge, as he saw it, was to hang on to the eclectic point of view he had developed in the two decades since he had been there and still have a practical impact on the city.
 He started by holding parties in abandoned warehouses, trying to get local people to reimagine blighted buildings as hidden assets. He moved the school of architecture a mile or so from the campus to a former cold storage complex in a rundown area, and brought in the celebrated minimalist architect Richard Gluckman to renovate it. And he began asserting himself more broadly, pushing the city and the university to recruit high-caliber architects like Toshiko Mori and Julie Eizenberg for other building projects, and not always winning friends in the process.
 ''Developers' and Mark's views are quite the opposite, as you might expect,'' Mr. Driscoll said diplomatically. The mayor, who deals with Mr. Robbins a lot in his role as senior adviser for architecture and urban initiatives to the chancellor of the university, added that he finds the debates spurred by Mr. Robbins's efforts ''exhilarating.''
 On the home front, Mr. Robbins hoped to make his former bank a mixing zone between the worlds -- municipal and academic, local and global -- that he was trying to bridge. He wanted it to be a place for gatherings where professors, students, policy makers and architects could celebrate architecture and enjoy food, wine and conversation. ''It shouldn't all be sturm und drang; the righteous salvation of an abject place,'' he said. ''I want it to be a kick.''
 Although the bank's exterior was always majestic, the inside, when Mr. Robbins first saw it, was office-park gothic. Faux-wood paneled partitions had created a warren-like interior that blocked all light from two great arched windows. The vaulted roof that had originally soared 35 feet above the banking hall -- and, in later years, 25 feet above the second-floor addition -- had been hidden above a dropped ceiling. Almost all the detailed plaster work had been neatly shaved away.
 After ripping everything out and throwing his first party there, he drew up plans, with the help of the New York City firm of Fiedler Marciano Architecture, for a minimalist renovation of the interior. On the ground floor, he built an office, which he rents to other architects; the floor above -- a 75-by-25-foot rectangle -- he kept for himself. He divided it with a long, narrow kitchen that cuts across the building's width, creating a small private area with a bedroom, two bathrooms and closets on one side and a ridiculously generous, but stark, expanse of living area on the other.
 There is an air of near-institutional restraint throughout, heightened by the whiteness of all the walls and cabinets (Mr. Robbins said the intent was to direct the entire focus of the space toward the ceiling), and by a relatively tight renovation budget, which, given the size of the building, meant that high-end materials were kept to a minimum. 
 Aside from the white Carrara marble counters in the kitchen and the oak floorboards (used to prevent warping from the radiant heat), there is little that speaks of luxury. Nevertheless, he ended up spending about twice as much as he had on buying the building.
 The sheer size of the living area can be startling, an effect that was not lost on Mr. Robbins as the project progressed. ''A month before the construction was complete I was up here and I had a panic,'' he said. ''I thought, I am going to feel like an outtake of some Hollywood movie. It is going to be me with a bottle of brandy dropping on the floor at 3 a.m., because it felt so grand and so theatrical.''
 He says that he is over that now, and that the place, modestly but warmly furnished with vintage modern and contemporary pieces, feels like home. But the moment it comes out, the statement sounds like equal parts wishfulness and truth. Mr. Robbins maintains a small one-bedroom on Gramercy Park. Unable to find suitable work in central New York, his partner of 10 years, Brett Seamans, the director of marketing at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, lives there, and the two take turns commuting on weekends -- a situation Mr. Robbins acknowledges is far from ideal. 
 But Mr. Robbins says he does take satisfaction in the fact that he has been able to start building his own society around him. He throws large parties only infrequently, but has had sit-down dinners for more than 70 people a couple of times a year, and has smaller, less formal gatherings at least monthly. Since he moved here, he said, several new faculty members, many of whom had previously been living in large cities, have moved downtown as well. 
 Paul Michael Pelken, an assistant professor at the school of architecture, moved from London in 2007. ''It's been quite a change from London, and having lived in major cities for a long time,'' he said in an e-mail, adding, ''I rent a loft-style apartment that would be hard to afford in London or New York.''
 Kevin Lair, who left an architecture practice in Boston to join Syracuse as an assistant professor last fall, recently bought a 6,300-square-foot former bottling factory about 10 blocks north of Mr. Robbins for $165,000.
 He said it was the prospect of taking part in the transformation of Syracuse that pulled him in. During his interview with Mr. Robbins, he realized that they shared a vision of melding academic thought with practical application.
 ''When I toured during my job interview, the main thing that stood out was the relationship of the school of architecture to the community,'' Mr. Lair said. 
 ''I wanted a place that was about ideas. A lot of schools have the ambition, but it didn't take much to see that Mark was doing things differently.''

HEADLINE: Investors Pull Back After a Jump in Oil Prices

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street turned lower Wednesday as investors worried about how a sharp jump in oil prices would affect consumers in an economy that is already showing signs of a recession. 
 The major indexes spent most of the session in a tight trading range, but dropped after oil prices shot higher in response to the Energy Department's report of an unexpected jump in gasoline demand. That could lead to higher prices at the pump, a troublesome trend given that retail gas prices are expected to rise further as summer nears.
 Crude oil rose $3.85 to settle at $104.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 ''The oil uptick took away some of the optimism that we've seen recently,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus. ''Higher gasoline price would mean less in the pocket for Americans, and there's also continued worries about a recession.''
 The credit crisis and weak economy have sent stocks tumbling over the last six months. But the shares shot up nearly 400 points on Tuesday on growing sentiment that the worst of the credit problems might be behind Wall Street.
 Some of the pullback late Wednesday was also attributed to profit-taking after that big advance.
 The Dow Jones industrials fell 48.53 points, or 0.38 percent, to 12,605.83, after changing direction several times.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.65, or 0.19 percent, to 1,367.53, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.35, or 0.06 percent, to 2,361.40. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 1.62, or 0.23 percent, to 712.27. 
 Stocks initially rose after the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told a Congressional panel that he did not believe the nation's big investment banks faced the possibility of a collapse. He said, however, that he expected the economy to contract in the first half. 
 Though many economists have said they believed a recession was under way, Fed officials generally are cautious when describing the economy. Two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth is the traditional definition of a recession, so that one can be declared only in hindsight.
 Richard Sparks, a senior equities analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research, called Wednesday's market performance ''a breather.'' He said stocks might begin to percolate higher if first-quarter earnings came in better than expected and the credit markets remained stable.
 Investors also weighed fresh economic data that indicated factory orders in the United States had fallen for a second consecutive month. The Commerce Department said orders dropped by 1.3 percent in February, about double the downturn that economists had been expecting.
 In corporate news, Best Buy said its fourth-quarter profit slipped 3 percent as customer traffic slowed after the holidays. The electronics retailer still beat Wall Street estimates, and its shares rose 47 cents to $43.94.
 Treasury bonds moved slightly lower as fixed-income investors focused on hints from Mr. Bernanke that the central bank might be less aggressive about lowering interest rates. The benchmark Treasury note fell 10/32, to 99 9/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.60 percent, from 3.56 percent.

HEADLINE: In High Prices, Moribund Mines Find a Silver Bullet

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: WALLACE, Idaho 

 BODY:
The strangest thing happened here in the Silver Valley as it began the transformation from historic mining camp to yet another Western confection of ski slopes and condos for newcomers with money. The real estate market slowed, and the price of silver soared. 
 Two condominium projects under construction in Kellogg, just west of Wallace, are stalled, while once-struggling or -shuttered mines like Lucky Friday, Galena and the historic Sunshine Mine have been revived and are expanding into the hillsides. 
 Though real estate developers continue to have faith in the area for the long term, speculators who maneuver for land these days may well want to build underground. Miners are feeling less like fading local color and more like the backbone of the local economy.
 ''This is the Silver Valley, not the Tourism Valley,'' Greg Riley, a miner who takes an elevator 5,900 feet down into the earth each workday, said between sips of beer at the Metals Bar and Lounge. ''I've actually had people right here in this bar say to me, 'Oh, they still mine here?' ''
 It was not such a foolish question a few years ago, when silver was slumming at less than $5 an ounce. Back then, local mines were closed or running skeleton crews or immersed in seemingly endless environmental cleanups. Since the 1980s, an entire generation of Silver Valley workers had left to find jobs elsewhere. Shoshone County, previously one of Idaho's three most prosperous counties, had become one of its three poorest. 
 Now silver is around $17 an ounce, there is talk of reopening a local mining training site (it is a mine-it-yourself tourist attraction now), and an industry that declares itself cleaner and safer than ever is reaching out across the West to find workers. 
 ''One of the things we never thought we would be experiencing again is a desperate need for more miners,'' said Kathryn Tacke, a regional economist with the Idaho Department of Labor. ''But anyone who wants to find a job mining in the Silver Valley probably can.''
 For years, some kinds of mining have survived near increasingly affluent Western towns like Steamboat Springs, Colo. A few other old camps, including Leadville, Colo., are also now moving toward reviving mining operations. But for others, like Crested Butte and Breckenridge, also in Colorado, the natural surroundings remain what they became long ago: amenities for newcomers, not resources for industry.
 ''Now prices have recovered to where it's finally economical'' to mine again, said Laura Skaer, executive director of the Northwest Mining Association, but in many cases ''the community has changed.''
 The Silver Valley has not changed nearly as much as pricey resorts like Crested Butte, however. The town of Wallace remains a tiny triangle of 890 people and dozens of historic red-brick buildings, all wedged between steep evergreen slopes and Interstate 90. About 10 miles west, the historic uptown section of Kellogg has plenty of vacant storefronts, and chain-link fences surround the two stalled condominium projects. 
 Local officials say the revival of mining, however counterintuitive the idea may seem to the second-home aesthetic, is critical if the area is to remain affordable to a population whose families have lived here for generations. (Already there are concerns about the long-term rise in housing prices.) 
 The average pay for mining jobs in Shoshone County in 2006 was about $57,000, more than double the average of all other jobs, Ms. Tacke said. And while the current total of 700 mining jobs is a small fraction of the 4,000 that the county had in the early 1980s, still it is 200 more than at this time last year.
 Many people here say they just want another chance to do what they do best. ''I don't really care about growth,'' said Mayor Ronald Garitone, 68. ''The price of silver is what determines our economic development.''
 Dick Vester, an optometrist here for three decades, said his office had been bustling with newly flush miners finally able to update their prescriptions. Some splurge on sunglasses. 
 ''Real estate is good, tourism is good,'' Mr. Vester said. ''But there's nothing like good old industry. That's what puts money on the table.''
 For now, at least, the new mining boom does not appear to be creating a culture conflict between miners and those nurturing a new Silver Valley.
 Mark W. Stromberg, an official of the federal Superfund project to clean up old mining contamination in the valley, said he was unaware of any organized opposition to the mining expansion. A huge toxic smelter has been largely leveled and removed as part of the cleanup, and the new mining involves expansion underground only and must meet a variety of environmental requirements.
 Neal Scholey, sales director at the new Silver Mountain Resort, in Kellogg, said the revival in mining had been largely invisible. ''Where are they?'' Mr. Scholey said. ''The environmental impact is basically nothing.''
 The resort, with 277 condominiums built and hundreds more houses and a golf course planned, is an island of precise roof lines and fresh paint a few hundred yards from some of the last, dilapidated remains of old mining operations. The slogan behind the front desk of the sales center says: ''Yesterday, Silver. Tomorrow, Gold'' -- the latter a reference to sunsets, not the metal. 
 With mining making a comeback, sales representatives strive to balance messages, assuring newcomers that the vacant storefronts in Kellogg will soon turn over with new shops, that the area has a bright future as a resort and that the mining here is now clean and safe. 
 Jacques Lemieux, a real estate agent with Century 21, works in a small office across the street from the resort and next door to new town houses whose prices, he said, have been lowered to $395,000 from $585,000.
 ''We maybe got a little ahead of ourselves,'' Mr. Lemieux said of the resort boom. ''But it's going to happen.'' 
 Then he nodded east toward Wallace and smiled. 
 ''Wallace is the damnedest town,'' he said. ''Wallace never gave up the mining dream.''

HEADLINE: Doing the Unusual To Help Workers Solve Personal Problems

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE

 BODY:
A SMALL company in Jacksonville, Fla., came up with a novel -- and sensitive -- solution when two crucial employees had trouble making the commute to its new headquarters across town.
 As Derek Mercer, the founder and chief executive of the company, Vurv Technology, tells it, the employees' supervisor came to him with the suggestion that the company buy two good used cars and give them to the workers outright.
 Mr. Mercer said he agreed, and immediately approved the $5,000 expenditure for each car. 
 Seven years later, the two employees, Tim Gunter and Renee Richmond, are still with Vurv, a developer of human resources software. The company itself has grown from about two dozen employees in those days to about 300 and is now in yet another building.
 In looking at the alternative, Mr. Mercer said, it would have cost the company more than the nearly $10,000 it paid for the automobiles to find and train replacements, not to mention the ground it would have lost with customers.
 ''I felt that they were good employees and responsive to the customers,'' Mr. Mercer said, and thus a valuable asset to the company.
 Mr. Gunter, who helped clients with software issues, said he was barely six months on the job at Vurv when the family car broke down. He had to ask a neighbor for a ride to work that day, and he feared his new job was at risk.
 That same day, Vurv bought him the used car. 
 ''It wasn't the nicest car,'' he said. ''It wasn't the prettiest car. It wasn't fresh off the lot with new-car smell. But boy, did my overwhelming feeling of dread go from that to enlightenment. This is what this company is about. This is what Derek is about.''
 At that point, Mr. Gunter said: ''I was just hooked. The 80-hour weeks we worked after that never meant anything. It was give and take. I was giving and the company was definitely giving back.''
 Ms. Richmond, who helped companies deploy Vurv's software, was a single mother of two in 2000. Her Chevrolet Cavalier, with 270,000 miles on it, ''finally took its last breath,'' she recalled. ''I lived 45 miles away from the office, so I had quite a hike back and forth.''
 Her supervisor, who is no longer with the company, and Mr. Mercer knew of her troubles, she said, and at her annual evaluation offered to buy her a car instead of giving her a $3,000 raise. They also helped her find the right car, a Diamanti, and paid $4,500 for it, she said. She told them to work out an installment so she could pay the difference. They never did.
 And then she got a second pleasant surprise: her raise started showing up in her paycheck as well.
 ''A company that takes care of their employees,'' Ms. Richmond said, ''it definitely is returned to them tenfold because their employees are going to take care of them and do a good job.''
 Creativity and sensitivity meshed with good business sense at Vurv, and that is a crucial aspect of problem solving, according to Glenn Okun, clinical professor of management and entrepreneurship at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ''Entrepreneurs must remember that resources have costs that must be borne by the firm,'' he said. 
 Small-business owners should approach such instances analytically, Professor Okun said, examining risk and opportunity. Act as if you are a third party interested in financing your own company, he suggested, and then decide how to proceed. 
 Especially now, when economic times are tough, Professor Okun said, business owners will have to weigh unexpected outlays against the knowledge there will be potentially less revenue coming in and less credit extended by lenders and investors to smooth rough patches. In this environment, he said, ''problems get magnified, even if the firm is solid.''
 The solution at Vurv was a balancing act of trying to help employees while not hurting the bottom line. 
 The same was true for the Transtec Group in Austin, Tex., which helps public and private agencies in street, highway, airfield and seaport projects. Dan K. Rozycki, its president, recalled what happened when an employee had to get out of her apartment after a relationship broke up. ''In a matter of days,'' Mr. Rozycki said, ''we helped her find a new apartment and we furnished the whole place from sofa to spatula.'' 
 The company has done so many things for employees, he said, that ''it's hard to remember stuff we've done over the years.''
 ''When you're small and flexible and put co-workers first,'' he said, ''stuff just happens, but nobody records it or thinks it's that shocking.''
 When another employee had serious personal problems, he said, the company offered and paid for the professional therapy.
 And when a new employee from China needed to learn how to drive, colleagues took him for driving lessons and helped him shop for a car.
 In addition, he said, over the years, the company has learned how to avoid common pitfalls that could fester as problems. Asking for raises is often tricky for employees and employers, Mr. Rozycki said, ''so we give out raises every Jan. 1 to everyone.'' No one has complained in the last seven years, he said. 
 As to industry conferences, he said, the company decided to invite every one rather than select a few so that no one felt left out.
 ''What it really comes down to,'' he said, ''is we're trying to create the ultimate workplace. We believe you can do the right thing and be profitable.''

HEADLINE: For the Self-Employed, a Year-Round System Will Smooth Tax Time

BYLINE: By CAITLIN KELLY

 BODY:
In tough economic times, as workers lose full-time jobs and take longer to find new jobs, more and more people are finding themselves self-employed. And with April 15 approaching, they are about to learn an important business lesson -- keeping track of income and expenses is part of the job, too.
 Staying on top of one's tax obligations ''is as important, if not more important, than the skill you're trying to sell,'' says Michelle Goodman, who has been a freelance writer in Seattle for 14 years and is the author of ''My So-Called Freelance Life: How to Survive and Thrive as a Creative Professional for Hire,'' to be published in September by Seal Press. 
 Learning about the world of 1099s -- the income record that freelancers most often receive from their clients -- is essential, Ms. Goodman said, no matter how confusing or tedious. ''It's part of the job, just like boring Monday meetings when you work in an office.''
 One surprise for people new to self-employment -- freelance or contract workers and some part-timers, as well as small business owners -- is that they must pay the full amount of payroll taxes, while a full-time employee typically pays half. 
 The key to maximizing deductions, while minimizing the chance of being audited, is to keep track of all spending. Alexandre Heine, the owner of Pitch110, a public relations firm in Boulder, Colo., says she uses Quicken software to simplify the process. ''I have been using it for 15 years and every purchase is recorded and assigned a category,'' like utilities or entertainment, Ms. Heine said. 
 ''At tax time, I have a tax template I created in Excel that lists all of my assets -- car, house, rental properties -- and all of the possible deductions I know about.'' Ms. Heine says she talks with her accountant to determine what additional deductions she can claim for the coming year.
 Andrew Sheere has worked as a forester in Chester, Vt., for 14 years, helping clients manage their woodlands. He says he spends ''50 percent of my time in the woods and 50 percent in the office.'' He claims work clothes, office supplies, equipment and professional dues as deductions, keeps track of his business-related mileage and has created spreadsheets to assess his deductions.
 Liene Stevens, a wedding planner in Phoenix, says she collects every receipt and keeps a notebook in her car to track work-related mileage. An accordion file in her car holds receipts, and she asks her assistants to immediately turn in all of theirs as well. 
 But while she has been calculating her own taxes, the business is doing well enough that she is ready to hire an expert. ''It's so convoluted, and reading the I.R.S. Web site makes my head hurt.'' 
 Ms. Goodman suggests finding a tax preparer who specializes in small business. Even better is finding someone familiar with your specific industry.
 Keith Hall, an accountant in Dallas with 20 years' experience in small-business taxes, urges clients to start early and get organized. ''Trying to stay organized might be the hardest part,'' he said. ''Start building your own paper fort, with W-2s and 1099s, and your bank and mortgage statements and 401(k) reports. Put it in the same place, and this will also jog your memory to chase down any missing forms.'' 
 While projects paying less than $600 do not require payers to issue a 1099, that income still must be reported.
 Mr. Hall suggests using software like TurboTax or relying on a professional who stays abreast of any changes, like the increase to 50.5 cents a mile, up from 48.5 cents, allowed as a travel deduction this year.
 ''There are always changes in the tax code you might not be aware of or might have forgotten,'' he said. 
 No matter how tempting, avoid shortcuts, he said. ''It's so easy, but go back to your mileage log. Don't guess at your charitable contributions, and have support for those numbers.''
 Some people may deduct a portion of their living expenses if their a space is used exclusively and regularly for work. ''You can't have a TV or exercise bike in there,'' Mr. Hall warned. Expenses associated with the upkeep of this space, whether landscaping, cleaning, painting, maintenance or a portion of the mortgage, can be written off. If 10 percent of a 2,000-square-foot home is used for business, then 10 percent of those costs are deductible.
 For the last-minute crowd without an accountant lined up -- and the good ones have been booked months in advance by their regular clients -- the National Association for the Self-Employed, a nonprofit group based in Washington, answers about 10,000 tax-related questions a year through its Web site, www.nase.org. The group promises to provide an answer from a tax professional within 24 hours.

HEADLINE: Unsold Homes Tie Down Would-Be Transplants

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Dr. Michele Morgan migrated last fall from Detroit to Phoenix, taking a job as a psychiatrist. She expected her husband, Sam Kirkland, to soon join her, since he was accepting an early retirement package from his employer, General Motors. But he cannot move, he says, because he has not been able to sell the four-bedroom family home.
 ''As things now stand,'' said Mr. Kirkland, who is 51 and intends to seek work in Phoenix, if he ever gets there, ''my wife might decide to give up her job in Phoenix and come back to Detroit for a while, until we can sell the house.''
 The rapid decline in housing prices is distorting the normal workings of the American labor market. Mobility opens up job opportunities, allowing workers to go where they are most needed. When housing is not an obstacle, more than five million men and women, nearly 4 percent of the nation's work force, move annually from one place to another -- to a new job after a layoff, or to higher-paying work, or to the next rung in a career, often the goal of a corporate transfer. Or people seek, as in Dr. Morgan's case, an escape from harsh northern winters. 
 Now that mobility is increasingly restricted. Unable to sell their homes easily and move on, tens of thousands of people like Mr. Kirkland and Dr. Morgan are making the labor force less flexible just as a weakening economy puts pressure on workers to move to wherever companies are still hiring. 
 Signaling an incipient recession, nearly 85,000 jobs disappeared in the United States from December through February, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to announce on Friday that March failed to produce a turnaround in hiring. 
 ''You hear a lot about foreclosure and the thousands of families who are being forced out,'' said Joseph S. Tracy, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''But that is swamped by the number of people who want to sell their homes and can't.''
 No government agency counts those who move for a job, either across state lines or just from one town to another in the same state. The Census Bureau, however, calculates how many people move across state lines for all reasons, and that number fell by a startling 27 percent last year, after climbing by almost that percentage for each of the previous three years.
 With homes changing hands easily in a booming market, interstate migration reached 2.2 million people in 2006, excluding the effects of Hurricane Katrina. As the economy and home prices began to unravel in 2007, however, interstate migration plunged to 1.6 million people. 
 ''That is still a historically high number,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''It reflects the relatively strong economy until midyear. But given what's happening now, I would be surprised if domestic migration isn't at a record low in 2008.''
 Worker mobility -- or rather immobility -- is making a big contribution to this decline, Mr. Zandi and other economists say. Retirees are similarly stuck in their homes. In normal times, they frequently sell so they can move to condos in Florida or assisted-living facilities or smaller quarters near adult children. 
 ''These older people spent all of their lives earning the money to buy their homes,'' said Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economist who is an expert on housing, ''and now they resist selling for less than they believe their homes are worth.'' 
 Corporate transfers contribute significantly to worker mobility, and employers often cover at least some of the cost of selling a home in the old location and buying one in the new. That practice can backfire, says Richard Shaw, a vice president of Applied Industrial Technologies, which sells gears, motors, bearings and other industrial parts from 337 centers around the country.
 Out of 3,500 employees in the United States, Applied normally transfers 25 to 30 each year from one center to another, or to the headquarters in Cleveland. Almost all are career people rising in the ranks. Despite the opportunity, transfers have fallen by half, Mr. Shaw said. That is mainly because transferred employees too often find themselves owning two homes -- one in the old location and one in the new -- and paying two mortgages. 
 Applied tries to minimize the problem by paying one of the two mortgages for up to six months, the expectation being that the old home will sell by then. Increasingly, that does not happen, not with inventories of homes across the country at an 18-year high, according to the National Association of Realtors. That makes employees reluctant to move, even for a raise and a promotion, Mr. Shaw said. 
 He tells of one transferred executive ''who ended up owning two homes for more than six months and, finding himself paying two mortgages, opted to move back to his original city, surrendering his new house to the bank.'' 
 Mr. Kirkland is determined to sell before he moves. But that might take months, he acknowledges. A house that he thought would bring $200,000 -- its appraised price three years ago -- in fact might bring only $90,000 if he were to sell it today. That was the selling price for a similar 2,500-square-foot home on the next block, and Mr. Kirkland wants more than the $125,000 in debt that he and his wife still have on their house.
 ''When I stop working at G.M., I am going to devote myself to the house, making it look as pristine as possible,'' Mr. Kirkland said.
 He is also trying to make a major career transition. After 30 years as a G.M. employee -- most recently at a parts warehouse in Pontiac, Mich., serving as a full-time union official of his United Automobile Workers local -- he accepted one of the early retirement packages that the company is offering to shrink its work force. Taking courses by mail, he is studying for a master's degree in organization and development. His goal is to get work in that field in Phoenix, perhaps with a community organization. His wife, who is 47, relocated in October, in time to escape the Michigan winter, and his two daughters are away at college. 
 But getting to Phoenix is now problematic. He will not leave the house, afraid that if it sits empty, it will be a target for vandals. ''I might have to spend so much time living at the house and working on it,'' Mr. Kirkland said, ''that my wife will say, 'I can always have a job as a psychiatrist here in Phoenix, but I might have to go back to Detroit for a while.' '' 
 Gayle Newton, in a somewhat similar fashion, delayed her departure from Taylorsville, N.C., for two years while she tried to sell her two-bedroom home, on a large parcel of land, for $89,000. She finally gave up, rented the house last September and moved in with her daughter and son-in-law in Baltimore, quickly landing a job there for $15 an hour in the accounts payable department of a granite quarry. Until she left Taylorsville, Ms. Newton, who is 53, did similar work for a furniture company at $9 an hour.
 She had put her home on the market in 2006, not long after her husband died and she found herself alone in Taylorsville in a job that did not pay enough to keep her there. She decided to live near her daughter, to find higher-paying work and to apply the proceeds from selling her home toward another one in Baltimore.
 ''That seemed like a good year, 2006,'' Ms. Newton said, ''but the downturn in housing had already started in our area. I didn't realize it. I never imagined that a house on seven acres would not sell. I thought at $89,000 it would be a steal and I could move on to Baltimore much sooner than I did. My daughter finally came and insisted. She could notstand my whining any longer.''
 The house in Taylorsville is still unsold.

HEADLINE: Ireland's Prime Minister to Resign Amid Corruption Inquiry

BYLINE: By EAMON QUINN and ALAN COWELL. 
Eamon Quinn reported from Dublin and Alan Cowell from London.

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland, one of Europe's longest-serving leaders, who was closely involved in the negotiations that brought peace to Northern Ireland, announced Wednesday that he would resign next month. 
 He denied accusations of corruption in the 1990s, when he was finance minister, but said he was quitting to prevent his government's work from being ''constantly deflected by the minutiae of my life, my lifestyle and my finances.'' He forecast that a tribunal investigating payments received by Irish politicians would find that he had not acted improperly.
 In emotional tones at a hastily convened news conference here, Mr. Ahern, 56, said he would quit on May 6. A week before that, he is to address both houses of Congress in Washington.
 The announcement Wednesday sealed a reversal of fortunes for a man once nicknamed the Teflon Taoiseach -- the Irish word for leader or prime minister -- for his ability to survive onslaughts by political foes.
 During Mr. Ahern's 11 years in office, Ireland's economy has undergone a transformation to become one of the most robust in Europe, though more recently, economic growth has slowed.
 His planned resignation raised questions about the future of his coalition government and about his ambitions. Supporters hint at his possibly becoming the first permanent president of the European Union, a new role being proposed for the 27-nation bloc. 
 ''Ahern likes Europe,'' said Sean Donnelly, a leading pollster who has worked for Mr. Ahern. ''He is not just going to walk away from politics.''
 Other analysts, however, said Mr. Ahern's prospects would depend on the outcome of the tribunal investigating accusations that Irish politicians received payments from real estate developers in return for favorable planning decisions. It is called the Mahon Tribunal after Alan Mahon, a judge who leads it. 
 ''I want everyone to understand one truth above all else,'' Mr. Ahern said Wednesday. ''Never, in all the time I have served in public office, have I put my personal interest ahead of the public good.''
 He went on: ''While I will be the first to admit that I have made mistakes in my life and my career, one mistake I have never made is to enrich myself by misusing the trust of the people. I have never received a corrupt payment, and I have never done anything to dishonor any office I have held.'' 
 The leader of the centrist Fianna Fail party, Mr. Ahern was re-elected last June for a third term in office, which was to last until 2012. At that time, he said he would not serve the full term.
 At the news conference, Mr. Ahern said of the accusations against him, ''All of these issues arose in a period when my family, personal and professional situations were rapidly changing, and I made the best decisions I could in the circumstances in which I found myself.''
 He continued, ''I know in my heart of hearts that I have done no wrong and wronged no one.''
 Despite opposition calls for an election, Mr. Ahern's most likely successor is the deputy prime minister, Brian Cowen, who is also expected to assume the leadership of the Fianna Fail party.

HEADLINE: Adrift in the Middle East

 BODY:
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's latest trip to Israel and Jordan came at a time when anger and frustration among ordinary Israelis and Palestinians are building to dangerous levels. This was a moment for American leadership and direction. Unfortunately, the moment was once again allowed to slip away. 
 Surely, Ms. Rice understands that Woody Allen's ''80 percent of success is showing up'' does not apply to the deadly serious business of Middle East peacemaking. 
 Yet despite 14 trips to the region in the past 15 months -- and the November peace conference in Annapolis -- Ms. Rice has frighteningly little to show for her presence. 
 If anything, the two sides are farther apart than they were in November, and Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, have less room to maneuver. 
 Israel marked Ms. Rice's visit by agreeing to remove 50 of its roadblocks restricting travel in the West Bank. That leaves 530, roughly the same number as at the start of 2007. Any goodwill was erased when, hours after she departed, Israel announced its intention to build 800 new homes for Jewish families in the West Bank. Mr. Abbas promised more energetic efforts against terrorism -- a promise he has made before -- and agreed to end his monthlong boycott of meetings with Mr. Olmert. 
 Just coming back to the table will not matter much unless Washington starts to push in earnest for the compromises that are the only basis for an agreement. President Bill Clinton first proposed the outline in 2000: a secure Israel and an economically viable Palestinian state, divided by roughly the June 1967 borders, and including reasonable compromises over Jerusalem. 
 If Washington doesn't make clear its own commitment to this kind of peace, it cannot expect weak Israeli and Palestinian leaders to take the political risks needed for a realistic compromise.
 They, as well as Washington, would also have to deal with the disruptive reality of Hamas, which broadcasts anti-Semitic propaganda and encourages deadly rocket fire into Israeli towns. The essential first step is to encourage efforts by Egypt and other Arab nations to press Hamas toward a complete cease-fire. 
 If that can be achieved, the United States and Israel should start exploring the possibilities of talking directly with Hamas, though not in a way that excludes the far more statesmanlike Mr. Abbas. 
 Doing so does not imply approval of Hamas's past methods or future goals. It does acknowledge that Hamas has a strong constituency -- and a lasting peace would have to include these Palestinians as well.

HEADLINE: A Reprise of the 3 A.M. Call

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
This 30-second television commercial for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, began running statewide in Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Within hours, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, released a similar advertisement as a rebuttal. 
 PRODUCERS The Clinton media team.
 THE SCRIPT Announcer: ''It's 3 a.m., and your children are safe and asleep. But there's a phone ringing in the White House, and this time the crisis is economic. Home foreclosures mounting, markets teetering. John McCain just said the government shouldn't take any real action on the housing crisis; he'd let the phone keep ringing. Hillary Clinton has a plan to protect our homes, create jobs. It's 3 a.m., time for a president who's ready.''
 ON THE SCREEN The commercial opens with images of children sleeping, then the ominous ring of the telephone in the middle of the night. There is a stark image of a crumpled dollar bill, then tax forms and various worried people appear, struggling over their bills and taxes. At the end, Mrs. Clinton, dressed and wearing glasses as if she had been up anyway, answers the phone.
 ACCURACY Economists and lawmakers generally agree that the country faces a crisis over the collapse of the housing and residential mortgage markets, and Congress is set to act on the matter. Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, initially said he would be reluctant to give aid to homeowners because they were speculators themselves, but after being criticized, he has said he would be open to other approaches. He has not said he would let the phone keep ringing. Mrs. Clinton has called for direct federal intervention to help affected homeowners, including a $30 billion fund for states and communities to help those at risk of foreclosure.
 SCORECARD The Clinton commercial is a sequel to one last month directed at Mrs. Clinton's Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama, challenging his readiness to serve as commander in chief. The repetition of the ''3 a.m.'' theme suggests that the Clinton campaign sees the advertisement as successfully planting doubts about her opponents and presenting her as presidential. But the shift in focus to the Republican nominee before the Democratic nomination is resolved is unusual. Campaign aides said that they wanted to cement the idea that Mrs. Clinton was ready to serve as a steward of the economy and that the contrast with Mr. McCain was more striking than it was with her fellow Democrat, Mr. Obama. The move suggests that the Clinton campaign believes it can get more mileage out of attacking Mr. McCain on an urgent economic issue than attacking Mr. Obama, whose economic views are similar to Mrs. Clinton's.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Fall Again Despite Demand for Aircraft

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Orders to United States factories fell for a second consecutive month, a worse-than-expected performance that reinforced worries that the risk of a recession might be increasing. 
 The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that factory orders dropped 1.3 percent in February, about double what economists had been expecting. In January, orders fell by an even larger 2.3 percent, the largest decline in five months.
 The drop in demand was widespread, with steep declines in orders for motor vehicles and various types of heavy machinery and in demand for iron and steel.
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, testifying before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Wednesday, said the economy could contract over the first half of this year, his most pessimistic assessment to date. ''It now appears likely that gross domestic product will not grow much, if at all, over the first half of 2008 and could even contract slightly,'' Mr. Bernanke said. 
 Two consecutive quarters of declines in total output constitute a recession.
 The report on factory orders showed demand falling by 1.1 percent for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years; orders for nondurable goods, like oil products and chemicals, fell 1.5 percent.
 The weakness in manufacturing occurred despite a 5.1 rise in orders for commercial aircraft in February, rebounding from a big decline in January. Orders for motor vehicles fell 2 percent in February after no gain in January. Automakers are struggling with weak demand in the face of soaring gasoline prices and the broad slump in the economy.
 Over all, orders for transportation products posted a 1.8 percent rise in February as the strength in commercial and military aircraft orders, as well as higher demand for ships, offset the drop in motor vehicles.
 Orders for heavy machinery plunged 12.3 percent in February, the biggest drop since January 2004. Orders for iron and steel fell 2.3 percent.

HEADLINE: A Not-So-Fine Romance

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the Tibet upheavals, the complicated romance between America and China is degenerating into mutual recriminations, muttering about Olympic boycotts and tensions that are likely to rise through the summer.
 It would be convenient if we could simply denounce the crackdown in Tibet as the unpopular action of a dictatorial government. But it wasn't. It was the popular action of a dictatorial government, and many ordinary Chinese think the government acted too wimpishly, showing far too much restraint toward ''thugs'' and ''rioters.''
 China and the U.S. clash partly because of competing interests, but mostly because of competing narratives. To Americans, Tibet fits neatly into a framework of human rights and colonialism. To Chinese, steeped in education of 150 years of ''guochi,'' or national humiliations by foreigners, the current episode is one more effort by imperialistic and condescending foreigners to tear China apart or hold it back. 
 So what do we do? A boycott of the Olympic Games themselves is a nonstarter. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has raised the possibility of a boycott of the opening ceremony, and that is plausible. 
 The best answer is: Postpone the decision until the last minute so as to extort every last ounce of good behavior possible out of the Chinese government -- on Darfur as well as Tibet. But at the end of the day, if there have been no further abuses, President Bush should attend -- for staying away would only inflame Chinese nationalism and make Beijing more obdurate. 
 If President Bush attends the ceremonies, however, he should balance that with a day trip to a Tibetan area. Such a visit would underscore American concern, even if the Chinese trot out fake monks to express fake contentment with fake freedom.
 President Bush and other Western leaders should also continue to consult with the Dalai Lama, even though this infuriates Beijing. The Dalai Lama is the last, best hope for reaching an agreement that would resolve the dispute over Tibet forever. He accepts autonomy, rather than independence, and he has the moral authority to persuade Tibetans to accept a deal.
 The outlines of an agreement would be simple. The Dalai Lama would return to Tibet as a spiritual leader, and Tibetans would be permitted to possess his picture and revere him, while he would unequivocally accept Chinese sovereignty. Monasteries would have much greater religious freedom, and Han Chinese migration to Tibet would be limited. The Dalai Lama would also accept that the Tibetan region encompasses only what is now labeled Tibet on the maps, not the much larger region of historic Tibet that he has continued to claim.
 With such an arrangement, China could resolve the problem of Tibet, improve its international image, reassure Taiwan and rectify a 50-year-old policy of repression that has catastrophically failed. 
 But don't hold your breath. Instead, President Hu Jintao -- who made his reputation by crushing protests in Tibet in 1989 -- will make up for failed policy within Tibet by trying to stir up Chinese nationalist resentments at nosy foreigners.
 America and China get on each other's nerves partly because they are so similar. Both are big, self-absorbed, and insular nations; both are entrepreneurial overachievers; both are infused with nationalism and yet tread clumsily on the nationalism of others -- whether in Vietnam or Iraq, or Tibet and the Muslim region of Xinjiang. 
 Both the United States and China also hurt themselves by petulantly refusing to engage leaders they don't like. The U.S. shrinks from talking with Iranian and Cuban leaders, and China refuses to negotiate directly with the Dalai Lama, whom it recently denounced as ''a jackal wrapped in a habit, a monster with human face and animal's heart.'' 
 That refusal to talk is stunningly foolish. Nearly every Tibetan I've ever spoken to in Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan or Gansu has been loyal to the Dalai Lama -- except those who think he's too gentle and accommodating toward China. After the Dalai Lama dies, there will be no one to hold Tibetans back, and more militant organizers in the Tibetan Youth Congress and other organizations will turn to violence, and perhaps terrorism. 
 The only other Tibetan who could fill that vacuum is the Panchen Lama, the No. 2 Tibetan leader, who turns 19 later this month. But the Chinese government kidnapped the Panchen Lama when he was 6 years old and apparently has kept him under house arrest ever since.
 Americans sometimes think that the Tibetan resentments are just about political and religious freedom. They're much more complicated than that. Tibetan anger is also fueled by the success of Han Chinese shop owners, who are often better educated and more entrepreneurial. So Tibetans seek solace in monasteries or bars, and the economic gap widens and provokes even more frustration -- which the spotlight of the Olympics gives them a chance to express.

HEADLINE: In Economic Drama, Bush Is Largely Offstage

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The first hint that President Bush might be detached from the nation's economic woes was in February, when he conceded that he had not heard about predictions of $4-a-gallon gasoline.
 Then Mr. Bush went to Wall Street to warn against ''massive government intervention in the housing markets,'' two days before his administration helped broker the takeover of the investment bank Bear Stearns.
 Now Mr. Bush is in Eastern Europe, one of eight foreign trips he is taking this year. As he delivered his farewell address to NATO on Wednesday, Senate Democrats and Republicans were holed up in the Capitol, scrambling to produce a bill to help struggling homeowners, the kind of government intervention Mr. Bush had cautioned against. 
 For a man who came into office as the nation's first M.B.A. president, Mr. Bush has sometimes seemed invisible during the housing and credit crunch. As the economy eclipses Iraq as the top issue on voters' minds, even some Republican allies of the president say Mr. Bush is being eclipsed and is in danger of looking out of touch.
 ''He's over there arguing about who should get into NATO, and the American people are focused on what's in their pocketbooks,'' said Kenneth M. Duberstein, who was chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan in his second term. ''He has talked about the economy, but it is not viewed as being a satisfactory response. Unfortunately, the lasting image is of not knowing of $4-a-gallon gas.''
 With the nation riveted by the race to succeed Mr. Bush, it is growing increasingly difficult for him to command the national stage. In addition to being upstaged by the candidates, Mr. Bush has ceded his bully pulpit on the economy to other Washington figures, including Congressional leaders, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, and Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 While Mr. Bush was in Romania on Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke was on Capitol Hill delivering a far more pessimistic vision of the economy than the president -- who has said the country faces ''a rough patch'' -- has allowed. 
 When the White House announced its plan to overhaul the financial regulatory system, it was Mr. Paulson, not Mr. Bush, who did the talking. And the Paulson plan, by the secretary's own account, is not aimed at offering immediate assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure.
 ''I think for the most part the administration is doing the right thing in addressing the economic problems we have,'' said Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York. ''But I think tactically it would be better if the president himself was more out front, rather than leaving it so much to Paulson. When there is a perceived national crisis, it's important for the president to be the point man.''
 Still, because the public has little faith in Mr. Bush, it may be tough for him to be the point man on the economy, even with a Harvard business degree. Just 25 percent of the public approves of the way Mr. Bush is handling the economy, a figure even lower than his overall job approval rating, a CBS News Poll in mid-March found. 
 So it is no wonder, some Republicans say, that Mr. Bush is letting others do the talking.
 ''The good news for Bush is he's got Paulson, who's got some real credibility on these issues,'' said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. ''Paulson is doing a pretty good job of looking like he's doing something.''
 Other presidents have tried, with varying degrees of success, to use their platforms in tough economic times. Franklin D. Roosevelt famously used his fireside chats to calm a nation traumatized by the Great Depression. But Gerald R. Ford was ridiculed for his WIN buttons (Whip Inflation Now), as was Jimmy Carter, with his call to set thermostats at 68 degrees.
 Mr. Bush, by contrast, has been loath to sound downbeat. He has yet to use the word ''recession,'' for instance. Two months ago, he drew praise for bringing together Republicans and Democrats on an economic stimulus package including rebates for taxpayers. (The checks will go out in May.) 
 But he has resisted calls from the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to hold a top-level bipartisan economic meeting to address the growing mortgage crisis. 
 That may be for philosophical reasons. As he said on Wall Street, Mr. Bush is not a fan of a government bailout for those who took risks in the marketplace.
 Even so, with Congress trying to come together around some kind of plan, James A. Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, says Mr. Bush should take the lead.
 ''He has the chance to show that he's bipartisan and he can be above it all and solve things,'' Mr. Thurber said. ''The American people want a leader right now.''
 White House officials fiercely reject the contention that Mr. Bush is not showing leadership, or is out of touch. They say he has been unfairly treated for his $4-a-gallon gasoline comment. The average price was nowhere near $4 when Mr. Bush was asked the question, though the predictions were all over the news. (The national average is $3.29, the Energy Department says.) The White House officials also note that in August Mr. Bush announced a package of proposals intended to help low-income homeowners that the Democratic Congress has yet to adopt fully.
 ''He is very much in touch with the economy,'' said Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary. ''He is out in the country a lot. He is talking about the economy very, very regularly.''
 While Mr. Bush may be talking, Americans do not seem to be listening. When the president visited a debt counseling center on Friday in Freehold, N.J., it did not generate major headlines. But the papers were awash with the news that Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania had endorsed Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination for president.
 Some Republicans say that will not change, no matter what Mr. Bush says or does; the public's views are so entrenched, they argue, that Mr. Bush would be faulted even if he took a more aggressive stance. Mr. Duberstein, the former Reagan chief of staff, says Mr. Bush must try. 
 ''He has to get back in the public conversation again,'' Mr. Duberstein said. ''All the conversation going on now is Obama, Clinton and McCain, and people are not talking about: 'What's George Bush thinking? What's George Bush going to do?' ''

HEADLINE: Clinton Finds Rallying Cry in Calls for Her to Quit

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH 

 BODY:
For someone supposedly in a heap of trouble, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is looking pretty relaxed these days.
 She hopped out of her motorcade at the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre airport on Tuesday afternoon, chatted with some residents and then took a relatively long stroll across the tarmac to her plane. The sun was out for the first time in days. Her bright fuchsia jacket -- gone was the dark coat of winter -- drew the eye, and she gave a jaunty nod as she bounded up the stairs of her plane.
 Earlier, she had staged a somewhat elaborate April Fool's stunt, with a mock-serious news conference, and later she had drolly told reporters about her days playing half-court basketball and bowling at Camp David. Thursday night she is to appear on ''The Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno and on Monday, ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show.'' 
 This is not to say she has gone soft. When it is message time, Mrs. Clinton is focused.
 But at moments she seems almost carefree, which is a jarring image for someone who has been called upon by members of her party to give up her quest for the Democratic presidential nomination. Her rival, Senator Barack Obama, has more delegates and more total popular votes. The longer Mrs. Clinton persists, her critics say, the more damage to the Democrats in the fall.
 So why does she appear so easygoing? Maybe she is confident in her new message.
 Mrs. Clinton has taken the calls for her to quit and recast them as efforts to disenfranchise the voters. In making it clear that Mrs. Clinton is not dropping out, Maggie Williams, her campaign manager, linked Mrs. Clinton's struggle with a signal struggle for Democrats. As Ms. Williams wrote in a memorandum on Tuesday, ''The last time that we were told we'd better cut the process short or the sky would fall was when the Supreme Court stopped the recount in 2000.'' 
 Linking Mrs. Clinton's cause with a larger one has been successful before. Call it the New Hampshire effect. She gets backed into a corner, takes a few days to find her footing (or her voice), then fights back against a perceived injustice -- the ''boys' club,'' the news media, the disenfranchisement of voters. This prompts an outpouring in her favor, whether because of sympathy for a perceived victim or anger at the forces against her or a belief that some injustice is, in fact, occurring. And then she works it, with fund-raising appeals and pleas at rallies, where she makes her fight for survival a fight for the larger cause.
 Perhaps in this case she seems chipper because her message about disenfranchisement has taken hold. Who knows where it will lead, but at the same time, Mrs. Clinton has ceased dropping negative bombs on Mr. Obama. She and her aides have directed their fire instead at President Bush and Senator John McCain, the presumed Republican nominee. On Tuesday, they began a television commercial in Pennsylvania suggesting Mr. McCain is not equipped to handle the nation's economic problems. In a conference call with reporters, her aides did their best to avoid mention of Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Obama has been holding his fire, as well, and has also put Mr. McCain in his sights. The policy differences between the two Democrats are slim. And while they wait for April 22, when Pennsylvania votes, they are engaging in deep discussions with the state's voters about the economy and jobs.
 Most interesting, Mr. Obama has not called for Mrs. Clinton to step aside. While some of his surrogates have, they have backed off in recent days. 
 Is this mutual disarmament? Is it possible that some kind of rapprochement is going on behind the scenes? Perhaps Mrs. Clinton is responding to polls that show voters find her untrustworthy and divisive. 
 It is also possible that Mrs. Clinton is waiting for lightning to strike. Or that the ferocious struggle for superdelegates has simply gone underground.
 Whatever the reason, it is almost as if a tacit understanding has emerged between the two candidates that the process has to play out. To short-circuit it would anger her many supporters, especially those who have not yet voted. Thousands of people continue to go to her rallies, and her campaign has organized events in post-Pennsylvania states where people say they are thrilled to be part of a process from which they are normally excluded.
 On Saturday, for example, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama are both going to a state Democratic dinner in Butte, Mont. Normally, about 600 people show up. This year, 1,500 had planned to attend. But once Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton confirmed they would be there, 2,500 more tickets were sold in less than 15 minutes, said Kevin O'Brien, a spokesman for the state party who added, ''This will be the biggest political event in Montana in generations.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton may well recognize that the odds of winning the nomination are long. But by staying in the race, she speaks to the larger issue of all voters having their say. Just a theory, but instead of destroying the party, this may, counterintuitively, help save it. 
 On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton held a jobs seminar here -- not a political rally but a wonky session about economic development. When someone mentioned how Pittsburgh had been retrofitted from a steel-based economy to the knowledge-based industries, she smiled.
 ''I'm a big believer in comebacks,'' she said, to much applause. The comment fit her economic message, as well.

HEADLINE: Paulson Urges China To Continue Reforms

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. urged Chinese leaders on Wednesday to press ahead with financial market reforms, but acknowledged the American credit crisis might make them hesitant.
 Mr. Paulson met with President Hu Jintao and Beijing's new economic planner, Wang Qishan. Mr. Paulson said he assured them that Washington was resolving its credit crisis but cautioned that it was not finished and there would be ''more bumps in the road.'' 
 ''There is no doubt that what is happening in the U.S. markets clearly has to give the Chinese pause,'' Mr. Paulson told reporters.
 Mr. Paulson, who was in Beijing as part of an American-Chinese dialogue on trade and other controversial issues, said the sides discussed financial reform, though he declined to say what Chinese officials said.
 Mr. Paulson said he acknowledged to Mr. Hu the ''very material progress'' Beijing has made in easing exchange rate controls, a demand by the United States and other trading partners, but said Beijing must open its financial markets wider to competition if it wanted to continue to develop.
 ''They have headed down the path to a market economy, and capital markets are a very powerful force for good,'' he said. ''Until they have efficient, competitive capital markets, their people will not receive adequate returns on their savings.''
 Premier Wen Jiabao, China's top economic official, declared himself ''deeply worried'' last month about the market turmoil, the decline of the dollar and the direction of the United States economy.
 Chinese banks hold risky American mortgage-backed securities and have set aside reserves to cover losses. Economists have cut growth forecasts for China because of slumping American demand for imports.
 Washington's interest rate cuts have complicated Beijing's effort to cool its fast-growing economy by raising its own rates.
 Economists say that if the gap between rates in the two countries grows too large, it could draw foreign money into China, fueling inflation that is heading toward 12-year highs.
 The Treasury secretary is the highest-ranking American official to visit Beijing since violent protests in Tibet and China's subsequent crackdown, and he said he appealed for a peaceful resolution.
 ''I expressed our concerns about the violence and urged a peaceful resolution through dialogue,'' he said.
 Mr. Paulson was in Beijing to prepare for the next meeting in June of the United States-Chinese Strategic Economic Dialogue. The process was begun in 2006 to address tensions over China's soaring trade surplus and currency controls and to deflect pressure from American critics for punitive action. It has been broadened to include talks on cooperation on energy and the environment.
 Mr. Wang first met his counterpart, Mr. Paulson, in the 1980s when the American worked for the Goldman Sachs Group and Mr. Wang was president of China Construction Bank, a major state-owned lender.
 Mr. Paulson said he considered Mr. Wang a friend, a relationship that he said would help in making a smooth transition from his predecessor, the retired vice premier, Wu Yi.
 ''We know each other very well,'' he said. ''When the inevitable tensions arrive, we can get on the phone and talk.''

HEADLINE: Congressman to Challenge Lautenberg in Democratic Senate Primary

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Disrupting the highly choreographed world of New Jersey politics, a veteran United States representative from South Jersey said Wednesday night that he would challenge Senator Frank R. Lautenberg for the Democratic nomination.
 The decision by the legislator, Representative Robert E. Andrews, capped a dizzying 48 hours in which the 84-year-old Mr. Lautenberg -- who has the support of Gov. Jon S. Corzine, the state's Democratic chairman and the rest of New Jersey's Congressional delegation -- worked feverishly to try to head off any primary opposition.
 In the end, Mr. Andrews, a 50-year-old moderate, picked up enough support from a number of state party leaders to decide that he could no longer wait. He was passed over for a Senate seat once before, when Robert Menendez was picked by Mr. Corzine soon after he was elected governor in 2005. 
 In a statement, Mr. Andrews, a fiscal conservative who voted for the authorization of the use of force in Iraq in 2002, did not cite any fundamental ideological differences with Mr. Lautenberg. Instead, he talked broadly about the need to ''bring our troops home from Iraq's civil war, fix our broken economy and bring people of all backgrounds together.''
 He did hint at Mr. Lautenberg's advanced age, but he mentioned the word ''change'' three times.
 This ''is a year of great change in American politics,'' Mr. Andrews said. ''Millions of new voters have chosen to enter the political process as a means to make our country better. As New Jersey elects a United States senator this year, people from all over the state have expressed the desire to have real choices based on a positive, substantive campaign.''
 He continued: ''I have decided that I will place my name and my credentials before the people of New Jersey to serve as their new United States senator. The people of New Jersey deserve to choose their senator. With respect for Senator Lautenberg and his public service, I will offer them that choice in this historic year of change.''
 For his part, Mr. Lautenberg, one of the Senate's most liberal members, suggested that he would not hesitate to engage in a hard-fought campaign highlighting his record on national security, health care and the environment.
 Mr. Lautenberg's campaign manager, Brendan Gill, said, ''This primary election will be a unique opportunity for Democrats to make a clear choice: whether to choose Senator Lautenberg, who has consistently stood up to George Bush, or Congressman Andrews, who helped write Bush's resolution to go to war with Iraq.'' Mr. Gill added, ''The people of New Jersey consistently support Frank Lautenberg because he stands up for them and makes a real difference in their lives.''
 The winner of the Democratic primary is expected to be heavily favored in the November election. The Republican primary now has three little-known candidates: State Senator Joseph Pennacchio, a dentist from Morris County; Murray Sabrin, a finance professor at Ramapo College; and Andrew Unanue, a nightclub owner and Manhattan resident whose family owns the Goya food company.
 Still, New Jersey's Democrats must now cope with a bruising primary fight between two of the state's best-known politicians. At the beginning of the year, Mr. Lautenberg, who was first elected to the Senate in 1982, had $4.3 million in campaign funds, and Mr. Andrews, who was first elected to the House in 1990, had $2.4 million.
 Already, their battle has exposed geographical and demographic rifts that party leaders have long tried to hide. Hour after hour, for a good part of three days, rumors have been ricocheting around the state, in the halls of the State House and on Web sites and blogs concerning who would support whom, and why.
 Ultimately, Mr. Andrews, who is from Camden County, decided to run because of strong support from influential Democrats like George E. Norcross III, Steven N. Adubato Sr. and State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, according to Democrats who have talked to him..
 For more than a year, party officials had assumed that Mr. Lautenberg would seek a fifth term without any opposition. As the April 7 filing deadline for the primary approached, party officials began to pick up rumblings of a last-minute challenge from B. Thomas Byrne, a former state party chairman who is the son of former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne. 
 On Monday, the current party chairman, Assemblyman Joseph Cryan, hastily convened a news conference in Trenton to formally kick off Mr. Lautenberg's campaign, surrounded by more than two dozen legislators, union leaders and others. (It was also announced at the rally that Mr. Byrne had decided not to run.)
 It was an impressive array of power, as six out of New Jersey's seven Democratic United States representatives were there. The only one who was not, of course, was Mr. Andrews.

HEADLINE: U.S. Cites Planning Gaps In Iraqi Assault on Basra

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, ERIC SCHMITT and STEPHEN FARRELL; Michael R. Gordon and Stephen Farrell reported from Baghdad, and Eric Schmitt from Washington. Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
This article was reported by Michael R. Gordon, Eric Schmitt and Stephen Farrell and written by Mr. Gordon.
 Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker first learned of the Iraqi plan on Friday, March 21: Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki would be heading to Basra with Iraqi troops to bring order to the city. 
 But the Iraqi operation was not what the United States expected. Instead of methodically building up their combat power and gradually stepping up operations against renegade militias, Mr. Maliki's forces lunged into the city, attacking before all of the Iraqi reinforcements had even arrived. By the following Tuesday, a major fight was on. 
 ''The sense we had was that this would be a long-term effort: increased pressure gradually squeezing the Special Groups,'' Mr. Crocker said in an interview, using the American term for Iranian-backed militias. ''That is not what kind of emerged.'' 
 ''Nothing was in place from our side,'' he added. ''It all had to be put together.''
 The Bush administration has portrayed the Iraqi offensive in Basra as a ''defining moment'' -- a compelling demonstration that an Iraqi government that has long been criticized for inaction has both the will and means to take on renegade militias. 
 The operation indicates that the Iraqi military can quickly organize and deploy forces over considerable distances. Two Iraqi C-130s and several Iraqi helicopters were also involved in the operation, an important step for a military that is still struggling to develop an air combat ability. 
 But interviews with a wide range of American and military officials also suggest that Mr. Maliki overestimated his military's abilities and underestimated the scale of the resistance. The Iraqi prime minister also displayed an impulsive leadership style that did not give his forces or that of his most powerful allies, the American and British military, time to prepare. 
 ''He went in with a stick and he poked a hornet's nest, and the resistance he got was a little bit more than he bargained for,'' said one official in the multinational force in Baghdad who requested anonymity. ''They went in with 70 percent of a plan. Sometimes that's enough. This time it wasn't.''
 As the Iraqi military and civilian casualties grew and the Iraqi planning appeared to be little more than an improvisation, the United States mounted an intensive military and political effort to try to turn around the situation, according to accounts by Mr. Crocker and several American military officials in Baghdad and Washington who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 Two senior American military officers -- a member of the Navy Seals and a Marine major general -- were sent to Basra to help coordinate the Iraqi planning, the military officials said. Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were pressed into service as combat advisers while air controllers were positioned to call in airstrikes on behalf of beleaguered Iraqi units. American transport planes joined the Iraqis in ferrying supplies to Iraqi troops. 
 In Baghdad, Mr. Crocker lobbied senior officials in the Iraqi government, who complained that they had been excluded from Mr. Maliki's decision-making on Basra, to back the prime minister's effort there. 
 ''I stressed the point that this was a moment of national crisis, and they had to think nationally,'' Mr. Crocker said. ''Because nobody should think that failure in Basra is going to benefit any element of the Iraqi community. The response was good. I have not found any element of the Iraqi government that will admit to being consulted.''
 Basra, Iraq's second-largest city, lies atop vast oil reserves and is a strategically situated port on the Shatt al-Arab waterway controlling Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf. Predominantly Shiite, it has suffered from fighting among numerous Shiite militias, tribal forces and criminal gangs struggling for control of its lucrative smuggling and oil revenues. Even some of the Iraqi police are believed to be under the influence of militia groups. 
 British troops, who provided the main allied military presence in the province after the 2003 invasion, withdrew from the city center last September and formally handed Basra over to Iraqi control on Dec. 16, moving to an ''overwatch'' position at the airport outside the city center. 
 There has been growing concern with the Iraqi government about the disorder in the city. In recent weeks, Lt. Gen. Mohan al-Fireji, a senior Iraqi commander in Basra, proposed that additional forces be sent. 
 Prompted by this suggestion, a detailed plan was being developed by American and Iraqi officials, which involved the establishment of combat outposts in the city and the deployment of Iraqi SWAT teams, Iraqi Special Forces and Interior Ministry units, as well as Iraqi brigades. 
 That plan was the subject of a March 21 evening meeting that Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior American commander in Iraq, convened with Mowaffak al-Rubaie, Mr. Maliki's national security adviser. At the end of that session, General Petraeus was asked to meet with Mr. Maliki the next morning. The prime minister, it seemed, had his own ideas on how to deal with Basra and planned to travel to the city to oversee the implementation of his plan. 
 ''Effectively, much of the city was under militia control and had been for some time,'' Mr. Crocker said. ''Maliki kept hearing this along with some pretty graphic descriptions of militia excesses and just decided, 'I am going to go down there and take care of this.' I think for him it was a Karbala moment.'' Last August, Mr. Maliki rushed to Karbala after an outbreak of Shiite-on-Shiite violence, fired the police commander and oversaw the successful effort to restore order to the city. 
 One American intelligence officer in Washington, however, had a somewhat different interpretation of the prime minister's motivations. While restoring order was his stated goal, he asserted, the Iraqi leader was also eager to weaken the Mahdi Army and the affiliated political party of the renegade cleric Moktada al-Sadr before provincial elections in the south that are expected to be to be held this year. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, a Shiite political party and militia that are rivals to Mr. Sadr, his party and his militia, form a crucial part of Mr. Maliki's political coalition. 
 When Mr. Maliki met with General Petraeus on the morning of March 22, he indicated that his goal was to take on the ''criminals and gang leaders'' in Basra, according to an account of the meeting by an American official. Mr. Maliki explained that the operation would be an Iraqi affair but that he might need air support from the Americans. 
 He said that he was going to meet with sheiks, religious figures and other local leaders, taking advantage of the additional leverage he hoped to gain by sending in troops, fostering economic development programs and sending teams of judges to try to punish corrupt and violent behavior. 
 ''It was a unilateral decision by Maliki,'' said an American official familiar with the session. ''It was a fait accompli.''
 For the Americans, the timing was not good. The American military had little interest in seeing a hastily conceived operation that might open a new front and tempt Mr. Sadr to annul his cease-fire, which had contributed to the striking reduction in attacks over the past several months. Mr. Crocker and General Petraeus were also scheduled to testify to Congress the next month on the fragile political and security gains achieved in Iraq. 
 According to one American official, General Petraeus conveyed the message that while the decision was in the hands of the Iraqi government, ''we made a lot of gains in the past six to nine months that you'll be putting at risk.'' 
 But if Mr. Maliki was determined to act, General Petraeus advised him not to rush into a fight without carefully sizing up the situation and making adequate preparations, the official said. Sending a couple of brigades of the Iraqi Army, Special Forces and Interior Ministry forces was a complicated undertaking that under the best of circumstances would test the Iraqi logistical and command and control system. 
 The Iraqi forces started to arrive March 24. The attack into Basra began just a day later. Reports from Basra indicated that the militias were deeply entrenched. Adding to the problems, the Iraqis did not trust the British and were not including them in their planning, according to a senior American officer. 
 Faced with a fight that had escalated far beyond what the United States had anticipated, American commanders took several steps to support the Iraqis. Rear Adm. Edward G. Winters, a member of the Seals with experience in special operations, was sent March 25 to lead a lower-ranking American liaison team that had gone to Basra with Mr. Maliki. 
 Lt. Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the day-to-day commander of American and allied forces in Iraq, went to Basra on March 27 to survey the situation. The next day, his senior deputy, Maj. Gen. George J. Flynn, was sent to the Basra Operations Center, a command center that was supposed to oversee the military operations. General Flynn, a Marine officer, commanded a team of American planners and other personnel. 
 The United States also sent air controllers to call in airstrikes on behalf of Iraqi units and moved additional helicopters and drones down to Basra and nearby Tallil.
 There were not enough military advisers for all the Iraqi reinforcements who were rushed south. So the United States took a company from the First Brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division. It was divided into platoons, which were augmented with Air Force controllers and assigned to help the Iraqi forces. 
 The United States helped the Iraqis ferry in supplies by C-130. The Iraqis, however, also began to fly in supplies and troops using their two C-130s. More than 500 Iraqi replacement soldiers were moved by air while an additional brigade was sent by ground. The Iraqis also flew Huey and Hip multimission helicopters. 
 Taking a page out of the American counterinsurgency doctrine, the United States encouraged the Iraqis to distribute aid and mount job programs to try to win over the Basra population. 
 To ease the distribution of supplies, American officials from the Agency for International Development flew with Iraqi officials to Basra to work with United Nations officials. The Americans also encouraged Mr. Maliki to proceed with his plan to seek an alliance with the Shiite tribes, as the Americans had done with Sunni tribes in the so-called Anbar Awakening. 
 ''We strongly encouraged him to use his most substantial weapon, which is money, to announce major jobs programs, Basra cleanup, whatnot,'' Mr. Crocker said. ''And to do what he decided to do on his own: pay tribal figures to effectively finance an awakening for Basra.''

HEADLINE: In Senate, Agreement On Housing

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats and Republicans reached a tentative deal Wednesday on a package of legislation to help homeowners facing foreclosure, including new tax breaks intended to help stabilize the wider housing market. 
 The bill, which is expected to go to the Senate floor on Thursday, includes a new standard property tax deduction of $1,000 for couples and $500 for individuals that will benefit 28.3 million tax filers who do not itemize deductions on their annual returns. 
 The bill also includes $10 billion in tax-exempt bonds for local housing agencies to refinance subprime loans and provide new mortgages for first-time home buyers, $4 billion in grants for local governments to buy foreclosed properties and $100 million to expand counseling for homeowners at risk of defaulting on their loans. 
 In addition, it would give a $7,000 tax credit to purchasers of foreclosed homes and would provide a new tax break for struggling home builders, allowing them to claim current losses against taxes paid in earlier, more profitable years. Officials said the proposals would cost taxpayers $15 billion to $20 billion, with details still being worked out. 
 Several of the components in the Senate package have been under consideration by the House Financial Services Committee, which could help speed final approval and get the bill to President Bush's desk, where political pressure to help homeowners would probably limit the chances of a veto. But there is a chance that fiscal conservatives will insist on paying for the tax breaks, potentially setting off a fight over $11 billion in tax increases that would be needed.
 But even as Senate leaders cheered the deal as the fruit of new bipartisan resolve to address problems in the housing market, they said that a more expansive foreclosure-assistance plan, to extend an added $300 billion to $400 billion in federally guaranteed mortgages, would require separate legislation, after more hearings and negotiations. 
 ''I made a passionate plea for this proposal,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee. But he said many Republicans were not ready to sign on. ''It is complicated,'' he said. ''We're going to be presenting this at a couple of hearings, maybe as early as next week, on this issue and then offer this as soon as we possibly could.'' 
 Mr. Dodd announced the deal at a news conference on Wednesday with Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the Banking Committee's senior Republican. And he insisted that even the more modest package represented a crucial step forward.
 The tentative deal comes as lawmakers have voiced, with increasing urgency, the need to extend a helping hand to individual homeowners caught in the turmoil of the mortgage industry and the overall downturn in the housing market. 
 Senate Republicans, in particular, had felt compelled to move housing legislation quickly after the Federal Reserve's intervention to avert the collapse of Bear Stearns. 
 ''We have seen how we have dealt at least to some degree with Wall Street, a major collapse of a major investment bank,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''Obviously for millions of people on Main Street who wondered whether or not the Congress is paying attention to their concerns, what's happened to their homes, to their economic well being, this effort that we have put into the last several days, I think, is a major step in the right direction to offering some real hope to people on Main Street.'' 
 The package announced by Mr. Dodd and Mr. Shelby effectively stripped out the most contentious provision of a Democratic housing bill that the Republicans blocked in February -- a proposal to change the bankruptcy code to allow judges to modify the terms of mortgages on primary homes. 
 That provision will instead be offered as an amendment by its main supporter, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. Other amendments are expected and it was unclear how quickly the Senate would move to a vote. 
 The outlines of the measure suggested that the two sides had succeeded, at least for the moment, in maintaining a spirit of collaboration. Republicans had sought a larger tax credit of $15,000, to be credited over three years, for buyers of foreclosed properties but were apparently willing to settle for a $7,000 single-year credit. 
 Democrats, who had been pushing for an additional $200 million for homeowner counseling by nonprofit groups, agreed at least initially to settle for half that amount. Two Democrats, Charles E. Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington, were planning an amendment to add back the money. 
 The White House on Wednesday offered guarded praise but did not immediately commit to supporting the measure. ''This bill is a first step,'' said Tony Fratto, the deputy press secretary. ''It will be debated and, we hope, amended on the floor.'' He added: ''We have serious concerns about some elements of the bill like the funding to purchase foreclosed properties and the tax credit provision. We'll continue to review the legislative language.'' 
 The deal also includes some initiatives that President Bush has strongly supported, including tax-exempt bonds for refinancing of subprime loans and provisions that had been part of a separate bill to ''modernize'' the Federal Housing Administration.
 Different versions of that bill were approved by both the Senate and the House last year, but efforts to reconcile them had stalled until this week. 
 The new bill would set the cap on mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration at $550,000 in the most expensive real estate markets. 
 The economic stimulus package approved by Congress in February temporarily raised the limit to $729,750, from $362,790, in the most expensive markets, but lawmakers disagreed over where to set the cap over the long term. The bill also will increase the down payment required for F.H.A. loans to 3.5 percent, from 3 percent. 
 Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, said staff members had worked through the night to put it together. ''I think this is good news for the American people,'' he said. ''And I'm confident that we can process this fairly rapidly.'' 
 Mr. Shelby, too, said Americans should be heartened. ''We are going to work in a bipartisan way to tell the American people that we have heard from you.''

HEADLINE: World Bank Calls on Sovereign Funds to Invest in Africa

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The president of the World Bank, Robert B. Zoellick, called Wednesday for the major government-owned sovereign wealth funds of Asia and the Middle East to join with the bank in investing in Africa.
 In a speech aimed at the world's finance ministers and central bankers, who will be meeting in Washington this month, Mr. Zoellick said the West's mistrust of sovereign wealth funds could be assuaged if the funds set aside 1 percent of their assets to help private enterprise spread on the world's poorest continent.
 Sovereign wealth funds, including those controlled by the governments of China, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore, among others, are believed to have amassed nearly $3 trillion in assets, making them a larger player on the world's investment scene than hedge funds. Their wealth is expected to grow exponentially in the next five years. 
 A 1 percent diversion of their assets could add up to $30 billion a year in private investment for Africa.
 ''This 1 percent could be the start of something much bigger, across more types of funds and countries,'' Mr. Zoellick said, adding that such investments would show that the fast-growing government funds were not a cause for concern but rather a potential partner for solving the world's problems.
 Tens of billions of dollars have been invested by Asian and Middle Eastern funds in an array of American banks and investment banks. Many in Congress say they are wary of government-controlled foreign investments in private American businesses as a threat to the nation's economic security and independence.
 Led by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Bush administration has called for the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other international agencies to help the funds adopt a code of practices disavowing political motives in their investments and adopting greater disclosure of their activities and portfolios.
 Mr. Zoellick, who took office last year after the ouster of Paul D. Wolfowitz in the wake of an ethics scandal, has not generally been a part of the chorus of financial experts calling for adoption of changes by sovereign wealth funds. He gave his speech at the Center for Global Development, a policy institute in Washington.
 Mr. Zoellick said in an interview that there was little to fear from sovereign wealth funds because they had already been engaging in sound practices, but that expanding those investments to Africa would help build popular support in the United States and Europe.
 ''At a time when people are fearful of sovereign wealth funds, I'm saying let's look at this as an opportunity,'' he said in the interview. ''If we can create investment platforms for equity investments in Africa, everybody benefits.''
 Mr. Zoellick said that although much of Africa was in poverty and a global food shortage may make matters worse, Africa was also an investment opportunity much as China, India, Brazil and other once-impoverished nations were two decades ago. 
 From 1995 to 2005, he said, the economies of 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa that were not reliant on oil exports grew 5.5 percent. These represented more than a third of the area's population, he added, and could well become future places for investment in infrastructure and other projects helping them export and expand their private sectors.
 Mr. Zoellick proposed that the sovereign wealth funds join with the World Bank's vehicle for private-sector investment, the International Finance Corporation.
 ''Yes, the sovereign funds need transparency and should be guided by best practices to avoid politicization,'' he said. ''But I believe we should celebrate a possibility that government-sponsored funds will invest in equity in development.''

HEADLINE: McCain and Clinton Ads Spar Over How to Solve Home Mortgage Crisis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: PENSACOLA, Fla. 

 BODY:
Senators John McCain and Hillary Rodham Clinton released dueling advertisements Wednesday that highlighted how the housing crisis has come to dominate the presidential race, with Mrs. Clinton using a version of her red-phone commercial to question Mr. McCain's ability to handle the souring economy.
 In the advertisement, the Clinton campaign again portrays a family asleep in the middle of the night when the phone rings, meant to evoke a national crisis. The narrator then intones, ''John McCain just said the government shouldn't take any real action in the housing crisis; he'd let the phone keep ringing.'' 
 Within hours, the McCain campaign released an advertisement on the Internet. It starts with images of the Clinton advertisement, with the narrator then commenting, ''Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama just said they'd solve the problem by raising your taxes -- more money out of your pockets.''
 The advertisements highlighted how the two parties' candidates have developed starkly different approaches to the housing meltdown, with Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton calling for billions of dollars in aid for distressed homeowners and Mr. McCain warning against costly federal intervention. 
 Mr. McCain's rapid response recalled a similar advertisement by the Obama campaign in response to Mrs. Clinton's original red-phone advertisement, which questioned Mr. Obama's readiness to be president.
 The advertisements on Wednesday capped a day in which Mr. McCain gave speeches at old haunts, from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., to the Florida base here where he learned to fly, and revealed that he had begun drawing up a list of roughly a score of potential running mates.
 Mr. McCain joked on his campaign bus in Annapolis that his list had ''every name imaginable'' on it and stood at about 20 people but that there were probably a hundred people who thought they were on it.
 As nervous aides looked on and occasionally interjected to say that no decisions had been made, Mr. McCain said he had spoken with several people about heading the search for a running mate. 
 He broached the subject in a radio interview on Wednesday with Don Imus.
 ''We just started this process of getting together a list of names and having them looked at, and I don't know how long it takes,'' he said. ''But if I had a personal preference, I'd like to do it before the convention to avoid some of the mistakes that I've seen made in the past, as you get into a time crunch and maybe sometimes don't make the announcement right.''
 Choosing a conservative running mate might help Mr. McCain energize the Republican base, and a moderate might help him win the support of independent voters in swing states.
 Officials who have been mentioned include Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and several governors, like Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, Charlie Crist of Florida, Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah and Mark Sanford of South Carolina. 
 Former governors have also been mentioned, including Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, whose support of abortion rights could cause trouble among conservatives already wary of Mr. McCain, and former primary opponents, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas.
 Mr. McCain began the day in Annapolis, speaking in a chill wind at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium about his transformation from a rebellious youth to a presidential aspirant. 
 ''In truth, my four years at the Naval Academy were not notable for exemplary virtue or academic achievement but, rather, for the impressive catalog of demerits I managed to accumulate,'' said Mr. McCain, who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class. ''By my reckoning, at the end of my second class year, I had marched enough extra duty to take me to Baltimore and back 17 times, which, if not a record, certainly ranks somewhere very near the top.'' 
 In the contentious Democratic primary, meanwhile, Mr. Obama picked up two endorsements on Wednesday, one from a former congressman, Lee Hamilton of Indiana, which holds its primary in five weeks, and the other from a superdelegate, Gov. Dave Freudenthal of Wyoming. And he also suggested that in an Obama administration, he would find a role for former Vice President Al Gore, who is considered the ultimate prize among superdelegates.
 With the rivalry between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton splitting the party, Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, met with Florida party officials in an effort to resolve the seating of the state's delegates at the national convention. Florida's delegates have been barred because the state primary was held before party rules allowed. 
 No agreement was reached. 
 Mr. Dean said he hoped to seat the delegates but wanted the Obama and Clinton campaigns to agree on a resolution of the issue.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Sees Possible Contraction in First Half

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In his bleakest economic assessment to date, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Wednesday that the American economy could contract in the first half of 2008, meeting the strict definition of a recession, and he called on Congress to strengthen the nation's distressed housing industries.
 While not endorsing any specific proposals, Mr. Bernanke made clear that the home mortgage crisis remained the single biggest drag on prospects for a recovery, and said that it was up to Congress to act. He cited a need to strengthen federal agencies that insure mortgages.
 ''I think housing is very important, and we need to address it,'' Mr. Bernanke said at a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. ''But of course that's the Congress's sphere of influence, not the Fed's.''
 Democrats and Republicans in the Senate announced a broad agreement Wednesday afternoon on measures for homeowners facing foreclosure. 
 The willingness of Congress to act had been spurred less by Mr. Bernanke's comments than by the actions the Fed took last month in assisting the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase with a $30 billion loan. That prompted a groundswell in favor of what many lawmakers described as helping Main Street as well as Wall Street in the current crisis.
 Mr. Bernanke, as expected, vigorously defended the Fed's involvement in the Bear Stearns deal, especially its role in providing a loan that was secured by mortgage-related securities of uncertain value. 
 A chaotic credit crisis, potentially affecting thousands of individuals and institutions, would have resulted from a Bear Stearns bankruptcy filing, Mr. Bernanke said, adding at one point that he regarded the condition of Bear Stearns as unusually dangerous and that he saw no comparable threats on the horizon now.
 ''That was an extraordinary thing to do,'' the Fed chief acknowledged to Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas. ''I thought about it long and hard. I would hope not to ever do it again.''
 Under prodding from Democrats, Mr. Bernanke also went further than before in suggesting that the Fed would remain aggressive and vigilant to prevent a repetition of the Bear Stearns collapse. He said that regulators were already ''on site'' in the offices of investment banks to examine their books.
 Acknowledging that the Fed was moving beyond a traditional role of regulating bank holding companies and moving into a new realm of investment banks and other financial institutions, he said the Fed would examine several issues related to their solvency and risk management.
 ''Clearly, we're looking at asset quality and capital,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''We're looking at liquidity. We're trying to make judgments about risk management, earnings quality -- a variety of things that we look at to try to ascertain whether a financial institution is sound or not. And if not, you know, we need to push them to improve their processes, to raise capital, improve their liquidity.''
 There were no questions about whether this more assertive role by the Fed might lead to conflicts with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulatory agency that has always taken the lead in equity markets. Some Democrats in Congress say the S.E.C. has been lax in the current crisis.
 Led by Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, many lawmakers appeared encouraged that the Fed chief was not waiting for Congressional authority to move into the S.E.C.'s territory and regulate what Mr. Bernanke referred to as ''our brave new world, our much broader, more diverse set of financial institutions.''
 After the hearing, Mr. Schumer said of Mr. Bernanke, ''He's a more activist regulator than we've seen before at the Fed, and he wants to do more on housing.''
 Perhaps more encouraging to Democrats, it was also clear that the Fed chairman was not entirely pleased with the ''blueprint'' for a regulatory overhaul issued Monday by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., which called for an overhaul of the financial regulatory system, but with what some critics saw as a dilution of the Fed's authority.
 Mr. Bernanke, a former economics professor, sounded as if he was assessing a draft of a student's term paper, saying Mr. Paulson's blueprint was ''a very interesting and useful first step'' for Congress to consider.
 He seemed also to take a swipe at Mr. Paulson's call for the Fed to pull back from regulating smaller banks throughout the country, saying that the Fed needed to look at banks' books to ensure their solvency.
 ''I'm really arguing,'' he said, ''that we should not lose some of the powers we have now, which involve our ability to go into banks, make our direct assessments of their safety and soundness and if necessary, make rules that would keep them safe and sound from a systemic point of view.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke's assessment of the economic outlook did not seem to surprise listeners or the markets, which declined on Wednesday but not steeply. It reflected a growing consensus of economists that a recession was possible or even likely this year.
 But his words were cautious, skirting the use of ''recession,'' which economists define as two consecutive quarters of contraction in the gross domestic product, the nation's output of goods and services. Mr. Bernanke also said that the situation could improve later this year when the effect of the stimulus package of tax cuts and spending enacted by Congress started to have an effect.
 ''It now appears likely that real gross domestic product will not grow much, if at all, over the first half of 2008 and could even contract slightly,'' he said. ''We expect economic activity to strengthen in the second half of the year, in part as the result of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies.''
 Later, he said that ''a recession is possible,'' but that ''I'm not yet ready to say whether or not the U.S. economy will face such a situation.''
 Mr. Bernanke said he would wait until Thursday when he testifies with Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to provide details on how an outside financial adviser was chosen for the Bear Stearns deal and other matters.
 But in a startling disclosure, he said that he and his colleagues at the Fed did not know that Bear Stearns faced bankruptcy until March 13, a Thursday, and that they quickly realized that a failure to act would risk a global crisis. Fed officials, in contact with Mr. Paulson and his aides, worked through the weekend on the matter.
 Mr. Bernanke noted that the S.E.C. had viewed Bear Stearns as having ''adequate capital, relatively'' just before the crisis. Now, he said, the Fed is urging financial institutions to raise more capital.
 At one point, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, asked the Fed chief ''what bullets does the Federal Reserve have left in its guns'' to deal with future crises.
 ''Well, we've been pretty creative up until now,'' he commented, provoking a chuckle. ''We don't have anything currently on plans, anything currently that's about to be unleashed. We think we have a number of things already that we're using, and we hope that they'll prove effective.''

HEADLINE: In Rapper's $150 Million Deal, New Model for Ailing Business

BYLINE: By JEFF LEEDS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
In a move that reflects the anarchy sweeping the music business, the superstar rapper Jay-Z, who released his latest album to lukewarm sales five months ago, is on the verge of closing a deal with a concert promoter that rivals the biggest music contracts ever awarded. 
 Jay-Z plans to depart his longtime record label, Def Jam, for a roughly $150 million package with the concert giant Live Nation that includes financing for his own entertainment venture, in addition to recordings and tours for the next decade. The pact, expected to be finalized this week, is the most expansive deal yet from Live Nation, which has angled to compete directly with the industry's established music labels in a scrum over the rights to distribute recordings, sell concert tickets, market merchandise and control other aspects of artists' careers. 
 As CD sales plunge, an array of players -- including record labels, promoters and advertisers -- are racing to secure deals that cut them in on a larger share of an artist's overall revenue. Live Nation has already struck less comprehensive pacts with Madonna and U2. 
 In Jay-Z, Live Nation has lined up with a longtime star who, after toiling as a self-described hustler on the streets of Brooklyn, earned acclaim as a rapper and cachet as a mogul. 
 Live Nation's core business has revolved around major rock and country tours, and with Jay-Z it is making an unexpected foray into hip-hop. The company is also placing an enormous wager on a performer who, like many others, has experienced declining record sales. (Last year's ''American Gangster'' sold one million copies in the United States; ''The Black Album,'' from 2003, sold well over three million.) 
 But the arrangement would also position Live Nation to participate in a range of new deals with Jay-Z, one of music's most entrepreneurial stars, whose past ventures have included the Rocawear clothing line, which he sold last year for $204 million, and the chain of 40/40 nightclubs.
 Jay-Z, 38, whose real name is Shawn Carter, owes one more studio album to Def Jam, where he was president for three years before stepping down in December after he and the label's corporate parent, Universal Music Group, could not agree on a more lucrative contract.
 His first undertaking with Live Nation is his current 28-date tour with Mary J. Blige, his biggest live outing in more than three years. After that, Live Nation envisions integrating the marketing of all Jay-Z's entertainment endeavors, including recordings, tours and endorsements. 
 ''I've turned into the Rolling Stones of hip-hop,'' Jay-Z said in a recent telephone interview.
 The deal answers a question that had been circling through the rap world for months: Where would Jay-Z take his next corporate role? As part of the arrangement, Live Nation would finance the start-up of a venture that would be an umbrella for his outside projects, which are expected to include his own label, music publishing, and talent consulting and managing. Live Nation is expected to contribute $5 million a year in overhead for five years, with another $25 million available to finance Jay-Z's acquisitions or investments, according to people in the music industry briefed on the agreement. The venture, to be called Roc Nation, will split profits with Live Nation. 
 The overall package for Jay-Z also includes an upfront payment of $25 million, a general advance of $25 million that includes fees for his current tour, and advance payment of $10 million an album for a minimum of three albums during the deal's 10-year term, these people said. A series of other payments adding up to about $20 million is included in exchange for certain publishing, licensing and other rights. Jay-Z said Live Nation's consolidated approach was in sync with the emerging potential ''to reach the consumer in so many different ways right now.'' He added: ''Everyone's trying to figure it out. I want to be on the front lines in that fight.''
 The popularity of music downloads has revolutionized how music is consumed, and widespread piracy has contributed to an industry meltdown in which traditional album sales -- composed mostly of the two-decades-old CD format -- have slumped by more than a third since 2000. (The best seller in 2007, Josh Groban's ''Noel,'' sold 3.7 million copies, compared with 9.9 million for the top album in 2000, according to Nielsen SoundScan.) 
 That has further pressured record-label executives to rewrite the economics of their business and step beyond the sale of albums in an attempt to wring revenue out of everything from ring tones to artist fan clubs. 
 Jay-Z said that his future as an artist could involve elevating the role of live performances, long a mixed bag even for popular rap acts.
 ''In a way I want to operate like an indie band,'' he said. ''Play the music on tour instead of relying on radio. Hopefully we'll get some hits out of there and radio will pick it up, but we won't make it with that in mind.''
 Though sales for Jay-Z's tour with Ms. Blige have been strong since it began on March 22, with almost all the early dates resulting in sold-out arenas, it is unclear when Live Nation could carry out other aspects of the deal. (Jay-Z said that he hoped to deliver his final album for Def Jam later this year.)
 Critics of Live Nation, which lost nearly $12 million last year, predict that it would be difficult to turn a profit on the arrangement, given the continuing decline in record sales and the mixed track record of artist-run ventures. Shares in the company have suffered since October when Live Nation negotiated a reported $120 million deal with Madonna.
 Michael Cohl, Live Nation's chairman, said he was not worried. Though he declined to discuss terms of the Jay-Z arrangement, he said it did not require an increase in record sales to be profitable. ''He could be doing more tours and doing great,'' Mr. Cohl said. ''There could be endorsements and sponsorships.'' He added, ''The whole is what's important.'' 
 He cited Jay-Z's forays into a host of other businesses as a model for Live Nation. ''What he's done has kind of mirrored what we want to do and where we think we're going.'' 
 Some executives at major record labels have privately portrayed Live Nation's artist deals as overly expensive retirement packages for stars past their prime.
 Others disagree. ''I'd much rather be in the business of marketing a superstar who cost me a lot of money than taking the 1-in-10, demonstrably failing crapshoot'' of signing unknown talents, said Jeffrey Light, a Los Angeles entertainment attorney, referring to the traditional record company model.
 But the dimensions of the competition could change if Live Nation begins vying for the same emerging artists that the labels hope to sign. Live Nation is negotiating with a Georgia rock act, the Zac Brown Band, after apparently wooing it away from an offer by Atlantic Records, according to music executives briefed on the talks. 
 Jay-Z, for his part, suggested that the string of stars to exit the major-label system would also signal to younger acts how to plot their careers. He said that rising artists will be thinking: '' 'Something must be happening. Madonna did it, she's not slow. Jay-Z, he's not slow either.' ''

 JAILING OF CHINESE RIGHTS ACTIVIST
 Is Part of Crackdown, Critics Say
 A Chinese court sentenced one of the most prominent human rights proponents in the country, Hu Jia, to three and a half years in prison after ruling that his critical essays and comments about Communist Party rule amounted to inciting subversion. Critics say his conviction is part of a crackdown to silence dissidents before Beijing plays host to the Olympic Games. PAGE A11 
 HUNGER IN NORTH KOREA MAY RISE
 North Korea's rising tensions with South Korea and the United States, along with soaring international grain prices and flood damage, will probably take a heavy toll among famine-threatened North Koreans, experts said. The warnings followed a report that the North Korean government had suspended distribution of food rations in Pyongyang. PAGE A11 
 CASE OPENS IN BOMBING PLOT
 British prosecutors laid out charges at the trial of eight men accused of planning attacks on trans-Atlantic airliners ''in the name of Islam.'' The bombs were to have been made of hydrogen peroxide and other organic chemicals and smuggled onto the planes disguised as soft drinks. PAGE A6 
 U.S. SUSPENDS ARMS DEALER
 The State Department suspended the export activities of a Miami Beach arms-dealing company led by a 22-year-old man whose munitions procurements for the Pentagon are under criminal investigation, according to American officials. The Army had accused the firm's president of fraud, claiming he shipped Chinese cartridges to Afghanistan after certifying they were made in Hungary. PAGE A9

 POPE TO MEET JEWISH LEADERS
 During Trip to United States
 Pope Benedict XVI has added two brief meetings to the itinerary for his coming trip to the United States, both with Jewish leaders. Some Jewish leaders have expressed hope that the pope might use either occasion to announce a change in the prayer for the conversion of the Jews that is part of the Good Friday liturgy in Latin. Unlikely, a Catholic Church leader said. PAGE A12

 A finding of 14,000-year-old specimens of human coprolites -- that would be fossil feces -- has offered what discoverers call the strongest evidence yet of the earliest people living in North America, perhaps 1,000 years before the well-known Clovis people, previously thought to be the first Americans.

 Firefighters responded to the smell of gas at the construction site of a $2.4 million new home in Scarsdale, N.Y., and when a fire captain heard ''a very loud hiss'' he ordered workers off the property.

 The owners of Madison Square Garden showed plans for a $500 million renovation, with a new skylit entry, luxury suites and better views of the action.

 TOBACCO SUIT THROWN OUT
 A federal appeals court threw out an $800 billion class-action lawsuit on behalf of smokers who said cigarette makers misled them into thinking light cigarettes were safer than regular ones.

 ''Turnarounds are the test of a leader,'' said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School who has written a book analyzing turnarounds in sports and corporations.

HEADLINE: Old Ways, New Pain For Farms In Poland

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: STRYSZOW, Poland 

 BODY:
Depending on your point of view, Szczepan Master is either an incorrigible Luddite or a visionary. A small farmer, proud of his pure high-quality products, he works his land the way Polish farmers have for centuries.
 He keeps his livestock in a straw-floored ''barn'' that is part of his house, entered through a kitchen door. He slaughters his own pigs. His wife milks cows by hand. He rejects genetically modified seeds. Instead of spraying his crops, he turns his fields in winter, preferring a workhorse to a tractor, to let the frost kill off pests residing there. 
 While traditional farms like his could be dismissed as a nostalgic throwback, they are also increasingly seen as the future -- if only they can survive. 
 Mr. Master's way of farming -- indeed his way of life -- has been badly threatened in the two years since Poland joined the European Union, a victim of sanitary laws and mandates to encourage efficiency and competition that favor mechanized commercial farms, farmers here say. 
 That conflict obviously matters to Mr. Master. But it is also of broader importance, environmental groups and agriculture experts say, as worries over climate change grow and more consumers in both Europe and the United States line up for locally grown, organic produce. 
 For reasons social, culinary and environmental, small farms like Mr. Master's should be promoted, or at least be protected, they say. They not only yield tastier foods but also produce few of the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. 
 In part because Poland has remained one of the last strongholds of small farming in Europe, it is also a rare bastion of biodiversity, with 40,000 pairs of nesting storks and thousands of seed varieties that exist nowhere else in the world. 
 But European Union laws are intended for another universe of farming, and Polish farmers say they have left them at a steep disadvantage. If they want to sell their products, European law requires farms to have concrete floors in their barns and special equipment for slaughtering. Hygiene laws prohibit milking cows by hand. As a result, the milk collection stations and tiny slaughterhouses that until a few years ago dotted the Polish countryside have all closed. Small family farming is impossible. 
 ''We need to reward them for being ahead of the game, rather than behind it,'' said Sir Julian Rose -- an organic farmer from Britain -- who, with his Polish partner, Jadwiga Lopata, founded the International Coalition to Protect the Polish Countryside some years back and has been fighting the regulations. 
 ''The E.U. has adopted the same efficiency approach to food as it has to autos and microchips,'' he said. ''Those who can produce the most are favored. Everything is happening the reverse of what it should be if they care about food and the environment.''
 The small farmers who have rallied behind the coalition here in southern Poland have touched a deep nerve and gained broad influence. 
 Ms. Lopata received the prestigious Goldman Prize for protecting the environment for her quest to preserve traditional farms. Prince Charles visited her farm (by helicopter) with its solar panels and the black sheep (responsible for mowing the grass) in the yard.
 All 16 states of Poland have now banned genetically modified organisms in defiance of European Union and Word Trade Organization mandates. Last month, the Polish Agriculture Ministry announced that it planned to ban their import in animal fodder, another refusal to accept European Union policy. 
 In Brussels, headquarters of the European Union, officials say they have no desire to undo Polish tradition. ''We are not advocating the industrialization of European farming -- from our side we think there is a place in Europe for all shapes and sizes of farms,'' said Michael Mann, spokesman for the European Commission Agriculture Directorate. But, he said: ''There has to be some restructuring to become more competitive and less reliant on subsidies. Farming is a business. They will have to look for market niches.''
 The European Union currently pays farmers who meet health and sanitary standards a subsidy, to help maintain Europe's farming tradition and as an acknowledgment that it is more expensive to farm in Europe than in other parts of the world. 
 It also provides matching funds to all European Union national governments for agricultural development, to upgrade and modernize farms. The national governments decide what types of projects qualify, but the boundaries are loosely defined. In various countries they have included buying new equipment and developing organic cultivation, as well as turning nonperforming farms into bed-and-breakfasts. 
 In a coming review of such polices, the European Commission is planning to encourage spending more money to develop organic agriculture. ''The whole idea is to empower farmers,'' Mr. Mann said. 
 ''They don't need to change anything if they don't want to,'' he added. ''But they have to survive in business. If you're still milking cows by hand, maybe you would want to use the money to put in a new system.''
 While overall farm income in Poland has gone up since the country has joined the European Union, that is certainly not the case for the small farmers here. In Poland, 22 percent of the work force is employed in agriculture, and the country boasts by far the highest number of farms in Europe. Most of them are tiny. 
 The average farm size is about 17 acres, compared with about 59 acres in Spain, France and Germany. There are 1.5 million small farms in Poland. Only Italy, with its proliferation of high-end niche agricultural products, compares to Poland in its abundance of small producers. 
 But the fall of Communism and, more recently, European Union membership have opened this once cloistered land to global forces: international competition, sanitary codes, trade rules and the like. Sir Julian recalls that at an agricultural conference in 1999 a pamphlet advertised ''Poland up for grabs!'' That is what has happened, he said. 
 In a market newly saturated with huge efficient players, these small traditional farmers are being overwhelmed. The American bacon producer Smithfield Farms now operates a dozen vast industrial pig farms in Poland. Importing cheap soy feed from South America, which the company feeds to its tens of thousands of pigs, it has caused the price of pork to drop strikingly in the past couple of years. Since European Union membership, the prices of pork and milk have dropped 30 percent. 
 In early March, hundreds of Polish farmers demonstrated outside the office of Prime Minister Donald Tusk, complaining that they were losing money on each hog they raised. Anyway, Mr. Master said, raising pigs for sale was a nonstarter. He is forbidden to slaughter his own pigs, and the nearest abattoir that meets European Union standards is hours away; there are only five in all of Poland. 
 ''It is impossible for me to farm,'' he lamented over beet soup, in his ragged sweater and black work pants. He and his wife know that the European Union offers subsidies and loans to modernize traditional farms. But, they say, it is not enough money, it is not what they want and they are not adept at navigating the bureaucracy. They tried to fill out the paperwork to get certified as an organic farm but found it overwhelming.
 Poland has a tradition of small farming that has persisted for centuries. Unlike farmers in the rest of Eastern Europe, Poland's farmers even resisted collectivization under Communism. Now, Ms. Lopata said, they are ''organic by default,'' and ''at the vanguardof an ecological, healthy way of food producing.''
 In a small barn covered with matted straw, Barbara and Andrzej Wojcik say they feel like outcasts. They used to make a decent living selling pork from pigs they raised as well as the milk and butter from their six cows. 
 But they said that with the price of pork so low they could not afford to raise pigs slowly, the traditional way. As for milk, their local collection station closed a few years ago. So they have no way to get their products to market, even if they buy the required stainless steel equipment. 
 Now they have sold all but two of their cows and reverted to subsistence farming. They live off their parents' pensions, barter and a bit of money selling sewed crafts. ''The new laws are killing us,'' Ms. Wojcik said. 
 Mr. Mann, from the European Commission, acknowledges that small farmers in places like Poland may have to adapt. ''There is a place for the small farmer,'' he said, ''but they have to be smart and not rely on payouts.'' 
 But deft adaptation seems hard here, a place set in its ways -- and may be bad for the environment anyway. A collective system for selling organic vegetables to the city, devised by Ms. Lopata, never got off the ground.
 ''They tend to be very individualistic,'' she said. ''They think they survived Communist efforts to collectivize them, so they will survive this. They don't realize the European Union and the global market are even harder.''

 ASHLEY BICKERTON This artist's blisteringly vivid new works look as if they were collaboratively hallucinated by Joseph Conrad and Hunter S. Thompson during an all-night psychedelic drug binge. 
 In colorful digital photographs printed on canvas, partly overpainted and presented within wide, wooden frames elaborately decorated to resemble Indonesian tourist kitsch, Mr. Bickerton stars as a decadent Ugly American living in a South Pacific paradise. (He actually lives in Bali.) His skin is painted Blue Man Group blue, and he is accompanied by voluptuous female islanders whose partly nude bodies are painted in tropical hues. In various scenes he boozes, smokes pot and poses in a sarong in a garish family portrait with a native consort and two children. One especially lively piece, ''The Dream,'' right, has him howling in bed with a bright red demon squatting on his chest, and green snakes writhing about, each with a screaming head that's a small version of Mr. Bickerton's own. 
 These works meditate on a division in Western consciousness. On the one hand, they evoke the fantasy of throwing off conventional moral strictures and escaping to the margins of civilization, where pursuing one's instinctual desires to the fullest leads to artistic and erotic utopia (see: Paul Gauguin). On the other, there's anxiety that unchecked hedonism may be the road to moral insanity (see: Captain Kurtz). 
 That Mr. Bickerton makes this conflict personal is a big part of the attraction -- he's exploring his own Jungian shadow. Yet it feels as if there's a dimension missing. In portraying himself as a crazy, sexist, pleasure-loving creep, he might be covering up something really shameful: the intellectually astute, hard-working professionalism by which he maintains his perennially successful career in the high-end Euro-American art world. (Through May 3, Lehmann Maupin Gallery, 540 West 26th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-2923, lehmannmaupin.com.) KEN JOHNSON 
 Museums
 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'DESIGNED FOR PLEASURE: THE WORLD OF EDO JAPAN IN PRINTS AND PAINTINGS, 1680-1860,' through May 4. Organized by the Japanese Art Society, this show anchors the ''floating world'' of ukiyo-e prints firmly in economic and social reality. It includes works by well-known artists, including Hokusai and Hiroshige, and emphasizes the entrepreneurial role of print publishers and the relationship between printmaking, painting and literature in the Edo period. Because the prints are sensitive to light, ''Designed for Pleasure'' will be shown in two installments. Of the 148 works in the exhibition, 95 are currently on view; about two-thirds of those will be rotated out on April 4. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'UTAGAWA: MASTERS OF THE JAPANESE PRINT, 1770-1900,' through June 15. This fascinating show tells the story of a group of artists that dominated the woodblock print business in Japan for much of the 19th century. Not everything in it is a masterpiece, but among its 95 prints are stunning portraits of actors, geishas and warriors; colorful retellings of old myths; views of contemporary urban life; and gorgeous, poetically captivating landscapes. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO: THE CONTINUING CURVE, 1730-2008,' through July 6. This enthralling show has an extraordinarily high sumptuousness quotient. It explores the 18th-century Rococo style and its legacy, with a focus on furniture, ceramic vases, jewelry, mirrors, snuff boxes and other sorts of domestic ware. It includes works from most of the countries that Rococo reached, from Germany to Guatemala; takes in 19th-century Rococo revivals; and pursues the spirit if not the actual style of Rococo into the 20th century and beyond. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Johnson)
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'ART DOES NOT EQUAL LIFE: ACTIONS BY ARTISTS OF THE AMERICAS, 1960-2000,' through May 18. The redefinition of modernism(s) through the illumination of its Latin American manifestations has been one of the joys of the current New York art season. This revelatory addition concentrates on the Happenings, Conceptual and Performance Art and Body Art and video that thrived in Latin America despite, or in response to, dire political and economic situations. With photographic and video documentation in the majority, the toughness and scope of the material, aided by a thoughtful installation, create their own fascination. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 THE FRICK COLLECTION: 'PARMIGIANINO'S ''ANTEA'': A BEAUTIFUL ARTIFICE,' through April 27. Exhibitions don't come any smaller than ''Parmigianino's 'Antea': A Beautiful Artifice.'' A painting, a wall text, a nugget of a scholarly catalog, and that's it. It's enough. Certain pictures, like certain performers, don't need troops of extras to make a large effect. Solo suits them. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Holland Cotter)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CAI GUO-QIANG: I WANT TO BELIEVE,' through May 28. This museumwide survey of a leading Chinese artist indicates considerable command of cross-cultural references and extreme appropriation, including a gang of sculptors remaking a classic Social Realist ensemble of life-size figures while you watch. Gunpowder is a favored material, violence a frequent motif. A stop-action installation of seemingly exploding cars hangs in the atrium space. Scores of arrows make pincushions of snarling tigers (stuffed), and there are carved-wood religious sculptures and an entire fishing boat. Videos documenting pyrotechnical land-art pieces go boom. The show has far more than its share of hollow spectacle. The scorched, mural-size gunpowder drawings that combine elements of performance art, Abstract Expressionism and traditional Chinese and Japanese painting are the most believable. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'ARCHIVE FEVER: USES OF THE DOCUMENT IN CONTEMPORARY ART,' through May 4. You need no grounding in art theory to understand the messages generated by this powerful brain-pincher of a theme show. The archive of the title is less a thing or a place than a concept, an immersive environment: the sum total of documentary images, mostly photographic, circulating in the culture, on the street, in the media and finally in what is called the collective memory. From an Andy Warhol silk-screen of a black civil rights demonstrator attacked by police dogs, to a gallery wallpapered with the front pages of international newspapers reporting on the destruction of the twin towers, truth, untruth and their consequences make up the riveting story here. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0045, icp.org. (Cotter)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'THE COLLECTIONS OF BARBARA BLOOM,' through May 4. Instead of the walk-in installations for which Ms. Bloom is best known, this survey displays pieces from different phases of her career as discrete works of sculpture, assemblage, collage, photography and design. This is confusing, but attentive viewers will profit from studying her ideologically subversive, dryly humorous and formally inventive play with many different forms of representation, from faux-antique plaster self-portrait busts to a found-object sculpture in the form of a Braille edition of Playboy magazine. (See above.) (Ken Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'WARHOL'S JEWS: TEN PORTRAITS RECONSIDERED,' through Aug. 3. In 1980 Andy Warhol produced a series of portraits of famous Jews, including Sigmund Freud, Gertrude Stein and the Marx Brothers. When they appeared at the Jewish Museum that year, the critics hated them. But they were warmly received by Jewish audiences when they were exhibited in museums and Jewish institutions around the country. Viewing them in this return engagement, it is hard to imagine anyone growing very excited for or against such bland, posterlike images. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GUSTAVE COURBET,' through May 18. Starting with an amazing if claustrophobic gallery of self-portraits that emphasize Courbet's ambition, attention to the old masters and inborn truculence, this show offers a grand tour of one of 19th-century European painting's most unruly geniuses. Realism, at whose prow he is usually placed, is in many ways the least of it. Several works could easily date from the 20th century, by artists like Balthus, Picabia or Max Ernst. What Courbet made most real was the sheer, implicitly ironic uncanniness of painting itself, which he conveyed in a commanding discombobulation. Some paintings barely hold together; others collapse inward into strange, shapeless masses. No artist before Picasso put so much of himself on canvas; few since have built in so many spatial booby traps, ambiguous feelings or elements of rebellion and dissent. Some were conscious; others were left for us to discover, to feel in our bones. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JASPER JOHNS: GRAY,' through May 4. Since his paintings of targets and American flags took the art world by storm 50 years ago, Jasper Johns has been a cultural fact and the subject of numerous museum exhibitions. But this is one of the best. Moody, opulent and eloquent, it singles out his many paintings in gray, the color at the core of his sensibility, along with numerous sculptures, drawings and prints that are inherently gray. Together they chronicle his maturation from brilliant, methodical young artist to a deeper, more lyrical, less predictable one. And frankly, it is almost a relief to follow the incessant unfolding of this singular career without the brightly colored, better-known masterpieces. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'POUSSIN AND NATURE: ARCADIAN VISIONS,' through May 11. If a painter can be judged by the love he inspires, Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) was one of art history's great valentines. Corot, Delacroix, Constable and Cezanne all adored him. So did Picasso and Matisse. You can see why in this show of his post-Classical, pre-Romantic landscapes and drawings. Every age has a different style for ''serious'' in art; Poussin's was different from our own, but enthralling and moving in its moral gravity and poise. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'SILVERSMITHS TO THE NATION: THOMAS FLETCHER AND SIDNEY GARDINER, 1808-1842,' through May 4. Blending neo-Classical kitsch, patriotic flair and superb craftsmanship, the Philadelphia silversmiths Thomas Fletcher and Sidney Gardiner pumped up the genre of the commemorative cup to works of awesome, small-scale monumentalism. Standing almost 30 inches from its hairy paw feet to the furrowed brow of a bellicose eagle mounted on the lid of its soup tureen bowl, an urn made in 1813 to honor Capt. Isaac Hull was at the time the heaviest, tallest and most complex work in silver ever produced in North America. It is still pretty impressive. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF TIME: EUROPEAN CLOCKS AND WATCHES FROM THE COLLECTION,' through April 27. This enthralling, compact show presents about 90 European timepieces, ranging from pocket watches to grandfather clocks and dating from the 16th through the 18th centuries. There are traditional mantel clocks in wooden, peaked-roofed houses and extravagantly fanciful forms like one from 1579 that has a revolving globe engraved with star charts and figures of the zodiac held up on the wingtips of a flying horse, all beautifully fashioned in silver. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'CLOSE ENCOUNTERS: IRVING PENN PORTRAITS OF ARTISTS AND WRITERS,' through April 13. Last spring, in its first foray into modern photography, the Morgan Library & Museum acquired 67 of Irving Penn's portraits of artists, writers and musicians. (Thirty-five were donated by Mr. Penn.) The entire group is temporarily on view in an exhibition that complements the library's collection of 20th-century drawings, manuscripts, books and musical scores. Organized by a guest curator, Peter Barberie, ''Close Encounters'' encompasses work from the 1940s, when Mr. Penn first started to work for Vogue, through portraits published in The New Yorker in 2006. Mr. Penn's subjects, including Marcel Duchamp, Arthur Miller and Truman Capote, emerged from their portrait sessions with their carefully shaped personas profoundly shaken. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'MICHELANGELO, VASARI AND THEIR CONTEMPORARIES: DRAWINGS FROM THE UFFIZI,' through April 20. Michelangelo, with a couple of spectacular drawings, is the marquee name here, but many of the 16th-century Florentine artists he influenced fill the space, beginning with the extreme polymath Giorgio Vasari. A handful of drawings by Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino will knock your socks off, as will work by a few less familiar artists, all working to make the Medici rulers of Florence look good. (See above.) (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS & DESIGN: 'PRICKED: EXTREME EMBROIDERY,' through April 27. The second in a series of exhibitions (following last year's ''Radical Lace and Subversive Knitting''), ''Pricked'' makes another case for needlecraft without the ''craft.'' The show places widely known contemporary artists like Laura Owens and Ghada Amer alongside Elaine Reichek and others who have been working with thread and textiles since the '70s. In the best works historical and technical concerns overlap, just as they do in traditional embroidered samplers. 40 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 956-3535, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COLOR CHART: REINVENTING COLOR, 1950 TO TODAY,' through May 12. Organized by Ann Temkin, a curator in the museum's department of painting and sculpture, color functions as a ready-made in ''Color Chart'' -- something to be bought or appropriated, rather than mixed on a palette. The show is a rejoinder to the notion of color as the province of formalists, and to the idea that Minimal and Conceptual art comes only in shades of black, white and gray. In the upper section of the lobby a floor created by the artist Jim Lambie surrounds concentric strips of brightly hued tape. In the galleries there are postwar classics by Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg and Sherrie Levine. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'JAN DE COCK: DENKMAL 11, MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, 11 WEST 53 STREET, NEW YORK, 2008,' through April 14. The word denkmal translates from German as monument or memorial. In Dutch it is a mold for thought. Both definitions fit the work of Jan De Cock, a 31-year-old Belgian artist who appropriates and arranges photographs in what might be viewed as an open-ended yet ultimately conservative encyclopedia. Overflowing with references to modern art, experimental film, photography and architecture, the project pulls most of the museum into its orbit. It incorporates elements of De Stijl, Russian Constructivism and Kurt Schwitters's collage/studio Merzbau, among other things. It is also the starting point of a yearlong project called ''American Odyssey,'' for which Mr. De Cock will travel to various and document cultural landmarks around the country. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'PICTURING NEW YORK: THE ART OF YVONNE JACQUETTE AND RUDY BURCKHARDT,' through April 13 (Burckhardt); through May 4 (Jacquette). This dual exhibition displays photographs by Burckhardt, who died at 85 in 1999, alongside paintings by Ms. Jacquette, his widow and 20 years his junior, who is still working. Burckhardt's black-and-white images approach the city from several angles, descending from rooftops to street level and even into the subways. Ms. Jacquette's works peer down into the canyons between high-rises. This pair of shows does not establish either artist as an unjustly overlooked talent, but it reveals the competing visions of the city behind a romantic and creative partnership. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'GUSTAV KLIMT: THE RONALD S. LAUDER AND SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTIONS,' through June 30. The first New York museum show devoted exclusively to this Viennese master is less a coherent Klimt exhibition than a Klimt-o-rama. The main draw is a veritable retrospective of the drawings, erotic and otherwise, and a smattering of paintings starring the new-in-town, gold-on-gold ''Adele Bloch-Bauer I.'' Also here: a photo mural of sections of Klimt's most famous painted mural, the ''Beethoven Frieze''; a period room; photographs and personal effects, including one of the artist's signature caftans; and piped-in music, all written in Vienna of course, and available for purchase on CD. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)
 NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY, HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES LIBRARY: 'MONUMENTAL FRANCE: THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF EDOUARD BALDUS' AND SKETCHES ON GLASS: CLICHES-VERRE FROM THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY,' through June 28. This pair of exhibitions focuses on the experimental period after the birth of photography (the 1850s through the 1870s). Film had not yet been invented, but glass-plate and paper negatives allowed artists to micromanage the camera's performance or to bypass it entirely. ''Monumental France: The Photographs of Edouard Baldus'' gathers 38 artisanal prints of French architectural landmarks. ''Sketches on Glass: Cliches-Verre From the New York Public Library'' presents prints made with hand-drawn glass plates on light-sensitive paper (no camera required). Together these shows reveal that artists in mid-19th-century France blurred the distinction between the photograph and the unique object. Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 930-0830, nypl.org (Rosenberg)
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'DESIGN: ISAMU KENMOCHI AND ISAMU NOGUCHI,' through May 25. The Bamboo Basket Chair was the result of a brief collaboration in 1950 between the Japanese-American sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the Japanese industrial designer Isamu Kenmochi (1912-71). The chair was never manufactured, and the prototype was lost. The example here was recreated from photographs. Mostly, however, the chair provides an excuse to compare the design careers of Noguchi and Kenmochi and examine their roles in midcentury modern design, as well as the cultural relationship between Japan and the United States. Kenmochi's ''Japanese modern'' furniture is here, as well as a room devoted to Noguchi's most popular design achievement, the Akari light sculptures. 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'WACK! ART AND THE FEMINIST REVOLUTION,' through May 12. This big, messy, fascinating scrapbook of a show focuses on the years between the mid-1960s and the early '80s, when feminism had its most intense impact on contemporary art. Presenting works by 120 women, it is uneven in quality, but the overall effect is exciting. It takes you back to a heady time when women were throwing out old, patriarchal laws and reinventing art in all kinds of idiosyncratic and sometimes dangerously extreme terms. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
 SCANDINAVIA HOUSE: 'ARS FENNICA: FINNISH ART NOW,' through April 12. Finland has its own version of the Turner Prize in Britain: the $50,000 Ars Fennica Prize. This sleepy show presents works by 2007's four finalists. It includes gimmicky sculptures by Markus Kahre; fairy-tale-like images painted and drawn by Elina Merenmies; Anna Tuori's brushy, mock-kitsch paintings of vaguely Asian landscapes; and, by Elina Brotherus, large, bland landscape photographs and a relaxing video triptych of people skinny dipping in peaceful, outdoor waters. 58 Park Avenue between 37th and 38th streets, (212) 879-9779, scandinaviahouse.org. (Johnson)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2008,' through June 1. This year's light-touch show takes lowered expectations -- lessness, ephemerality and failure, to use the words of its young curators, Henriette Huldisch and Shamim M. Momin -- as its theme, and makes at least an appearance of trying to circumvent an object-obsessed market. With 81 artists, this is the smallest Biennial in a while, and feels that way, even as it fills three floors and more of the museum, and continues at the Park Avenue Armory (at 67th Street), with a program of installation and performance art. If the overall mix feels uncharismatic, there are good artists on hand, most with work commissioned by the museum for the occasion. In an anti-triumphalist show, uncertainty, political and existential, rules. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Uptown
 'FACES FROM MEDIEVAL JAPAN' Featured in religious rituals and then retired to temples where they continued to ward off evil, these rare 14th-through-17th-century carved wood masks depict demons, monkeys and, in one case, an old man in expressions that range from subtle to grotesque. They are displayed with a large Muromachi-period mandala depicting the Nachi shrine and its famous waterfall that should also not be missed. Koichi Yanagi Fine Arts, 17 East 71 Street, (212) 744-5577, through April 15. (Smith) 
 'WINE, WORSHIP AND SACRIFICE: THE GOLDEN GRAVES OF ANCIENT VANI' In small but elegant new galleries, a study center founded in 2006 under the auspices of New York University presents its inaugural exhibition. This show offers more than 100 objects unearthed from ancient graves in Vani, a cosmopolitan city established in Colchis -- modern-day Georgia -- in the eighth century B.C. It includes beautiful, intricate gold jewelry discovered in grave sites of the rich and powerful; the life-size bronze torso of a youth made in classic Hellenistic style; and two strikingly exotic bronze lamps with functional parts in the form of elephant heads. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, (212) 992-7810, nyu.edu/isaw, through June 1. (Johnson)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 JEAN ROYeRE Organized by two Parisian galleries, Patrick Seguin and Jacques Lacoste, this exhibition provides New Yorkers with a rare in-depth look at the work of Jean Royere (1902-1981). It includes 100 objects presented in plausible if free-flowing domestic arrangements designed by India Mahdavi and demonstrates the timeless appeal of this French master's fusion of Art Deco streamlining with the organic forms of the 1950s. Royere excelled at lighting design, and when it came to seating, he made round, low and even squat look great. Some of his chairs suggest a time and place when people tended to be shorter and thinner than in the here and now. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018, through April 12. (Smith) 
 Galleries: Other
 'UNDER PAIN OF DEATH' This uneven show about capital punishment has too many pieces that are only indirectly related to the theme, but it has some thought-provoking works, including ''The Last Supper,'' an Errol Morris-style documentary film by Mats Bigert and Lars Bergstrom, about preparing final meals for condemned prisoners; and an understated, oddly abstracted video by Harun Farocki in which surveillance tapes reveal murderous conditions in a maximum-security prison. Austrian Cultural Form, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org, through May 10. (Johnson)
 Out of Town
 SMITHSONIAN AMERICAN ART MUSEUM : 'COLOR AS FIELD: AMERICAN PAINTING, 1950-1975,' through May 26. An overdue, if far from perfect, reconsideration of Color Field painting reintroduces the joyful pictorial derring-do of an art movement partly done in by the single-minded advocacy of its biggest fan, the great American art critic Clement Greenberg. It is wonderful to see some of the best of this work float free of the Greenbergian claims for greatness and inevitability, propelled by the fantastic soft power of brilliant color, big scale and judicious amounts of pristine raw canvas -- especially as wielded by Helen Frankenthaler, Morris Louis, Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski. Perhaps humorless power-lust prevented Greenberg from seeing that if, as he said, Abstract Expressionism was Baroque, then Color Field might be Rococo: beautiful, sometimes frivolous and even comedic. Eighth Street and F Street, NW, Washington, (202) 633-7970, americanart.si.edu. (Smith)
 Last Chance
 'DIEBENKORN IN NEW MEXICO' In graduate school in Albuquerque at the beginning of the 1950s, Richard Diebenkorn put his own spin on the drawing-painting fusion of Willem de Kooning's black-and-white paintings, interjecting an elegant, waggish sense of line borrowed from George Herriman's Krazy Kat cartoons, along with brushy, glowing layers of color. He would later go on to make grander, more complex works, but in many ways his painting was never freer, less predictable or more full of the future than in New Mexico. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, at Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 'EARLY IMAGES OF THE FLOATING WORLD: JAPANESE PAINTINGS, PRINTS AND ILLUSTRATED BOOKS, 1660-1720' This exhibition examines the origins of ukiyo-e, or pictures of the Floating World, focusing on guidebooks to the Yoshiwara pleasure district and on shunga -- prints from erotic albums in which bare skin and rich kimono patterns contrast to sensuous effect. The colors, all applied by hand, are out of this world. Sebastian Izzard Asian Art, 17 East 76th Street, (212) 794-1522; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 HISPANIC SOCIETY OF AMERICA: 'FRANCIS AL$(YUML$)S FABIOLA' The first of three collaborations between the Dia Foundation for the Arts and the Hispanic Society of America is an astutely site-specific display of 300 Fabiola paintings collected by the artist Francis Als, who is based in Mexico. Made by devout amateurs worldwide, all are based on a lost original from 1885 and show Fabiola, the fourth-century saint, in profile, wearing a vibrant red veil. Mr. Als's 300 examples pepper dark-wood-paneled galleries with smoldering color and are consistent with the collaborative, subversive and open-ended nature of his art. North Building Galleries on Audubon Terrace, Broadway between 155th and 156th Streets, Washington Heights, (212) 926-2234, diaart.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 JIM HODGES The mercurial Mr. Hodges has produced a pair of walk-in installations that together create an impressive duality of divine light and infernal darkness. One is a circular enclosure of white canvases adorned with patterns and semi-abstract imagery made of gold leaf. The other is a small, wooden room in which a screen of radiating steel spokes frames a circular view into an impenetrable void. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-2766, crggallery.com; closes on Wednesday. (Johnson)
 PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF ART: 'NOTATIONS/WILLIAM KENTRIDGE: TAPESTRIES' This uneven show of not-so-lively collages, sculptures and prints, and 11 large and much livelier tapestries based on the collages, confirms that the work of this South African artist is best in translation, filtered through a second process. In this case it is the craft of expert weavers; the degree to which their increase in scale, texture, intricacy and color improves on the collages is more than striking. The subject here is displacement, refugeeism and survival, conveyed by the imposing silhouettes of ''Porters'' that either carry or oddly merge with objects while seeming to move across 19th-century maps of Europe and other continents. The style is a kind of send-up of Baroque art, but the images point metaphorically and painfully toward the future. Benjamin Franklin Parkway, at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 MARK SCHUBERT: '55 GALLON' The trickle-down effect of Lynda Benglis's early foam pour pieces and installations -- which she cast in heavy metals several years later -- is felt in this show of painterly, improvisational, no-nonsense sculpture. On the floor two aggregates of large foam spheres in shades of black, gray and white suggest scoops of melting ice cream consuming plastic lawn furniture and other junk. Meanwhile, in ''Rapture,'' foam and paint fasten scores of misshapen beer cans directly to the wall, creating a crazy quasi-painting that puns on Lyrical Abstraction (remember that?) and has a startling dermatological aspect, like stubble. Monya Rowe Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5065, monyarowegallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)

HEADLINE: In Plainfield, N.J., 27 Are Arrested in Raid Aimed at Gangs

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY and NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: PLAINFIELD, N.J. 

 BODY:
It is not uncommon for shots to ring out at night in the West End housing projects, where public surveillance cameras rise over parking lots. Across town, private cameras guard historic homes in the exclusive Sleepy Hollow section where the former governor, James E. McGreevey, lives. 
 Early Thursday in this city of contrasts, local police officers and state troopers swept in and arrested 27 people, completing a roundup that was begun in January and ended with the arrest of a total of 91 people suspected of being gang members. 
 When the raids were over, the police said, they had seized, from 39 homes, a dozen handguns, about $18,000 in cash, as well as crack cocaine, heroin, marijuana and a three-foot-long alligator. 
 Most of those arrested were charged with possession or distribution of drugs; one was charged with attempted murder, the police said. They ranged in age from their teens to 69. Many were suspected of being members of local gangs like the Clinton Avenue Posse, the Lib Side Boys, and the 116 Boys -- organizations affiliated with the Bloods gang -- though Sgt. Kevin O'Brien of the Plainfield narcotics bureau said one suspect was believed to be a member of the Crips. 
 It was not the first time that the authorities had cracked down on gang activity here. In April 2007, 17 people suspected of being members of the Clinton Avenue Posse were arrested on racketeering, weapons possession and drug charges. And in 2005, 33 people, including a corrections officer, were charged in a $1 million-a-week drug trafficking operation run out of a dollar store.
 The police chief, Edward Santiago, said he had lost track of the number of antigang operations he has led since coming to the city in 1975.
 After the crackdown last April, crime fell by 50 percent, and shootings dropped by 60 percent, Sergeant O'Brien said. But when rival gangs clashed last fall in nearby Dunellen, he said, the cycle of violence started up again, with 60 shootings from September to December and a killing in January.
 It was then that the local police reached out to the State Police gang unit and created Operation 5-Spot, so named because gangs were thought to be operating in five sections of town. 
 Lt. Col. Gayle Cameron of the State Police said the gangs in Plainfield seemed to be more homegrown than in other cities. 
 Residents say the gang problem is a result of a lack of alternative activities for young people; schools that some consider lackluster; and economic pressures, particularly for residents of the garden-style low-income housing projects in the city. 
 ''It's not just Plainfield,'' Mr. Santiago said. ''Wherever you have a significant high school dropout rate, and kids are on the streets, they're fodder for gang recruitment.'' 
 Sergeant O'Brien suggested that gang members stayed in Plainfield because they saw it as a place where they could ''make a living the easy way, with drugs and burglary.''
 Mr. Santiago warned at a news conference at the Union County administration building in Elizabeth that there were going to be changes: ''For those who choose to become gang members or associates of gang members, you are under our microscope. This is not the last operation, unfortunately. There will be more.''
 Plainfield, six square miles in size, has a population of 47,000. The downtown area still bustles and there is a low vacancy rate, but older residents bemoan the loss of the three or four movie theaters once here. Streets are lined with small restaurants, discount shops and money-transfer stores.
 The city began as a Quaker farming village and remained one until a rail line was built connecting it with New York City, said John Grady, who was one of the authors of a book on the city's history. Situated at the foot of the Watchung Mountains and recognized for its natural spring water, it became known as a healthy place to live.
 ''It became a place for wealthy New Yorkers,'' Mr. Grady said. It also became a shopping hub. 
 Then 1967 arrived.
 Race riots flared on the west side of town and soon many businesses fled to the highways on the outskirts of town or out of town completely, to the newly fashionable shopping malls. 
 ''The town obtained a reputation as a dangerous place to be,'' Mr. Grady said.
 Plainfield has in recent years been known as a place where working-class people can afford to buy a house. It attracts many couples without children, perhaps because the schools belong to one of the state's 31 so-called Abbott districts, historically poor and urban districts. 
 A year ago, Mano Starks, a barber at Gentleman's Quarters on Park Avenue, downtown, helped his brother build a boxing ring in the basement of the shop. They hung punching bags and speed bags and set up weights to try to get children off the streets. 
 ''At least we can give them something to do for a few hours,'' Mr. Starks said.

HEADLINE: The Patient Is Healthy But Dead

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
Bear Stearns never ran short of capital. It just could not meet its obligations.
 At least that is the view from Washington, where regulators never stepped in to force the investment bank to reduce its high leverage even after it became clear Bear was struggling last summer. Instead, the regulators issued repeated reassurances that all was well.
 Bear's principal regulator was the Securities and Exchange Commission, which says it was watching closely. ''At all times,'' wroteChristopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, in the aftermath of the collapse, ''the firm had a capital cushion well above what is required to meet supervisory standards.'' 
 Even when the Federal Reserve concluded it had to subsidize a takeover of Bear by JPMorgan Chase to preserve the financial system, Mr. Cox wrote, Bear qualified under the Fed's rules as ''well capitalized.''
 Could that indicate there is something wrong with the Fed's rules? Does it sound a little like a doctor emerging from a funeral to proclaim that he did an excellent job of treating the late patient?
 The S.E.C. does not see it that way. It its view, this was a case of an old-fashioned bank run, and no capital standards can stop such a run when confidence is lost.
 ''That kind of statement is a condemnation of the kind of supervision that the S.E.C. did,'' said one expert on financial regulation, Edward J. Kane, a finance professor at Boston College, in an interview this week. ''If there is good capital, you should be able to convince your counterparties of it.''
 The S.E.C. assumed that Bear, or any other investment bank, could always borrow against securities it owned. It assumed that lenders would put up at least 93 percent of the value of those securities, and as much as 97 percent for the safer ones.
 In a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Analysis, prepared for a conference to be held next week at Cambridge University, Mr. Kane assigned some of the blame for the current credit crisis to international regulatory competition, in which national regulators, fearful of seeing business go overseas, dared not be too tough.
 Instead, regulators from around the world agreed on common capital standards, the latest version of which is known as Basel II. That standard has loopholes that allowed banks to add lots of leverage, some of it pushed off balance sheets in ways that obscured the risks that remained and minimized the apparent need for capital. The job of determining the risk of various assets, and thus the amount of capital needed, was largely subcontracted to bond rating agencies and to the banks themselves. 
 ''On the grounds that they were helping innovative U.S. firms to compete effectively in global markets, federal supervisors refused to take on the political and practical challenge of establishing and maintaining their ability to see and to discipline complicated risk exposures,'' Mr. Kane said.
 If any big bank was going to have a lot of leverage, it was almost inevitable that all would. In good times, it is hard for a more conservative institution to stay competitive when its rivals use borrowing to magnify profits.
 It is no coincidence that the crisis of 2007 and 2008 had its origin in unregulated financial products traded in unregulated markets. Ever since the Great Depression, the government has tried to limit the leverage available to the public in the American stock market. But regulators, led by Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, thought innovation would be hampered, and financial activity driven overseas, if there were any attempts to impose limits on leverage in the unregulated markets.
 The Treasury Department regulatory overhaul proposal introduced this week had its genesis in a move to relax regulation to make American markets more competitive. 
 The proposal took for granted the benefits of financial innovation, but unfortunately was released just when that innovation was shown to have failed in ways that left the American credit system largely dependent on government guarantees to function at all. Few mortgage loans are now being made without some kind of guarantee from the government or from government-sponsored enterprises, and investment banks now have the assurance they can borrow from the Federal Reserve.
 ''A severely overleveraged banking system may be portrayed as an accident waiting to happen,'' Mr. Kane wrote. ''A regulation-induced crisis occurs when misfortune impacts a banking system whose managers have made their institutions vulnerable to this amount and type of bad luck.''
 For now, market revulsion is limiting leverage in the system and driving banks to raise more capital if they can. Mr. Cox told a Senate hearing Thursday that the Basel committee should think more about liquidity. But there has been no admission from regulators that they erred in letting leverage get so far out of hand that a ''well capitalized'' company could not find anyone willing to lend it money without government help.

HEADLINE: European Plan to Treat Bank Failures Advances

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
Europe's finance ministers are expected to agree on Friday to guidelines for handling cross-border banking failures, their first steps to address potential threats brought on by the tight credit markets. 
 In a sign of the growing concern over the international banking system, European ministers will sign an agreement promising deeper European cooperation, and establishing principles to be applied when a financial institution operating in different countries faces difficulties. 
 However, the document will not propose creation of a European regulator or lay down strict rules. Instead it will bind the national authorities to favor private-sector rescues where possible, and urge them to decide in advance who would pay the bill for banks that operate in more than one country if a state bailout is required. 
 The memorandum of understanding, to be signed at a meeting in Slovenia, highlights the mounting concern about the health of the banking system in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage collapse. 
 Financial integration increases ''the likelihood of a systemic crisis affecting more than one member state,'' said a draft of the document obtained by The International Herald Tribune. 
 Banks have had to write down an estimated $200 billion or more in debt after mortgage defaults in the United States led to a tighter credit market and caused a liquidity crisis. 
 In signing the agreement, which will take effect July 1, European finance ministers will pledge to exchange information and assessments of potential problems, coordinate public communication and establish contingency plans including ''stress testing and simulation exercises.'' 
 They will also commit to favoring private-sector solutions. 
 ''The management of ailing institutions will be held accountable, shareholders will not be bailed out and creditors and uninsured depositors should expect to face losses,'' the document says. ''The use of public money to resolve a crisis can never be taken for granted and will only be considered to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy.''
 The memorandum, drafted by Slovenia, which holds the European presidency, calls on interested parties to consider creating ''cross-border stability groups,'' building on existing supervisory networks of supervisors. 
 Though the idea was not mentioned, ministers at the informal meeting will debate proposals from Italy and Hungary for a European regulator. The suggestion, however, is not likely to win much support. 
 ''Though the Italians would like a European regulator, there is no political appetite for that in most of the largest member states,'' said Philip Whyte, senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform in London. ''The memorandum of understanding accepts the political reality that we are not going to have a pan-European regulator while impressing the need for greater cooperation among European regulators that have shared responsibility.''
 Under the expected guidelines, a home country's central bank, finance ministry or supervisory body would assume the role of cross-border coordinator.

ART
 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. 
 Museums
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO: THE CONTINUING CURVE, 1730-2008,' through July 6. This enthralling show has an extraordinarily high sumptuousness quotient. It explores the 18th-century Rococo style and its legacy, with a focus on furniture, ceramic vases, jewelry, mirrors, snuff boxes and other sorts of domestic ware. It includes works from most of the countries that Rococo reached, from Germany to Guatemala; takes in 19th-century Rococo revivals; and pursues the spirit if not the actual style of Rococo into the 20th century and beyond. 2 East 91st Street, Manhattan, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'ART DOES NOT EQUAL LIFE: ACTIONS BY ARTISTS OF THE AMERICAS, 1960-2000,' through May 18. The redefinition of modernism(s) through the illumination of its Latin American manifestations has been one of the joys of the current New York art season. This revelatory addition concentrates on the Happenings, Conceptual and Performance Art and Body Art and video that thrived in Latin America despite, or in response to, dire political and economic situations. With photographic and video documentation in the majority, the toughness and scope of the material, aided by a thoughtful installation, create their own fascination. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CAI GUO-QIANG: I WANT TO BELIEVE,' through May 28. This museumwide survey of a leading Chinese artist indicates considerable command of cross-cultural references and extreme appropriation, including a gang of sculptors remaking a classic Social Realist ensemble of life-size figures while you watch. Gunpowder is a favored material, violence a frequent motif. A stop-action installation of seemingly exploding cars hangs in the atrium space. Scores of arrows make pincushions of snarling tigers (stuffed), and there are carved-wood religious sculptures and an entire fishing boat. Videos documenting pyrotechnical land-art pieces go boom. The show has far more than its share of hollow spectacle. The scorched, mural-size gunpowder drawings that combine elements of performance art, Abstract Expressionism and traditional Chinese and Japanese painting are the most believable. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'WARHOL'S JEWS: TEN PORTRAITS RECONSIDERED,' through Aug. 3. In 1980 Andy Warhol produced a series of portraits of famous Jews, including Sigmund Freud, Gertrude Stein and the Marx Brothers. When they appeared at the Jewish Museum that year, the critics hated them. But they were warmly received by Jewish audiences when they were exhibited in museums and Jewish institutions around the country. Viewing them in this return engagement, it is hard to imagine anyone growing very excited for or against such bland, posterlike images. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GUSTAVE COURBET,' through May 18. Starting with an amazing if claustrophobic gallery of self-portraits that emphasize Courbet's ambition, attention to the old masters and inborn truculence, this show offers a grand tour of one of 19th-century European painting's most unruly geniuses. Realism, at whose prow he is usually placed, is in many ways the least of it. Several works could easily date from the 20th century, by artists like Balthus, Picabia or Max Ernst. What Courbet made most real was the sheer, implicitly ironic uncanniness of painting itself, which he conveyed in a commanding discombobulation. Some paintings barely hold together; others collapse inward into strange, shapeless masses. No artist before Picasso put so much of himself on canvas; few since have built in so many spatial booby traps, ambiguous feelings or elements of rebellion and dissent. Some were conscious; others were left for us to discover, to feel in our bones. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'MICHELANGELO, VASARI AND THEIR CONTEMPORARIES: DRAWINGS FROM THE UFFIZI,' through April 20. Michelangelo, with a couple of spectacular drawings, is the marquee name here, but many of the 16th-century Florentine artists he influenced fill the space, beginning with the extreme polymath Giorgio Vasari. A handful of drawings by Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino will knock your socks off, as will work by a few less familiar artists, all working to make the Medici rulers of Florence look good. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008590-0310, morganlibrary.org. (Holland Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COLOR CHART: REINVENTING COLOR, 1950 TO TODAY,' through May 12. Organized by Ann Temkin, a curator in the museum's department of painting and sculpture, color functions as a ready-made in ''Color Chart'' -- something to be bought or appropriated, rather than mixed on a palette. The show is a rejoinder to the notion of color as the province of formalists, and to the idea that Minimal and Conceptual art comes only in shades of black, white and gray. In the upper section of the lobby a floor created by the artist Jim Lambie surrounds concentric strips of brightly hued tape. In the galleries there are postwar classics by Ellsworth Kelly, Robert Rauschenberg and Sherrie Levine. (212) 708-9400, moma.org.
 (Karen Rosenberg)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'WACK! ART AND THE FEMINIST REVOLUTION,' through May 12. This fascinating scrapbook of a show focuses on the years between the mid-1960s and the early '80s, when feminism had its most intense impact on contemporary art. Presenting works by 120 women, it is uneven in quality, but the overall effect is exciting. It takes you back to a heady time when women were throwing out old, patriarchal laws and reinventing art in all kinds of idiosyncratic and sometimes dangerously extreme terms. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WHITNEY BIENNIAL 2008,' through June 1. This year's light-touch show takes lowered expectations -- lessness, ephemerality and failure, to use the words of its young curators, Henriette Huldisch and Shamim M. Momin -- as its theme, and makes at least an appearance of trying to circumvent an object-obsessed market. With 81 artists, this is the smallest Biennial in a while, and feels that way, even as it fills three floors and more of the museum, and continues at the Park Avenue Armory (at 67th Street), with a program of installation and performance art. If the overall mix feels uncharismatic, there are good artists on hand, most with work commissioned by the museum for the occasion. In an anti-triumphalist show, uncertainty, political and existential, rules. (212) 570-3676, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Uptown
 'FACES FROM MEDIEVAL JAPAN' Featured in religious rituals and then retired to temples where they continued to ward off evil, these rare 14th-through-17th-century carved wood masks depict demons, monkeys and, in one case, an old man in expressions that range from subtle to grotesque. They are displayed with a large Muromachi-period mandala depicting the Nachi shrine and its famous waterfall that should also not be missed. Koichi Yanagi Fine Arts, 17 East 71 Street, (212) 744-5577, through April 15. (Smith) 
 Galleries: Chelsea
 JEAN ROYeRE Organized by two Parisian galleries, Patrick Seguin and Jacques Lacoste, this exhibition provides New Yorkers with a rare in-depth look at the work of Jean Royere (1902-1981). It includes 100 objects presented in plausible if free-flowing domestic arrangements designed by India Mahdavi and demonstrates the timeless appeal of this French master's fusion of Art Deco streamlining with the organic forms of the 1950s. Royere excelled at lighting design, and when it came to seating, he made round, low and even squat look great. Sonnabend Gallery, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018, through April 12. (Smith) 
 Galleries: Other
 'UNDER PAIN OF DEATH' This uneven show about capital punishment has too many pieces that are only indirectly related to the theme, but it has some thought-provoking works, including ''The Last Supper,'' an Errol Morris-style documentary film by Mats Bigert and Lars Bergstrom, about preparing final meals for condemned prisoners; and an understated, oddly abstracted video by Harun Farocki in which surveillance tapes reveal murderous conditions in a maximum-security prison. Austrian Cultural Form, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, acfny.org, through May 10. (Johnson)
 Last Chance
 'DIEBENKORN IN NEW MEXICO' In graduate school in Albuquerque at the beginning of the 1950s, Richard Diebenkorn put his own spin on the drawing-painting fusion of Willem de Kooning's black-and-white paintings, interjecting an elegant, waggish sense of line borrowed from George Herriman's Krazy Kat cartoons, along with brushy, glowing layers of color. He would later go on to make grander works, but in many ways his painting was never freer or more full of the future than in New Mexico. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, at Waverly Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 'EARLY IMAGES OF THE FLOATING WORLD: JAPANESE PAINTINGS, PRINTS AND ILLUSTRATED BOOKS, 1660-1720' This exhibition examines the origins of ukiyo-e, or pictures of the Floating World, focusing on guidebooks to the Yoshiwara pleasure district and on shunga -- prints from erotic albums in which bare skin and rich kimono patterns contrast to sensuous effect. The colors, all applied by hand, are out of this world. Sebastian Izzard Asian Art, 17 East 76th Street, (212) 794-1522; closes on Saturday. (Smith)
 HISPANIC SOCIETY OF AMERICA: 'FRANCIS AL$(YUML$)S FABIOLA' The first of three collaborations between the Dia Foundation for the Arts and the Hispanic Society of America is an astutely site-specific display of 300 Fabiola paintings collected by the artist Francis Als, who is based in Mexico. Made by devout amateurs worldwide, all are based on a lost original from 1885 and show Fabiola, the fourth-century saint, in profile, wearing a vibrant red veil. Mr. Als's 300 examples pepper dark-wood-paneled galleries with smoldering color and are consistent with the collaborative, subversive and open-ended nature of his art. North Building Galleries on Audubon Terrace, Broadway between 155th and 156th Streets, Washington Heights, (212) 926-2234, diaart.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 JIM HODGES The mercurial Mr. Hodges has produced a pair of walk-in installations that together create an impressive duality of divine light and infernal darkness. One is a circular enclosure of white canvases adorned with patterns and semi-abstract imagery made of gold leaf. The other is a small, wooden room in which a screen of radiating steel spokes frames a circular view into an impenetrable void. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-2766, crggallery.com; closes on Wednesday. (Johnson)
 MARK SCHUBERT: '55 GALLON' The trickle-down effect of Lynda Benglis's early foam pour pieces and installations -- which she cast in heavy metals several years later -- is felt in this show of painterly, improvisational, no-nonsense sculpture. On the floor two aggregates of large foam spheres in shades of black, gray and white suggest scoops of melting ice cream consuming plastic lawn furniture and other junk. Meanwhile, in ''Rapture,'' foam and paint fasten scores of misshapen beer cans directly to the wall, creating a crazy quasi-painting that puns on Lyrical Abstraction (remember that?) and has a startling dermatological aspect, like stubble. Monya Rowe Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5065, monyarowegallery.com; closes on Saturday. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Out of Africa, Whatever Africa May Be

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Afropolitanism is the modish tag for new work made by young African artists both in and outside Africa. What unites the artists is a shared view of Africa, less as a place than as a concept; a cultural force, one that runs through the world the way a gulf stream runs through an ocean: part of the whole, but with its own tides and temperatures. 
 This idea, or something like it, lies behind ''Flow'' at the Studio Museum in Harlem, a fine-textured survey of 20 artists who, with a few exceptions, were born in Africa after 1970 but who now live in Europe or the United States. 
 Before the 1980s contemporary African artists had virtually no presence in the mainstream Euro-American art world. And on the rare occasions they were admitted to its precincts, they were required to show clear evidence of Africanness -- Africanness as gauged by Western standards, that is -- in their work, like a visa prominently displayed. 
 Multiculturalism, whatever its deficiencies, began to change this situation. It exposed art-world apartheid for what it was and forced open some long-locked gates. Not only did artists once excluded by color and class gain entry, they were also granted certain options as to how they might appear there. They could wrap themselves in evidence of their origins, or wear that evidence lightly, or not at all, the first option being preferred by the market. 
 The artists in ''Flow'' choose among these options, which means the show has no essential look, though there are broad patches of formal common ground. A lot of what's here is based on an aesthetic of assemblage and fragmentation, the piecing together or taking apart of materials and ideas, including art-historical precedents. 
 Latifa Echakhch, born in Morocco and now living in France and Switzerland, has created her own version of Richard Serra's ''Splash'' pieces from the 1960s. Rather than throw molten lead against a wall as Mr. Serra did, she throws Moroccan tea glasses. Their smashed remains lie on a gallery floor like the aftermath of an explosion. The piece neatly pinpoints the aggression of the original, an aggression with many metaphorical and political ramifications. But is Ms. Echakhch's work topical? Polemical? Whimsical? Personal? It shifts from one to the other of these possibilities, which is, generally speaking, the ''Flow'' dynamic. 
 A second North African, Adel Abdessemed, Algerian by birth and now living in Paris, starts with many fragments and builds something from them. In this case the result is a toy-size model of the luxury liner Queen Mary II pieced together from cut-up bits of commercial packaging for olives and pepper, products exported from a continent that helped produce the immense wealth the ship represents. 
 Modou Dieng, a Senegalese artist now in the United States, evokes the exhilaration and misplaced optimism of 1960s Africa in his trio of wall ensembles made from secondhand vinyl records adorned with neckties and glitter. The names on the record labels range from Nat King Cole to Jimi Hendrix to Mos Def, suggesting that the high cultural moment, which also saw the ballooning of a market economy, extends into the present.
 It does. It's there in the photographs of Nontsikelelo Veleko, known as Lolo, of fiercely chic young Johannesburgians, and in the heroically scaled portraits, culled from fashion magazines but resembling passport photos and mug shots, by Mustafa Maluka, a fine painter who was also one of the creators of africanhiphop.com, a music Web site and pop-cultural gold mine now a decade old. 
 The evidence of material richness continues where crafts traditions and modernist abstraction meet: in moss-green yarn reliefs by the Ethiopian artist Elias Sime; in Nicholas Hlobo's suturelike stitched pieces based on Zulu needlework; and in enigmatic collages by Moshekwa Langa, one of several artists in the show who were also in ''Africa Remix,'' the grand contemporary survey in 2005 that never made it from Europe to the United States. 
 A few artists revisit and revise primitivist myths of Africa. Thierry Fontaine does this in photographs of his own body transformed by layers of natural materials -- clay, sand, grass -- into a series of freakish sculptures. So does Joel Andrianomearisoa in a video called ''The Stranger'' (2007), in which a naked man evolves from prowling the forest to settling down in a nice, neat house. It's worth noting that the ''native'' in this civilizing process appears to be white. 
 The show, organized by Christine Y. Kim, associate curator at the Studio Museum, has a fair amount of video. A short piece called ''Back to Me 1'' by the South African artist Thando Mama gives a sense of what it's like to be plugged into the world when the world isn't plugged into you. A young man (the artist) sits transfixed in front of a television that is broadcasting inaccurate accounts from abroad of the Africa he knows.
 Grace Ndiritu, born in London of African parents, and Michele Magema, from Congo and now living in Paris, both address liabilities of Afropolitanism, past and present. In a striking film called ''Au Bord de la Loire,'' one of a small number of pieces in the show to address race directly, Ms. Magema reminds us that a few centuries ago her relationship to France might have been as a West Indies slave. Ms. Ndiritu acknowledges her conflicted connection to Africa now: despite her heritage, she's a tourist there. 
 For tourists and transplants, can any place be real? Ananias Leki Dago, born in Ivory Coast, photographs the slums of Paris as if through the haze of dreams. Mounir Fatmi turns the immigrant's life into an obstacle course of bright-colored horse-jumping poles. In a mural by Dawit L. Petros views of Tanzania, California and Canada -- all places where the artist has lived -- merge. Monrovia, the strife-wracked capital of Liberia, becomes the heavenly city in Trokon Nagbe's gilded painting of it. And in studio photographs by Otobong Nkanga, Africa's grand landscape is reduced to a tabletop diorama, a Lilliputian thing.
 So Africa is unreal. Or maybe it's super-real: a place, or state, where present and future coexist. Ms. Veleko's street dandies look futuristic enough. So do Olalekan B. Jeyifous's marvelous architectural models, like materializations of cyberspace; and the imaginary faces, half human, half something else, that peer out of darkness in Lynette Yiadom-Boakye's fictional portraits.
 Some of the eight portraits in the show are more interesting than others. Some are almost too dark to see; put them in an art fair and they'd vanish in the visual noise. Yet as a group they work; they wrap you in a substantial if elusive sensibility. To some degree the same can be said of ''Flow.'' 
 Whether, or how, that sensibility can be defined as ''African'' is a question. There is no single Africa, and the continent's multiple elements change all the time, art included. No wonder artists are resisting the idea of Africanness as a fixed identity, or are trying to tailor it to something they can pick up or lay aside at will, and layer under and over other identities. 
 At the same time they understand, it would seem, that their choices have weight. Postcolonial African art, wherever it is produced, is all but inseparable from politics. In Africa art has always played a social role, assumed moral status, a status that even physical distance -- almost none of the work in ''Flow'' has been shown in Africa -- can't erase. 
 And so Afropolitanism, young and cool, comes with responsibilities. Maybe it is the awareness of this that gives a light-touch show heft and focus, a sense of thereness, geography-free but concrete, without which flow becomes drift. 
 ''Flow'' continues through June 29 at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street; (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org.

HEADLINE: Wonder Bread and Curry: Mingling Cultures, Conflicted Hearts

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
UNACCUSTOMED EARTH 
 By Jhumpa Lahiri 
 333 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25. 
 Jhumpa Lahiri's characters tend to be immigrants from India and their American-reared children, exiles who straddle two countries, two cultures, and belong to neither: too used to freedom to accept the rituals and conventions of home, and yet too steeped in tradition to embrace American mores fully. These Indian-born parents want the American Dream for their children -- name-brand schools, a prestigious job, a roomy house in the suburbs -- but they are cautious about the pitfalls of life in this alien land, and isolated by their difficulties with language and customs. Their children too are often emotional outsiders: having grown up translating the mysteries of the United States for their relatives, they are fluent navigators of both Bengali and American culture but completely at home in neither; they always experience themselves as standing slightly apart, given more to melancholy observation than wholehearted participation. 
 As she did in her Pulitzer Prize-winning collection of stories ''Interpreter of Maladies'' (1999) and her dazzling 2003 novel ''The Namesake,'' Ms. Lahiri writes about these people in ''Unaccustomed Earth'' with an intimate knowledge of their conflicted hearts, using her lapidary eye for detail to conjure their daily lives with extraordinary precision: the faint taste of coconut in the Nice cookies that a man associates with his dead wife; the Wonder Bread sandwiches, tinted green with curry, that a Bengali mother makes for her embarrassed daughter to take to school. A Chekhovian sense of loss blows through these new stories: a reminder of Ms. Lahiri's appreciation of the wages of time and mortality and her understanding too of the missed connections that plague her husbands and wives, parents and children, lovers and friends.
 Many of the characters in these stories seem to be in relationships that are filled with silences and black holes. In some cases this is the result of an arranged marriage that's never worked out; in others it is simply a case of people failing to communicate or failing to reach out, in time, for what they want.
 In ''Only Goodness'' Sudha, who is working on her second master's degree at the London School of Economics, wonders at the bizarre ''lack of emotion'' in her parents' marriage, which was ''neither happy nor unhappy'' and seemingly devoid of both bitterness and ardor, but she finds her own marriage to an Englishman foundering upon her failure to tell him a family secret. In ''Hell-Heaven'' the narrator recounts the story of her parents' chilly marriage and her mother's passionate, unrequited love for a fellow Bengali and family friend, who gave her mother ''the only pure happiness she ever felt.'' And in ''A Choice of Accommodations'' Amit realizes that the ''most profound thing'' in his life -- the birth of his daughters -- has already happened, that the rest of his life will be only ''a continuation of the things'' he already knows. Increasingly he will come to regard solitude -- a run in the park, a ride by himself on the subway -- as ''what one relished most, the only thing that, even in fleeting, diminished doses, kept one sane.'' 
 As for Ruma, the heroine of the title story, she realizes during a visit from her widowed father that they rarely talk about matters of real importance; they do not speak about her mother or her brother, they do not discuss her pregnancy or her marriage, or her father's new relationship with a woman he met on vacation. This has been their history as long as she can remember: ''Somehow, she feared that any difference of opinion would chip away at the already frail bond that existed between them.'' Her marriage, Ruma realizes, is stilted too: she is increasingly aware that she and her husband, Adam, are ''separate people leading separate lives,'' and that part of her is actually relieved when Adam leaves on one of his many business trips. 
 Like many children of immigrants Ms. Lahiri's characters are acutely aware of their parents' expectations; that they get into an Ivy League school, go to med school or grad school, marry someone from a good Bengali family. Deftly explicating the emotional arithmetic of her characters' families, Ms. Lahiri shows how some of these children learn to sidestep, even defy their parents' wishes. But she also shows how haunted they remain by the burden of their families' dreams and their awareness of their role in the generational process of Americanization. 
 Their parents often seem so exhausted just coping with the difficulties of surviving in a strange new world that talk about self-fulfillment or depression or happiness seems utterly irrelevant to them; they are strangely pragmatic and unsentimental -- about their marriages, their work, the hardships of daily life. These characters' American-born children are, at once, more romantic about the possibilities of finding genuine love and rewarding careers and more cynical too about the trajectories of most people's lives. Often cast in the role of facilitator or fixer, they are accustomed to serving as their parents' go-betweens and to easing their younger siblings' way into full-fledged American lives. 
 Sudha, for instance, scavenged yard sales for the right toys for her little brother -- ''the Fisher Price barn, Tonka trucks, the Speak and Say that made animal sounds''; she read him books like ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' and ''Frog and Toad,'' and ''told her parents to set up sprinklers on the lawn for him to run through in the summer.'' 
 The last three overlapping tales in this volume tell a single story about a Bengali-American girl and a Bengali-American boy, whose crisscrossing lives make up a poignant ballad of love and loss and death. Hema and Kaushik get to know each other as teenagers, when Kaushik's family comes to stay with Hema's parents while they house-hunt in the Boston suburbs. Hema secretly nurses a crush on Kaushik, but he is oblivious to her schoolgirl antics and preoccupied with his mother's deteriorating health. His grief over her death and his rage at his father's hasty remarriage will propel him into a career as a photojournalist, who spends most of his time traveling to war zones in distant parts of the globe. 
 Hema, meanwhile, becomes a professor, a Latin scholar, who after a long, unhappy love affair impulsively decides to opt for a traditional arranged marriage; though she is conscious of the ''deadness'' of this proposed partnership, she tries to convince herself that the relationship will endow her life with a sense of certainty and direction. Then, against all odds, Hema and Kaushik run into each other in Rome -- on the eve of Hema's departure for her wedding -- and embark on an intense, passionate affair. And yet it is an affair that concludes not with a fairy-tale happy ending but with an operatic denouement that speaks of missed opportunities and avoidable grief.
 In the hands of a less talented writer it's an ending that might have seemed melodramatic or contrived, but as rendered by Ms. Lahiri it possesses the elegiac and haunting power of tragedy -- a testament to her emotional wisdom and consummate artistry as a writer.

HEADLINE: 81% IN POLL SAY NATION IS HEADED ON WRONG TRACK

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Dalia Sussman and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Americans are more dissatisfied with the country's direction than at any time since the New York Times/CBS News poll began asking about the subject in the early 1990s, according to the latest poll. 
 In the poll, 81 percent of respondents said they believed ''things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track,'' up from 69 percent a year ago and 35 percent in early 2002. 
 Although the public mood has been darkening since the early days of the war in Iraq, it has taken a new turn for the worse in the last few months, as the economy has seemed to slip into recession. There is now nearly a national consensus that the country faces significant problems. 
 A majority of nearly every demographic and political group -- Democrats and Republicans, men and women, residents of cities and rural areas, college graduates and those who finished only high school -- say the United States is headed in the wrong direction. Seventy-eight percent of respondents said the country was worse off than five years ago; just 4 percent said it was better off. 
 The dissatisfaction is especially striking because public opinion usually hits its low point only in the months and years after an economic downturn, not at the beginning of one. Today, however, Americans report being deeply worried about the country even though many say their own personal finances are still in fairly good shape.
 Only 21 percent of respondents said the overall economy was in good condition, the lowest such number since late 1992, when the recession that began in the summer of 1990 had already been over for more than a year. In the latest poll, two in three people said they believed the economy was in recession today.
 The unhappiness presents clear risks for Republicans in this year's elections, given the continued unpopularity of President Bush. Twenty-eight percent of respondents said they approved of the job he was doing, a number that has barely changed since last summer. But Democrats, who have controlled the House and Senate since last year, also face the risk that unhappy voters will punish Congressional incumbents. 
 Mr. Bush and leaders of both parties on Capitol Hill have moved in recent weeks to react to the economic slowdown, first by passing a stimulus bill that will send checks of up to $1,200 to many couples this spring. They are now negotiating over proposals to overhaul financial regulations, blunt the effects of a likely wave of home foreclosures and otherwise respond to the real estate slump and related crisis on Wall Street.
 The poll found that Americans blame government officials for the crisis more than banks or home buyers and other borrowers. Forty percent of respondents said regulators were mostly to blame, while 28 percent named lenders and 14 percent named borrowers.
 In assessing possible responses to the mortgage crisis, Americans displayed a populist streak, favoring help for individuals but not for financial institutions. A clear majority said they did not want the government to lend a hand to banks, even if the measures would help limit the depth of a recession.
 ''What I learned from economics is that the market is not always going to be a happy place,'' Sandi Heller, who works at the University of Colorado and is also studying for a master's degree in business there, said in a follow-up interview. If the government steps in to help out, said Ms. Heller, 43, it could encourage banks to take more foolish risks.
 ''There are a million and one better ways for the government to spend that money,'' she said.
 Respondents were considerably more open to government help for home owners at risk of foreclosure. Fifty-three percent said they believed the government should help those whose interest rates were rising, while 41 percent said they opposed such a move.
 The nationwide telephone survey of 1,368 adults was conducted from March 28 to April 2. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
 When the presidential campaign began last year, the war in Iraq and terrorism easily topped Americans' list of concerns. Almost 30 percent of people in a December poll said that one of those issues was the country's most pressing problem. About half as many named the economy or jobs.
 But the issues have switched places in just a few months' time. In the latest poll, 17 percent named terrorism or the war, while 37 percent named the economy or the job market. When looking at the current state of their own finances, Americans remain relatively sanguine. More than 70 percent said their financial situation was fairly good or very good, a number that has dropped only modestly since 2006. 
 Yet many say they are merely managing to stay in place, rather than get ahead. This view is consistent with the income statistics of the past five years, which suggest that median household income has still not returned to the inflation-adjusted peak it hit in 1999. Since the Census Bureau began keeping records in the 1960s, there has never been an extended economic expansion that ended without setting a new record for household income.
 Economists cite a variety of factors for the sluggish income growth, including technology and globalization, and it clearly seems to have made Americans anxious about the future. Fewer than half of parents -- 46 percent -- said they expected their children to enjoy a better standard of living than they themselves do, down from 56 percent in 2005. 
 Respondents were more pessimistic when asked in general terms about the next generation, with only a third saying it would live better than people do today. (Polls usually find people more upbeat about their personal situation than about the state of society, but the gap is now larger than usual.) 
 Charles Parrish, a 56-year-old retired fireman in Evans, Ga., who now works a maintenance job for the local school system, said he was worried the country was not preparing children for the high-technology economy of the future. Instead, the government passed a stimulus package that simply sends checks to taxpayers and worsens the deficit in the process.
 ''Who's going to pay back the money?'' Mr. Parrish, an independent, said. ''We are. They are giving me money, except I'm going to have to pay interest on it.''
 Democrats have asserted recently that the lack of wage growth has made people more open to government intervention in the economy than in the past, and the poll found mixed results on this score. 
 Fifty-eight percent of respondents said they would support raising taxes on households making more than $250,000 to pay for tax cuts or government programs for people making less than that amount. Only 38 percent called it a bad idea. Both Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic presidential candidates, have made proposals along these lines.
 More broadly, 43 percent of those surveyed said they would prefer a larger government that provided more services, which is tied for the highest such number since The Times and CBS News began asking the question in 1991. But an identical 43 percent said they wanted a smaller government that provided fewer services.
 And although both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama haveblamed trade with other countries for some of the economy's problems, Americans say they continue to favor trade -- if not quite as strongly as in the past. Fifty-eight percent called it good for the economy; 32 percent called it bad, up from 17 percent in 1996.
 At the same time, 68 percent said they favored trade restrictions to protect domestic industries, instead of allowing unrestrained trade. In early 1996, 55 percent favored such restrictions.

HEADLINE: Appeals Court Panel Throws Out Class Action Over Light Cigarettes

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
In a victory for the tobacco industry, a federal appeals court threw out on Thursday an $800 billion class-action lawsuit on behalf of smokers who said they had been misled that light cigarettes were safer than regular ones. 
 Plaintiffs' lawyers wanted to represent millions of people across the country who had smoked light cigarettes. But the court, saying it was impossible to generalize about why smokers chose light cigarettes, ruled that the group could not be treated as a class. Instead, smokers wanting to sue over the issue would have to do so individually. 
 There might be various reasons for a smoker to choose a light brand other than ''the belief that lights were a healthier alternative,'' the ruling said. Other possibilities are that a lights smoker ''was unaware of that representation, preferred the taste of lights, or chose lights as an expression of personal style.'' 
 Even though the ruling had been generally expected, and tobacco company stocks were little affected by the decision, analysts still viewed it as positive for the industry. 
 Several experts said the ruling, the latest in a string of industry victories in cases involving light cigarettes, relieved the tobacco industry of potentially billions in damages and could also deter other similar class-action lawsuits around the country. ''It may be persuasive to judges around the country who might well be watching it,'' said Carl W. Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.
 The decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned a ruling in September 2006 by a federal district judge, Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn, that certified the suit as a class action.
 Judge Weinstein's ruling represented the first time that a so-called lights case received class-action certification in federal court. At the time, the ruling was viewed as potentially opening the door to a major legal threat against the industry, exposing cigarette companies to large damages for their marketing of light cigarettes. 
 Yet, as a number of such lawsuits have been filed in state courts around the country, plaintiffs so far have had little success. One Illinois case, in which plaintiffs initially won a $10 billion judgment, was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court.
 More than a half-dozen such state cases are currently in legal limbo, awaiting a United States Supreme Court decision in a Maine case involving light cigarettes. The issue in those cases involves federal pre-emption, whether the fact that the Federal Trade Commission allowed marketing of cigarettes as light would bar legal action against tobacco companies on that count. 
 Clifford E. Douglas, the executive director of the University of Michigan Tobacco Research Network, said there was generally a high ''win rate'' in cases against the tobacco industry, but not when it came to class actions. 
 ''Some courts have been very sympathetic, but many have had problems with the individualized nature of smoking and smoking-related injuries,'' Mr. Douglas said.
 Mr. Douglas, a lawyer who has been involved in litigation against the tobacco industry, said the ruling illustrates that the courts are a poor surrogate for government regulation when it comes to holding the industry accountable. 
 ''I think this underscores the need to combat the light cigarette scam in the public policy arena,'' Mr. Douglas said, citing a bill in Congress that would give the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco. The bill would ban the use of terms like light and low-tar in marketing such cigarettes, which contain the same tobacco as other cigarettes but have filters that allow more air to mix with the smoke, diluting it. 
 Unlike most tobacco lawsuits, the Brooklyn federal case did not contend that smokers' health was injured by the cigarettes. Instead it claimed that consumers had been subjected to an economic fraud since 1971, when Philip Morris began selling Marlboro Lights, the first light cigarette. The lawsuit claimed that if smokers had known that light cigarettes were no healthier than other cigarettes, the cigarettes would have been cheaper. 
 But the appeals court ruled that even after disclosures by the National Cancer Institute in 2001 that light cigarettes were no healthier than others, smokers continued to smoke them. That included three of the six named plaintiffs in the case, the court said. 
 ''Given the lack of an appreciable drop in the demand or price of light cigarettes after the truth about lights was revealed,'' the ruling said, ''plaintiffs' argument that defendants' misrepresentation caused the market to shift and the price of lights to be inflated fails as a matter of law.'' 
 Theodore M. Grossman, the lawyer who argued the case in July on behalf of tobacco companies, said the ruling could have implications in other class-action cases across the country involving light cigarettes.
 ''One of the central points of the opinion was that the reasons that people bought light cigarettes were highly individual and that this kind of case can't be resolved in a class context,'' said Mr. Grossman, a partner at Jones Day who represented the R. J. Reynolds unit of Reynolds American. 
 The lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, Michael D. Hausfeld, said he was saddened by the ruling. ''We have options and we have to evaluate them,'' Mr. Hausfeld said. Among them are asking for a rehearing by the entire appeals court, appealing to the United States Supreme Court or pursuing the cases individually. 
 The Supreme Court infrequently reviews cases involving questions of whether class actions should be allowed, however. 
 While the ruling does not preclude individual lawsuits, the small compensation each person could collect under the theory of the case -- which would be calculated based on economic losses from smoking light cigarettes, and damages -- could make such lawsuits financially untenable for plaintiffs' lawyers. ''I can't imagine that individual cases will go forward; they're just too expensive,'' said Mr. Tobias, who teaches product liability law. 
 In a note to investors, a tobacco industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, Judy E. Hong, said that the ruling ''should continue to increase investors' confidence about the legal environment and allow the cigarette companies to have more balance-sheet flexibility.'' 
 Besides Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds, tobacco companies that market light cigarettes include the Lorillard Tobacco unit of the Loews Corporation, whose brands include Newport. 
 Shares of the Altria Group, which owns Philip Morris USA, the marketer of Marlboro cigarettes in this country, closed down 7 cents, at $22.01, Thursday. Stock in Reynolds American, whose R. J. Reynolds Tobacco unit markets the Camel brand, was up 29 cents, closing at $60.

HEADLINE: A Giant Bookstore Goes Dark in Chelsea

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Wei Wei, visiting New York from the Michael Schultz Gallery in Beijing, showed up on Tuesday morning at the blocklong Barnes & Noble on the Avenue of the Americas, between 21st and 22nd Streets, in the old Ladies' Mile shopping district. 
 He was looking for monographs of Sam Francis, Keith Haring, James Rosenquist and Frank Stella, whose work the gallery plans to exhibit. His hotel had recommended this particular Barnes & Noble for the strength of its art section.
 But Mr. Wei was late. About 18 hours late. The 35,000-square-foot store, among the larger units in the chain, closed on Monday evening after 14 years in business.
 ''I had heard some bad things about the U.S. economy,'' Mr. Wei said, wondering whether this was somehow connected to the subprime mortgage crisis.
 No, it had to do with -- well, you can imagine what it had to do with.
 ''In anticipation of the lease coming up, we tried negotiating with the landlord,'' said Mitchell S. Klipper, chief operating officer of Barnes & Noble. ''The brokers came in and put crazy numbers in their minds. We can't pay those kinds of rents. We've been looking two, three years for a replacement. We have not been able to find a suitable location at rents that are affordable.''
 Mr. Klipper said that ''nobody likes closing stores -- trust me,'' and added that most of the employees in Chelsea had been transferred to the Union Square or TriBeCa branches. (The Astor Place store also recently closed.)
 Mr. Klipper recalled signing the lease 15 years ago when that stretch of the avenue was just beginning to wake up from a long slumber. 
 ''We were very concerned whether anybody would shop there,'' he said. ''When we came, it put a foothold in the area. The next big box came and the next big box came.''
 And that's what the landlord is looking for, according to the sign in the window: ''Big Box Retail.'' Ideas have already surfaced on other blogs.
 Where plate glass windows beckoned browsers as recently as last weekend, there now hang rolls of kraft paper, intended to block the view of passers-by. But this shield is not seamless, and one can glimpse slices of the interior. The decor is standard B & N issue, though it is ennobled here by colossal columns from the days in the early 20th century when this was the Adams Dry Goods emporium.
 Familiar as the store looks, it now seems poignantly remote, a relic from another age.
 Is it possible? Have things taken such a turn in Manhattan that we are growing nostalgic for Barnes & Noble; the big bully that was once so easy to blame for the demise of the neighborhood bookshop?
 A middle-aged woman who passed by the locked doors on Tuesday after Mr. Wei departed -- a neighbor, to judge from the blue laundry cart she had in tow -- delivered her own brief eulogy. ''It's the saddest thing, isn't it?'' she asked.

HEADLINE: More Consumers Are Behind on Their Loans

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
More Americans have fallen behind on consumer loans than at any time in nearly 16 years, as credit problems once concentrated in mortgages have spread into other forms of debt, according to the American Bankers Association. 
 In a quarterly study, the association said the percentage of loans at least 30 days past due rose to 2.65 percent in the fourth quarter, from 2.44 percent in the third quarter and 2.23 percent a year earlier.
 The rate of delinquencies was the highest since a 2.75 percent rate in the first quarter of 1992. 
 ''There's no question that the economy is weakening beyond housing, resulting in the loss of household purchasing power,'' said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service.
 ''Deterioration of household credit should continue through 2008, though the rate may moderate,'' he said. ''If it intensifies, then the current recession may prove more severe than anticipated.''
 The association's chief economist, James Chessen, attributed the jump in the delinquency rate largely to auto loans.
 Late payments on ''indirect'' auto loans, which are made through dealerships, totaled 3.13 percent, the highest on record. Delinquencies on direct auto loans rose to 1.90 percent, a 2 1/2-year high.
 Credit and debit card delinquencies rose to 4.38 percent, from 4.18 percent in the third quarter, after four consecutive quarterly declines.
 Delinquencies on home equity loans rose to a 2 1/2-year high of 2.39 percent, and on home equity lines of credit delinquencies rose to 0.96 percent, matching a level last seen in the fourth quarter of 1997.
 The association's study covers more than 300 banks that extend a majority of outstanding consumer loans. It covers direct auto, indirect auto, home equity, home improvement, marine, mobile home, personal and recreational vehicle loans.

HEADLINE: An Auction That Google Was Content to Lose

BYLINE: By MIGUEL HELFT

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Google had little desire to own a premium slice of the nation's airwaves, but a week into a federal auction for wireless licenses, it found itself at risk of being the winning bidder for the coveted spectrum. 
 The spectrum would have cost $4.7 billion, Google's biggest single investment. Winning would have thrust the company into the wireless business and could have sent Google's battered shares even lower.
 Google and other companies began publicly discussing some of the auction's behind-the-scenes action after an anti-collusion rule prohibiting participants from commenting was lifted Thursday. Google bid in the auction to honor a promise made to the Federal Communications Commission. 
 Last summer, the company vowed to bid a minimum of $4.6 billion, the reserve price, for a set of frequencies known as the C block as long as the F.C.C. imposed some ''openness'' conditions on it. The F.C.C. imposed two conditions, requiring the owner of the spectrum to open its network to devices and services from third parties.
 Google's main goal, however, was not to win, but to make sure the reserve price was met so that the openness conditions would become effective, ensuring that its search, e-mail, maps and other services would be easily available on phones operating on those frequencies. And while the company had willingly taken the risk that it could end up winning, it was not without trepidation.
 ''Our primary goal was to trigger the openness conditions,'' said Richard Whitt, Google's Washington telecommunications and media counsel. 
 The auction raised more than $19 billion, far more than expected. Still, some critics said the auction failed to promote competition, as it solidified the positions of AT&T and Verizon Wireless, the two biggest carriers, who won a majority of the licenses. Some economists and others remain critical of the way the auction was set up, pointing out that among other things, two groups of frequencies, known as the A and B blocks, sold at much higher prices than the C block. 
 Ralph de la Vega, president and chief executive of AT&T's wireless unit, said in a news conference Thursday that his company was pleased with the auction's outcome. But he noted that the Google-backed conditions on the C block had an effect on pricing.
 ''People put a premium on spectrum that is not encumbered by excessive regulations,'' Mr. de la Vega said. 
 Verizon Wireless has scheduled a news conference for Friday morning to discuss its plans. 
 In an interview late Thursday, the F.C.C. chairman, Kevin J. Martin, once again called the auction a success. ''What was important was not only the success of the auction from a money standpoint but also the ability to have an open-access platform that I think is going to transform the whole wireless industry,'' Mr. Martin said. 
 From a windowless ''war room'' at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., the small auction team placed bids electronically. Eric E. Schmidt, the chief executive, and the founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, visited frequently.
 For much of the first week, Google gradually topped its own bids. With no competitors emerging, anxiety grew. 
 ''There were definitely some people at the company that had cold feet,'' said Larry Alder, a product manager in Google's auction team. 
 The team, which had persuaded Google's board last summer to back the company's bid, was asked again to make its case to top executives and the board.
 ''People had to be convinced that it was the right business decision,'' Mr. Alder said.
 Google declined to discuss what it would have done had it won the licenses. But it strongly suggested that it would not have become a wireless operator. Instead it would have formed partnerships with other companies. Still, after placing a $4.71 billion bid early on Jan. 24, meeting the reserve price, members of the team remained in a state of high alert and anxiety. 
 ''We kept hitting the 'refresh' button on the browser'' to see if others would bid higher, said Minnie Ingersoll, another product manager on the auction team. No one topped Google's bid that day or the following day, a Friday, and Google executives went into the Super Bowl weekend thinking they might end up owning the C block licenses after all. 
 ''There was a feeling that we were picking up something at a great price,'' Mr. Alder said.
 If Google felt it had a bargain, it wasn't by much. The company declined to top the $4.74 billion bid that Verizon finally placed the following Tuesday. 
 ''If Google had won a license, there was only downside risk for them,'' said Gregory L. Rosston, a former F.C.C. official and senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. ''Now they can just spend $1 million a year on a law firm to ensure Verizon lives up to the openness requirements.''

HEADLINE: Through Trying Times for Blacks, a Place of Peace and Quiet

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: ST. HELENA ISLAND, S.C. 

 BODY:
In the hour between sunset and nightfall, the view from this slate-blue cabin consists of a steadily darkening palette. The salt marsh silvers into stone gray, the grassy hummocks ash away into soft black. A blue heron, perhaps feeling conspicuously colorful, flies away.
 The scene was intended to soothe the sore eyes of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But as evidence of just how much he needed the kind of solace it offered, Dr. King died before the cabin was finished. He was assassinated 40 years ago on Friday. 
 The cabin is part of the Penn Center, founded in 1862 as one of the country's first schools for freed slaves and used more than 100 years later by Dr. King as a retreat center for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. 
 At the time, willing hosts were hard to find for interracial gatherings in the South. The Penn Center, known for vocal advocacy on behalf of the black residents of Beaufort County and the region, provided an environment where Dr. King could speak and act more freely than when he was on the national stage -- where he could give voice to doubts and disappointments.
 ''I am still searching myself, I don't have all the answers,'' Dr. King told his staff at Penn in 1966, when they were discussing the next step for the organization, according to transcripts of tapes. The group's many legal and judicial victories, he reflected, ''were at best surface changes; they were not substantive changes.'' 
 It was a trying time. Blacks were rioting, Dr. King was under fire for speaking out against the Vietnam War, and the strident rhetoric of the Black Power movement was causing a backlash among whites. At Penn, Dr. King's lieutenants had heated arguments over such topics as whether to move their efforts north, to Chicago, as Dr. King wanted. He shared controversial views, like his thoughts on economic equality: ''Something is wrong with capitalism,'' he told them, according to notes collected by the S.C.L.C.
 But Penn also offered a chance to unwind. Dr. King relaxed under the oak trees and played baseball. Joan Baez played the guitar for a group singalong. 
 ''The photos you see of Dr. King at Penn Center, he's not wearing a suit and tie,'' said David J. Garrow, a biographer of Dr. King and a senior research fellow at Cambridge University, in a telephone interview. ''Ninety-eight percent of the other photos you see of Doc, he has his tie done up.''
 The staff at Penn treated Dr. King with reverence, but not too much. Thomas C. Barnwell Jr., 72, remembered picking him up from the Savannah airport, about an hour's drive from St. Helena. 
 ''We had a private disagreement that when changes did come, there would be a disproportionate number of blacks that would be displaced from their businesses such as service stations, hotels, restaurants and things of that type,'' Mr. Barnwell said. ''He said, 'No, Brother Barnwell, the Lord will provide.' I said, 'O.K., we'll see.' ''
 On Wednesday, Mr. Barnwell, who was in charge of community development at Penn, gathered behind the campus museum with two other former staff members, Frieda R. Mitchell, 82, and Joseph McDomick, 72, to reminisce. 
 Ms. Mitchell, a pioneer in early childhood education and one of the first black school board members in Beaufort County (the other was also a Penn staff member), said she was determined to ask Dr. King one question: ''How can you tell me to love people who treat me as if I were not human?''
 ''I will never forget'' his response, she said. ''He said we are created in God's image. So you love the image of God in that person.'' She added: ''I don't know if I was able to use that, to apply that, in all different situations. But I always remembered it.''
 The Penn Center is a secluded place, a 50-acre campus of white clapboard dorms and cottages built by high school students who paid modest fees for room, board and tuition. Photographs show the Penn basketball team posing on the porch steps. 
 The school was founded even before Emancipation. The Union Army occupied the area, causing plantation owners to flee and abandon their slaves.
 By the early 1950s, the state had begun providing a high school education to black children, and Penn morphed into a community center run by a white Quaker couple. It opened the state's first day care center for black children, persuaded government agencies to hire blacks, trained midwives and set up a farmer's cooperative. It picketed, boycotted and staged attempts to integrate whites-only restaurants.
 So Penn was a natural fit for the S.C.L.C. Dr. King stayed here for the last time in 1967, just a few months before his death. He slept in a tiny, almost rudimentary cottage on the edge of the campus. 
 But the staff wanted to give him even more solitude -- a retreat within the retreat. ''They wanted to have a place a little bit more private and a little bit more modern for him,'' said Rosalyn Browne, the director of history and culture at Penn. Her father, Leroy Browne, went to school at Penn and helped build the cottage on the marsh, reached by a dirt road off the main grounds and now available to paying guests. Above the door hangs a sign that reads: ''Retreat House. Est'd 1968.''
 Penn may have been remote, but it faced opposition from some local whites over Dr. King's visits. ''Even when he came here, it had to be kept secret,'' Mr. McDomick said. ''We couldn't notify any law enforcement people because we didn't know who would be in that little group that would be after doing him in, see what I mean?'' Threats of violence did not materialize. 
 ''When the word got out, they did burn one cross,'' Ms. Mitchell said. ''But it wasn't an upright cross. They poured the gasoline down in the form of a cross, so we knew it, but nobody could see it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 9, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the Penn Center, a school for freed slaves on St. Helena Island, S.C., that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King used as a retreat center misstated the age of Joseph McDomick, a former staff member. He is 69, not 72.

HEADLINE: The View From Room 306

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
On Wednesday morning I was in Memphis, and I walked over to the Lorraine Motel, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated 40 years ago today. I toured the National Civil Rights Museum and then went up to the room by the balcony where King was shot.
 The Rev. Billy Kyles happened to be filming a documentary with his daughter Dwania as I arrived, going through a second-by-second account of the last moments of King's life. The Rev. Kyles was with King when he was shot and was due to host him for dinner that evening. 
 You can watch Dwania's documentary someday to hear his description of that afternoon, but I was curious for him to describe King's mood during the final hour of his life. When you read the accounts of his final months, you get a sense of building pressure, of a rising atmosphere of menace and doom.
 By 1968, King was under harsh assault not only from white racists but from the black power movement, which regarded his tactics as outdated and anodyne. His effort to stage a Poor People's Campaign in Washington was in disarray. He was often sleepless and depressed.
 He came to Memphis because of a sanitation workers' strike. The garbage men were paid so little that they could work full time and still qualify for welfare. When two workers were killed because of unsafe trucks, the rest struck. 
 As Michael Honey notes in his compelling though crusading history, ''Going Down Jericho Road,'' the mayor of Memphis was unbending. The strike dragged on and tensions rose. The workers staged a march on Feb. 23, 1968, and the police responded with mace and clubs. The second rally, on March 28, was a microcosm of America at that moment. King stood at the head of the march, looking dazed. Around him in the front were the sanitation workers, with their concrete demands. But in the back of the crowd there were more radical and anarchic elements. 
 The looting and the rioting began almost immediately. King was whisked away. Hundreds were bloodied. One was killed. The authorities were driven both by the desire to restore order and by their own racist demons. 
 That march was a pivot. In both the white and black communities, the forces of order and reform vied with the forces of hatred and anarchy. The latter grabbed the upper hand.
 The atmosphere deteriorated. The National Guard was sent in. There were weapons everywhere. This week I ran into Bobby Martin, whose father was a sanitation worker during the period. ''I saw fear on my hero's face,'' Martin recalled.
 Everybody sensed that this was heading toward disaster. King expressed premonitions of his murder in the ''Mountaintop'' speech. City officials worried about his assassination to reporters. The K.K.K. stayed out of Memphis so it wouldn't get blamed if he was killed. 
 And yet, the Rev. Kyles noted, ''he preached himself through the fear of death.'' The next day, in the privacy of the hotel room, he was happy and domestic. He had a brief pillow fight. He talked about soul food and what tie to wear. It was just three reverends sitting around, Kyles remembered, talking ''preacher talk.''
 Then King walked out onto the balcony and the forces that were swirling outside intervened. James Earl Ray's bullet sliced the knot of his tie. Riots commenced, and in the ensuing years, crime rates skyrocketed, cities decayed and the social fabric was torn. Dreams of economic opportunity and racial integration were swallowed up by the antinomian passions and social disorder.
 The key tension in King's life was over how to push relentlessly for change but within an existing moral structure. But by the late-60s many felt the social structure needed to be torn down. The assassin's bullet set off a conflagration.
 At King's funeral, the marshals told the throngs that nobody should chew gum because it would look undignified. But niceties like that were obsolete.
 Building the social fabric after the disruption of that period has been the work of the subsequent generations -- weaving the invisible web of family, neighborhood and national obligations so that people stay in school, attend to their kids and have an opportunity to rise if they play by the rules.
 Progress has been slow. Nearly a third of American high school students don't graduate (half in the cities). Seventy percent of African-American kids are born out of wedlock. Poverty rates in Memphis have scarcely dropped. 
 Martin Luther King Jr. at least left behind a model of how to repair the social fabric. He was scholarly, formal, assertive and meticulously self-controlled in public. If Barack Obama's presidential campaign represents anything, it is the triumph of King's early-60s style of activism over the angry and reckless late-60s style. King was in crisis when he was gunned down. But his inspiration is outlasting his critics.

HEADLINE: In Ex-Steel City, Voters Deny Race Plays a Role

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

DATELINE: LATROBE, Pa. 

 BODY:
Ask whom she might vote for in the coming presidential primary election and Nash McCabe, 52, seems almost relieved to be able to unpack the dossier she has been collecting in her head.
 It is not about whom she likes, but more a bill of particulars about why she cannot vote for Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.
 ''How can I vote for a president who won't wear a flag pin?'' Mrs. McCabe, a recently unemployed clerk typist, said in a booth at the Valley Dairy luncheonette in this quiet, small city in western Pennsylvania. 
 Mr. Obama has said patriotism is about ideas, not flag pins.
 ''I watch him on TV,'' Mrs. McCabe said. ''I keep looking for that lapel pin.'' 
 Asked the same question this week at a sports bar, Bob Stano, an engineer and a hunter, cradled his chin for a long minute.
 ''I really do like Barack Obama,'' Mr. Stano said, mentioning Mr. Obama before anyone else. ''Except for his politics, he seems like a good thing for the country.'' 
 ''But the Second Amendment is too important to me,'' Mr. Stano said. ''I just won't vote for him.''
 Americans have a long tradition of voting against candidates rather than for them. But in the first presidential campaign with an African-American as a serious contender, there may be a new gyration in the way voters think, the need to explain the vote against the candidate who is black.
 ''I don't say this because he's black, but the guy just seems arrogant to me, the way he expects things to go his way,'' said Harry Brobst, a truck driver who had never registered to vote until this year.
 Mr. Brobst said he would vote in the primary ''not so much for,'' but against.
 People are not shy about dismissing out of hand Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York for her supposed untrustworthiness or Senator John McCain of Arizona for what is described as his ''100 years'' approach to the Iraq war. 
 But when dismissing Mr. Obama, voters in this former steel center, whatever their racial feelings, seem almost compelled to list their reasons, if only to pre-empt the unspoken race question. 
 Because he voted ''present'' too often as an Illinois state senator. Because he speaks very well, but has not talked about reviving the coal industry. Because he would not command the respect of the military. Because there is something unsettling about his perfect calm, they say. 
 ''Everyone seems to think of him as the answer to all the problems facing the country, but I just don't think Obama is the answer,'' Janine Koutsky said when asked for her reading of the contenders in the grandstand at Legion Keener Park, watching her son play on the high school baseball team. 
 Latrobe was selected last week for its blue-collar ''cred'' as the backdrop for the announcement by Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania of his endorsement of Mr. Obama. But it is hard to tell what any group of voters here truly thinks. 
 Polls show Mr. Obama gaining on Mrs. Clinton among likely Democratic voters in the state, including whites. 
 At a public forum on March 28 in neighboring Greensburg, where he began a weeklong bus tour, Mr. Obama packed the Hempfield Area High School gym. 
 As everywhere, including on a radio dial that is wall to wall throughout the Pennsylvania interior with conservative talk show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, race and gender questions are almost never directly addressed when voters are asked about their preferences.
 Deb Friedline, an insurance agent here, said Mrs. Clinton was too likely to make decisions based on emotion, but when asked if that was because the senator is a woman, Ms. Friedline said, ''No, I honestly don't think of her as a woman.''
 Gail Delsordo, who said she would vote for Mr. McCain, added: ''I don't see Obama as a 'color,' but I do think he needs to get away from mimicking Dr. Martin Luther King. I'm not degrading Dr. King. I liked what he stood for, and it's a shame what happened to him. But Obama needs to be his own person.''
 In a place like Latrobe, which the census says is 99 percent white, the race issue is almost an unexplored country that people visit like tourists with a phrase book. Driving past abandoned steel mills and a brewery and through a neatly swept downtown where tulips have sprouted along the 19th-century railroad line that spawned the city, diversity is mainly in the exterior paint of the residential bungalows. 
 ''When I worked in the steel mill, there were always a few guys who were black,'' Robert Bradish said. ''But you wouldn't even know they were black, we got along so well.'' 
 Mr. Bradish said he would vote for Mr. Obama.
 Latrobe is probably best known as the birthplace of Rolling Rock beer. The label was sold to Anheuser-Busch, and brewing was moved in 2006 to Newark. 
 A new company came in that employs fewer people, mostly at lower wages.
 ''I'm making $5 an hour less than I did before,'' said Rick Musick, who parked his truck outside the brewery just before the 5 p.m. shift.
 Like almost everyone interviewed in Latrobe, Mr. Musick said he was worried about the economy, health care and the price of gasoline. 
 He said he did not ''know what to make of Obama.'' Mr. Musick said he had liked the senator but then decided that he did not ''for a bunch of reasons.''
 ''It's not about race,'' he added. ''It's about a feeling I have.'' 
 Mr. Musick checked his watch, beep-locked his truck and walked across a mostly empty employee parking lot.

HEADLINE: India Tiptoes in China's Footsteps to Compete but Not Offend

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA; Hari Kumar contributed reporting.

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
Since protests against China broke out among the Tibetans who make their home in exile here, India has urged the Dalai Lama to refrain from talking politics and assured Beijing that the Olympic torch will pass unmolested when it arrives here this month. 
 That delicate stance has disappointed some. But it is just one leg of an emerging Indian approach to the world -- one part caution, one part competition, with a dash of mimicry sprinkled in -- that is ever mindful of the more powerful giant that has risen on its eastern flank. The Dalai Lama has gently chided India as ''overcautious.''
 The Tibetan issue is one thing. Perhaps more to the point was another, less noticed development this week, as the Indian prime minister warmly welcomed the second in command in Myanmar's junta, a general named Maung Aye, barely six months after a crackdown there on Buddhist monks. 
 Together they announced an Indian-financed project to refurbish a port, river and roads in Myanmar, a deal that may allow India to elbow its way into the plentiful energy reserves of a country that has become a virtual well of resources for Beijing. 
 Next week, lifting a page from the Chinese, India is scheduled to play host to an India-Africa summit meeting intended to bolster trade with mineral-rich Africa. It is all part of a push by India, like China, to scour the planet for natural resources to aid its growth.
 But as the two emerging Asian giants engage in their own version of the Great Game, it is impossible for New Delhi to escape the reality that the playing field is badly skewed in China's favor, and hence the need for caution. 
 The planned Africa summit meeting, for instance, only highlights the vast gap between Indian and Chinese ambitions on the continent. Jairam Ramesh, the Indian minister of state for commerce, pointed out that a $640 million line of credit to Ethiopia was India's largest single loan to an African country; by comparison, he noted that China had extended a $13 billion line of credit to oil-rich Angola. 
 ''We can't race with them at all,'' he said. ''There's no point. They have left us behind.''
 That imbalance has forced New Delhi to walk a fine line between competing with China and challenging it. 
 ''It is a new, evolving relationship. It's a fragile relationship,'' said Tarun Das, chief mentor of the Confederation of Indian Industry, one of the country's largest trade groups, and often the face of Indian business in the world. ''We are going to be careful.''
 Indeed, these days Chinese and Indian interests coincide nearly as much as they divide. For one thing, China is on its way to surpassing the United States as India's largest trade partner. Although Indians worry about the trade imbalance -- China mostly buys iron ore from India and sells a variety of consumer goods and auto parts -- there are clearly now significant commercial stakes in the bilateral relationship.
 At the same time, India's efforts to modernize its military are clearly done with an eye on China. In 1998, when India tested a hydrogen bomb, it said it needed a nuclear deterrent because of China. Today, New Delhi has fighter jets, air-to-air refueling capacity and transport ships that can help expand its reach across the Indian Ocean. 
 While Indian officials bristle at any suggestion that their country is being courted by Washington as a bulwark against the Chinese, the United States has aided that military buildup. India agreed this year to buy a half-dozen American-made cargo planes, worth about $1 billion. Last year the Indian Navy bought an American-made warship able to carry 450 soldiers across the seas. American companies are bidding to sell fighter jets to India worth $10 billion.
 ''The demands are really based on Chinese capability rather than anybody else's,'' said Dipankar Banerjee, a retired Indian Army major general who is director of the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies in New Delhi. ''We are keeping the China factor very much in mind.''
 As India and China try to find new footing with each other, they are mindful of the past. Relations between them remained suspended for 26 years, after a border war in 1962 in which India was quickly routed. The border dispute remains unresolved and is an occasional irritant. 
 Today, China is not only militarily and economically more powerful, but also holds important diplomatic cards. It can undermine India's efforts to garner nuclear technology through the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group, derail its ultimate ambition for a seat on the United Nations Security Council and strengthen rival Pakistan, which has long enjoyed Chinese support. 
 The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party has stepped up its criticism of the government in recent weeks, accusing it of appeasing China. While the government says India's China policy is the same as ever, there is no doubt that the ''China factor'' modulates India's position on the latest crisis over Tibet. 
 The Dalai Lama has lived in India since 1959, and he has been allowed to run a government in exile and minister to the needs of more than 100,000 Tibetan refugees in the country. On Thursday, India's government announced that the foreign minister, Pranab Mukherjee, had spoken to his Chinese counterpart the day before and reiterated New Delhi's position: It considers Tibet to be a part of China, treats the Dalai Lama as a spiritual leader and prohibits Tibetans to carry out anti-Chinese agitation on Indian soil. 
 As for the Olympic Games, Mr. Mukherjee, according to the External Affairs Ministry Web site, ''conveyed that government of India will take the necessary measures to ensure that the passage of the Olympic torch is a success.'' 
 An Indian soccer player, Bhaichung Bhutia, has already refused to carry the torch when it comes to the capital in two weeks. 
 The actor Aamir Khan has posted a note on his blog saying he will carry it with a prayer for Tibet. The Indian Olympic Association said the Olympic torch relay would be shortened out of concern for security, according to The Press Trust of India. The details of the route have not been announced.
 At Beijing's request, the authorities have fortified security around the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi, though it was not enough to stop Tibetan protesters from scaling a wall last week and unfurling banners inside the compound.
 With the Olympic Games in August still months away, the events of recent weeks may only presage an even trickier passage for India in the days ahead. On Thursday, in the heart of the capital, Tibetans and Burmese crisscrossed each other, echoing each other's protests.
 ''We want democracy,'' the Burmese shouted. 
 And then: ''Long Live Dalai Lama.''

HEADLINE: MORE THAN 1,000 IN IRAQ'S FORCES QUIT BASRA FIGHT

BYLINE: By STEPHEN FARRELL and JAMES GLANZ; Reporting was contributed by Michael Gordon, Qais Mizher, Ahmad Fadam and Karim al-Hilmi from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Basra.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
More than 1,000 Iraqi soldiers and policemen either refused to fight or simply abandoned their posts during the inconclusive assault against Shiite militias in Basra last week, a senior Iraqi government official said Thursday. Iraqi military officials said the group included dozens of officers, including at least two senior field commanders in the battle.
 The desertions in the heat of a major battle cast fresh doubt on the effectiveness of the American-trained Iraqi security forces. The White House has conditioned further withdrawals of American troops on the readiness of the Iraqi military and police.
 The crisis created by the desertions and other problems with the Basra operation was serious enough that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki hastily began funneling some 10,000 recruits from local Shiite tribes into his armed forces. That move has already generated anger among Sunni tribesmen whom Mr. Maliki has been much less eager to recruit despite their cooperation with the government in its fight against Sunni insurgents and criminal gangs. 
 A British military official said that Mr. Maliki had brought 6,600 reinforcements to Basra to join the 30,000 security personnel already stationed there, and a senior American military official said that he understood that 1,000 to 1,500 Iraqi forces had deserted or underperformed. That would represent a little over 4 percent of the total. 
 A new National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq cites significant security improvements but concludes that security remains fragile, several American government officials said. 
 Even as officials described problems with the planning and performance of the Iraqi forces during the Basra operation, signs emerged Wednesday that tensions with Moktada al-Sadr, the radical cleric who leads the Mahdi Army militia, could flare up again. Mr. Sadr, who asked his followers to stop fighting on Sunday, called Thursday for a million Iraqis to march to the Shiite holy city of Najaf next week to protest what he called the American occupation. He also issued a veiled threat against Mr. Maliki's forces, whom he accused of violating the terms of an agreement with the Iraqi government to stand down. 
 Estimates by Iraqi military officials of the number of officers who refused to fight during the Basra operation varied from several dozen to more than 100. But three officials said that among those who had been relieved of duty for refusing to fight were Col. Rahim Jabbar and Lt. Col. Shakir Khalaf, the commander and deputy commander of an entire brigade affiliated with the Interior Ministry.
 A senior military official in Basra asserted that some members of Colonel Khalaf's unit fought even though he did not. Asked why he believed Colonel Khalaf did not fight, the official said that the colonel did not believe the Iraqi security forces would be able to protect him against threats to his life that he had received for his involvement in the assault.
 ''If he fights today, he might be killed later,'' the official said.
 The senior American military official said the number of officers was ''less than a couple dozen at most,'' but conceded that the figure could rise as the performance of senior officers was assessed.
 But most of the deserters were not officers. The American military official said, ''From what we understand, the bulk of these were from fairly fresh troops who had only just gotten out of basic training and were probably pushed into the fight too soon.''
 ''There were obviously others who elected to not fight their fellow Shia,'' the official said, but added that the coalition did not see the failures as a ''major issue,'' especially if the Iraqi government dealt firmly with them.
 Mr. Maliki, who personally directed the Basra operation, which both American and Iraqi officials have criticized as poorly planned and executed, acknowledged the desertions without giving a specific number in public statements on Thursday.
 ''Everyone who was not on the side of the security forces will go into the military courts,'' Mr. Maliki said in a news briefing in the Green Zone. ''Joining the army or police is not a trip or a picnic, there is something that they have to pay back to commit to the interests of the state and not the party or the sect.''
 ''They swore on the Koran that they would not support their sect or their party, but they were lying,'' he said.
 On Sunday, Mr. Sadr gave the prime minister a somewhat face-saving way out of the Basra fight by ordering the Mahdi fighters to lay down their weapons after days in which government forces had made no headway.
 Mr. Sadr simultaneously made a series of demands, which senior Iraqi politicians involved in the talks said they believed that Mr. Maliki had agreed to in advance. But the prime minister has since denied any involvement in the talks, and government raids on Mahdi Army units -- something Mr. Sadr had said must stop -- have if anything become more frequent in Basra and Baghdad.
 Accordingly, Mr. Sadr's latest statement began by quoting a section of the Koran promising doom to those who make promises and then break them. He then complained bitterly that his followers were being unjustly suppressed and arrested, and warned that nothing would force them to completely withdraw. But he did not explicitly call for new fighting.
 American support for Iraqi government forces has also continued, and on Thursday the American military said it had carried out two airstrikes on Wednesday in Basra, one ''to destroy an enemy structure housing a sniper engaging Iraqi security forces in Basra'' and another to destroy a machine gun nest.
 The Iraqi police said one of the strikes leveled a two-story house in Basra's Kibla neighborhood, killing three people and wounding three, all in the same family. The police made no mention of hostile activity.
 Ryan C. Crocker, the United States ambassador to Iraq, said Mr. Maliki took the lead in talks with Shiite tribes and said that the turnout of thousands of security applicants in Basra was testament to his success.
 ''It is very clear that they have moved over toward the prime minister in a very significant way,'' Mr. Crocker said during a briefing in the United States Embassy in Baghdad.
 ''The tribal element he managed himself, as far as I can see,'' he said. ''You may recall he had a series of meetings with different tribal leaders, three or four of them, maybe more. That was something he focused on almost from the beginning, and pressed it hard straight through and has seen it pay off. Did he have counsel to do it, I don't know. But he is the one who did it.''
 Two southern tribal sheiks said that by providing recruits for the security forces, they were expressing support for the government. But the sheiks made clear that the promise of good-paying jobs for the largely unemployed young men in their tribes had also been a powerful inducement.
 Sheik Kamal al-Helfi, head of the Basra branch of the Halaf tribe, said by phone that he was still bargaining to increase his tribe's allotment of 25 jobs in the security forces. ''Many people faced a bad situation since the time of Saddam, and they have no jobs,'' he said. 
 Another southern tribal leader, Sheik Adel al-Subihawi, said larger and more powerful tribes had received quotas as high as 300 jobs.
 Mr. Maliki also announced $100 million in economic assistance to Basra, to be administered by the central government in partnership with the provincial government, and said the government would create 25,000 jobs in the city over the coming year.
 Citing that promise of assistance and the tribal discussions, Mr. Crocker said, ''Were there deals? Like everything else, that is not an engagement you win purely by military means. The prime minister is employing the economic dimension of power right now, and good on him, I think. Money is in many respects his most important weapon and he is using it.''
 Mr. Maliki said that the tribal recruits would be carefully vetted. But that was not enough to satisfy some Sunnis farther north who have been waiting for months to see comparable numbers of their tribesmen accepted into the government security forces. Tens of thousands of these Sunnis, including many former insurgents, are working alongside Iraqi and American troops in a so-called tribal awakening movement -- clearly a model for the tribal outreach in Basra.
 ''Recruiting large number of young people in Basra to fight the JAM proves once again that the government of Nuri al-Maliki is a sectarian government, a double-standard one that favors one sect at the expense of other sects,'' said Abu Othman, a senior member of Fadhil Awakening Council, referring to the Mahdi Army by its Arabic acronym.
 Abu Othman said four months ago he had presented 100 Sunni names for enrollment in the Iraqi police and had received no reply.
 ''The Maliki government wants security forces that are controlled, manipulated and moved by them,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Stay in It to Win It

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHRUM. 
Robert Shrum, a senior fellow at the Wagner School of Public Service at New York University and the author of ''No Excuses,'' was a senior adviser to Al Gore's presidential campaign in 2000 and John Kerry's presidential campaign in 2004.

 BODY:
SHE has very little chance of winning, but Hillary Clinton has no reason to get out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination -- for now. A long shot isn't the same as no chance at all. And an extended campaign doesn't have to wound the nominee, assuming a measure of self-restraint on both sides. 
 From Barack Obama's side, this would mean no more suggestions, even in the guise of counterattacks, that Mrs. Clinton's role in the White House was ''ceremonial,'' when she was in fact her husband's most influential adviser; no more memos criticizing her ''character gap''; and no more distorted readings of her health care plan that assert it would force people to buy insurance they can't afford. 
 From Mrs. Clinton's campaign, there should be no more sly comments about who is qualified to be commander in chief that just happen to include John McCain and exclude Mr. Obama; no more calls to superdelegates that traffic in dark warnings about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr.; and no more silly, and false, charges that Mr. Obama wasn't a ''professor'' at the University of Chicago law school, a transparent ploy that failed to stem the fallout after Mrs. Clinton ''misspoke'' about her trip to Bosnia as first lady.
 The degree of aggression on each side may not be comparable, as both sides argue on their own behalf. But the Democratic nomination may not be worth winning if the victor is lacerated as unready, unfit to hold the office, or un-American -- not, as expected, by the vast right-wing conspiracy but by a Democratic rival. 
 I don't doubt that Mr. Obama would agree to these rules of the road. He is winning, after all. His summons to change has proved more compelling than Mrs. Clinton's argument for experience. So wouldn't a truce be asymmetrical? Without attacking, how could she possibly catch up? That's why the Clinton operatives turned to what they call a ''kitchen sink'' strategy. 
 But the negative campaign apparently damages her more than Mr. Obama. Fairly or unfairly, she is blamed for it. In a recent poll, her approval rating collapsed to 37 percent. No one can be elected with that rating, undoing her rationale that she would be a stronger candidate against John McCain.
 Yet Mrs. Clinton has another, if decidedly narrow, path to the nomination. She has shifted from the cautious, triangulating approach that converted her inevitability into improbability. Now she sounds a populism that recalls Bill Clinton's 1992 pledge to ''put people first.'' 
 Pennsylvania, the next test, is both ideal ground for this message and a demographic nightmare for Mr. Obama. She should win the state by double digits -- and she has to. Then she would need to upend expectations by winning North Carolina on May 6, and then roll up big margins in the remaining states -- from West Virginia and Nebraska on May 13 to Montana and South Dakota on June 3, the campaign's last day of voting.
 This is a tall order. If she cannot fill it, Mrs. Clinton should then decide it's time for her to go. 
 If instead she insists on protracting the race, calls in June for her to quit would be right in principle and right for the party. But we are not at that stage yet. Calls for her to concede now, before the race is lost, are premature.
 Obviously, if she cannot win the nomination between now and June 3, Mrs. Clinton could push on to the convention as Ronald Reagan did in 1976 against Gerald Ford and as Ted Kennedy did four years later against Jimmy Carter. But in '76 and '80, there were great issues of ideology and policy at stake: Mr. Reagan's demand for the end of detente with the Soviets, Mr. Kennedy's demand for national health insurance and a new economic program. 
 Mrs. Clinton's preference for an individual mandate on health care, one of the few policy disagreements between the candidates this year, hardly rises to that level. If she carried a lost campaign all the way to the convention, she would be driven not by a cause but by personal disappointment and thwarted ambition.
 Convention fights don't necessarily produce defeat in the fall. But for Democrats in 2008, this race now looks close, closer than we assumed before the resurrection of John McCain with his appeal to moderates and independents. Democrats cannot afford to fight on after June 3, when the outcome will be clear.
 If defeat comes for Hillary Clinton, it will be hard for her to face. At the start, she thought the nomination was hers. She could have been the candidate of change instead of the establishment candidate in a year of change. She might have swept the primaries in spite of Mr. Obama's extraordinary talents. 
 But that was the year that wasn't. And, in the likely event that she falls short by June, I hope and believe that no matter how hard it is, she will do the right thing.

HEADLINE: Bear Stearns in the Committee Room

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Three weeks after the market crisis that forced the rescue of Bear Stearns, federal officials and senior Wall Street executives offered their first public account on Thursday of the harrowing four days of negotiations that led to a deal to sell the investment bank to JPMorgan Chase.
 In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, top officials from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission strongly defended their actions, answering critics who have said that the government should have taken more aggressive steps months, or years, earlier to prevent the problems that are plaguing the financial markets. 
 Critics have also questioned bailing out creditors of one Wall Street investment firm possibly at taxpayers' expense.
 The officials responded that they had no choice but to act for the broader good of the markets and the economy. A failure to save Bear Stearns, said Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, would have led to ''a greater probability of widespread insolvencies, severe and protracted damage to the financial system and, ultimately, to the economy as a whole.'' 
 The testimony disclosed that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had insisted that Bear be paid a very low price for its stock by JPMorgan Chase. The testimony also offered more details about the pressures on Bear. The firm's chief executive, Alan D. Schwartz, said that he thought on the morning of Friday, March 14, that he had engineered a loan, backed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, that bought him 28 days to find a solution. 
 But he said he realized that he had misunderstood the terms of the loan when the Fed decided later that day that the loan would last only through the weekend and that he had only until Sunday afternoon to find a buyer for the 85-year-old firm. 
 The testimony also disclosed that regulators were unaware of Bear's precarious health and did not know until the afternoon of Thursday, March 13, that the firm was planning to file for bankruptcy protection the next morning. 
 Pummeled by market rumors of insolvency, the investment house lost more than $10 billion --or more than 80 percent -- of its available cash in a single day. Only a few days earlier, the chairman of the S.E.C., Christopher Cox, had sought to calm investors, telling reporters that ''we have a good deal of comfort about the capital cushions'' at Bear and other large investment houses.
 By Sunday, March 16, Federal Reserve and administration officials had orchestrated a $30 billion rescue of the firm, and the firm announced that its stock, which last year had been trading at $171 a share, would be sold to JPMorgan for $2 a share. (The offer was later revised to $10.)
 Under questioning by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the committee's chairman, both Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed, and Mr. Geithner said they played no role in setting the price, which was one of the most controversial elements of the deal.
 ''We had no interest or no concern about the stock price that was evaluated,'' Mr. Bernanke testified.
 But in response to the same question, Robert Steel, a Treasury under secretary, said that his boss, Mr. Paulson, had said during the negotiations that the price should be low because the deal was being supported by a $30 billion taxpayer loan. 
 He said a lower price was desirable to make the broader point to the markets that by rescuing the bank, the government did not want to encourage risky behavior by other large institutions, a concept known as ''moral hazard.''
 ''There was a view that the price should not be very high or should be towards the low end and that it should be -- given the government's involvement, that that was the perspective,'' Mr. Steel said. ''With regard to the specifics, the actual deal was negotiated or transaction was negotiated between the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the two parties.''
 ''It was our perspective, as I said, that moral hazard wanted to be protected as much as possible,'' he added, ''and so therefore a lower price was more appropriate and there were lots of terms and conditions.''
 Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Geithner said that in exchange for the $30 billion loan, the Federal Reserve Bank was given investment-grade securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, with the majority of them from government-sponsored institutions like Freddie Mac. 
 They said that under the terms of the deal, an investment manager retained by the Federal Reserve Bank would have 10 years to dispose of the assets. That would eliminate the need to sell the assets quickly in a fire sale. Moreover, JPMorgan Chase later agreed to absorb the first $1 billion of any loss that might occur on the loan.
 ''Our system has many strengths,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''But to be direct about it, I think we've suffered a very damaging blow to confidence in the credibility of our financial system.''
 Mr. Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, testified that Bear's failure on Thursday and Friday, March 13 and 14, to obtain financing even though it had what he called ''high-quality collateral'' was ''an unprecedented occurrence.'' 
 Mr. Cox strongly suggested in response to questions by several senators that the commission was investigating whether there may have been unlawful manipulation of Bear Stearns's stock price in the days leading up to the run on the firm. 
 The Thursday afternoon alert to the commission led to a round of evening and early morning negotiations, and at 5 a.m. on Friday, members of the Federal Reserve voted over the telephone to grant a loan, through JPMorgan, to Bear Stearns. 
 Mr. Schwartz, Bear's chief executive, said he thought the action had bought him 28 days to raise cash or find a buyer. 
 ''We believed at the time that the loan and corresponding back-stop from the New York Fed would be available for 28 days,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''We hoped this period would be sufficient to bring order to the chaos and allow us to secure more permanent funding or an orderly disposition of assets to raise cash, if that became necessary.''
 But by the end of the day, with continuing problems surfacing and the downgrading of the firm's credit rating, he said he was told by the Federal Reserve of New York that he had misunderstood the terms of the deal. He was told that the loan would expire on Sunday, and that he had to find a buyer for the bank by then -- before the Asian markets opened. The decision, Mr. Schwartz testified, left him with no negotiating leverage as talks proceeded with JPMorgan.
 ''On Friday night, we learned that the JPMorgan credit facility would not be available beyond Sunday night,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''The choices we faced that Friday night were stark: find a party willing to acquire Bear Stearns by Sunday night, or face what my advisers were telling me could be a bankruptcy filing on Monday morning, which could likely wipe out our shareholders and cause losses for certain of our creditors and all of our employees.'' 
 Mr. Schwartz said his misunderstanding of the agreement was ''an honest disagreement as to the words'' of the loan.
 ''Everything happened on a very, very short time frame,'' he said.
 Asked about the adequacy of the price paid to Bear Stearns, Mr. Schwartz said he had no alternative.
 ''All the leverage went out the window when we were told we had to have a deal done by the end of the weekend,'' he said.
 James Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, offered a slightlydifferent view on the question.
 ''Buying a house,'' he said, ''is not the same as buying a house on fire.''

HEADLINE: Voodoo Health Economics

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Elizabeth Edwards has cancer. John McCain has had cancer in the past. Last weekend, Mrs. Edwards bluntly pointed out that neither of them would be able to get insurance under Mr. McCain's health care plan.
 It's about time someone said that and, more generally, made the case that Mr. McCain's approach to health care is based on voodoo economics -- not the supply-side voodoo that claims that cutting taxes increases revenues (though Mr. McCain says that, too), but the equally foolish claim, refuted by all available evidence, that the magic of the marketplace can produce cheap health care for everyone.
 As Mrs. Edwards pointed out, the McCain health plan would do nothing to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage to those, like her and Mr. McCain, who have pre-existing medical conditions. 
 The McCain campaign's response was condescending and dismissive -- a statement that Mrs. Edwards doesn't understand the comprehensive nature of the senator's approach, which would harness ''the power of competition to produce greater coverage for Americans,'' reducing costs so that even people with pre-existing conditions could afford care.
 This is nonsense on multiple levels.
 For one thing, even if you buy the premise that competition would reduce health care costs, the idea that it could cut costs enough to make insurance affordable for Americans with a history of cancer or other major diseases is sheer fantasy. 
 Beyond that, there's no reason to believe in these alleged cost reductions. Insurance companies do try to hold down ''medical losses'' -- the industry's term for what happens when an insurer actually ends up having to honor its promises by paying a client's medical bills. But they don't do this by promoting cost-effective medical care. 
 Instead, they hold down costs by only covering healthy people, screening out those who need coverage the most -- which was exactly the point Mrs. Edwards was making. They also deny as many claims as possible, forcing doctors and hospitals to spend large sums fighting to get paid.
 And the international evidence on health care costs is overwhelming: the United States has the most privatized system, with the most market competition -- and it also has by far the highest health care costs in the world. 
 Yet the McCain health plan -- actually a set of bullet points on the campaign's Web site -- is entirely based on blind faith that competition among private insurers will solve all problems. 
 I'd like to single out one of these bullet points in particular -- the first substantive proposal Mr. McCain offers (the preceding entries are nothing but feel-good boilerplate).
 As I've mentioned in past columns, the Veterans Health Administration is one of the few clear American success stories in the struggle to contain health care costs. Since it was reformed during the Clinton years, the V.A. has used the fact that it's an integrated system -- a system that takes long-term responsibility for its clients' health -- to deliver an impressive combination of high-quality care and low costs. It has also taken the lead in the use of information technology, which has both saved money and reduced medical errors.
 Sure enough, Mr. McCain wants to privatize and, in effect, dismantle the V.A. Naturally, this destructive agenda comes wrapped in the flag: ''America's veterans have fought for our freedom,'' says the McCain Web site. ''We should give them freedom to choose to carry their V.A. dollars to a provider that gives them the timely care at high quality and in the best location.'' 
 That's a recipe for having healthy veterans drop out of the system, undermining its integrated nature and draining away resources.
 Mr. McCain, then, is offering a completely wrongheaded approach to health care. But the way the campaign for the Democratic nomination has unfolded raises questions about how effective his eventual opponent will be in making that point. 
 Indeed, while Mrs. Edwards focused her criticism on Mr. McCain, she also made it clear that she prefers Hillary Clinton's approach -- ''Sen. Clinton's plan is a great plan'' -- to Barack Obama's. The Clinton plan closely resembles the plan for universal coverage that John Edwards laid out more than a year ago. By contrast, Mr. Obama offers a watered-down plan that falls short of universality, and it would have higher costs per person covered.
 Worse yet, Mr. Obama attacked his Democratic rivals' health plans using conservative talking points about choice and the evil of having the government tell you what to do. That's going to make it hard -- if he is the nominee -- to refute Mr. McCain when he makes similar arguments on behalf of such things as privatizing veterans' care.
 Still, health care ought to be a major issue in this campaign. I wonder if we'll have time to discuss it after we deal with more important subjects, like bowling and basketball.

HEADLINE: Seeing the Sights of Industrial China: 2 Factories, 2 Futures

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
 ''The RMB is killing me,'' groaned Jin Jue.
 Mr. Jin, a hip-looking 35-year-old with spiky hair and an all-black ensemble, describes himself on his business card as the ''board chairman'' of the Shanghai Jinjue Fashion Company. It was my first full day in China, and Mr. Jin was showing me around his factory on the outskirts of town. 
 RMB, of course, is shorthand for renminbi, the Chinese currency, also known as the yuan, which, since the beginning of the year, has risen more than 4 percent against the declining dollar. Even as the Chinese economy has become increasingly powerful, the government has kept the yuan artificially low, much to the annoyance of the United States. Truth to tell, it is still not nearly as high as it would be if it were unmoored from government control. When the Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson Jr., was in Beijing this week, he praised the recent rise of the yuan though -- as he invariably does when he's in China -- he called on Chinese officials to let their currency float freely. 
 This is my first trip to China and, like most Americans, I had an image of what a Chinese factory looked like. Mr. Jin's operation fit that image almost to a T. It was housed in a run-down building amid a sea of run-down buildings in the Kun Shan industrial zone, just northwest of Shanghai. Except for Mr. Jin's own office, it was really just one cavernous room, filled with rows of tables, on which stood old-fashioned sewing machines. There was a cafeteria with rickety wooden chairs and beaten-up tables where the workers ate their meals, and a sad-looking dormitory where they slept. Behind the building was a dirty-looking river. Debris littered its banks. 
 Mr. Jin's factory also makes the sort of thing you expect a Chinese factory to make: it churns out inexpensive clothing, aimed at the European market. Mr. Jin is the classic low-cost, tight-margin, squeeze-every-penny manufacturer, the kind of entrepreneur who has been the backbone of China's astounding economic rise -- and who has also been the primary beneficiary of the low yuan, which has spurred the market for China's cheap goods. On the day I visited, his work force was making tan jackets under the French brand Camaieu.
 Except ... where were all the workers? I had expected the place to be teeming with people. Instead, only about a quarter of the room was in use; Mr. Jin later confirmed that 60 percent of his work force had either quit or been laid off. Business, clearly, was terrible, and Mr. Jin was losing money.
 What the low yuan giveth, the rising yuan taketh away. As China's currency has risen, Mr. Jin's cheap clothes suddenly aren't so cheap anymore. And he had other problems as well. ''The business environment in Europe is bad,'' he said through a translator. Thanks to inflation in China -- up 8.7 percent in February alone -- his workers wanted more than the several hundred dollars or so a month he says he pays them. The tax rebates he received from the government were shrinking. 
 Recently, the government passed labor laws that included a series of protections for workers; that was also pushing up his costs. As a result, orders that had once come to him as a matter of course were now gravitating to Vietnam, Mexico and other countries that could undercut him on his only competitive advantage: cost. (I later heard that some Chinese garment manufacturers were putting a ''Made in Mexico'' tag on their goods and routing them through Mexico to take advantage of Nafta.)
 Though he lacked a college education -- Mr. Jin had started in business right out of the army, he told me -- he had a pretty clear-eyed understanding of what was happening to him. Though factories like his had led the way in China's economic miracle, the government was not all that terribly interested anymore in having the country be the lowest-cost producer of every good imaginable. Factories that played that game sometimes produced toys that were tainted. And they didn't necessarily improve the quality of life of their workers. Ultimately, relying on cheap labor to build an economy was a sucker's game. ''If the government lets the RMB keep rising,'' Mr. Jin said, ''all these factories will go out of business.''
 And so it may turn out. But though it may inflict some pain in the short term, over the long haul, it will almost surely be a good thing for the Chinese economy. And it won't be a lot of fun for the West to watch.
 When you travel around China these days and listen to businessmen and analysts, there is a phrase you hear again and again. They all talk about ''moving up the value chain.'' By that they mean they want their businesses to gravitate toward more complex, higher-value goods -- the ones that bring in bigger profits, are less dependent on rock-bottom costs and are more immune to currency fluctuations. 
 Andrew Rothman, a China strategist with the investment firm CLSA, described it as ''a deliberate policy to push manufacturing up the value chain.''
 ''It is coming at the same time as rising raw material costs. What the Chinese government is saying is that, 'We don't want to be the world's workshop for junk. We want to make higher-value stuff that creates more wealth and better jobs.' ''
 For instance, if you open up, say, an iPod, you'll find that many of the higher-value components are made in places outside of China--and then brought into the country to be assembled. And, of course, the biggest profit of all goes to the owner of the brand: Apple. The Chinese are no long content to simply assemble the components. They want to make them as well -- and own the brand.
 In his own way, Mr. Jin understood that, too. On the flip side of his business card was the word ''Tousnosamis.'' It was, he told me, a fashion brand he had started recently; he had put out several lines of women's clothing that he was selling in the domestic market. Eventually, he said with a small, self-conscious laugh, he hoped it would become ''like Armani.'' At the least, it would allow him to be freed from the grinding pressure of being a low-cost manufacturer. ''Maybe in 10 years,'' he said. It was his dream -- and China's. 
 The next morning, I met someone who had already fulfilled the dream. His name is Li Xian Shou, and he is the founder and chief executive of a company called ReneSola, which makes the silicon wafers that are used in solar panels. 
 Mr. Li, 39, looks as uncool as Mr. Jin looks cool; his pink tie was slightly askew and the sleeves of his suit were so long they almost covered his hands. His company, however, is as cool as can be: In the fourth quarter of 2007, its revenue was up nearly 200 percent from the fourth quarter of 2006. Last year, it made $53 million, almost double its 2006 profit, and in January it raised $130 million in a stock offering on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The ReneSola factories were also on the outskirts of Shanghai, but that's where the similarities with Mr. Jin's factory ended. Mr. Li's company was expanding like crazy, taking over acre after acre of former farmland, and snapping up plants, dormitories and other facilities as fast as it could. As we toured through Mr. Li's plants, I was a little stunned to discover that some of the buildings were only six months old; the plaster was nicked and scarred, suggesting a lot of wear and tear. Like many Chinese businessmen, Mr. Li is moving so fast he doesn't have time to worry about whether the plaster on his walls is smooth.
 Before giving me the tour, Mr. Li told me his story (again through a translator). A former government official, he had raised $1.5 million from four friends to start his company in 2001. (Government officials who go into business tend to have the crucial advantage of good connections.) At first, the company assembled solar panels; most of his customers were companies in Germany and Japan that made the wafers and then sold the panels once they were assembled. ''By 2003,'' he said, ''revenue was about $10 million.''
 But assembling the panels was the lowest-cost, lowest-value part of the solar industry. ''It is a commodity business,'' he said. ''And it can attract a lot of competition.'' So in 2005, he decided to take the big leap. He got out of the solar panel business and into the more profitable solar wafer business.
 Now instead of competing with other Chinese companies, he is competing with German and Japanese companies -- where his cost advantage is huge. His company has created a technology for using recycled wafers and other materials, which is helping him avert the shortage of polysilicon, the material from which the wafers are made. He employs 3,300 people, up from 20 in 2005, and pays his line operators upward of $500 a month. From a standing start three years ago, ReneSola is among the world's top five suppliers of solar wafers.
 When I asked Mr. Li about the effect of the rising yuan, he gave me an indifferent shrug. Because his wafers are shipped to other Chinese companies -- the panel assemblers -- instead of exported, he can demand payment in yuan. His is a business that relies on complicated machinery at least as much as manual labor, so he can work toward productivity improvements. And because he is making a product with a much higher profit margin than a solar panel's, he can more easily absorb a currency hit. So far, he said, the money lost from the rise of the yuan was ''trivial.'' 
 As we toured his plant, I couldn't help noticing that much of the machinery ReneSola uses to make wafers came from Germany. A rising yuan helps Mr. Li there, too.
 As the Chinese say, Be careful what you wish for, Mr. Paulson.

HEADLINE: In a Modern Gold Rush, Can Memories Beat $913 an Ounce?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Gold rushes should be simple money-making schemes. 
 And on the surface, this one is. With prices hitting record levels, people are melting down rare coins. They are digging through drawers for family heirlooms to pawn. And they are giving gold parties, inviting friends to walk in with gold and walk out with cash.
 ''Gold is coming out of the walls,'' said Joseph Grunberg, a pawnbroker and jewelry shop owner in the Diamond District of Manhattan. 
 He said his clientele is the rich and not-so -- a stockbroker came into his store recently to sell his $30,000 gold watch, but he's also seen people hoping that their old class ring might help pay the rent. ''It's a mega-mega business right now,'' he added.
 But there are hidden costs to cashing in. As thousands of Americans rush to sell off pieces of their past -- an ounce of gold now commands about $913, as of Friday afternoon, up about $240 from a year ago -- they are confronting treacherous emotional terrain.
 Behind every 18-karat gold herringbone necklace and 12-karat toggle bracelet is the story of a bad breakup or a late great-aunt. 
 That has turned the seemingly uncomplicated process of cashing in on gold's surging value into an emotionally fraught experience, bringing new meaning to the notion of a precious metal. 
 ''People tear up as they tell us about the jewelry,'' said Michael Mouret, president of Louisiana Gold & Coins in Baton Rouge, who, like many storekeepers, has become a therapist for conflicted gold sellers. 
 A tough economy across much of the country is pitting memories against much-needed money. Rita Wallace, 50, has collected coins for 30 years, a hobby she inherited from her grandfather. Selling the coins as scrap gold, destined for melting, was never her intention. 
 But after watching the price of gold soar this winter, Ms. Wallace, who is unemployed, decided to send off for melting her United States Mint coins commemorating the Statue of Liberty, the Constitution and the founding of the Jamestown colony in Virginia.
 In the end, she was paid $5,000, far more than the coins' value as collectibles, she said. ''Is it really what I wanted to do?'' said Ms. Wallace, who lives outside Columbus, Ohio. ''No, not really. But it made the most sense financially.''
 Gold's steady climb in price has been driven by a swooning stock market, a weak dollar and fear of inflation, which have prodded people to turn to safer bets, like ever-reliable gold. Its value jumped from around $660 an ounce a year ago to more than $1,000 in March.
 Prices have slipped back to about $900, but the numbers are still attractive enough to drive thousands of Americans to raid their jewelry boxes.
 To mitigate the emotional toll, a handful of pawnshops and jewelers are playing host to gold parties, where a combination of alcohol, food and banter has transformed a cold financial transaction into something resembling happy hour. 
 At one such party a few nights ago, with a 28-year-old teacher in Shelby, Mich., as host, a group of women drank wine and snacked on vegetables as a jewelry expert calculated the weight and karat value of their gold, writing them checks based on that day's gold price ($880 an ounce). 
 Raegen Findlay, a 29-year-old homemaker, arrived with several dozen pieces of jewelry, some hers, some belonging to her mother. As it was examined, Ms. Findlay panicked, picked up her cellphone and called her mother. Did she want to salvage the gems from a gold ring before it was sold off and melted down?
 ''Nah, she said to go ahead and sell it all,'' Ms. Findlay said, relaying the conversation with her mother, who wanted the extra money for a coming vacation. The gold from Ms. Findlay's mother was worth $365 -- a figure that drew applause from the women in the room.
 While wrenching for some, selling gold is cathartic for others. Over the last few months, a woman named Diane, who lives in Tennessee and asked that her last name not be used, has sold more than $1,000 worth of gold jewelry given to her by her former husband, including a 14-karat herringbone necklace (sold for $500). 
 ''If I had not gotten a divorce, I probably would not have parted with it,'' she said. ''But I did not need that kind of karma lying around the house.''
 Stanley Crane, a 66-year-old coin and jewelry collector, said the high price of gold was the equivalent of a get-out-of-jail-free card for those who are stuck with, say, an 18-karat wedding band saddled with emotional baggage from a breakup, or a chunky gold charm bracelet that has fallen out of fashion.
 ''It forgives a lot of bad stuff and makes up for a lot of mistakes,'' he said. 
 Mistakes like damaged coins. For years, Mr. Crane, a retired trucking company employee in White Lake, Mich., has tried to unload dented and scratched coins that have languished in his collection for lack of a buyer.
 When gold prices began to surge this winter, the weight of the flawed coins overshadowed any aesthetic flaws. He just traded an imperfect gold coin worth $936, at the time, for two smaller gold coins, potentially worth much more because they are in mint condition. 
 Not everyone's story ends that happily, or profitably. Many are discovering, much to their embarrassment, that all that glitters in the back corner of their jewelry box is not gold -- or at least not the valuable kind. 
 Several weeks ago, a 30-something woman walked into Lombard Mutual, the pawnbroker and jewelry shop in Manhattan, to find out how much a pair of gold drop earrings might fetch. 
 Behind the counter, the shop's owner, Joseph Grunberg, performed a routine test and delivered his verdict: ''Gold plated,'' he said. 
 ''I'm shocked,'' responded the woman, who would identify herself only as Jessica because of what she said next. ''It figures. My boss gave me those earrings right before she fired me.''
 ''She claimed,'' Jessica added, with disgust, ''that they were real gold.''

HEADLINE: For Seattle Shoppers, Paper or Plastic Could Come with a 'Green Fee'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
The cashier's chorus has long fallen on deaf ears among the sustainability set here. Paper or plastic? ''Neither'' is of course the greenest answer.
 Soon, however, ''neither'' may be the cheapest answer, too. 
 Under a proposal announced this week by Mayor Greg Nickels, shoppers in Seattle would pay a 20-cent ''green fee'' beginning next year for every new paper or plastic bag they use to carry away goods from grocery, drug or convenience stories. They would be encouraged to bring their own bags for carrying home purchases. 
 Foam food containers would also be banned under the proposal. 
 The goal, Mr. Nickels said, is to reduce waste, reduce production of paper and plastic and encourage still more people here to be faithful to their bumper-sticker gospel: ''Think Globally, Act Locally.'' (The proposal also appears likely to burnish Mr. Nickels's credentials as one of the nation's greenest mayors.) 
 ''This combination of environmental and economic stewardship will help ensure a truly sustainable city,'' Mayor Nickels said.
 Richard Conlin, the president of the City Council, who was present at the announcement, said that council members would most likely take up the proposal in June or July and that he expected it to pass easily. Other cities have banned foam containers, but Seattle would appear to be the first in the United States to impose fees on both kinds of shopping bags. Last year, San Francisco banned plastic grocery bags outright, but paper bags can still be used, and without a fee. 
 Seattle, often just as liberal but less loopy than San Francisco, determined that the production and shipping costs of paper bags made them ''actually worse for the planet'' than plastic bags, according to a recent local study.
 The city said a similar program in Ireland helped reduce the use of disposable bags by 90 percent. The city could expect to raise $10 million annually through the fee, with $1 million going to buy and distribute free reusable bags to each household in the city.
 ''This proposal,'' the mayor said, ''is all about forming new habits.''
 So there was Kristy Guise the day after the announcement, forming her new habit at the mammoth Fred Meyer grocery and department store in the Ballard neighborhood. 
 Word of the proposed fee prompted Ms. Guise to take three large reusable shopping bags into the store, but she still needed two plastic bags to hold everything she bought. She figured she would have needed a dozen plastic bags to carry the whole load. Next year that could cost her $2.40 beyond her grocery bill.
 ''It made me think twice,'' said Ms. Guise, 35. ''I've usually got one or two kids in tow, and I usually just forget.''
 Ms. Guise conceded that she was particularly interested in the issue because she worked at a company that sells bags to retail stores. Her efforts to reduce her own bag consumption make for ''a bit of a conflict of interest,'' she said. 
 Mr. Conlin, the Council president, said making people pay for bags rather than banning them would encourage people to be aware of what they consume and could help the city avoid potential challenges to its authority to ban products. He dismissed the suggestion that the public dependency on disposable bags was somehow beyond rehabilitation.
 ''Plastic bags were only invented like three decades ago,'' Mr. Conlin said. ''It's not like this was a pioneer tradition.''

HEADLINE: A Newspaper Chain Is in Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
In a magazine article seven years ago, the chief executive of the Journal Register Company, the publicly traded newspaper company, bragged about being such a skinflint that he checked the odometers in reporters' vehicles to verify expense reports. 
 Even such penny-pinching was not enough to keep the company from facing a sprawling debt situation now and the possibility of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. 
 In response, Journal Register, whose flagship paper is The New Haven Register, has hired the investment bank Lazard as an adviser as it weighs a restructuring, according to executives briefed on the matter.
 If the company were to seek bankruptcy protection, as analysts said was possible, it would be a first in recent memory for a publicly traded newspaper company, John Morton, a longtime newspaper analyst, said. 
 ''That will just add to the gloom and doom that has settled over the industry,'' he said.
 A spokesman for the company declined to comment. 
 This development comes amid a broad upheaval for the newspaper industry as readers and advertisers continue to shift to the Internet, and it raises the prospect of a public newspaper company's being owned by its creditors -- in the case of Journal Register a consortium of banks that includes JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank.
 Journal Register's troubles are more related to its debt load -- about $625 million at the end of 2007 -- than secular changes in the business.
 Four years ago, the company paid $415 million for several Michigan dailies, whose fortunes declined as automobile manufacturers in Detroit cut their advertising budgets.
 ''When the whole automotive market collapsed, their newspapers did as well,'' Mr. Morton said. ''And they took on a lot of debt. This was strictly a market-driven collapse.''
 While the company struggles to make its debt payments, its operating performance has declined. Journal Register reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $90 million last year, a figure that is expected to slip to $70 million in 2008, according to Wachovia Capital Markets. 
 ''This is the year that maybe those companies that are highly leveraged can't make their debt payments, and Journal Register could be the first,'' said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute. 
 On March 31, Journal Register was notified by the New York Stock Exchange that its share price had fallen too low and that the stock was at risk of delisting. From that day it had 10 business days to notify the stock exchange of a plan to bolster its share price or face being delisted.
 Journal Register owns 22 daily newspapers and 310 nondailies, mostly clustered in to six areas: Greater Philadelphia, Michigan, Connecticut, Greater Cleveland and the mid-Hudson region of New York. The company, based in Yardley, Pa., went public in 1997, and was once owned by the New York investment firm E. M. Warburg Pincus & Company. The company's shares closed unchanged Friday at 52 cents.
 ''Who would have thought that a relatively substantial public newspaper company would be at risk of bankruptcy?'' Mr. Edmonds said. ''People are going to see this and say, who's next?''

HEADLINE: Across the Globe, Hints Of More Perils in Housing

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AS a weakening housing market appears to be dragging the American economy into recession, the International Monetary Fund warned this week that home prices in other industrial countries were even more overvalued. 
 In its World Economic Outlook report, the fund also concluded that central banks should pay close attention to home prices and consider raising interest rates when prices are rising rapidly. That conclusion is directly contrary to the established policy of most central banks, including the Federal Reserve, which ignores home prices when they are expanding.
 In the current credit crisis, which began with problems in the subprime mortgage market, the Fed has moved aggressively to lower interest rates.
 ''A central bank that wants to stabilize the economy is better served by responding to house prices, both when they go up and when they go down,'' said Roberto Cardarelli, a senior economist with the I.M.F. He said that was particularly important in countries with relatively open mortgage markets, like the United States, which make it easy for homeowners to get access to cash when prices are rising.
 The fund looked at trends in housing prices and mortgage debt in 17 countries, and tried to assess how much of the price changes could be attributed to economic fundamentals, including trends in personal income, demographics and interest rates. It concluded that house prices in the United States in mid-2007 were 11 percent higher than the fundamentals would justify.
 But that overvaluation was much lower than in Ireland, where the I.M.F. estimates that house prices were 32 percent higher than fundamentals would support. The Netherlands, Britain, Australia, France and Norway all showed overvaluations of at least 20 percent.
 On the other end of the spectrum, the I.M.F. concluded that homes were undervalued in Canada and Austria.
 Mr. Cardarelli pointed out that adjusted for overall inflation, home prices rose at a slower rate in the United States in this decade than they did in many other countries, with the mid-2007 figure up 42 percent from the first quarter of 2000. Comparable figures included gains of 95 percent in Spain, 90 percent in Britain and 85 percent in France.
 Mortgage debt has shot up over recent decades in many countries, but there remain sharp variations as some markets make it much harder to borrow or restricted the loan-to-value ratio of mortgage loans. 
 In the United States, total mortgage debt more than doubled, as a percentage of gross domestic product, going from 34 percent in 1983 to 45 percent in 1990 and then to 76 percent in 2006. 
 In some countries, however, the increases were much greater. Mortgage indebtedness in the Netherlands hit 98 percent of G.D.P., and in Denmark it rose to 101 percent.
 In Italy, however, mortgage debt has risen but is still less than 20 percent of G.D.P., and in France the figure is just 32 percent. Perhaps not coincidentally, when the I.M.F. put together an index of mortgage markets, the most liberal in terms of lending standards was the United States, followed by Denmark and the Netherlands. 
 At the bottom of that list were France and Italy.

HEADLINE: Database Was Set Up To Ignore 'Abortion'

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Johns Hopkins University said Friday that it had programmed its computers to ignore the word ''abortion'' in searches of a large, publicly financed database of information on reproductive health after federal officials raised questions about two articles in the database. The dean of the Public Health School lifted the restrictions after learning of them.
 A spokesman for the school, Timothy M. Parsons, said the restrictions were enforced starting in February. 
 Johns Hopkins manages the population database known as Popline with money from the Agency for International Development.
 Popline is the world's largest database on reproductive health, with more than 360,000 records and articles on family planning, fertility and sexually transmitted diseases.
 Mr. Parsons said the development agency had expressed concern after finding ''two articles about abortion advocacy'' in the database. The articles, he said, did not fit database criteria and were removed.
 Employees who manage the database instructed their computers to ignore the word ''abortion'' as a search term.
 After learning of the restrictions on Friday, the dean, Dr. Michael J. Klag, said: ''I could not disagree more strongly with this decision, and I have directed that the Popline administrators restore 'abortion' as a search term immediately. I will also launch an inquiry to determine why this change occurred.''
 The school is named for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, a Hopkins alumnus who has given millions of dollars to the university and the school.
 Dr. Klag said the school was ''dedicated to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge, and not its restriction.''
 Ted Miller, a spokesman for Naral Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group, said: ''The public has a right to know why someone would censor relevant medical information. The Bush administration has politicized science as part of an ideological agenda. So it's important to know if that occurred here.''
 A woman answering telephones at the Agency for International Development said officials were not available because they were at a retreat.
 Librarians at the Medical Center of the University of California, San Francisco, expressed concern about the restrictions this week after they had difficulty retrieving articles from Popline.
 In an e-mail response on Tuesday, Johns Hopkins told the librarians that ''abortion'' was no longer a valid search term.
 ''We recently made all abortion terms stop words,'' Debra L. Dickson, a Popline manager, wrote. ''As a federally funded project, we decided this was best for now.''
 Ms. Dickson suggested that instead of using ''abortion,'' librarians could use other terms like ''fertility control, postconception'' or ''pregnancy, unwanted.''
 Gail L. Sorrough, director of medical library services at the medical center in San Francisco, said it was absurd to restrict searches using ''a perfectly good noun such as 'abortion.' ''
 Under the rule, Popline ignored the word ''abortion,'' just as it ignores terms like ''a'' and ''the.'' Ms. Sorrough and a colleague, Gloria Won, reported their experience on an electronic mailing list, and librarians protested the restrictions.
 ''We sent this out on a listserv, and it just exploded,'' Ms. Sorrough said. ''Eliminating this term essentially blocks access to reports in the database and ultimately to information about abortion. Unwanted pregnancy is not a synonym for abortion.''
 Items on Popline include articles on ''demand for abortion by unmarried teenagers'' and federal judges' abortion rulings.

HEADLINE: Work Every Bit as Wild as It Is Woolly

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: NORRIS, Mont. 

 BODY:
It sounds like something a Zen master might ask: How does the wool come off a sheep?
 But when you have a squirming 100-pound yearling between your knees, a roaring set of power shears in one hand, and a completely blank mind because everything your instructor just told you about which stroke comes next has faded into a white noise of panic and muscle fatigue, getting the wool off is not an academic question.
 You stare down, bent over, and the universe contracts. It is only you, the sheep and the shears. Find the way, you think. Try to remember. Is the ''long blow'' next? Or up the brisket and under the neck? Or maybe the ''top knot''? 
 To shear a sheep is to touch a fading chord of Western culture. In the 1990s alone, 40,000 sheep ranches blinked out of existence, a 38 percent decline. And the number of people who know how to shear is falling even faster. 
 Which brings us to a sheep-shearing class here: 10 men and 5 women -- a few entrepreneurs, some back-to-the-land idealists, a psychiatrist from Butte who has made a bet with his wife, three high school buddies, a home builder looking for an economic sideline in tough times and a reporter trying to get inside the story.
 And, of course, there are the sheep.
 Sheep, you might think, should be among the mildest and easiest of animals to handle. In literature, they have been handy symbols since the days of Homer for innocence in the face of adversity, forever typecast as lost pals to Little Bo Peep or victims of the Big Bad Wolf.
 But in this three-day class, a harder truth emerges: Sheepish innocence and stoicism are only a front for the jagged reef on which beginners can founder. Sheep endure. It is the shearer who must adapt, adjust and pivot.
 ''Learning to shear is a lesson in humility,'' said one instructor, Jim Moore, a field agent at the Montana Sheep Institute, which focuses on all things woolly at Montana State University and runs training programs at the university's experimental ranch here about 30 miles west of its Bozeman campus. 
 This is a fortunate year to become an American shearer. In a strange local backwash of global capitalism and the weak United States dollar, the Australian and New Zealand shearing companies on which Western ranchers have come to depend are staying home this spring, unable to justify the exchange-rate loss. The short-term shortage of shearers, which the sheep institute tries to address, has meant all but guaranteed work for domestic talent, notwithstanding the long-term decline in American sheep ranching, coincident with a growing foreign dominance.
 Still, there are motivations to learn shearing other than quick employment, or masochism.
 Becky Weed, 48, runs about 150 sheep with her husband on a certified organic ranch and wool mill near Bozeman and was enrolled in the class. A geologist by training, Ms. Weed worked on hazardous waste cleanup projects for years and became obsessed with the idea of preserving a patch of earth by natural means. Learning to shear, she said, is part of that same impulse.
 ''I see the interest in learning these old skills not as a backward-looking thing at all,'' she said. ''Old-timers have a lot to teach us.''
 Joletta Spang, another student, said she wanted to bring sheep ranching back to the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, about 300 miles east of here, where she is a leader of a 4-H club.
 ''Forty-one years old and I'm finally learning how to shear a sheep,'' Ms. Spang said. ''Not sure how much sense that makes, but how often do you get to do something like this?''
 Cody Newland, 23, who completed four years in the Marines in December, including a tour in Iraq, drove 14 hours from his home in Oregon to be here. Soft-spoken but determined, he said he planned to buy his first flock of 150 sheep this spring. 
 ''I'll be a sheep farmer the rest of my life, hopefully,'' he said.
 An unheated Montana shearing shed in March is a cold and cacophonous place. A grinding wheel for sharpening blades periodically screams from one corner. The thumping of sheep on the plywood floor is punctuated by the occasional curses of the students when a sheep gets loose and sets off a mad scramble of recapture.
 The thick, waxy feel of lanolin, the natural oil in sheep's wool, hangs over everything, coating jeans and skin. Lanolin gives wool its waterproof property but is also completely enmeshed in the shearing process. It lubricates the cutting blades as the shearing comb slides across the sheep's skin.
 A good shearer can finish a sheep in two or three minutes and earn upward of $70 to $80 an hour, minus expenses. Mike Schuldt, one of the instructors, did one in 52 seconds in competition last year. This reporter, just a beginner, managed seven in a day and a half.
 There is poetry in watching any physical task done well. But shearing is more like ballet. The sheep and the shearer must move as one. Each shift of the shearer's feet into a new position for the next set of strokes also shifts the sheep's posture and weight, presenting a new flank or angle for the blade's pass.
 Shearing has its own language, too. The thick tuft on the sheep's head is the ''top knot.'' A pass of the blade is a ''blow.'' The ''long blow,'' a big sweep of the shears on the animal's side from rump to neck, comes near the end when in a sense the shearer connect the dots of the previous strokes.
 For some students, empathy was an issue, if mostly unspoken. Are the sheep stressed? 
 Put in the right positions, though, some sheep went almost limp and closed their eyes. And when the work was done, they mostly scampered out the open end of the shed seeming no worse for wear. 
 Meagan Rathjen, 22, a ranch hand at a sheep spread near Missoula -- she came west from small-town Iowa, interested in helping support sustainable agriculture -- nicked her first sheep. It was nothing too serious, but enough to draw a small trickle of blood, which looked stark and red against the yearling's white skin. 
 So quietly that almost no one else could hear, Ms. Rathjen bent down over the half-shorn animal, and apologized.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rising

 BODY:
Friday's awful news of 80,000 lost jobs in March surprised economic forecasters, who had not expected such a severe contraction. But it's safe to say that it did not surprise most Americans. Just days before the report, a poll taken by this paper and CBS News showed that a stunning 81 percent of Americans believe the nation is on the wrong track. That's the highest percentage since the poll began asking about the country's direction in the early 1990s. Two in three respondents said they believed the economy was in a recession. 
 The March employment report leaves virtually no doubt they are right. The job contraction last month was on top of large losses in January and February. Not since the 1950s has job growth contracted for three months straight without recession. The question is whether lawmakers in Washington will catch up to where the people are in time to help in a meaningful way. 
 The worsening job market, for instance, could worsen the foreclosure crisis. To date, many foreclosures have occurred because mortgages were made to people who had no ability to repay over time. Poorly underwritten, such loans are now being foreclosed in large numbers, even for borrowers who have not experienced job loss or other adverse financial events, like illness or divorce. Now, on top of junk loans that are headed for default, more people will find themselves strapped because they are out of work.
 Even for those who escape layoffs, a deteriorating labor market (unemployment spiked from 4.8 percent in February to 5.1 percent in March) means slower wage growth. When new inflation data is released next week, March is expected to become the sixth month in a row in which wage growth has not outpaced inflation. The likely result is more defaults by people who otherwise would have been able to keep paying their mortgages. 
 Yet Congress is just now getting around to responding to the foreclosure crisis, doing things that would have been too modest even months ago, and are now clearly not up to the scale of the problem. In the relief package debated by the Senate this week and expected to pass next week, lawmakers bowed to the mortgage industry. They ditched what would have been the bill's most powerful measure -- allowing bankrupt homeowners to have their mortgages modified under court protection. The remaining features in the package are smaller bore -- $10 billion in tax-exempt bonds to help local housing agencies refinance subprime loans, $4 billion for local governments to buy foreclosed properties and $100 million to expand counseling for homeowners at risk. 
 Rising unemployment will worsen all of the expected problems of a downturn -- from waning consumer spending, to foreclosures, to rising demand for government-paid health care, food stamps and unemployment benefits. Congress has all the data it needs to quit dithering and take bold action. Restoring the bankruptcy reform to the relief package as it moves through Congress would be a good place to start.

HEADLINE: Soaring Gold Prices Lure New Breed of Diggers

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: COLFAX, Calif. 

 BODY:
On a recent Saturday afternoon, in the freezing shallows of the American River, Gene Zuspan looked into a pile of wet sand and swore he saw something glint. 
 ''You see that right there?'' he said, pointing at something shiny -- and tiny -- in the black sediment. ''That's gold.''
 Whether it was true gold or just fool's was not clear. But what is certain is that 160 years after a flake of gold found not far from here incited a frenzied stampede to the Sierra Nevada foothills, a new gold rush is on.
 Driven by record high prices and a suburban thirst for new outdoor activities, tens of thousands of '08ers are taking to historically rich streams and hills all across the West in search of nuggets, flecks and -- more often than not -- specks of gold. 
 ''Anywhere gold has been found in the past,'' said Corey Rudolph, the field operations director for the Gold Prospectors Association of America. ''That's where they're going again.'' 
 Mr. Rudolph said his membership had grown to more than 45,000 -- up nearly 40 percent from a few years ago -- including diggers from previously gold-crazed states like Arizona, Colorado and California. In Alaska, tales of bigger nuggets -- one to three ounces, sometimes larger -- are drawing newcomers to the Yukon River and its tributaries in search of overnight riches. 
 Mining shops say they cannot keep equipment on the shelves. ''We had a lady in here on crutches, not a young lady either, saying, 'I want to buy this $3,200 metal detector and a $1,000 power sluice,' '' said Steve Herschbach, an owner of Alaska Mining and Diving, a supply shop in Anchorage. ''We tried to talk her down a bit, but she was dead set.''
 Not all the action is in the water. Some prospectors have taken to scouring ore dumps-- discarded piles of rock left by old-time miners -- with high-tech metal detectors hoping to divine what previous generations missed. In Arizona, clubs head for dry creeks, sifting through the dirt where gold might have washed down in past floods. 
 Perhaps nowhere is the rush more spirited than in California, home of the Sierra's famed Mother Lode, where the discovery of gold in 1848 caused a national migration. Like their forebears, many of today's prospectors have little more than a pan, a shovel and a dream. 
 Unlike the original forty-niners, though, some of today's caravans involve minivans, wetsuits and cellphones. And while many current prospectors say they hold out hopes of big scores, their clubs also act as social networks, where members exchange stories of the joys of sluicing and the unexplainable, often unattainable, thrill of shouting ''Eureka!'' at the sight of a nugget. 
 ''There's nothing like finding gold,'' said Pat Putnam, 57, who found a nickel-size chunk of ore a few years back. ''It's just an unbelievable feeling. Because you know you're the first person to ever lay eyes on that.''
 Long the province of crusty hobbyists and bored retirees, prospecting has also recently drawn some younger converts, partly from their exposure to two prospecting shows on the Outdoor Channel.
 Not everyone, of course, is just in it for the fresh air. Rob Goreham, a miner and equipment salesman from Columbia, Calif., in the heart of the Mother Lode, says hundreds of full-time prospectors in California make a living at the often bone-chilling profession. How much of a living?
 ''No one's going to tell you that,'' said Mr. Goreham, like the veteran gold man he is. ''We do O.K., how about that?''
 The work is often backbreaking -- and mind-numbing -- but many call it a type of therapy. 
 Mr. Zuspan, the American River prospector who is otherwise a truck driver, said he had joined the Delta Gold Diggers, in Stockton, Calif., in part to get over a divorce and his six-day workweek.
 Frank Hansen said he used the club's outings to get over memories of working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. ''I could go out to a mountain and do this, and as soon as I saw a little bit of that color in the pan, I could ignore the job, and that stress would dissolve,'' Mr. Hansen said. 
 Others fear a different type of stress. Past gold rushes caused hills to be denuded and rivers polluted, and the new rush has led to fears of a repeat. In 2007, the California Department of Fish and Game issued nearly 3,000 permits for dredging, even as it began to look into whether dredging was causing ''adverse environmental effects'' or harm to fish. A coalition of sport and tribal fishermen asked Monday for a two-year moratorium on dredging till the environmental impact could be determined.
 The one gold-digging law that hasn't changed over the years is this: If you want to make money during a gold rush, don't mine the hills. Mine the miners. 
 The New 49ers Prospecting Club, in Happy Camp, Calif., charges members $2,500 each for lifetime access to claims on several rivers and tributaries in northernmost California. Dave McCracken, the club's owner, says he expects gold-prospecting to bring about $5 million this summer into Siskiyou County, an economically depressed region. 
 Jerry Keene, 73, the chief executive of Keene Engineering, a leading manufacturer of mining equipment, said, ''Anything connected with gold, we're just about out of.''
 Last month the company posted an apology on its Web site, saying a backload of orders had simply overwhelmed the staff. 
 Mr. Keene likened the current rush to the last time gold prices spiked this high, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the spot price for an ounce hit $850. The current price is $913, after topping $1,000 last month. 
 All of which can make some new prospectors a little wild-eyed. ''Gold fever is a real thing, you know,'' said Gary Hawley of the Gold Prospectors of the Rockies, a 140-member club in Denver. ''They'll go out with a pan and get some speck, and some people will get crazed by it. They'll go from pan to sluice box to dredge. Before you know it, you can end up with $7,000, $8,000 worth of equipment and still no gold.'' 
 Wes Reese, 35, a stay-at-home dad who was panning recently with the Delta Diggers on the American, had no illusions of riches, but a big smile on his face. 
 ''You get to go out and play in the dirt and play in the water,'' he said. ''What else could you want?''

HEADLINE: Within Powerful Union, Debate Over Mission Intensifies

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Politicians often pay unusual deference to Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, because he heads the nation's fastest-growing, most politically potent union.
 But within some segments of labor, Mr. Stern has been accused of betrayal, of cutting ''sweetheart deals'' with employers, deals that Mr. Stern says make it easier to unionize more workers.
 Now Mr. Stern is going on the offensive, saying his labor critics often selfishly safeguard the interests of their unions' members while ignoring the concerns of the 88 percent of workers who do not belong to unions. 
 Just as it was wrong for many unions to exclude blacks, Hispanics and women in decades past, he said, it is wrong for unions not to do their utmost to unionize the nation's nonunion workers.
 Mr. Stern is speaking out in preparation for what is expected to be a tumultuous union convention next month in Puerto Rico.
 His critics plan to introduce amendments to weaken his authority, accusing him of selling out workers by negotiating back-room deals that sacrificed some gains for current union members, like health coverage for retirees.
 Mr. Stern is trying to frame his argument by saying that labor has two stark choices: ''Just Us'' unionism or ''Justice for All'' unionism. 
 ''Just Us ignores the fundamental mission of the union movement -- to build a more just and humane society for all working people, not just a small exclusive club,'' Mr. Stern said. ''At a time when seven out of eight workers have no union, 11 out of 12 in the private sector, to be a voice just for the few who do is to abdicate our founding mission.'' 
 Anticipating that the next president will be a Democrat who will make it easier for unions to organize nonunion workers, Mr. Stern said, ''I'm throwing down the gauntlet at this moment of opportunity because we have to push each other and say to the whole labor movement, 'We all need to think about how do we get bigger to help the tens of millions of workers without unions.' ''
 Last week, the service employees filed a report with the Labor Department saying it had 1.65 million members and represented another 207,000 workers who paid the equivalent of union dues.
 Mr. Stern's leading critic, Sal Rosselli, president of the union's giant health care local in California, accused Mr. Stern of making deals that were far too friendly to businesses. 
 ''He's pushing for the corporatization of the S.E.I.U.,'' Mr. Rosselli said. ''He's hijacking worker power to centralize it in D.C. What he's saying is rhetoric; it's not real.'' 
 Mr. Stern and other leaders of the service employees union have often pushed to have a nationwide bargaining team handle negotiations with large companies, a move that officials with the union's locals sometimes say shortchanges local members. That nationwide bargaining team often puts more emphasis on striking deals that pave the way to organize more nonunion workers than rank-and-file members do. 
 ''Andy is consumed with the idea of growth,'' said Jerome Brown, the retired president of the union's health care local in Connecticut. ''He's decided that the traditional way to organize and represent workers doesn't allow fast enough growth. He is experimenting with agreements with employers that allow workers to organize more easily. That's a great idea, but the question is, What do you give up to get those agreements?''
 Mr. Stern said one message he would take to his union's convention -- and to all of organized labor -- was that the bargaining power of union members would be undermined unless they did more to organize workers. 
 He pointed to the nation's truck drivers, saying that their after-inflation wages slipped when the percentage of drivers in unions slid from 60 percent in 1975 to less than 25 percent three decades later.
 ''It simply is not possible for current members to pull up the ladder, barricade themselves in a fortress and continue to enjoy relatively high pay and benefits,'' Mr. Stern said, while the majority of workers are nonunion and earn less.

HEADLINE: Feeling The Urge To Flee The Dollar

BYLINE: By JANE BIRNBAUM

 BODY:
Interest rates on savings accounts are falling. The dollar is weak. And the stock market is up one day and down the next. It is no wonder that even normally timid investors are hearing the siren song of foreign currencies. 
 The question is whether they should heed it.
 While experts have different opinions about investing in foreign currencies, they all agree that such investments are not for the faint of heart. 
 ''In today's uncertain economy, it is understandable that people may turn to foreign currencies in search of profit and a sense of control over their money,'' Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics and international business at New York University, wrote in an e-mail message. ''However, they may not realize it is a form of speculation, not investment, which may well end with lack of control and significant loss.''
 Experts like Peter Morici, an economist and a University of Maryland business professor, and Vivian Lewis, editor of the Global Investing newsletter, warn most small investors to steer clear of investing directly in the currency markets, which can rapidly move against them. It is a tricky arena, they say, dominated by fast-moving events and seasoned global players trading more than $1 trillion daily. 
 Information about foreign currency -- and ways to purchase it online through certificates of deposit and exchange-traded funds and notes -- has never been more available. That can raise expectations, says Paul Karger, a managing partner of Twin Focus Capital Partners, a money management firm in Boston.
 Mr. Karger said he remembered an e-mail message from a high-net-worth client wanting to know why his cash was not in three-month Icelandic krona CDs paying over 11 percent interest.
 ''I wrote back that it looked tempting, but it's more than a yield story,'' Mr. Karger recalled. ''People could start dumping the krona, and when he converted his CD back into dollars, he could wind up losing money.'' 
 In late March, Iceland's central bank, facing a credit crisis, raised interest rates to 15 percent to dissuade investors from selling the krona -- precisely the situation Mr. Karger was concerned about.
 Still, some experts think there is a place for foreign currencies in an average investor's portfolio. Adrian Day, chief executive of Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis, Md., argued that investing in foreign currency can be part of a broader strategy to defend against what he views as a fundamentally weak dollar. Investors can purchase select foreign stocks and bonds, he said. They can buy stock in American companies with strong global sales. And they can hold some foreign currency. 
 ''It should be seen not as a short-term investment that will make you rich, but as long-term insurance to hedge a weak dollar,'' Mr. Day said. 
 The best time to buy foreign currency is when traders and investors are buying the dollar, in so-called dollar rallies, which may last up to six weeks, he added. That is when investors get the most foreign currency for their dollar. 
 ''Novice buyers must consider what they are doing and their time frame,'' Mr. Day said. ''The danger is you freak out and sell after your first decline. You need to know why you are buying, then hold your position.''
 The cost of investing in foreign currencies is higher than that of buying a regular CD or exchange-traded fund. Investors in foreign currency CDs pay to convert back into dollars, as well as penalties for unwinding their positions early. Investors in currency exchange-traded funds pay higher expense ratios than most exchange-traded fund investors.
 Sophisticated traders with a lot of money sometimes buy foreign currency with a higher interest rate and simultaneously go into the futures market to sell it forward -- meaning they contract to sell the same amount of currency at a specific price at a later date. In the parlance of such trading, that is a ''single play.'' The traders are insulated from a loss if the exchange rate moves against them, though they still reap the interest, said Peter Orr, a retired bond dealer living in Panama and Salt Lake City. 
 A ''double play'' -- also known as an ''open'' or ''naked'' trade -- is not hedged, which makes it both riskier and potentially more lucrative. ''Here you're profiting from the foreign currency's higher interest rate plus the exchange rate as it appreciates against the dollar,'' Mr. Orr explained in an e-mail message. But success depends upon the foreign currency's continued strength. 
 About two years ago, Mr. Orr, an Australian who keeps a close watch on his native country's economy, decided that going naked in the Australian dollar was a ''no-brainer,'' he wrote. ''My strategy was the Aussie dollar would appreciate toward par with the United States dollar, so I would be making 6 percent on the Australian one-year treasury bills, plus a huge appreciation -- from 72 U.S. cents on the Aussie dollar to, say, 90 cents.'' 
 Unfortunately, Mr. Orr said, he could not find a bank in Panama that would sell him Australian dollars. Today, each one is worth about 94 United States cents, and most Australian one-year treasuries pay 6.25 percent, he wrote.
 Mr. Orr advised currency buyers to research foreign nations and their credit risks, determine at the start their own risk-reward ratio and tolerance to volatility, and have exit strategies, while watching their positions constantly.
 Walt McManus, a real estate investor and former banker based in Towson, Md., said investing in foreign currency requires research and passion. ''If you're just trying to make money,'' he said, ''it won't work because without the passion, you won't understand the psychology of foreign currencies.'' 
 Five years ago, Mr. McManus's first purchases -- EverBank CDs in New Zealand, Canadian and Australian dollars -- represented more than 30 percent of his total invested assets. He recently sold his euro and yen CDs, and just rolled over Norwegian krone, Swedish krona and Swiss franc CDs. 
 In Fort Worth, Dr. Jim Nickerson has managed his own money since retiring from dentistry and oral surgery in 1986. After Rydex introduced its yen exchange-traded fund last year, Dr. Nickerson started buying shares that accounted for about 10 percent of his total invested assets of about $1 million.
 The shares began rising steadily in July. As the dollar bottomed on March 17, they peaked. 
 The next day, they declined sharply. ''I saw a significant reversal of direction, and I didn't want to give up those profits,'' said Dr. Nickerson, who during market hours had been checking the shares' real-time quotes every 15 minutes since buying them. ''I pulled the trigger and took an $18,750 profit.'' 
 Creative thinking and being in the right place at the right time helped Julie Moeller make a triple play on foreign currency and real estate. 
 After a divorce in 2000, Ms. Moeller used the proceeds from her settlement to buy and rent out real estate in London, where she had been raising her three children. Then she moved home to the Detroit area. 
 ''I knew the pound would be appreciating against the dollar, and it would be easier if I had money in pounds and spent it in dollars,'' she explained. 
 Last year, when Ms. Moeller calculated that London real estate, as well as appreciation between the pound and the dollar, had reached historic highs, she sold a home she had bought for the equivalent of $1.6 million. ''Let's not be greedy,'' she recalled thinking. The house fetched almost $7.7 million. 
 While Ms. Moeller's investments are more diversified today, she remains enthusiastic about foreign currency. Having never traded it, she experimented early this year, buying $20,000 worth of shares in the Rydex yen exchange-traded fund. She held them almost two months, then sold for a gain of about $1,200.
 Ms. Moeller understood the risk. ''I was willing to lose the $20,000,'' she said. 
 According to Mr. Orr, foreign currency is extremely risky now in the midst of a ''giant credit squeeze'' and derivative problems that are sending many investors scurrying for the safety of Treasury notes. ''My experience tells me that one needs to slow down now, and keep the powder dry,'' he wrote. 
 Even those sternly warning average investors away from foreign currency do make exceptions. When told of a Chinese yuan exchange-traded fund planned by WisdomTree, Richard K. Lyons, a former professor of finance at the University of California, Berkeley, and now chief learning officer at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, called it ''an interesting idea.'' 
 Thinking an average investor can ''do better than a spot trader at any large bank'' is ''basically ridiculous,'' he said. ''But the interesting thing about the yuan-dollar exchange is China's central bank controls the yuan, and they're allowing it to appreciate by decree, rather than by market forces.''

HEADLINE: At the Port, Peril Is Around Every Corner

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
What does the port of Los Angeles have in common with the storm-tossed Bering Sea and the ice-covered lakes of the Northwest Territories? According to Original Productions -- the makers of ''Deadliest Catch,'' ''Ice Road Truckers'' and now ''America's Port,'' an eight-part series beginning Sunday on the National Geographic Channel -- it's ever-present danger. 
 At first glance the balmy industrial expanse on San Pedro Bay doesn't look so terrifying. And trying to apply the template of ''Deadliest Catch'' and ''Ice Road Truckers,'' which are tightly focused on small subcultures, to the sprawling city within a city that makes up the port seems unwise to begin with. Nevertheless ''America's Port'' is out to prove that there is peril around every corner, or at least in front of every camera. It trumpets the risk of every story line and nearly every action we see. 
 Longshoremen can be crushed by 40-ton shipping containers. Port pilots can fall into the sea while trying to climb aboard moving ships. An engine malfunction puts two huge container ships perilously close together; if they collide near the port entrance, it will cripple the nation's economy. Divers and canine units search for terrorist bombs. 
 Even the offices aren't safe. The port's executive director, Geraldine Knatz, who looks and talks like your favorite spinster aunt, cheerfully admits that she'll probably lose her job if she can't push through a plan to reduce pollution.
 Amid the frenetic editing, time-lapse photography and voice-of-doom narration that are de rigueur for this sort of show, one story line proceeds slowly, in sunstruck scenes at the port's peaceful marina. But it's no respite: it follows a police diving unit methodically searching the harbor for a missing person.
 It's not hard to understand why Americans, living the most comfortable lives this earth has ever afforded to nonroyalty, might fetishize danger and risk. The real problem with the first few episodes of ''America's Port'' is that unlike ''Deadliest Catch,'' where those whipsawing cables occasionally inflict injury, there's no payoff. 
 The containers come in, the containers go out, and everyone goes home in one piece. Ms. Knatz's pollution proposal is unanimously approved. These producers ought to know that we don't want to say ''Whew!'' all the time; sometimes we want to say ''Ouch!''

HEADLINE: Catholic School Teachers Strike Over Health Care and Plan Another Walkout

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON; C.J. Hughes and Mathew R. Warren contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Catholic social ideals and harsh financial truths are colliding at an inopportune time for the Archdiocese of New York.
 Less than two weeks before the city's first papal visit since 1995, the archdiocese is engaged in an acrimonious battle with teachers at its 277 schools, which, despite cutbacks and closings over the last few years, educate about 107,000 students. 
 On Friday, nearly 200 teachers at 10 Catholic schools went on strike for at least one day, saying that the archdiocese has hindered their efforts to obtain a new health insurance plan. And another Catholic teachers' union has planned a strike, including picketing at papal events, to coincide with Pope Benedict XVI's visit to New York April 18 to 20.
 This latest tussle underscores the larger financial crisis Catholic schools have faced nationwide, with widespread school closings in urban areas and a nearly 15 percent decline in enrollment since 2000. 
 ''There are principles that come out of Catholic social teaching about the rights of workers and the dignity of work that the Catholic Church preaches,'' said the Rev. Joseph M. O'Keefe, dean of the Lynch School of Education at Boston College. ''How do you balance that with the financial problems schools face? It's a tough balancing act.''
 In New York, the problems have manifested themselves in the form of more than a dozen Catholic school closings over the past four years, and six more will close at the end of this school year. The church had been pumping as much as half a million dollars a year into some of those schools, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese.
 Through the 1960s, Catholic schools had essentially free faculty, in the form of nuns and priests, Father O'Keefe said, but they have been supplanted by lay people as the ranks of the clergy have shrunk. In New York, the teachers make on average about $45,000, nearly $25,000 less than their public school counterparts, and have been more militant in their dealings with their employer. While public school teachers have not struck since 1975, one of the Catholic school unions, the Lay Faculty Association, walked out for a month in 2001, and also staged a one-day sickout in January.
 The other union, the Federation of Catholic Teachers, which represents about 3,000 teachers, is the one that walked out Friday at 10 schools in Manhattan, Staten Island, the Bronx and Westchester County. (The archdiocese also covers six other counties north of New York City, but not Brooklyn, Queens or Long Island.)
 The union's contract expired Aug. 31, and the archdiocese made a final offer on a new contract in November.
 The major sticking points in both unions' contract disputes have been an increased premium for health insurance and the unions' desire for bigger pay raises and a better pension plan. The archdiocese has vowed not to budge.
 ''We know we've made a good offer,'' Mr. Zwilling said. ''We know the teachers should accept this offer. We're very comfortable with what we've done and the offer we've made.''
 Mary-Ann Perry, of the Federation of Catholic Teachers, said the union called Friday's strike at selected schools to pressure the archdiocese to hand over records of health insurance claims that the union needs to obtain a new plan. The strike could continue Monday if the archdiocese does not produce the documents, she said. ''The cost of health care makes it difficult for people to make ends meet,'' Ms. Perry said. 
 But Mr. Zwilling said that the archdiocese had already handed over stack of documents about the health plan that stood about a foot high, and that it was preparing more documents the union had requested.
 ''They're just using this tactic to try and waste time, I think, rather than coming to an agreement,'' he said. ''The only thing they've done is cost themselves a day's pay.''
 A strike during the pope's visit, planned by the Lay Faculty Association, which represents about 400 teachers in 10 schools, could be more damaging to the archdiocese. Henry Kielkucki, the association's business manager, said the purpose of the strike would not be to disrupt the visit, but to get the attention of the many high-ranking church officials who will be in town.
 ''We see an opportunity here, all these people coming into New York to say to Egan, 'What are you doing?' '' Mr. Kielkucki said, referring to the head of the archdiocese, Cardinal Edward M. Egan. ''They're going to face an embarrassment I don't think they've ever faced before.''
 But Mr. Kielkucki acknowledged that the plan could backfire, because some people see it as distasteful for the teachers' union to use a spiritual event to gain traction. The union is meeting with the archdiocese on Thursday, but Mr. Kielkucki said he was not optimistic.
 Ms. Perry, of the Federation of Catholic Teachers, said that her union had also not ruled out striking during the pope's visit.
 On Friday, the 10 schools stayed open but at least two closed early. At Our Lady Queen of Angels, an elementary and middle school in East Harlem, some students watched videos or played games, while others took scheduled tests.
 If the strikes continue, the schools have contingency plans that include having administrators teach classes or hiring substitute teachers. While students and parents seemed eager for things to return to normal at three area schools, most showed support for the teachers' cause.
 ''It just brings me to tears; I love the teachers here,'' said Sheila Estep, 39, who has two sons at Our Lady Queen of Angels. ''I have to support them as they support me and my children.''
 Alicia Cox, 36, who has three children at the school, said: ''They're excellent teachers and this is an excellent school,'' but also worried whether increasing teachers' pay would cause an increase in tuition, which starts at $2,800 a year there. ''My focus is how are the parents going to be affected by this.''
 A number of students and teachers at Cathedral High School, a girls' school on East 56th Street where teachers are represented by the Lay Faculty Association, said that striking during the pope's visit would be justified as a way to inform him about the issues.
 ''If you're going to do it, you might as well do it big,'' said Tiffany Viruet, 17, a senior from East Harlem, outside the school's front doors as she handed a poetry assignment to Vincent Doyle, 53, her English teacher.
 ''Pope Benedict said economic injustice is a sin of the Catholic Church,'' said Mr. Doyle, a 24-year employee of the school. ''And the archdiocese isn't living up.''

HEADLINE: A Seminary Where a Bicentennial Looks Forward

BYLINE: By RICHARD HIGGINS

DATELINE: NEWTON, Mass. 

 BODY:
At the Andover Newton Theological School here, banquets, exhibitions and church services proclaim the bicentennial this year of the school's founding as the Andover Theological Seminary.
 The Rev. Nick Carter, its president, celebrates the seminary's history proudly, but he is more engaged by how the school will adapt to the deep ferment in American religion and survive until the 250th anniversary and beyond.
 Mr. Carter's question is shared by scores of other smaller and midsize independent Protestant seminaries that have seen their financial support from denominations wither, their costs increase, and their assumptions about church life and the career of ministry tested by growing fragmentation and change in the pews. 
 ''The church is changing,'' Mr. Carter said. ''Our concepts of religious leadership, mission, denomination and the status of ministry are being redefined. Other than the Gospel itself, most of the assumptions that our programs of study are based on are being swept away.''
 Mr. Carter said he and other seminary presidents had been discussing this challenge.
 ''The question we're asking each other,'' he said, ''is, 'What insights and skills are essential for the practice of transformative ministry in the 21st century, and how do we teach it?' ''
 Never far behind is the question of their survival as freestanding institutions. 
 The nation has 165 seminaries, but 39 percent of seminary students attend just 20 of them. The 20 large institutions, all but two evangelical Christian, raise substantial money, have big endowments or receive moderate to high denominational support -- or do all three.
 In addition, nonsectarian theological and divinity schools that exist within a university also tend to be in good shape. 
 But a majority of Protestant seminaries are smaller independents, and many, including Andover Newton, lack adequate endowments. The mainline churches that parented the older seminaries have sharply cut financial support. 
 A result, said Daniel O. Aleshire, executive director of the National Association of Theological Schools, is that around 30 seminaries are in financial stress. In the future, Mr. Aleshire said, ''There may be just two kinds of seminaries, those with substantial endowments or effective annual giving and the nonexistent.''
 While Andover Newton is not on the brink, Mr. Carter said, it and other seminaries needed to think about sharing costs and pooling resources. The Bangor Theological Seminary in Maine has begun to outsource information technology work here. 
 ''All of us,'' Mr. Carter said, ''have to find news ways to relate to and collaborate with each other as institutions or face the prospect that some will go out of business.''
 Driven by economics and a desire for innovation, Andover Newton shares its campus with Hebrew College, a rabbinic school. The arrangement saves on fixed costs, Mr. Carter said, and the interfaith discussions it has created has attracted new types of students, grants and donations. Other seminaries are similarly combining resources, Mr. Aleshire said.
 Mr. Carter's question about the mission of theological education is sharpened here by the bicentennial. The nation's first full-time graduate theological school, the Andover Theological Seminary was started by orthodox Calvinists who fled Harvard after it embraced Unitarianism. The school opened in 1808 at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.
 Until then, ministerial training had been undergraduate, capped by parlor study under a pastor. Andover started three years' graduate study of four subjects under a residential faculty: the Bible, church history, doctrinal theology and the practical arts of ministry. 
 That model became the gold standard, although Andover Newton has long since changed it. Andover Seminary, a bastion of Christian evangelical and missionary zeal, moved here in 1931 to an early Baptist seminary campus, merging in 1965. 
 Today, Andover Newton maintains ties to the United Church of Christ and the American Baptist churches and has 380 students from 35 denominations. One-fourth are Unitarian Universalists.
 Tuitions covers 40 percent of the $7 million annual budget. The rest is from fund-raising, the endowment and other sources, with a trickle coming from the denominations, Mr. Carter said. 
 ''We can't turn out pastors for a church that no longer exists,'' said Mr. Carter, an American Baptist minister. ''Pastors have to be grounded in their own faith yet also have the 'border crossing' skills to be leaders in today's religious landscape. Our survival depends on this more than anything.''
 He pointed out that when new ministers took their pulpits, ''perhaps half the people they see in the pews didn't grow up in that faith tradition.'' 
 Mr. Carter's call to reinvent seminaries is hardly new. 
 Theological education is adapting to declining denominational loyalty, changing ministries and a greater diversity of students, monitors of the field say.
 David Kelsey, a professor of theology at the Yale Divinity School, said, ''I think Mr. Carter is right about the inadequacy of what seminarians learn to the real ground-level cultural, social, economic diversity, even pluralism of belief, in the congregations they serve.''
 Mr. Carter said seminaries might learn from business, adding: ''Too many of us have long lists of problems, then put our best resources to work solving them. But if we would apply those same resources to our assets, our strengths, we would become stronger and in the long run be more able to solve our problems.''

HEADLINE: 80,000 Jobs Lost; Democrats Urge New Aid Package

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE; David Herszenhorn contributed reporting from Washington, Michael Grynbaum from New York, Carolyn Marshall from San Francisco and Crystal Yednak from Chicago.

 BODY:
The nation's employers eliminated tens of thousands of jobs for the third month in a row, the government reported Friday, and top Democrats immediately called for new measures to help suffering American workers.
 After the early-morning report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that 80,000 jobs had disappeared in March, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said she would propose a second economic stimulus package. Hers would supplement the $150 billion in tax rebates scheduled to be mailed to millions of Americans beginning next month.
 The presidential candidates, already divided over how to alleviate the mortgage and housing crisis, divided again over how to generate jobs and help the unemployed. 
 In separate statements Friday morning, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama supported another stimulus package and an extension of unemployment benefits, among other measures. In contrast, John McCain, acknowledging that ''many Americans are hurting,'' said that lower taxes and less regulation would generate jobs.
 ''People have been focused on the housing crisis, and rightly so,'' said Andrew Stettner, a policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, ''but now the deterioration in the job market should be demanding much more attention from policy makers.''
 The job losses this year are roughly equal to those that disappeared in the early months of the last recession, in 2001. Recognizing that employment was weakening, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, testified on Wednesday that ''a recession is possible,'' but not necessarily upon us. 
 Wall Street took a dimmer view after Friday's report. ''These job numbers strengthen the case materially that we are in a recession,'' said Edward McKelvey, senior United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''They remove all but a sliver of doubt that the economy is contracting.'' 
 In March, the unemployment rate rose three-tenths of a percentage point, to 5.1 percent, its highest level since September 2005, after Hurricane Katrina. The majority were men and women searching unsuccessfully for jobs after a layoff or they were temporary workers unable to move to a next job, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. The job losses were widespread across industries and service companies. 
 Gina Gerhardt, 47, a mother of two in Chicago, lost her job in December as a project manager at a roofing company. ''There are so many applicants out there, that if employers found my resume among the hundreds they get, it would be a miracle,'' she said. Lately, she has resorted to food stamps, she said, to make ends meet.
 In response to the job losses, Ms. Pelosi said that Democrats would urge President Bush to work with them on a second bipartisan stimulus package that would bring relief from the income losses when jobs disappear. 
 ''We need to work together to restore consumer and market confidence, to assist millions of Americans threatened with the loss of their homes, and to help families meet the rising costs of necessities,'' Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. This would be in addition to legislation to provide relief for homeowners behind on their mortgages.
 Some Republicans, like Representative Roy Blunt, of Missouri, called for lower taxes, while Senator Olympia J. Snowe, whose home state of Maine has high unemployment, called for additional benefits for those who are unemployed.
 The unemployment figures will lend ammunition to Congressional Democrats as they press ahead next week with parallel proposals to offer aid to struggling homeowners as well as to inject money into the economy as Ms. Pelosi has proposed. 
 The March decline was the largest job loss since March 2003 when the economy was still shaking off the lingering effects of the 2001 recession. Since the start of the year, 232,000 jobs have disappeared, the bureau said yesterday. 
 More than once in the past, three consecutive months of job losses have marked the start of a recession. ''It is our view that we are already in one,'' said Drew Matus, a Lehman Brothers economist, offering a view widely held on Wall Street.
 Major stock indexes barely moved Friday, suggesting job losses had been anticipated. Many economists restated their forecast that the Federal Reserve's policy makers will drop their benchmark short-term interest rate when they meet on April 30 -- perhaps by as much as half a percentage point in an effort to lower the cost of credit and thus stimulate spending.
 The jobs picture had few bright spots. Only education and health care, hotels and restaurants registered noticeable gains in the private sector. Construction was the biggest loser, shedding 51,000 jobs as the slowdown in residential building spread to the commercial sector. 
 Manufacturing, which has been losing jobs for years, was particularly weak in March, shrinking by 48,000 jobs, in part because of a strike at a supplier of auto parts that resulted in cutbacks in auto vehicle production and layoffs.
 Unemployment rose in every sector of the work force, except among teenagers. Hourly wage gains slowed for production workers, who constitute 80 percent of the work force. The 5-cent rise last month brought the average wage to $17.86 an hour, an increase of 3.6 percent since the previous March, not enough to keep up with inflation.
 ''You can talk all you want about the importance of stock portfolios and the wealth embedded in your home,'' said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute, ''but when you get right down to it, most people depend on their paychecks.'' 
 Many forecasters argue that the economy will rebound by the fourth quarter, a view rejected by Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics.
 ''We are in for a much longer recession than Wall Street thinks,'' he said. ''This particular downturn is driven by a rare contraction in consumer spending, and that is starting to hurt a broader range of people than those hurt by the mortgage crisis.'' 
 Parul Vora, 28, who holds a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thought she was immune to unemployment -- until Yahoo laid her off recently as a researcher in San Francisco earning in the low six figures. 
 ''To me, the layoff was an introduction to the dark side of corporate life,'' Ms. Vora said. ''It was a reminder that at the end of the day, you are doing breakthrough research for a company that is making decisions about your life, and you have no control over those decisions.''

HEADLINE: White Guys Are Back

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
It was probably inevitable. The historic contest between a woman and an African-American for the presidential nomination is now all about white men.
 Not that the white male voters asked for this. They've been uncommitted, supporting Hillary in one contest and Barack in the next. But all that hemming and hawing has turned them into the deciding factor in the big upcoming primary in Pennsylvania. 
 Reporters are spread all over the state, searching for white men to interview. American Legion halls under siege! Both campaigns engage in extensive research, which reveals that white men are very concerned about the economy. Duh. 
 Courting them is extremely tricky. It's not like you can promise that under your presidency, more white men would be appointed to the Supreme Court. 
 The candidates' desperation to make contact is showing. Barack Obama goes bowling in Altoona -- with disastrous consequences. Hillary Clinton attempts to compare herself to Rocky Balboa, prompting many people to note that Rocky lost to a black guy. Obama, rather cruelly, points out that Rocky is a fictional character. Clinton, in turn, reveals that she owns her own bowling ball. 
 It's got to be irking women and blacks. This was supposed to be all about us! But in modern politics, the people who choose up sides are doomed to be taken for granted while the whole world goes running after the folks on the fence. That is why this fall the presidential campaign will be taking place in 13 states, and the would-be presidents will spend more time worrying about Iowa than New York and California combined.
 By October, some of you will have dedicated so many hours to discussing this election that close friends will cross the street to avoid having another conversation. Yet every once in a while you will note that the candidate you gave your heart to centuries ago is spending all his/her time in desperate pursuit of your next-door neighbor who is undecided, possibly because he can't remember which one is the Republican and which one is the Democrat.
 The candidates have already resigned themselves to wooing people with political attention deficit disorder. They know that if they embark on a 12-week tour of the nation to publicize their signature issue of dropout prevention, on the day it's over they will turn on the TV and see an undecided voter in sweat pants saying: ''I'm waiting to hear what they say about dropouts.'' Then they'll order up another passel of ads and go out to woo again. 
 But we digress. The question at hand is: What do white men want?
 Maybe not change -- sorry, Barack. Pennsylvania is a state where change has not been a friend to your average white male, particularly the aging working-class ones who are the candidates' prime target. Change left the state full of empty factories that towns keep desperately trying to make into condos or art museums. 
 Although there is nobody happier than a white guy when his daughter turns out to be a star in the Little League, change has taken away most of white men's favorite preserves, including sports. They long ago came to grips with the fact that they weren't going to be seeing many reflections of themselves on the basketball court anymore. (They have not, in my observation, become nearly as resigned to female sports announcers.) And it's hard to fashion an entire identity out of fantasy football and hockey.
 I once tried to make a list of specifically guy things that no woman was ever going to want to trespass upon. All I came up with were ''The Three Stooges'' and lawn care. This is not adequate material around which to construct a presidential campaign.
 As I said, the white guys did not ask for the honor of being the target demographic. They know it's a minefield. As Paul Vitello reported Friday in The Times, they couch every negative comment about Barack with a preface pointing out that this isn't about race. And I cannot tell you how many Obama men I have run into who begin every discussion by noting that Hillary is an excellent senator. 
 I still wonder if the white males have been maintaining their even-handedness through some kind of secret pact. Maybe the guys in Wisconsin agreed to vote for Obama if their brothers in Ohio would go for Clinton, and so on. They probably transmitted the signals with those drums they bought during the manhood epidemic in the '90s. But now all eyes are on Pennsylvania, and they can't keep their heads down any longer.
 Maybe Hillary's blunder about being under sniper fire in Bosnia was just an attempt to make contact with a group that feels somewhat under siege.

HEADLINE: A Town Under Fire Becomes a Symbol for Israel

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

DATELINE: SDEROT, Israel 

 BODY:
This long neglected immigrant town a mile from Gaza, pounded by Palestinian rockets for the past seven years, is taking on a new identity, edging into the center of Zionist consciousness as a symbol of the nation's unofficial motto: ''Never Again.'' 
 Like the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, Sderot is now a must-see stop for those who support Israel or are being urged to do so. Several groups have set up offices to arrange visits to a damaged home or a trauma center. Foreign diplomats have been bused here by the government; a United Nations officer says he has brought top officials here five times; Senator John McCain came last month; Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, residents say, cannot be far behind.
 Israelis and their supporters are lining up to volunteer. Money is pouring in for bomb shelters, social services and an Orthodox religious seminary.
 ''For years, the government and others thought of Sderot not as a national problem but a local one,'' Mayor Eli Moyal said, just before the ribbon-cutting for an elegant first aid and ambulance center built with money donated largely by American Jews. ''They now understand that if Sderot falls, Israel falls.'' 
 The sense that Sderot is actually Israel's front line in its battle for legitimacy and self-respect has gained real currency, just as in the Arab world the suffering of Gazans has taken on a special significance. For Israelis, the conviction of Sderot's importance began growing with the huge increase in rocket fire since the 2005 Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and after the 2006 war with Hezbollah, which sent thousands of rockets into northern Israel. 
 With both Hamas and Hezbollah gaining strength on Israel's borders and developing rockets with longer ranges, Sderot, its advocates say, is a bitter sample of what more prosperous and distant parts of Israel may face if the threat here is ignored. And to a growing number across the political spectrum, it has inspired a collective rescue operation.
 ''In Tel Aviv, you have great cafes, nice clothes and you live an illusion as if everything is all right,'' reflected Ilanit Swissa, a theater director and one of about a dozen liberal intellectuals setting up camp in Sderot who moved here a few months ago to work with high school actors. ''But it is not true. Here I feel like I am contributing something. We are at war and you feel it here.''
 Surrounded by orange groves and wheat fields, guarded above by a military blimp that sets off an alert with each rocket launched from Gaza, Sderot has been a tough place to live. There have been days when more than 50 rockets have landed in or near the town, bringing panic, destruction and occasionally death to a town of 20,000 that is heavily populated with Israeli minority groups -- Moroccans, refugees from Central Asia and Ethiopians. Panic is widespread. Businesses have closed. Three thousand residents have left.
 Residents have grown accustomed to -- though hardly comfortable with -- the constant sound of a townwide alert known as ''Code Red,'' produced when the blimp detects an incoming rocket. Once the alarm has gone off, there is 20 seconds to get to a shelter before the rocket hits. Given such a short warning, kindergartners are kept inside all day rather than risk their failing to move quickly. 
 Hundreds of rockets are on grim display in the courtyard of the police station. The town itself, while typical of many its size in Israel, is now pockmarked with rocket holes and shelters and has developed a fierce black humor about its predicament, with sculptures made of rockets in a number of places.
 A sense of pride in Sderot's gritty refusal to yield and an interest in finding ways to protect and enhance the town have spread rapidly. World WIZO, a Zionist women's group, found that Sderot campaigns elicit visceral support from donors.
 ''We printed T-shirts saying 'Sderot Needs You.' In one day, we raised $1 million,'' said Helena Glaser, the group's president, as she toured Sderot. 
 The other day, David W. Lentz of Livingston, N.J. was pounding the pavement here with fellow Israel advocates, looking for ways their community could help.
 That same afternoon, a busload of Jewish fund-raisers were inspecting new care centers they had sponsored, passing some of the dozens of bomb shelters, some of them donated by evangelical Christians; a rabbi was going over plans for a $5 million seminary, financed mostly from abroad.
 For people who live and work here, all the attention, especially from wealthy outsiders, can seem overwhelming. Several said they were unable to get anything done.
 ''It has gotten out of hand,'' said Dror Marsha, the director of the local volunteer center. ''It has become a trend -- a good trend -- but I can't handle it. We have 1,000 volunteers a month now.'' Two years ago, he said, the number was 200.
 Among the projects donated by evangelical groups are some of the nearly 80 small shelters and bus stops that double as shelters as well as a set of ''resilience centers'' to coordinate social services. Run by the Israel Trauma Coalition, a project of the UJA-Federation of New York, the resilience centers send social workers on house calls, provide training for single parents and offer workshops for the elderly and new immigrants.
 Apart from the donations and support from the outside, another big change in Sderot in the past year has been economic, and the surprising reason for that is the Israeli evacuation of Gaza. Until 2005, there was an industrial park just inside Gaza of companies jointly owned by Israelis and Palestinians. With the withdrawal, the companies relocated to Sderot and employed locals, bringing the city's unemployment rate from a crushing 20 percent in the late 1990s to a near national low of 3.5 percent, according to Shalom Halevy, a municipal spokesman.
 Still, 30 percent of Sderot's population show symptoms of stress, five times as many as in similar populations in Israel, according to studies carried out by Marc Gelkopf of Haifa University. Many families sleep in one room together for fear of missing an alarm.
 As much as Sderot is a symbol, it is also a kind of Rorschach test -- a screen onto which various political factions project their hopes and fears. For the right, it is evidence that only force will stop the rockets; for the left it is evidence that force is not the answer and that the rockets cannot be stopped without a new approach.
 One attempt at a new approach involves a group in Sderot that has started holding discussions with Palestinians in Gaza via speakerphone. The group, Another Voice, is urging a cease-fire. There is also a new blog, a discussion between a resident of Sderot and one of Gaza, both anonymous.
 But for Rabbi David Fendel, who has run a 500-student yeshiva here for years, the rockets are proof that withdrawing Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza was foolish. He has raised millions of dollars to build a new yeshiva. The point of his project is to make a statement to those who wish Israel ill.
 ''The Palestinians are trying to turn this into a ghost town,'' he said as he stepped through the construction site of his school. ''We're not going to let them. We're going to make it a dynamic center of Zionism, Torah and building.''
 The building here is a bit unusual -- the new yeshiva study hall will have 1,500 tons of concrete in its ceiling as protection against the crude homemade rockets known as Qassams and other rockets that assault the city on a nearly daily basis from Gaza. 
 Rabbi Fendel recognizes that there is plenty of work ahead. He is marrying off his eldest of seven children in the coming weeks. But even though his son and future daughter-in-law will live here at the yeshiva, the wedding will not be here because so many guests are afraid to come. 
 Avi Farhan, who was a settler in the Sinai before it was returned to Egypt and then in Gaza before the Israelis withdrew, said he agreed with Rabbi Fendel that the withdrawal was a mistake. Standing on a bluff near his new apartment, he can see what remains of his former Gaza settlement, now a staging ground for rocket fire.
 ''From my old house, they can now shell my new house,'' he said ruefully.

HEADLINE: Clinton Strategist Lobbied for Trade Pact She Opposes

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Steven Greenhouse contributed from New York.

DATELINE: MEMPHIS 

 BODY:
Mark Penn, the pollster and chief strategist for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign, apologized on Friday for meeting with Colombian officials to discuss a free-trade agreement that Mrs. Clinton opposes. 
 The Colombians hired Mr. Penn in his role as chief executive of Burson-Marsteller, one of the nation's leading public relations firms, to help secure passage of the trade pact. President Bush supports the trade deal; Mrs. Clinton has opposed it as unfavorable to American workers. Her campaign confirmed her opposition again on Friday after news of Mr. Penn's work on behalf of the pact was disclosed in an article in The Wall Street Journal.
 Mr. Penn and other Burson-Marsteller executives met with the Colombian ambassador to the United States, Carolina Barco Isakson, and other Colombian officials in Washington on Monday, an embassy spokeswoman said. 
 Clinton campaign officials confirmed the meeting and expressed disapproval.
 Mr. Penn, in a statement on Friday, said: ''The meeting was an error in judgment that will not be repeated, and I am sorry for it. The senator's well-known opposition to this trade deal is clear and was not discussed.''
 But leaders of two labor groups that have endorsed Senator Barack Obama, Mrs. Clinton's opponent for the Democratic nomination, urged Mrs. Clinton to fire Mr. Penn. The two groups are Change to Win, a federation of unions including the service employees, Teamsters and carpenters, and Unite Here, which represents apparel, hotel and restaurant workers. 
 Greg Tarpinian, executive director of Change to Win, said it was ''outrageous'' that Mr. Penn would do lobbying work for Colombia while advising Mrs. Clinton on trade and other matters. 
 Bruce S. Raynor, president of Unite Here, said, ''That Clinton's chief strategist would be working hand in hand with the government of Colombia and the Bush administration, while candidate Clinton says she opposes the agreement, is truly incredible, even by today's crazy standards.''
 Burson-Marsteller signed a one-year, $300,000 contract with Colombia to help it win passage of the trade deal and handle bilateral drug-trafficking issues, according to Justice Department documents cited by The Journal.
 Mr. Penn's continued association with Burson-Marsteller has caused heartburn for the campaign before. The firm represents the Countrywide Financial Corporation, the nation's largest home mortgage lender, an industry that Mrs. Clinton has criticized. It has also provided public relations advice to Blackwater Worldwide, the private security firm under investigation by numerous government agencies for the deaths of civilians in Iraq.
 Trade has been a touchy issue in the Democratic campaign. Mrs. Clinton's aides forcefully criticized Mr. Obama when it was learned that his senior economic adviser, Austan D. Goolsbee, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, met with Canadian officials in February to discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement and other issues. Although accounts of the meeting differ, some Canadian officials said that Mr. Goolsbee had assured them that Mr. Obama would not follow through on campaign promises to dump or renegotiate the treaty.
 Mrs. Clinton used the Nafta issue to her advantage in Ohio, where many blue-collar workers who have lost their jobs blame foreign competition. It is also a hot topic in Pennsylvania, where the Democratic primary is April 22.

HEADLINE: A Candidate Could Laugh at the Absurdity, if Only There Was Time

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
Running for president is a lesson in existential hopefulness. 
 Senator Barack Obama's bus rattles through the black-rock hills of rural Pennsylvania, a vertical and wooded land interrupted by a hard-tack town or city, and the sheer size of the state starts bearing down. The stately homes of Pittsburgh are far behind -- this feels like Appalachia. 
 The candidate completed a six-day tour of the state this week; polls showed him down double-digits at the start and a touch less at the end. But you watch the land roll by hour after hour and wonder how any candidate could ever reach even a small fraction of the voters needed to win the primary on April 22.
 ''This process,'' Mr. Obama confided to a friend, ''would be real interesting if we weren't in the middle of it.'' 
 The Penny and Prisons
 One night he found himself in Greensburg, a hilly city in western Pennsylvania, peering at a sea of hands at his 102nd (give or take two dozen) town-hall-style meeting. He pointed to a middle-aged man named Denny, who rose in the bleachers.
 I'm a Ph.D. in economics, Denny said by way of throat clearing, and I want to know your position on the penny.
 The penny? Mr. Obama tilted his head.
 And the dollar bill. Isn't it time to also retire that baby and go with the $2 bill?
 The $2 bill? Obama squinted at Denny, who has one more question: What is the candidate's position on island prisons for rapists and serial murderers?
 ''Well, that is a pretty wide-ranging set of proposals,'' Mr. Obama said. But as to the penny, he brightened: ''As long as we can find Abe Lincoln another place to land, I might consider that.''
 Denny sat down, content. 
 To take the long distance run down the presidential campaign trail is to embrace the absurdity of the enterprise. In Lancaster, Mr. Obama, talked to a woman in tears because disability had left her impoverished, then fielded a question from an impatient fellow convinced that the secret world government was about to impose the Amero, a joint American-Mexican-Canadian currency. Mr. Obama explained that he could not do anything about the Amero because, alas, it did not exist.
 At times, the candidate can feel himself soaking in a bath of lunacy. ''You're going to slip up,'' Mr. Obama told one crowd in what amounted to a temporary-insanity plea for himself and his rival, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. ''You know you're going to say something goofy.''
 Watching Calories Go By
 Mr. Obama has not, however, acquired the campaigner's cast-iron digestive system. He is an abstemious sort, religious about early-morning workouts. 
 So on a misty Monday, he wandered into Wilbur Chocolate, in Lititz, more in search of cameras than a lode of the sweet stuff.
 The manager extended a jarful of chocolate morsels. Mr. Obama ate one and opined, ''Quite tasty.'' Eat another, she commanded. Mr. Obama demurred. The manager stared him in the eye and said, ''Oh, now you don't worry about calories in a chocolate factory.'' 
 The candidate smiled weakly.
 Later he stepped into the Marvel Ranch Diner, which serves up the Marvel Mess, a sandwich of eggs, potatoes, onions, American cheese and green peppers. Mr. Obama sidestepped that, but came face to face with the owner, Cheryl Burton, who offered a plate of chocolate cake with white frosting. He stared. 
 ''Oh, man, that's too decadent for me,'' he said.
 He spun around to find a beaming waitress offering him a plastic container. He sighed and opened it: a burger oozing fat, cheese fries and a mound of brown onion rings. He shrugged, then tossed a ring back. 
 Score one for cholesterol lovers.
 Service and Sacrifice
 The pivot comes fast. One minute you are talking about an imaginary currency, and the next you hear life rubbed raw. In Lancaster, Linda Hassel rises, hesitant and pained. Her son is an Army lieutenant. What can you say to mothers and fathers who fear that their sons and daughters have died in vain? 
 Mr. Obama stood silent before answering. He said that he wore a yellow wristband given to him by a woman in Green Bay, Wis., whose son had died in Iraq. He spoke of crying with her and recognizing the futility of offering comfort. ''I meet parents all the time who have lost sons and daughters, but their service to our country is never in vain,'' he said. ''They have performed magnificently. Our military has acquitted itself with all the honor you could expect. That's never a waste.''
 ''Getting rid of Saddam Hussein,'' he continued, ''that is an accomplishment; trying to reduce and contain violence, that is an accomplishment.'' 
 He stood perched on the edge of the riser. ''The failure is on the part of the civilian leadership who did not think through this war and its consequences.'' 
 We want to honor that service going forward, he said; we want to care for maimed veterans and those who remain haunted by war. We will end the countless tours of duty, he said. 
 ''We revere your sacrifice,'' he said to Mrs. Hassel. ''I am going to make sure that we as a nation are as great as those who sacrifice for us.''
 The audience clapped softly, and Mrs. Hassel nodded and thanked him. Mr. Obama turned and stared at the floor before taking another question.
 A Gutter Ball and a Laugh
 The mood is lighter in Altoona. Mr. Obama and Senator Bob Casey, who has chaperoned him around Pennsylvania, rolled into Pleasant Valley Lanes. 
 ''I just want to point out that the last time I bowled was 30 years ago, when I was 16,'' Mr. Obama says to no one in particular.
 Whatever. Roxanne Hart, 43 and from Altoona, asks if he wants to bowl. Mr. Obama and Mr. Casey shed dress shoes for bowling shoes -- blue and white, size 13 1/2 for Mr. Obama -- and enter their names into the overhead monitor. BAR and BOB against ROX.
 Mr. Obama picks up a ball, cues up confidently and sends it into the gutter. ''We're just warming up,'' he assured himself, maybe. Rox hit spare upon spare; Mr. Obama knocked a few pins here and there and announced his goal was to beat Mr. Casey. ''I can't beat Roxanne,'' he said.
 ''Let me tell you something,'' Mr. Obama said to the crowd. ''My economic plan is better than my bowling.'' A man at the next lane called out, ''It has to be.'' 
 Mr. Obama laughed and gave him a hug.
 In the seventh frame, Mr. Obama scored a spare. ''Yes, I can!'' he chanted after some admirers started it. ''Yes, I can!''
 As to bowling? No, he really can't.

HIGHER PRICES FOR COAL Shares of Massey Energy soared more than 18 percent Friday after the coal mine operator announced that it expects to sell coal for far higher prices than it expected this year. Massey had told investors that it expected prices ranging from $54 to $56 a ton this year. But now the company, based in Richmond, Va., says it expects between $61 and $63 a ton in 2008. Coal prices have shot up in recent months, particularly because of strong foreign demand for metallurgical grade coal used to make coke for steel manufacturing. (AP)
 SKYBUS AIRLINES SHUTS DOWN Low-cost carrier Skybus Airlines is shutting down Saturday and plans to file for bankruptcy protection next week, becoming the latest of the nation's airlines to fail because of rising fuel costs and a slowing economy. The airline, based in Columbus, Ohio, announced the shutdown late Friday. ''Skybus struggled to overcome the combination of rising jet fuel costs and a slowing economic environment,'' Michael Hodge, the carrier's chief executive. ''These two issues proved to be insurmountable for a new carrier.'' The airline made 74 daily flights to 15 cities, a spokesman said. It has about 450 employees. (AP) 
 HOME DEPOT JOB CUTS Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, may cut as many as 1,000 jobs as it reduces human-resources departments in stores by half to shift more workers to the sales floor. About 2,200 workers were notified of possible changes, and affected full-time employees, less than 1 percent of its work force, can apply for other jobs at the Atlanta-based company, a spokesman said Friday. The job cuts are effective May 1. 
 The job cuts are Home Depot's second this year after the retailer announced in January that it would reduce staff at its Atlanta headquarters by 10 percent.

 INDECENCY APPEAL REJECTED The News Corporation's appeal of $91,000 in indecency fines for a 2003 broadcast featuring strippers at bachelor and bachelorette parties has been rejected by the Federal Communications Commission on technical grounds. The appeal from the Fox Television unit exceeded a 25-page limit for responses, the agency said Friday in an order posted on its Web site. The F.C.C. said in the three-paragraph order that the fines would stand because Fox neither complied with the rule nor sought a waiver. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) 
 PASSAT RECALL Volkswagen is recalling some 410,000 Passat sedans sold in the United States due to potential problems with heat shields and fuel line components, the German automaker said Friday. Volkwagen said it would voluntarily recall all gasoline-powered Passats it had sold from the 1999 through 2005 model years for inspection and possible repair. The wide recall marks a setback for VW at a time when it has set ambitious targets for growth in the United States market and is considering building a new auto plant in North America. (REUTERS)
 $22.8 MILLION FOR MULALLY Alan Mulally, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company, received compensation valued at $22.8 million in 2007, down nearly 42 percent from the prior year, when he joined the company and collected a hefty signing bonus, according to a federal regulatory filing published Friday. Mr. Mulally, above, earned $2 million in salary and a $4 million bonus in 2007. The automaker lost $2.7 billion in 2007, largely because of continuing troubles in the North American market, an improvement from its $12.6 billion loss in 2006. Ford gave Mr. Mulally stock and options awards it valued at $12.3 million on March 5, 2007, and March 30, 2007, the dates they were granted, and perks worth $1.4 million. (AP) 
 CA RESTRUCTURES CA, an information technology company, said Friday it would eliminate 2,800 jobs under a restructuring plan, instead of the 1,700 job cuts previously announced. CA also said it would consolidate global facilities and take other cost-cutting actions as part of the initiative.
 The company expects the new actions to result in additional pretax restructuring charges between $75 million and $100 million, bringing the restructuring plan's total pretax costs to between $275 million and $300 million. (AP) 
 VACANT SHOPPING CENTERS Vacancies at community and neighborhood shopping centers in the United States rose in the first quarter to the highest level in more than a decade, and rent growth was the lowest since the last recession, the research firm Reis reported on Friday. The average vacancy rate rose to 7.7 percent from 7.1 percent a year earlier. It was the highest since 1996, the real-estate researcher said. Demand for retail space is being hurt by a drop in home prices and sales, rising food and gasoline costs, and job cuts, Reis said. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)

HEADLINE: Day on Campaign Trail To Remember Dr. King

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and JOHN M. BRODER; Larry Rohter contributed reporting from Fort Wayne, Ind., and Katharine Q. Seelye from New York.

DATELINE: MEMPHIS 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called for a cabinet-level poverty czar and Senator John McCain said he was wrong to have voted a quarter century ago against a federal holiday in memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as both presidential candidates converged here on Friday to appeal to black voters on the 40th anniversary of Dr. King's assassination.
 Senator Barack Obama, who polls show is the overwhelming choice for president so far among African-American primary voters, spent his day hopscotching around Indiana, North Dakota and Montana, although Dr. King's life and legacy were the subject of an emotional speech he delivered to a racially mixed crowd at a forum at a high school in Fort Wayne, Ind. 
 From the Memphis church where Dr. King delivered his last sermon the evening before he was assassinated by James Earl Ray, Mrs. Clinton gave her support to an idea long advocated by the King family: a cabinet position that she said would be ''solely and fully devoted to ending poverty as we know it, that will focus the attention of our nation on this issue and never let it go.''
 Mrs. Clinton added, ''No more excuses, no more whining, but instead a concerted effort.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton's proposal was intended to endear her to John Edwards, the former Democratic presidential candidate who ran as an antipoverty populist and whose endorsement Mrs. Clinton is seeking. 
 Mr. Edwards, in a statement issued through a spokesman, praised Mrs. Clinton's call. ''America's need to address the great moral issue of poverty demands strong action,'' he said in a statement, ''and a cabinet-level poverty position is exactly that kind of action.'' 
 Mr. McCain spoke in Memphis in a steady rain outside the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. King was slain -- now the National Civil Rights Museum. As some in the crowd booed, he said he had erred when he voted, in 1983, as a freshman in Congress against the January holiday honoring Dr. King.
 ''Even in this most idealistic of nations, we do not always take kindly to being reminded of what more we can do, or how much better we can be, or who else can be included in the promise of America,'' Mr. McCain said. ''We can be slow as well to give greatness its due, a mistake I made myself long ago when I voted against a federal holiday in memory of Dr. King. I was wrong and eventually realized that in time to give full support for a state holiday in Arizona.''
 In his remarks at the high school, Mr. Obama told the crowd of about 2,000 that Dr. King had been in Memphis as much for an economic reason, in the form of wages and income, as for a racial one.
 ''It was a struggle for economic justice, for the opportunity that should be available to people of all races and all walks of life,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Because Dr. King understood that the struggle for economic justice and the struggle for racial justice were really one, that each was part of a larger struggle for freedom, for dignity and for humanity.''
 Mr. Obama's staff cited a previous commitment in Grand Forks, N.D., as the reason the candidate skipped the King commemoration in Memphis, although Mr. Obama may have little political need to make the pilgrimage to woo black voters, and he talked with members of the King family by phone. Speaking to reporters just after landing in Fort Wayne, Mr. Obama said he did not think his absence would be misinterpreted, and noted that he had spoken this past Jan. 20 at Dr. King's home church in Atlanta, Ebenezer Baptist.
 Mrs. Clinton, in somber remarks to a small group of religious and civic leaders at Mason Temple at the Memphis headquarters of the Church of God in Christ, recalled her often-described meeting with Dr. King when she was a 14-year-old girl ''from an all-white school and an all-white church and an all-white suburb.'' 
 There were times when she appeared to be comparing her struggle for the Democratic nomination with Dr. King's battles for civil rights. She spoke of the hostility he faced from the news media, the threats and the sheer exhaustion of the struggle.
 ''Like with any faith, there were moments when one doubts and one is on the brink of throwing in the towel,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But he would always come back from those dark places, and so must we.'' 
 She referred to ''the grinding hard work of just getting up every day'' when it would have been tempting to just sleep in.
 ''Those of you in the clergy know it sometimes tests one's constitution, one's faith, to be constantly asked to do more, to reach out,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''Someone of lesser heart and lesser faith might have grown weary, might have given up. But he persisted in his struggle, and we know the results.'' 
 At times her voice broke, as when she recalled learning of Dr. King's death when she was a student at Wellesley. 
 ''I was a junior in college, and I remember hearing about it and just feeling such despair,'' she said. ''I walked into my dorm room and took my book bag and hurled it across the room. I felt like everything had been shattered, that we'd never be able to put the pieces together again.''
 In his remarks, Mr. McCain recalled that he heard about Dr. King's death while he was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.
 ''I remember first learning what had happened here on the fourth of April 1968, feeling just as everyone else did back home, only perhaps even more uncertain and alarmed for my country in the darkness that was then enclosed around me and my fellow captives,'' Mr. McCain said. 
 He added that his captors ''had correctly calculated that the news from Memphis would deeply wound morale, and leave us worried and afraid for our country'' while confirming their belief ''that America was a lost cause, and that the future belonged to them.''
 But ''if they had been the more reflective kind, our enemies would have understood that the cause of Dr. King was bigger than any one man, and could not be stopped by force of violence,'' Mr. McCain said. ''Struggle is rewarded, in God's own time. Wrongs are set right, and evil is overcome.''

SECTION: Section TR; Column 0; Travel Desk; SPRING BREAK BARCELONA DAY TRIP; Pg. 3

LENGTH: 1026 words

HEADLINE: Catalonia's 'Champagne' Country

BYLINE: By SARAH WILDMAN

 BODY:
IT'S so hard to leave Barcelona. The sea, the food, the art, the music, the shopping (the shopping!). But sometimes Las Ramblas, with its polylingual hordes of shuffling tourists, is so mobbed that even the most enthusiastic Barca fan can feel weary. 
 One way to take a break from Barcelona's frenetic pace is to venture into the countryside of Catalonia. The first wineries of the Penedes, the Catalan answer to the Rioja, are a mere 20 miles away and can be the centerpiece of a perfect spring day trip from Barcelona. Indeed, a myriad of guided wine tours have popped up over the past few years, but on a recent visit to the region, my preference was to rent a car and devise my own tour, which began with cava, Spanish sparkling wine, and ended with a splurge on a fish-focused lunch in a Mediterranean seaside village. 
 You can pick up a rental at Europcar or Pepecar downtown; expect to pay a bit over $100 a day for the car, and another 30 to 40 euros ($47 to $63 at $1.58 to the euro) to fill up the tank at the end of the day. Then take Avenue Diagonal straight out of the city toward the AP-7 motorway (direction Tarragona). The massive 1920s-style hacienda of Freixenet, one of Spain's largest cava producers, looms at exit 27. Be sure to make a reservation in advance because, unlike Napa, cava wine cellars and other Penedes wineries aren't equipped for pop-in visitors. Freixenet (free) and fellow cava maker Codorniu (2 euros) are within a three-minute drive of each other and compete for visitors. 
 But before you tour a dark, century-old cellar, do a little exploring on foot. The little town of Sant Sadurni d'Anoia, its dusty streets barely wide enough for the cava trucks, is the center of an economy that is tightly tied to wine. Shops sell local Penedes whites, sparkling wines and a few reds at pocket-change prices. For two to six euros, you can buy a bottle and tuck it away for the beach, even if you've never heard of the vigneron. Cal Feru (Carrer Diputacio 51; 34-93-891-0163; www.calferu.com) is a vast ''cave'' or cellar of Penedes wines and 120 varieties of cava. Next door at Gust de Poble (Placa Manuel Raventos, 34-93-818-3467) the wine selection is more limited, but enhanced by great local chocolates, as well as cheese and jamon. 
 Up at Freixenet (Joan Sala 2, Sant Sadurni d'Anoia, 34-93-891-7000; www.freixenet.com) our one-and-a-half-hour tour was led by Emile, a young Frenchman. Emile gave an impressively engaging speech on sparkling-wine making -- and let videos do a little myth building about the two wine-making families, cemented by marriage, who founded the company in 1914. 
 Bold-colored panels lit up as we walked, explaining how yeast plus sugar equals bubbles. As he narrated, Emile imparted helpful cava storing hints -- never keep a bottle of cava more than two years and never store it horizontally. Finally the whole crew descended, on foot, several stories into the earth, down into cobwebby basements dug by hand in the 1920s. Hopping on a Disneyesque mini-train, we rocketed through basements and underground warehouses until we careened back upstairs to taste the cava.
 Our next tour, my partner Ian and I realized, with stomachs rumbling, was two hours off. We drove up to Codorniu (Avenida Codorniu s/n, Sant Sadurni d'Anoia, 34-93-891-3342, www.codorniugroup.com) hoping we could get in early. The winery buildings are gorgeous examples of turn-of-the-century Catalan modernism designed by the Catalan architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, a contemporary of Gaudi. 
 Tours advertise ''Cava and Art.'' A small museum illustrates the influence of cava makers' wealth on art and architecture at the turn of the last century. Medieval architecture fans might want to check out another part of the Codorniu group -- the exquisite Abadia de Poblet, a 13th-century monastery surrounded by vineyards, about an hour and a half away (Passeig de L'Abad Conhill 6, Poblet; 34-977-870-358). 
 At Codorniu, we told the desk we couldn't wait for our tour and asked to see the shop. From there we snuck out onto the grounds for a quick peak at the gardens, and the Puig i Cadafalch-designed Raventos family mansion, and then headed back on the road.
 ''Easy'' was the way Freixenet's parking lot attendant described the trip from Sant Sadurni d'Anoia to Sitges, a gay-friendly former fishing town on the Mediterranean coast rumored to have a raucous night life. An hour later, we were rewarded with a breathtaking coast line. On the tiny Platja de Sant Sebastia, a solitary woman practiced yoga, her black-clad silhouette stark against the profile of the Esglesia de Sant Bartomeu i Santa Tecla, a 17th-century cathedral built on the shoreline. 
 It was 4 p.m., the time most restaurants close; and no matter how many diners are still happily chewing away, nothing will make a restaurateur take on a new table. We climbed the narrow streets to the Platja de la Fragata, past the neo-Classical Edifici Miramar, the site of Catalonia's international film festival, and the late 19th-century town hall. We finally sat down at the excellent, though terribly overpriced, Restaurante Maricel (Passeig de la Ribera 6; 34-93-894-2054). Lunch for two -- monkfish in mushroom sauce and a delightfully creamy vegetable soup -- came to a stomach-dropping 87 euros. 
 Putting that indulgence out of our minds, we wandered the boardwalk and then up Carrer Nou, the beginning of a warren of winding alleys with galleries and little shops. At Galeria des Arts Aplicades Pau d'Arara (Carrer Major 9; 34-93-894-2844), we peeked into an exhibition of the Argentine artist Fernando Suarez: huge canvases, filled with movement. In a separate room were sculptures cast from ceramics, wood and glass (75 euros and up).
 Nearby, at the jewelry store Inaures Joyas (Carrer Major 25; 34-93-894-7076; www.inaures.com), we stopped in to check out the gorgeous wearable art from across Europe offered by the owners Aurora Artes and Monika Hellwig.
 Finally, we stumbled back down the road for a drink at Villa Lola, a jazz bar with low beige couches outside, facing the sea, and contemplated finding our way back to beloved Barcelona.

HEADLINE: Can't Beat the Commute

BYLINE: By WM. FERGUSON

 BODY:
If you want a symbol for the current American housing market, look into the backyard of a tidy little four-bedroom on Burke Avenue North in the Seattle neighborhood of Wallingford. There, where homeowners of the past might have installed a rose trellis, a hot tub or some other monument to leisure, you will find something a little more modest. You will find a shed. 
 But this is no garden-variety shed. The Burke Avenue shed is a sophisticated little home office with a Modernist air -- a 120-square-foot site for thinking, not for hiding the lawn mower. Designed by Ryan Smith, a Seattle architect, the shed was a solution to a distinctly contemporary problem: a sales rep who worked from home was having a second child and losing his office. He contracted Smith to dig out his basement; Smith proposed a less expensive option, the shed (the basement conversion would have cost around $150,000, compared with $15,000 for the shed). It inspired Smith to start Modern-Shed, a company dedicated to constructing just these sorts of prefab outbuildings. And Smith was not the only one with this idea. There are dozens of companies (like MetroShed, Modern Cabana and Shelter-Kit) that offer a prefabricated home office (or playroom, guest room or workshop) starting at around $10,000. (Electricity and plumbing are what you might call necessary extras.)
 Several factors have made the shed moment possible. First, with some economists predicting that housing prices may fall as much as 30 percent, homeowners who once thought about trading up must find ways to be happy staying put. Second, with more Americans than ever working regularly from home -- more than 20 million, according to the National Bureau of Labor Statistics -- there is clearly a market for the backyard office. But until recently, the image of the American shed was humble. What has surely propelled the idea of the designer shed is the recent high profile of prefab architecture. When a firm like LOT-EK wins awards for designs using shipping containers straight out of the railyard, a ready-made home office carries some cachet. It's also an aesthetic that trades heavily on its green credentials. Instead of creating a Dumpster's worth of trash, constructing a shed leaves you with about a garbage can of waste. 
 Sheds also take a lot less time to construct than additions: about three to five days. This, in the view of Daniel Gray, an author of computer how-to books who has run a blog devoted to sheds for close to a decade, is the real reason to set up out back. Since sheds have such a small footprint, they can often be installed without permits and may not increase taxes. ''It's an end run around the town,'' he says. Plus, Gray adds, ''it won't raise eyebrows in the neighborhood, like parking an Airstream trailer in your yard and using that for an office.'' Wm. Ferguson

HEADLINE: How To Turn A Herd On Wall St.

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
Experts have long known that a classic phenomenon called herd behavior has a great deal to do with the wild swings of panic and exuberance that can seize Wall Street in the wake of surprising economic news.
 But lately they have tried to confront a related question: What makes a herd, financial or otherwise, stop and turn around? Specifically, behavioral experts want to know if there are psychological cues that can help transform this bear market into a bullish one.
 ''The dynamics of these turning points are much harder to understand'' than the original herd behavior itself, perhaps particularly in economics, ''and the field is only just beginning to look at them,'' said Terrance Odean, a professor of finance at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business.
 Researchers who study nonconformity, fads, even game theory, agree that in any declining market, investors will inevitably begin to bet against the behavior of the herd. Many of these initial contrarians may be working from their own analyses of economic fundamentals, or from tips, or maybe they are simply jumping at the chance to pick up ''distressed'' products like mortgages and bank loans on the cheap. 
 But other investors will defect for individual, idiosyncratic reasons. Two recent psychological studies at Arizona State University point to what it might take for individuals to peel off from the herd. In the studies, researchers demonstrated that young men rating the attractiveness of facial photographs significantly changed their ratings, up or down, in line with what they thought were peers' ratings (but were in fact generated by a computer program). Yet when encouraged beforehand to think of meeting a romantic partner, the men were highly likely to dissent. ''The goal to attract a mate generally led them to go against the preferences of others,'' the authors concluded.
 Other sorts of strong urges can similarly overwhelm the social pressures to conform, some experts said. Investors trying to preserve their reputation as mavericks, for example, or to show confidence under spiraling pressure, might favor a contrarian strategy.
 ''When you're working with other people's money you're going to be looking to hit for average and minimize risk, period,'' said Charles Osborne, president of Osborne Partners Capital Management in San Francisco. ''But you sometimes see people who feel they have little to lose make a contrarian move; they may feel they're going to lose the client anyway,'' and so bet against the crowd.
 Early dissenters usually pick up allies quickly. One model that researchers have used to study contrarian behavior is called the minority game. The game is based on a now-classic problem posed in 1994 by the economist W. Brian Arthur set in a bar called El Farol. Everyone likes El Farol but also knows that the place is not much fun when it's crowded. What, then, is the best strategy to maximize the fun. Avoid weekends? Try Thursdays and Sundays? Won't everyone else be doing the same?
 Experiments testing various versions of this game have shown that many players flip strategies in the middle of playing, apparently simply because they have set some private threshold for changing, like trying one strategy three times, ''and if it doesn't work, switch to the other one,'' said Willemien Kets, a postdoctoral fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.
 Dr. Kets contends that this switching strategy can be successful precisely because others decide to stick to a congested road. ''You see this 'grass is always greener' kind of behavior emerging,'' Dr. Kets said in an interview, ''which suggests that a variety of contrarian strategies will evolve naturally in the course of any such game because there are people who are more conservative in their strategies.''
 Once people start thinking in this way, they subconsciously recruit evidence that supports their view, and not only from other investors. Simply bumping into an acquaintance who shares a contrary opinion -- at the gym or in line at the grocery store -- can seem like an affirmation.
 ''We tend to pay very close attention to what we hear in these sorts of fleeting relationships,'' said Calvin Morrill, a sociologist at the University of California at Irvine. ''The person isn't a good friend, so their opinion seems fresh, new, important information coming from outside the usual sources.''
 Studies of group behavior in work teams, for instance, or juries, find that dissenters are far more likely to stick to their guns and influence others when they believe they have allies. 
 ''Having social support is very important,'' said John M. Levine, a professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh. ''If the person believes that others agree with them -- even if they're not present -- then they're much more likely to hold their position and influence the group.''
 Not that the market cares about any of this; it will bury anyone who's early, late or wrong, whether they're self-styled contrarians or Nobel laureates.
 But under the right circumstances, key investors and traders pick up on the same contrarian cues, and the herd can change course very quickly. In a paper due out later this year, the psychologists Jonah Berger of the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and Chip Heath of the Stanford Graduate School of Business describe a series of experiments demonstrating precisely such collective swings.
 In one experiment, the psychologists in effect created a fad at a university dormitory, selling residents the yellow LiveStrong wristbands popularized by the cyclist Lance Armstrong several years ago. A week later, they sold the same wristbands at a nearby dorm populated by students with a nerdier reputation.
 The number of people wearing the wristbands in the first dorm quickly plummeted by a third; and in questionnaires students from that dorm acknowledged that they believed themselves to be ''dissimilar'' to those in the academic dorm.
 From this and other research, Dr. Berger concludes that a fad can reverse itself when group members decide it's no longer distinctive. ''This is why hipsters will suddenly lose interest in a band when they think others are poaching it,'' Dr. Berger said in an interview. ''It's a matter of protecting their group identity.''
 Investors and traders may not build their identities around garage bands or wrist accessories. But those who stay in the racket long enough know from experience who tends to be on the right side of trades, and who grazes with the sheep. And if the ratio of sheep to non-sheep in the neighborhood gets too high, they hop the fence out.
 ''People say picking where the market's going to turn is all gut feeling, but that's really a misnomer,'' said Tom Baldwin, a legendary trader in Treasury bond futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. ''You don't have to be the first one in. You're really watching what certain other people do.''
 He added: ''They don't have to be huge, market-moving people, just traders you know from experience who tend to be right, and if you take the other side, you're going to lose money. Then it's a matter of believing what you see. You have to believe it, that's the hard part.''

HEADLINE: Change Can Be Painful, but This One Shouldn't Hurt

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT

 BODY:
KENT STEINRIEDE of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia, was riding the commuter train a couple of weeks ago when he opened his New York Times to something he did not like. On Page 3, where he was used to finding an international article -- he has a special interest in news from France -- was an airy-looking index to the paper, expanded from its usual spot on Page 2. On Page 4 was a new guide to content on nytimes.com, and two full-page ads followed that. The first article inside the paper did not appear until Page 7, the start of a redesigned International Report.
 The first thing Steinriede did when he arrived at the office was fire off a message to the public editor. ''I've subscribed to the NY Times since 1989 because I like to read articles, not look at a Hulked-out table of contents,'' he said.
 Richard C. Longworth of Chicago agreed. Times readers, he said, ''are serious readers who don't mind doing a little work'' and do not need a big index to tell them where to find national news or to drive them to the paper's Web site. 
 Other readers, like Barry Jagoda of La Jolla, Calif., fretted that The Times was taking space away from news articles to tell readers what was in the space that was left. ''How many fewer stories ... are being provided to the reader?'' he asked.
 The answer is, none. That is what Times editors told me. My assistant, Michael McElroy, measured the news hole in the first section of the paper for the week before the change and the week after and confirmed it. Space for national and international articles actually increased slightly.
 Steinriede, Longworth and Jagoda are typical of the readers I hear from each time The Times makes a change in the printed newspaper. Many of them are passionate about The Times. The average Times reader spends 48 minutes with the daily newspaper and 72 minutes with the Sunday paper, far more time than the readers of most other papers. It is not an exaggeration to say that they see The Times as an essential part of their lives, and they worry that change -- which has often meant taking away content in a declining newspaper economy -- is chipping away at something they love. They are not comforted by the rich and growing offerings on The Times's Web site; they love the printed paper.
 Just since last spring, The Times has eliminated four pages of daily stocks listings, one and a half pages of Sunday stocks, the weekly Spare Times and Dateline pages in the Weekend Arts section, and the daily television listings in the Washington and Boston editions. It has trimmed an hour from the daily television listings in the New York edition.
 In the most drastic change since color was introduced into the paper in 1997 amid predictions that it would destroy the character of the ''gray lady,'' the page width of The Times was trimmed by one and half inches last Aug. 6. The skinnier newspaper, which will save an estimated $10 million a year on newsprint, brought The Times into line with other papers in a year when the industry suffered its largest advertising revenue plunge since records started being kept in 1950. The New York Times Media Group, which includes The Times, The International Herald Tribune and their Web sites, did better than most but still saw ad revenue decline by 2.2 percent for the year.
 That slimmer paper, which wound up cutting the space for news by 10 percent, actually prompted no more complaints than the expanded indexes, including one stripped across the bottom of the front page. That might seem odd, since one was a take-away and the other was intended to help readers. But The Times did a poor job of preparing readers for the latest changes and did not explain that, for once, they added content instead of reducing it.
 By contrast, Times editors spent months trying to make the transition to the narrower pages as invisible as possible. Virtually everything on every page of the paper had to be changed -- the spacing between letters and between lines of type, even the width of the rules between columns. (The most unfortunate impacts were less room for letters to the editor and sometimes for obituaries, a Times signature strength.) Yet, as intended, the change was hardly noticed by most readers. The Times says it has 4.7 million daily readers and 6.3 million Sunday readers. I heard from 44 of them about the narrower paper.
 The latest change was not about saving money. In fact, some of the news hole that was saved by the narrower page width was added back to accommodate the expanded indexes.
 Tom Bodkin, the assistant managing editor in charge of design, said the change was conceived by a committee that Bill Keller, the executive editor, appointed in June of 2006 to look at ways to improve Page 1 and the first section of the paper. One big change that has gone without complaint: Jumps from front-page articles are now confined, for the most part, to the A section. Before, if a business article started on the front page, it was continued in the business section, requiring a reader to fumble for that section or wait until a spouse finished reading it.
 Bodkin said the expanded index was designed to address two issues raised by readers. One was, ''I don't have enough time.'' The other was, ''I miss good stuff in the paper.'' Bodkin said: ''That we hear all the time. It's a big, complicated paper.''
 He acknowledged that ''if you flip through the entire paper every day, you don't need'' the expanded index. But he said, ''I just feel like it's not a huge imposition'' for those readers to skip it. For time-starved readers, he said, the new contents provide ''an efficient way to get an overview of the news and find features deep within the paper that they might want to read.''
 The new front-page index is a big improvement, but I find the design of the expanded one inside jarring. The typography of The Times is deliberately dense, giving an impression of substance. The items in the new index float in a sea of white space, looking light and inconsequential. Bodkin is inclined to agree. ''We went a little too far,'' he said, adding that the design will be adjusted.
 I am not a fan of newspaper indexes, but as long as I know the new one is not crowding out news, I am content to turn past it to find what I want to read. Will those readers who are complaining get used to it?
 I recently asked the 44 readers who protested the narrower page how they felt about it today. Some are still upset. But Tom Yamamoto of San Francisco said he is no longer bothered by the page size, though he worries that The Times cannot succeed in the long run offering less for a higher price.
 Yamamoto volunteered that he likes the latest changes.

HEADLINE: Michigan's Song of Itself

BYLINE: By THOMAS LYNCH. 
Thomas Lynch, a funeral director and lecturer at the University of Michigan, is the author of the memoir ''Booking Passage.''

DATELINE: Milford, Mich. 

 BODY:
 THE University of Michigan had a chance to shine at the end of February when our symphony orchestra toured by bus from Ann Arbor to Carnegie Hall. The musicians made stops at Oberlin and Cornell before getting to West 57th Street. Kenneth Kiesler, our maestro, selected Mahler's Fifth Symphony and a new composition by a faculty member, Evan Chambers, called ''The Old Burying Ground'' to show the talents of our student musicians. Because one of my poems is included in the Chambers work, I found myself among the fresh-faced virtuosi as they made their debut on the nation's most prestigious stage. 
 To sit waiting for my moment behind the first violins rehearsing Mahler's heartbreaking Adagietto was a gift that nearly overwhelmed with memories -- Luchino Visconti's film and Thomas Mann's novella ''Death in Venice,'' and Robert Kennedy's requiems at St. Patrick's Cathedral 40 years ago this June. I felt like a heartsick Aschenbach, fresh from the barbers, vexed by the grim and dismal in the midst of hope and beauty. 
 It was a brilliant night! The great hall packed, the music transcendent, the voices resplendent, the ovations longstanding. 
 ''I had this aim to create a work that sounded as if the voices were rising from the ground,'' said Evan Chambers. And it put me in mind of the groundswell, bottom-up, collaborative politics of change that has been much in play this primary season. To hear his composition played and sung in Carnegie's perfect acoustics was a triumph and a gift. 
 Alas, a triumph and gift that went unremarked-upon and unreviewed: no mention made, as far as I could tell, in the dailies in New York or Detroit or Ann Arbor. It is true: bad news gets halfway round the world before good news has its boots laced up. The easy litany of things gone wrong in Michigan gets more of a forum than what's gone right. 
 Most of the ink and airtime of late around here has been spent on the self-inflicted fall from grace of Detroit's hapless mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, who has been indicted for perjury in his alleged efforts to cover up a sex scandal. He has Bill Clinton's trouble with mendacity and George W. Bush's on-his-sleeve religiosity; the former president's lapses of self-control and the current one's insuperable hubris. Like Mr. Clinton he's gotten in trouble with women. Like Mr. Bush, he reckons he's ''on assignment from God.'' All three men have misspent their considerable gifts -- some inherited, some acquired, some congenital -- and have disappointed beyond all expectations. 
 So now the National Conference of Black Mayors, which had been scheduled for Detroit in April, will go to New Orleans in June instead. ''It's not that we're against Detroit, or the people of Detroit or even Mayor Kilpatrick; we just want to keep focus on our issues,'' said George Grace, president of the conference. 
 By comparison, the perseverance of our governor, Jennifer Granholm, gets little notice. Her efforts to diversify the economy, double the number of college graduates and restore our cities are not nearly as engaging as the soap opera that has been playing out in Detroit. The Government Performance Project at the Pew Center for the States graded Michigan's management with a B-plus this year; only three states scored better. 
 As she has put it: ''We need to capitalize on our natural advantages ... Wind. Woods. Water. Work force. Even waste. If we do this right, Michigan can be the alternative energy capital of North America, and create thousands and thousands of jobs.'' Her faith in the future is contagious. So is despair. Sometimes we vote our hopes, sometimes our fears. 
 Among those young musicians of Michigan at Carnegie Hall, I felt the way supporters say they do at a Barack Obama event -- that maybe we are worthy of our better dreams. A symphony orchestra is an exercise in collaboration, in bringing diverse tools and talents to bear on a common purpose. The worst of times might give way to the best, the winter will at last give way to spring, that out of all the noise and nonsense, blather and racket we might make song and poetry and music.

HEADLINE: Bookstore and Coffee Shop, Both Beloved, Both for Sale

BYLINE: By JOY L. HAENLEIN

DATELINE: GREENWICH 

 BODY:
 MOST stores and restaurants in Old Greenwich's business district are independently owned -- a point of pride in this tree-lined waterfront community. Unlike in many suburban neighborhoods, the big-chain CVS drugstore is the exception in Old Greenwich, and the independent toy store, chocolate shop, hardware store and chicken takeout place are the standard.
 So when Thomas and Jenny Lawton put Just Books, Too, one of two independent bookstores left between Stamford and Greenwich, and the adjacent Arcadia Coffee Company up for sale last month, many patrons were surprised and saddened. 
 The bookstore is known for its customer service and community involvement. The coffee shop is a gathering spot for people of all ages and one of the few places where local teenage bands are encouraged to perform. 
 The bookstore has taken pride in knowing its customers and providing personal service. ''We'll know what your book club is reading,'' Ms. Lawton said. ''We'll call you if there's a book we think you might like. We deliver. We'll even take a book back.''
 The properties are to be sold separately. Ms. Lawton said she is talking to potential buyers about the bookstore and working with an investor group to keep Arcadia going. An April 23 benefit show to help the owners retire debt, featuring Jane Condon, a local comedian, is planned.
 The Lawtons opened Just Books, Too in 2002 in a former women's clothing boutique and bought the coffee shop in 2004. The two businesses never were profitable, however, and Ms. Lawton said she and her husband lacked a financial cushion as a hedge against losses as rent and other costs continued to mount. 
 The bottom line is respected in Old Greenwich, home to many in the financial services and corporate worlds, but many patrons don't want to see Just Books, Too disappear.
 While she lives in Stamford's Westover neighborhood, Meg Scarpetta shops at Just Books, Too because she finds ''the type of conversation you can't get at Barnes & Noble.'' 
 The larger chain bookstores ''are, to me, soul-less,'' Ms. Scarpetta said. ''There's no personal connection. Jenny lives in the community and has a business in the community.'' 
 Ms. Lawton has helped schools find authors to speak and played host to meet-the-author sessions with everyone from Henry Kissinger to Toni Morrison. Students read galleys before they are published and share reviews as part of Just Books, Too's after-school program. When each new Harry Potter book went on sale at midnight, children from throughout the region lined up to get a copy, many dressed as their favorite Potter character.
 Ms. Lawton's interest in young people extends to her coffee shop, a onetime community center with high ceilings and a long coffee bar. No audition is required for local bands that play there, and a modest $5 admission is charged at the door, from which Ms. Lawton deducts expenses and gives the band the rest. 
 Brooke Cantwell, a Greenwich High School freshman, is part of a four-piece girls' band, Periwinkle Elevator, that performed March 7 at Arcadia before about 50 people. Brooke, 14, plays bass in the alternative music group.
 She also ends the school week with her friends at Arcadia on Friday afternoons. 
 ''It's one of the few fun places kids can go,'' she said. ''They know us there. We sometimes leave our stuff there and run around. During midterm week, we went there a couple of times for lunch.''
 That is a potentially important connection, according to Jenny Byxbee, Greenwich's youth services coordinator.
 ''There are more activities for youth on the other end of town,'' she said. ''Not all kids have transportation. Jenny works with kids where they're at and actively asks them for ideas. She's been such a wonderful asset.''
 But the economic challenges have multiplied over the years. Amazon and other online discount retailers have made it increasingly difficult for traditional bookstores to compete on price, Ms. Lawton said. 
 Laura Bennett, president of the Old Greenwich Merchants' Association, said many local businesses do not own their own buildings, and they cannot all weather drastic changes in the economy.
 ''As those rents get higher, it gets scary,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Clash Over Land and Water

BYLINE: By TIM WACKER

 BODY:
WHEN Mayor Timothy Stewart of New Britain pressed for state legislation last summer to open city Water Department woodlands to a private mining operation, he envisioned what the city could do with the $15 million and the new recreation fields and new reservoir it would receive through the deal.
 Several residents, environmentalists and at least two state lawmakers had a different picture of what the mining operations would bring. They foresaw a dirty, disruptive business denuding dozens of acres of pristine forest that now protect the city's water supply.
 New Britain won legislative approval last July that would have allowed mining in their woodlands, but the legislature repealed the measure two months later because of concern that allowing development would threaten more than 100,000 acres of woodlands protecting drinking water supplies around the state. 
 Now, the debate is taking place in the legislature again because a similar bill has been introduced that would allow New Britain to move forward with its mining plans. 
 Supporters of the bill said municipalities and water companies, both public and private, that own land near reservoirs should be allowed to explore commercial options for their use. Critics said they are concerned about the possibility of commercial use near reservoirs and the impact on drinking water.
 ''There are many potential commercial mining operations on those 100,000 acres, but that land was not bought for that purpose,'' said Curt Johnson, senior attorney for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, which opposes the New Britain project and the bill. ''It was bought to protect the pubic health, not pollute the public health.''
 The original legislation approved last year -- then repealed -- would have allowed New Britain to give 131 acres of woodlands owned by the New Britain Water Department to Tilcon Connecticut, a construction materials producer that operates one of the state's largest stone quarries, in neighboring Plainville.
 The city would have received annual payments totaling $15 million from the company and a new reservoir when excavating was finished about 40 years later. But Mr. Johnson and some New Britain residents said the city had all the water it needed and the new reservoir might end up contaminated by natural deposits in the bedrock beneath it.
 Those arguments caught the attention of State Representative Timothy O'Brien, a Democrat, who worked with State Senator Donald J. DeFronzo, also a Democrat, to get the original legislation that New Britain sought repealed in a special legislative session called last September.
 ''I just realized that the whole New Britain thing smelled bad and had to be repealed,'' Mr. O'Brien said. ''It was one of those deals where the more you heard about it the worse it sounded.''
 Now Mr. O'Brien has been joined by Mr. Johnson's group and the Connecticut Alliance of Rivers. Both groups have launched a campaign asking residents to contact Representative Peggy Sayers and Senator Mary Ann Handley, the co-chairwomen of the legislature's Public Health Committee, to oppose the bill. Both women are Democrats.
 Mr. Johnson said concern now goes well beyond New Britain. There are 3,017 public water systems in the state, the largest of which collectively own some 100,000 acres of environmentally sensitive lands that need to be protected, he said. If the legislature decides to open those lands to commercial interests it could be opening the flood gates for deals like the Tilcon proposal, Mr. Johnson and other opponents say.
 ''We expect the mining issue to come back up,'' said Margaret Miner, executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut. ''It's such a lucrative possibility for water utilities that others would immediately express interest in the same possibility.''
 Expressing an interest is not the same as starting an excavation, said Mr. Stewart, the mayor in New Britain, who is a Republican. All New Britain wanted was to study the Tilcon proposal, he said, and he would like the city to have that opportunity again if the new legislation is passed.
 ''These sorts of projects can be handled on a case-by-case basis, but as it is now there is no mechanism in the law to do so,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''Mr. O'Brien made a big stir and got the legislature to repeal the law, but it was a shortsighted move.''
 Mining operations moving into preserved lands that protect drinking water supplies are contentious issues anywhere. As the New Britain dispute moves to a statewide stage, the debate between the two politicians has gotten heated. 
 Mr. O'Brien accused Mr. Stewart of misleading the legislature when he presented the bill for New Britain by saying it was an urgent matter when the city had been negotiating with Tilcon for months. Mr. Stewart said Mr. O'Brien was engaging in partisan politics. Tilcon Connecticut did not return calls for comment.
 Support for the New Britain bill came from Ms. Sayers, whose committee sponsored the original legislation in July and favors it coming back in some form. Beautiful reservoirs from former rock quarry operations now provide drinking water and recreational opportunities across the state, said Ms. Sayers, who contends that Connecticut communities should be free to explore the same opportunities today.
 ''The state needs to be able to look at everything regarding the use of these lands,'' she said.
 That is the position of the mining industry, according to Jay F. Malcynsky, a prominent local lawyer and lobbyist. The New Britain deal would have preserved some 200 more acres of woodlands than would be needed for the quarry, and it would have greatly extended the business life of Tilcon, one of the area's largest employers and property taxpayers, Mr. Malcynsky said. The state needs legislation that will allow communities to study such opportunities when they arise, he said.
 ''If the appropriate criteria are placed in whatever review process is established, you can balance the interests of the environment, public health and the economic viability of an area,'' Mr. Malcynsky said.
 Environmental groups seeking regulations that go far beyond restricting mining on water company lands are weighing in. There are 530,000 acres scattered across Connecticut that drain into rivers and streams feeding into the state's drinking water supplies that need protection as well, officials from these groups have said.
 The groups are pushing for two-acre zoning and apportionment of water rights, Ms. Miner said. Officials from environmental groups also want the state to create a buffer zone to restrict development around those lands.
 Some of these issues are coming up in different bills. The Legislative Commissioners' Office of the General Assembly is working to incorporate all these issues in one bill, and many people are waiting to see what the final proposal will say.
 ''We need some kind of overarching management plan that covers mining, protection from dense develop and watershed planning,'' Ms. Miner said. ''Because I can assure you, Tilcon is going to get its mining bill in there somewhere, and I can assure you we're going to try and stop them.''

HEADLINE: Going Green In the Blue Mountains

BYLINE: By JENNIFER CONLIN. 
JENNIFER CONLIN writes the Green Traveler column for the Travel section.

 BODY:
LYING under a thick patchwork quilt, breathing in the fresh mountain air, I felt like a true eco-traveler as I listened reverently to a morning medley of nature streaming through my window: the chirping of a cockatoo, the scuffle of a passing lizard, the rustling of leaves ... and then, from the room next door, the shrill, piercing voice of my travel companion shouting, ''There's a huge spider in my duffel bag! Get me out of here!'' 
 Dashing into the living room, I found my friend -- call him the ultimate urbanite -- standing on the couch, staring down at what was, in fact, a fairly large spider crawling across the floor of the cabin. I suspected he was having second thoughts about joining me on this ''environmentally friendly'' trip -- a first for both of us. Before he left New York, his image of a green vacation consisted of drinking mojitos after a seaweed wrap by an infinity pool, not fighting crawly things the size of a baseball mitt in the Australian bush. 
 Quite urban myself (I grew up in the Midwest but now live in London), I planned this trip wondering what it would be like to travel in a more sustainable way than I have grown accustomed to over the years -- grabbing cheap flights to whatever city caught my interest at that moment, never mind the carbon footprint I was leaving behind. 
 Yet I also wanted a vacation that would not be too jolting for a couple of green travel novices. So rather than signing us up for a marine conservation expedition in Antarctica or a Bedouin trekking journey across the Sahara, I settled on a more ''eco-light'' experience: hiking in the Greater Blue Mountains in New South Wales, a World Heritage Site since 2000, said to have unparalleled examples of nature, including forested landscapes on sandstone plateaus, deep gorges and canyons, secluded rain forests and ancient trees. Best of all, we would not have to rent a car once we got to Sydney. The Blue Mountains are an easy two-hour train ride from the city center. 
 Of course, one could make the argument that the moment I chose Australia (a blow-your-carbon-footprint-off-the-map sort of destination), I committed my first serious environmental crime of the trip. According to one carbon calculator, my round-trip journey between London and Sydney alone (about 21,000 miles) would produce an outlandish 5.6 tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of leaving all the lights on in my home all day and night for two years and six months. And though air travel accounts for only 2 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, according to figures from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is the fastest-growing contributor to global warming. With such an earth-shattering (literally) equation staring back at me, it was hard not to think twice before flying.
 But when I read in September that Qantas Airways had begun a carbon offset program, I began wondering if I could justify a January trip across the world if I paid for my emissions and then, once there, traveled responsibly (no internal flights or rental cars) and delicately (staying only in green hotels, eating locally grown food and so on). In fact, for a one-time payment of 24.02 Australian dollars to Qantas (about $21.50 at 1.12 Australian dollars to the U.S. dollar), I could offset my entire trip (including a fuel stop in Bangkok) by contributing to an Australian government-accredited ''greenhouse gas abatement'' program. 
 It seemed a ridiculously small amount to pay for a ludicrously long trip (19 hours of flight time), but at least I would be preventing my carbon footprint from growing any larger, even if I wasn't reducing it by staying home. And though many feel offsetting -- whether it is planting forests or financing green initiatives in the developing world -- is just a fashionable way for vacationers to feel less guilty about traveling, it still seemed better than doing nothing.
 Still not entirely convinced, I called Justin Francis, a founder of Responsibletravel.com, a British-based Web directory of thousands of screened sustainable travel vacations all over the world. ''Certainly, the goal is for everyone to try and fly less each year by finding alternative means of transport, particularly on short-haul distances,'' said Mr. Francis, who used to work at the Body Shop for Anita Roddick, one of the first eco-leaders of the corporate world. ''But when you have no choice but to fly, be sure to offset,'' he said, adding that until ''greener'' airline fuel is developed we have little alternative.
 Mr. Francis went on to assuage my guilt by telling me that one in 12 jobs in the world is in tourism, and if everyone decided not to travel, the result would be a global recession that would undoubtedly hit the developing countries hardest, and not just their economies. (In October 2007, the United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated that 46 of the 49 poorest countries in the world rely on international tourism as their primary source of foreign exchange earnings.) ''Tourism also keeps many cultures from going extinct,'' he said. ''Often rituals and traditions are passed down between generations primarily because tourists come to see them.'' I vowed to learn something about the Aborigines if I went to Australia. 
 Armed with eco-information, I decided to book my flights, excited not just to set foot in a new country, but also to see the Blue Mountains, or at least a small part of them (the entire area is about 2.5 million acres). Even better, I found a two-bedroom bungalow at an eco-lodge, the Jemby-Rinjah, which bills itself as ''one of the earliest examples of sustainable tourism in Australia'' (it started in 1987), which sounded much better to me than a campground near the extreme rappelling cliffs. 
 Set into the landscape overlooking one of the Blue Mountains' seven national parks, the Jemby-Rinjah is surrounded by signposted trails for hiking (along with raised planked walkways to protect the flora and fauna from human impact), an eco-lodge with a dining room and circular stone fireplace, and plenty of visible wildlife, including possums and parrots. What's more, it is just outside the village of Blackheath, and not far from the area's other two towns, Katoomba and Leura, filled with shops, pubs, boutiques and cafes for occasional breaks from the bush -- something I thought we might need.
 Still, my friend looked anything but happy when we checked in and the first thing the receptionist handed us was a flashlight so we could ''locate'' our cabin in the pitch-black wilderness. I must have looked equally troubled when, in a burst of enthusiasm, my friend signed us up for a guided hike into the Grand Canyon (forget his arachnophobia; my fear is heights!).
 And I am certain, had we ended up in one of the bungalows with a composting, rather than standard, toilet, he would have vacated the premises faster than I could mutter ''organic waste.'' In fact, I wondered if our two-decades-long friendship could sustain this sustainable travel experience when he complained that the solar ''light globes'' weren't bright enough to read by. (He abruptly upped our energy consumption by switching on the electric lights so he could read the novel he had taken along.) 
 Fortunately, both our moods improved when we were served a charcoal-grilled steak (''fresh from the barbie,'' said the hostess), homemade fries and a salad in the wood-beamed dining room of the lodge -- all locally harvested and satisfyingly washed down with a full-bodied Australian merlot. And though we forgot our flashlight and were forced to make our way blindly back to the cabin, taking several wrong turns along the way, we did eventually get some sleep (the bush is, literally, full of noisy night owls), a necessity since we had to survive our ''medium grade'' walk the next morning with our naturalist tour guide.
 Our guide, a fit 47-year-old named Tim Tranter, opened Tread Lightly Eco Tours about a decade ago. Having lived in the Blue Mountains for 45 years, he proved an invaluable guide when, five minutes into our ''signposted'' Grand Canyon walk, we had already gotten lost. (Again.) Without him, I am certain we would have ended up as one of the many ''rescue'' statistics he kept quoting during our trek. 
 Apparently more than a hundred people a year have to be pulled out of the Blue Mountains' wilderness because of twisted ankles, dehydration or disorientation (for this reason there are cellphone signals in the park). I now understood why the lodge instructs guests to inform a member of the staff before leaving for a hike. It was not just so they knew when to clean your room. 
 Over a four-hour trek, much of it climbing, Tim kept up a nonstop narrative about the area's rich environmental history, including the fact that a large portion of the forest had burned down entirely a year and a half ago and yet had already nearly replenished itself. (The miracle of nature at work!) As we descended 1,000 vertical feet into the canyon, he ushered us through a ''door'' leading from one biosphere into another. In one instance, we were standing in dry, shrubby bush; a few minutes later we found ourselves surrounded by a steamy, wet eucalyptus rain forest. 
 We were just going for a hike -- strenuous enough, believe me -- but other visitors come to the Grand Canyon, and nearby spots like the Valley of the Waters, for more adventurous diversions, like rappelling down the steep, slippery surface of a mountainside and then floating or swimming in the cool waters of the canyon streams. As I peered down at the small clearing in the bush that would have been the starting point for such an expedition -- and then the steep drop to the canyon floor below -- I had one thought: No thanks.
 But the history of the canyon is a fascinating one, and I was happy to hear it as we walked along the rocky path. According to Tim, Aborigines lived in these caves as recently as 100 years ago, isolated from the European settlers who were colonizing the rest of New South Wales. Then, in 1907, Thomas Rodriguez, Blackheath's rail station master, began the arduous process of creating walking trails, complete with the rock steps we were now negotiating on our trek. At one point, as we stopped in a cave for a coffee break, courtesy of the thermos Tim had brought along, he pointed out the names of two early bush walkers painted on the walls, faded but still clearly visible nearly a century later. 
 Upon reaching the bottom of the canyon, we lightly hopscotched from rock to rock across a gentle stream, a sharp contrast to the end of the hike when we would huff and puff our way up a section that Tim told us was disturbingly called the ''Stairway to Hell''-- 300 steps that lead to the summit. 
 Buoyed by our rugged hike, the next day we ventured into the town of Katoomba, a backpacker's paradise filled with cafes, restaurants and shops, to say nothing of the mountain scenery -- though sorting out an eco-friendly way to get there, or anywhere for that matter, from our lodge proved impossible. While the train from Sydney had dropped us right in Blackheath, once there, we had to take a cab from the station to our lodge, and to reach Katoomba (a 10-minute ride away) we again had to call a taxi. It was obvious that public transport was not a priority here, as no one seemed to know when or where there were buses, and even the locals seemed to wait forever for a bus that might never come. 
 Once deposited in Katoomba, we followed the flock of tourists, both Australian and foreign, down the town's main street to Echo Point, one of the country's most visited places, as evidenced by the many buses rolling in and the number of cameras clicking. Looking out over the Jamison Valley and the Kadumba Valley, we realized why this was named the Blue Mountains. The eucalyptus trees covering the park disperse oil into the atmosphere that emanates a blue hue, almost like a misty halo, when lit by the sun.
 But it is the natural monument called the Three Sisters -- three spires carved from millions of years of erosion of sandstone cliffs -- that is the most awe-inspiring feature of the Blue Mountains. They jut dramatically into the sky, looking like three queens admiring their realm.
 Wanting a closer look at the spires, we headed into the bustling visitor center for some much needed advice, then headed off for a hike along Prince Henry Cliff Walk, which hugs the side of the mountains and gives spectacular views of the valley below. For about half an hour, water bottles in hand, we weaved past cascades and waterfalls before emerging on a busy street leading back into town. 
 There, just another few minutes' walk away, was a much-appreciated pub. Sitting outdoors on the terrace filled with both young and old backpackers, all fresh (or not so fresh) from the mountain trails, we quickly polished off a couple of beers before stopping in for dinner at the Savoy, a casual restaurant with modern Oz food. I sampled my first kangaroo -- hardly endangered and extremely local -- which tasted a bit like a mix of lamb and venison, tender to the knife, with a hint of game on the tongue. 
 That night, we returned to the lodge -- this time we remembered our flashlights -- for a restful sleep thankfully uninterrupted by any more spiders. (Though my friend was still irritated by the faint glow emanating from the solar-powered lights in his room.)
 On our final day, we woke early to make sure we were ready for the 8:30 a.m. bird-feeding ritual, a much-touted attraction of the Jemby-Rinjah lodge. Walking out to the designated feeding area, we saw a small group of people all standing with their arms extended like scarecrows, their palms turned up to the sky. Waiting. And then waiting some more. Finally, one by one, blue and red crimson rosella birds started flying in from the bush -- like a colorful version of Hitchcock's movie -- and landing on people's hands. 
 As I stood there, flinching each time a bird attempted to alight on my palm, a man told me how rare it is for these birds to approach humans, and then he instructed me on the best way to hold the seed in my hand so the birds would come close.
 ''Are you a bird-watcher?'' I asked him. He looked like a serious ornithologist in his Birkenstocks, camp shorts and pocketed vest. ''Are you kidding?'' he said, as a few gang-gang cockatoos landed on him. ''I just got here yesterday. This is the first time I've ever fed a bird.'' 
 Moments later, I giggled as I felt the peck of a beak on my hand for the first time. But I had to laugh even harder at the sight of my friend. Squatting down, he was surrounded by a whole flock of feeding, flapping birds, looking a lot like Dr. Dolittle. What's more, I could swear I heard him talking to them. 
 LEAVING BIGGER FOOTPRINTS LOCALLY (ON THE HIKING TRAIL) THAN GLOBALLY
 GETTING THERE AND AROUND
 Qantas, United and American are among airlines that fly from Kennedy Airport to Sydney, via Los Angeles, starting at $1,335 (on Qantas) for travel in May, according to a recent online search. The fastest and greenest way into the city is the Airport Link train. A train trip from the airport to Central Station in Sydney is 13.80 Australian dollars (about $12 U.S., at 1.12 Australian dollars to the U.S. dollar). Trains run every 10 to 15 minutes and the journey takes 10 to 15 minutes (www.airportlink.com.au). 
 Trains depart Central Station nearly every hour en route to Blackheath, a two-hour journey. A one-way costs 13.80 Australian dollars; www.cityrail.info. 
 The hop-on hop-off Blue Mountains Trolley Tours (www.trolleytours.com.au; 15 Australian dollars for an all-day pass) leave every hour, daily, stopping at 29 attractions, including the Everglades Gardens in Leura, the Gordon Falls Lookout, and the main shopping street in Katoomba. 
 WHERE TO STAY
 Jemby Rinjah Eco Lodge (336 Evans Lookout Road, Blackheath; 61-2-4787-7622; www.jembyrinjahlodge.com.au) has an ''Advanced Ecotourism Accreditation'' from Ecotourism Australia, a nonprofit organization established in 1991 that runs a certification program; the lodge was one of the first large-scale sustainable tourism projects in Australia. One- and two-bedroom timber cabins start at 170 Australian dollars a night for two adults and two children under 12. Additional adults are 30 dollars a night, and extra children are 20 dollars. 
 Blue Mountains Youth Hostel (207 Katoomba Street, Katoomba; 61-2-4782-1416; www.yha.com.au ) is in a restored guesthouse from the 1920s within walking distance of both Echo Point and the town's many pubs and restaurants. It has two fireplaces, a group kitchen and Internet access. Doubles with a private bathroom cost 92 Australian dollars. 
 Echoes Boutique Hotel and Restaurant (3 Lilianfels Avenue, Katoomba; (61-2-4782-1966; www.echoeshotel.com), on the edge of a cliff overlooking Jamison Valley, may not be as green as some (though it does have a towel re-use program), but the spectacular view allows one to look across miles of national park. It appears to be a popular spot for honeymooners or others on a romantic getaway. On a recent stay, one fellow guest was spotted in the garden bending down on one knee to propose to his somewhat startled girlfriend -- who, between a swig of her beer and several puffs of her cigarette, appeared to say yes. Standard rooms with a view of the valley start at 350 Australian dollars a night. The restaurant specializes in Australian cuisine with Asian influences.
 WHERE TO EAT
 Savoy (26-28 Katoomba Street, Katoomba; 61-2-4782-3845) serves modern Australian cuisine in a casual setting. A meal for two with wine is usually under 80 Australian dollars.
 Victory Cafe (17 Govetts Leap Road, Blackheath; 61-2-4787-6777) is in the same building as the antiques center. The menu is more eclectic than one would imagine at a small town cafe. Alongside a large bowl of sweet potato and tomato soup (8.50 Australian dollars) one can also have a Vietnamese chicken salad (15.20 dollars).
 Silk's Brasserie (128 The Mall; 61-2-4784-2534; www.silksleura.com) is on the main street of Leura not far from galleries and boutiques. At the restaurant, decorated with ocher walls and a black-and-white-tiled floor, seasonal starters include a salmon tartare with caviar (21 Australian dollars), while main courses include a braised breast of corn-fed chicken on baked polenta (31 dollars), and tenderloin of grain-fed beef with baby English spinach (36 dollars), all served with local wines.
 WHERE TO HIKE
 Tread Lightly (61-2-4788-1229; www.treadlightly.com.au) offers guided half- or full-day bush walks, for all levels of fitness, throughout the Blue Mountains, including night tours. A four-hour Grand Canyon trek is 135 Australian dollars a person.

HEADLINE: So What if $1 Million Isn't What It Used to Be?

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE along the line, having $1 million -- like the ability to diagram sentences, do math in your head, and the dollar itself -- became devalued.
 Today, when magazines routinely compile lists of the world's billionaires, and trillion-dollar federal budgets are commonplace, a mere $1 million seems quaint. Still, it is a nice round number to aim for as you plan for retirement, and is the focus of two new books.
 Indeed, writing that you need at least a seven-figure nest egg is perhaps the biggest contribution that Michael K. Farr makes in ''A Million Is Not Enough'' (Springboard Press, $24.99).
 Mr. Farr, president of an investment firm based in Washington, doesn't break any new ground on how you should get to that $1 million threshold. Like many other personal-finance authors, he talks about the need to cut your expenses. And he cites the now seemingly obligatory measure of eliminating your daily cup (or two or three) of takeout coffee and investing what you would have spent on it. 
 When it comes to where to put that money, his advice is also familiar: Invest in stocks for the long term, although he would have you be a bit more aggressive than most. For example, he writes that 55-year-olds should have 85 percent of their retirement money in equities, with 10 percent in bonds and 5 percent in cash. The conventional wisdom puts the stock portion at somewhere between 65 and 80 percent. 
 In his favor, Mr. Farr is terrific on the basics, going so far as to begin at the very beginning. ''Investing can simply be defined as committing money with the hope of achieving a financial return on it,'' he says.
 But his real value is in providing a definable goal. Most retirement books tell you to save as much as you can or ask you to make an almost impossible calculation of how much you will spend in retirement.
 Mr. Farr simply declares that to achieve self-sufficiency, you will need $1 million, figuring that it will generate about $50,000 a year in income. He stresses that if $50,000 won't do it for you, you need to save a lot more. ''Those who want (or need) to spend $250,000 per year in retirement will need $5 million,'' he writes. 
 Clearly, if you are going to receive a pension of some kind, and if Social Security is still around, you may be that much further ahead of the game. Mr. Farr's focus here is on building a nest egg that is entirely within your control.
 He outlines steps to get your house in order, beginning with figuring out your net worth and determining where the money goes each month, and ending with the creation of a financial legacy. Throughout, he says that the onus is on you to fund the retirement you want, although he emphasizes that it may not be as difficult as it looks.
 ''You've succeeded in many other parts of your life,'' he says, ''and I've no doubt that with the right mind-set, the proper information and research and the kind of dedication that you have demonstrated in other areas of your life, your million-dollar mission will be a success.'' 
 The authors of ''Millionaire by Thirty'' (Business Plus, $22.99) contend that you may not have to work that hard. 
 In this book, Douglas R.Andrew, assisted by his sons -- Emron D. Andrew and Aaron R. Andrew -- builds on some of the arguments he made in ''Missed Fortune 101''(Business Plus, $23.99). For the financially unsophisticated -- a description that probably applies to a substantial number of people in their 20s, the book's target audience -- many of their strategies would be extremely risky.
 The book starts on solid ground, suggesting that young adults should not be in a hurry to pay off their student loans, because the rates are usually low and the interest deductible. And they recommend owning a home, instead of renting, because mortgage debt is deductible and houses usually appreciate. 
 Things start to get dicey when they argue that real estate is a great way to become a millionaire. They are big believers in buying numerous properties, arguing that real estate is safer than stocks.
 They never define what they mean by safer. The current housing crisis has taught many investors that housing isn't entirely safe. Nonetheless, if the authors mean ''less volatile,'' they may be right. Despite the current turmoil, housing prices over the long term have been more stable than those of stocks. 
 But less risk means generally means less reward. The National Association of Realtors says on its Web site that typically ''home values rise at the general rate of inflation plus 1.7 percentage points.'' Since 1926, inflation has averaged a little more than 3 percent a year. If we accept the association's numbers, that means the average house price has climbed about 5 percent a year, notwithstanding the current downturn.
 By comparison, stocks over that time have returned 10.4 percent, annualized, and bonds 5.5 percent, according to Ibbotson Associates.
 Given the lagging returns for real estate, how do you make your fortune with it? Through leverage, the book contends.
 Here's the sort of thing it recommends. (The example is ours. Theirs takes many pages to explain.)
 Say you put down just 10 percent to buy a $400,000 home. If it appreciates 10 percent in one year -- the kind of market climb the book is fond of hypothesizing -- then, in theory, you have made 100 percent on your money. You put down only $40,000 (10 percent of $400,000), and the house, on paper, is now worth $40,000 more than you paid.
 The authors say you can then take that $40,000 out of the house, by refinancing, using the profits to buy another house or to fund another investment.
 Piece of cake, right? Well, no. First, their examples mention no transaction costs, like fees for refinancing, or points on mortgages. Second, leverage can cut both ways. If that $400,000 home drops 10 percent in value in a year and you sell, you are out your entire $40,000. If you time the market correctly, you can become extremely rich, but timing is tricky.
 What isn't tricky is this: If a 28-year-old saves $400 a month until the age of 65, and the money earns 8 percent a year, she will end up with slightly more than $1 million. It won't happen by 30. But she won't have to worry about being wiped out by a housing crisis.

HEADLINE: Stretching for a New Film Role: The Lead

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

 BODY:
 MOST of the time when people recognize him on the street, they ask if he was their high school classmate. No, he politely responds in his distinctive, gravelly baritone. Richard Jenkins is an actor -- one you did not go to high school with, unless you happen to be from DeKalb, Ill., but have probably seen a dozen times on screens big and small. Try to place exactly where you saw him, though, and you might find yourself at a loss.
 He has played characters created by John Updike and the Coen brothers. He was the psychiatrist in ''There's Something About Mary'' who pretended to listen as Ben Stiller's character droned on about his romantic problems. In ''Flirting With Disaster'' he was the gay federal agent who ran through the desert in his underwear after inadvertently eating a meal laced with drugs. He's been the ghost of an undertaker who gets pulverized by a bus in ''Six Feet Under'' and Woody Allen's doctor in ''Hannah and Her Sisters.''
 But now, after playing supporting roles for the better part of three decades, he is finally getting his shot at being the leading man. 
 In ''The Visitor,'' a new film by Thomas McCarthy that opens in New York and Los Angeleson Friday, Mr. Jenkins plays Walter Vale, a lonely, bored and widowed economics professor who finds his orderly life shaken and then transformed by two illegal immigrants he discovers in his Manhattan pied-a-terre.
 Vale is in many ways a reflection and creation of Mr. Jenkins himself. Both are contemplative and earnest men, making it difficult to tell where Mr. Jenkins ends and Vale begins. 
 That is because Mr. Jenkins worked directly with Mr. McCarthy, who wrote the script with the actor in mind, to shape Vale's character development. The actor and director collaborated on the character's every trait, from the lines he speaks to the glasses he wears.
 ''I understood this man,'' Mr. Jenkins, a slender-framed man of 60, said in an interview here at a cafe just a few blocks from Trinity Repertory Company, the theater where he spent almost 20 years as an actor and, eventually, artistic director. ''I understood his reluctance to reach out, to become part of things.''
 By his own admission Mr. Jenkins sometimes requires a jump-start to get into first gear. He's perfectly content in his comfort zone. He often needs a little motivation from his wife, he said, even for the littlest things, like trying a new restaurant or taking a vacation someplace they have never visited. 
 Mr. Jenkins's role in ''The Visitor'' began to take shape about four years ago, when he and Mr. McCarthy first sat down over lunch to discuss the possibility of working together. 
 ''About a year and a half later he called me and said: 'I wrote this script. Would you take a look at it?' '' Mr. Jenkins recalled. ''He sent me the script, and I read it, and I just loved it. I mean, I just loved it. And I said to him, 'Nobody's going to give you any money to do this movie with me in the lead.' He said: 'That wasn't my question. My question was, do you want to do it?' And I said, 'Absolutely.' ''
 Mr. McCarthy, an actor who made his directorial debut in 2003 with ''The Station Agent,'' did not see Mr. Jenkins's lack of star power as a problem; he saw it as an asset. ''I felt like I needed an actor who could really vanish into the role and maybe someone who wasn't immediately recognizable as a Hollywood star,'' Mr. McCarthy said in a telephone interview. ''He could really play the everyman, the average American, and be really believable.'' 
 A Hollywood stereotype Mr. Jenkins is not. For the last four decades he has lived in the Providence area, where he and his wife, Sharon, raised a son and a daughter. Ms. Jenkins, a dancer turned choreographer and his wife of 39 years, still works with Trinity Rep, where Mr. Jenkins got his start as a professional actor right after college in the Midwest. He spent 14 seasons with the theater and later four years as its artistic director, making time for the occasional small part in films like ''And the Band Played On'' and ''Wolf.''
 Mr. Jenkins, whose taste in cars tends toward Toyota Camry hybrids, tries as hard as he can to stay out of the limelight. That has been difficult lately. He is about to embark on a publicity tour for ''The Visitor,'' and it's a part of the actor's life he finds a little awkward. ''I don't do this,'' he told a reporter as he fidgeted nervously with a piece of paper during an interview over lunch. ''I've been fortunate. I've been able to do lots of different things. And I don't know why, but I have.''
 He seems truly at home at Trinity Rep, which is housed in a majestic, renovated theater in downtown Providence. On a recent visit there the staff welcomed him with warm embraces and gleeful greetings. A black-and-white picture of him still hangs on a wall in the lobby.
 ''This is just a great little space,'' he said, standing in the aisle of one of the auditoriums and taking in the smell of freshly cut wood from the set. ''I love coming back here. I love the feeling.'' The four seasons he spent as the theater's artistic director seem to have carried over to his career as a screen actor. Mr. McCarthy recalled a scene in ''The Visitor'' in which Mr. Jenkins's character tries to flirt with the mother of Tarek, one of the immigrants who has been living in his apartment. Vale, a creature of strict habit, arrives wearing new glasses.
 Those spectacles -- with sleek, thin frames compared with the big, clunky pair he wore earlier -- were Mr. Jenkins's idea and written into the script at his suggestion to show how the straight-laced Vale is taking baby steps toward loosening up. ''It's a lovely touch,'' Mr. McCarthy said, ''and it really reveals a lot about the character.'' 
 Mr. McCarthy said Mr. Jenkins connected with his role at a level of intimacy he has rarely seen from actors. The night he screened ''The Visitor'' for Mr. Jenkins and his wife, Mr. McCarthy said, the bond of actor to character was obvious.
 ''He didn't say anything for a long time,'' Mr. McCarthy said. ''Then he finally said, 'I've been waiting my whole career to do a movie like this.' And he said it in such a way that was so honest. For me, those are the moments you live for.''

HEADLINE: Milestone for Tunnels, and a Second Set Coming

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
TO many commuters, the two tunnels that connect New Jersey and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan seem so ordinary that they barely give them a second thought -- except, perhaps, when their train breaks down inside them.
 Yet when the Pennsylvania Railroad blasted the final pieces of rock out of the tunnels to complete the underground link a century ago this week, they were hailed by many as an engineering marvel and the product of foresight and gumption.
 The Gilded Age tunnels have performed remarkably well and defied skeptics -- including some of the engineers who built them and doubted their durability. Each business day, about 150,000 passengers on 337 New Jersey Transit trains roll through the 6,100-foot-long cast iron tubes, which are owned and operated by Amtrak, which itself runs 104 trains. Another 39 empty New Jersey Transit trains use the tunnel. 
 But the tunnels reached their peak-hour capacity in 2003 when the Secaucus, N.J., transfer hub opened. So New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are planning to spend $7.6 billion to build a second set of tunnels that will more than double, to 48 an hour, the number of trains that can traverse the Hudson. 
 The project, called Access to the Region's Core, or ARC, is in some ways as monumental as the first tunnels, which cost the Pennsylvania Railroad $111 million, a price tag that included the old Pennsylvania Station and four other tunnels under the East River. (It's about $2.5 billion now when accounting for inflation.)
 If federal approval is given this summer and grants are secured later this year, construction will begin in early 2009 and take eight years to finish. Contractors will deploy boring machines the length of football fields to drill through granite, schist and other materials, use laser-guided satellite signals to pinpoint their location, and carve a path under 34th Street so wide that commuters will be able to walk underground to 14 subway lines, and to PATH, Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and Long Island Rail Road trains.
 The sophisticated machinery completely dwarfs the equipment used a century ago, when legions of sandhogs, or underground construction workers, risked their lives toiling in high-pressurized chambers slopping silt into carts that were hauled away by mules. But in other ways, the techniques for boring through hard rock and under riverbeds and serpentine city streets remain remarkably similar to those used a century ago. 
 ''The principles back then were almost the same except today, things are more mechanized and automated,'' said Howard Sackel, the deputy chief of the tunnel project.
 The ARC tunnels are part of a larger tableau of civil projects that include the construction of the Second Avenue subway and the East Side Access project that will bring L.I.R.R. trains to a station adjacent to Grand Central Terminal. Some pundits have compared these days of large-scale projects to when master builders like Robert Moses reshaped New York's landscape with aplomb.
 But many of these projects were designed decades ago, when New York's existing bridges, tunnels and rail lines had already reached capacity. In that light, many transportation officials view the ARC project as an urgent necessity, not unlike the first tunnels that were designed so riders could avoid crossing the Hudson by ferry.
 ''We're still living off the past in many ways, and we have to think big again,'' said Rae Zimmerman, the director of the Institute for Civil Infrastructure Systems at New York University. ''But we also really have to keep up the level of service because these big projects can take 20 to 30 years to build.''
 The ARC project has its skeptics, just like the first tunnels, which were championed by Alexander Cassatt, the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. He had to win over shareholders who viewed the project as an expensive folly, as well as politicians in New York City who worried that the vast construction project would dilute their power by displacing so many residents.
 These days, critics complain that the project would cost billions of dollars more than is currently projected and would overburden already crowded Midtown streets. Others say that the project is not ambitious enough, and that it should be extended to Grand Central Terminal. And critics say that the new annex would be too far underground and not part of other plans to redevelop the area around Pennsylvania Station.
 ''Having New Jersey Transit unilaterally place its commuters in a dead-end dungeon, we lose mobility,'' said Albert L. Papp Jr., secretary of the National Association of Railroad Passengers. ''For billions of dollars, we lose access to Penn Station and don't get access to Grand Central Terminal.''
 Like agency officials, though, many critics agree that in an era when transportation dollars are in short supply, securing money for new tunnels is critical.
 While executives at New Jersey Transit and the Port Authority lobby Congress for up to $3 billion, a team of 200 engineers and architects has been busy planning every aspect of the project so construction can begin as soon as possible.
 The westernmost part of the project is above ground at the Frank R. Lautenberg Station at Secaucus Junction, N.J., where a loop will be built so that instead of heading only to Hoboken, some Main, Bergen and Pascack Valley Line trains can head directly into Manhattan.
 New Jersey Transit will use much of the rock and silt excavated from the tunnels to raise an 80-acre vacant lot in Kearny by 20 feet. That will create the extra space needed for trains to park at midday.
 A second set of tracks will be built parallel to the existing Northeast Corridor route from Secaucus to North Bergen and the western edge of the Palisades. The new tracks, though, will veer south at Tonnelle Avenue and the entrance to the new tunnels.
 There, a special hard-rock boring machine will begin its 5,000-foot descent to the river in Hoboken, where the tunnels will enter the Hudson a little more than 100 feet below ground. The distance and depth are no accident. Like the older tunnels, the new ones will have a grade of no more than 2 percent. Anything steeper and a train's steel wheels slip on the steel rails.
 ''The character of steel has not changed much in the last century,'' said Arthur D. Silber, the chief of the ARC project.
 Geologists have taken 20,000 feet of core samples and determined that the Palisades here are filled with hard, abrasive diabase and sandstone. Workers a century ago used dynamite and rock drills to claw through the stone.
 These days, operators sitting in an unpressurized chamber of a hard rock boring machine do the heavy lifting. They use computers to direct the machine. A drill in front of the shield takes samples of the rock ahead.
 In front of the shield, a rotating disc with a diameter of just under 30 feet that is outfitted with about 20 specially designed teeth, chews away at the hill and spits out rocks the size of charcoal briquets. The stones roll past the shield and are carried back along the threads of a giant turning screw, which dumps the rocks onto a conveyor belt.
 The machine will cover up to 50 feet a day, and it will move with far greater precision and with far less dangerous blasting than a century ago.
 The most dramatic changes in construction techniques, though, are those for drilling under the river. A hundred years ago, engineers pushed iron shields that weighed up to 200 tons through the silt and clay. Nine small doors on the shield were opened at different times to allow silt and clay to pass through them like a sieve into a pressurized chamber, where workers loaded the material onto carts.
 Workers also removed debris -- boulders, wooden poles from wharves -- that were blocking the shields' path.
 As the shields moved forward, workers installed 11-ton cast iron rings that were bolted in by hand to form the circular body of the tunnel. The liner plates were 30 inches wide and once secured, were used as leverage for pistons that pushed the shield forward by precisely another 30 inches.
 ''As the sandhogs became seasoned, they could install one two-foot-six-inch ring in two hours,'' Jill Jonnes, the author of ''Conquering Gotham'' (Viking Adult), which details the building of the tunnels and Pennsylvania Station, said in an interview. ''If there were round-the-clock shifts, on the best of days, a shield on one side of the river could progress 30 feet.'' 
 To speed the construction of the tunnels, the Pennsylvania Railroad had teams on both sides of the Hudson race to get to the state line under the river. (The New York team ultimately won.) This meant that each time a plate was installed, the engineers had to determine their location to ensure they were on track to meet the team advancing from the opposite shore.
 Charles Jacobs, chief engineer of the North River tunnels, told a reporter at the time that this was a ''simple problem of trigonometry.'' Surveyors would use 100-foot lengths of piano wire inside the tunnel and towers on both shores to confirm that they were on the correct path. 
 ''They would check every five or six rings to make sure they were straight,'' said Bernie Martin, a professional engineer at Parsons Brinckerhoff and an expert on tunnel construction. ''Nowadays, it's like navigating a space ship. The accuracy is superb.''
 Surveyors often discovered that they were off course, sometimes by several feet. When one of the tunnels from New Jersey was two feet too high, heavier rings were used in the hope of sinking the tunnel farther. Even after the tunnels were completed and left to settle in the silt, some engineers considered bolting the tunnel to the bedrock if the tunnel shifted too much.
 ''No one knew if that tunnel was 100 percent safe until trains had been going through it for many years,'' Ms. Jonnes said. ''They really didn't know how long the tunnels would keep sinking in the mud and whether they would crack. There was no precedent for a tunnel having hundreds of 700-ton trains going though them.''
 To this day, the tunnels continue to drift ever so slightly in the riverbed.
 This time, engineers will use an earth pressure balance machine to bore from New Jersey all the way to New York, and then switch to a hard rock machine to burrow under Manhattan.
 The front of the machine, similar to the hard rock borer, absorbs muck and passes it through the shield. As the machine moves forward, 12-inch- and 18-inch-thick concrete segments will be put into the place behind the shield to form the wall of the tunnels. Some contractors use precast segments, while others pour concrete into forms. In both cases, gaskets are inserted in the seams between the segments to keep water and mud from seeping in.
 To determine the tunnel's location, lasers send coordinates from the boring machine back to the tunnel opening and up to global positioning satellites. Instead of dozens of sandhogs toiling in high-pressure chambers forever in danger of getting the bends, 6 to 10 workers operate the earth pressure balance machine.
 When the original tunnels were built, engineers dug a three-block-wide trench from 12th Avenue to Seventh Avenue to form the West Side railyards and the tracks under Penn Station. They drew up plans for two more tunnels.
 The new tunnels will enter Manhattan between 28th and 29th Streets about 150 feet below ground to avoid a historical bulkhead at the river's edge, the Hudson River Park and what is expected to become the extension of the No. 7 subway line that is supposed to run along 11th Avenue.
 The tunnels will run northeast to 10th Avenue and split into lower and upper tunnels that will form a two-tiered cavern with six tracks under 34th Street. The station will extend from Eighth Avenue to Sixth Avenue, with a ''tail'' to Fifth Avenue for trains to park.
 Some transportation advocates say the new station will be a security issue because it will be more than 150 feet deep. They also note that the six tracks will be far from Penn Station, making changing trains difficult.
 ''There is a perception in public that this is not a deep cavern, that it's just below the street,'' said Joseph M. Clift, a transportation consultant and a member of the Regional Rail Working Group. ''It sounds like fear mongering, but it's an attractive target.''
 Other transportation advocates say the construction costs are likely to soar, which could mean many more fare increases. They also question whether New Jersey Transit and other agencies have ensured that the additional 60,000 commuters who are expected to use the new station by 2030 do not overwhelm the nearby streets.
 ''Where do these extra people go when there's no room for them now?'' asked Kyle Wiswall, general counsel of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. ''As much of your commute is getting from the station to your office.''
 Mr. Silber of New Jersey Transit said that the extra passengers going through the new station would be a ''small contributor to the street traffic,'' and that his agency is working with the city and New York State to develop a comprehensive plan to address the additional pedestrians.
 In a report released last month, analysts at the Regional Plan Association called for the tunnels to be extended from 34th Street to near Grand Central Terminal so commuters working on the East Side do not need to clog the subways and streets getting to and from their offices.
 But they concede that their proposal is the second phase of the project, and that it is important to set aside differences so construction can begin on the first phase.
 ''Before you can get to Madison Avenue, let's get the funding in place, get the thing under construction and then figure out what's next,'' said Jeffrey Zupan, a senior fellow for transportation at the association.

HEADLINE: Expensive Lessons In Emerging Markets

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
INVESTORS in emerging-market funds have been scrambling to cope with widespread declines, but the situation has been particularly painful for those who poured money into China.
 From Nov. 1 through March, the typical foreign stock fund fell about 16 percent, said Bill Rocco, a senior analyst at Morningstar. But during those same five months, most funds that invest primarily in China have lost up to 40 percent of their value, Mr. Rocco said.
 Those steep losses are a reminder of how risky developing-country funds can be, said Mr. Rocco, who added that he does not believe most individual investors should be making bets on particular markets. 
 ''If you're one of those people who discovered China funds late last summer, it's been pretty bad,'' he said.
 Diversified emerging-market funds provide plenty of exposure to foreign markets that have high growth potential with less risk, he said. Investors who just cannot resist the siren call of the latest country whose stock market is on a tear, Mr. Rocco said, should spread out purchases of single-country funds over several months to test their tolerance for sudden dips and to avoid plunging in at the peak.
 That advice could have saved some of the billions that evaporated so swiftly in the last few months. According to Brad Durham, managing director of EPFR Global, a fund research firm, investors pumped $50 billion into emerging-market stock funds last year.
 Almost all of it -- about $45 billion -- came in the last quarter, Mr. Durham said. That means the net inflow into those funds in three months was about double what they had previously received in a good year, he said.
 Much of that money was chasing the higher returns available in those markets, but a lot of it was fleeing the troubles in the United States, including the declining purchasing power of the dollar, Mr. Durham said.
 But as stock prices slid worldwide, the money flowed right out again. In the first quarter this year, emerging-market funds had net outflows of about $20 billion, he said.
 This year, most of the action in emerging-market funds has been in those with the most exposure to commodity-rich countries like Russia and Brazil and to the regions of the Middle East and Africa, he said.
 Russia funds had net inflows of more than $1 billion in the first quarter. They had underperformed for years, Mr. Durham said, because of fears about what Vladimir V. Putin, the president who tangled with the country's oligarchs, might do next. But the election last month of Dmitry A. Medvedev to succeed Mr. Putin has quelled some of those concerns, Mr. Durham said.
 ''Now that the political situation in Russia has been clarified,'' he said, ''I think Russia is a pretty attractive market.'' 
 When Justin Leverenz, who manages the $12 billion Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund, returned from Moscow recently, he was not raving about the investment opportunities there. Instead, Mr. Leverenz was more excited about the bargains he said he saw in technology companies whose fortunes are tied to the American economy.
 He said he thought investors had turned too sour on some established franchises that depend on the West for much of their business. Two of his favorites are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Infosys Technologies, a technology services company based in India. Taiwan Semiconductor's profits have been growing more than 15 percent a year, but its stock now sells for about 12 times its per-share earnings ''based on the view that semiconductors are cyclical and the U.S. economy is going down the toilet,'' Mr. Leverenz said. ''It's seriously mispriced.''
 Infosys, a prime beneficiary of the trend toward offshoring of technology services, is an ''enormous'' business that will be offering more software-based services to clients in the United States and Europe, he said. Its stock is cheaper now than during the dot-com boom of the late 1990's, he said, because of the perception that there will be an ''apocalyptic retreat'' in spending on information technology.
 Mr. Leverenz said he had also been buying shares of some of the biggest companies in Mexico, including Grupo Televisa, the broadcaster, and Banorte, a bank.
 BUT despite being a Mandarin speaker who lived in and around China for 10 years, Mr. Leverenz said, he had relatively little money invested there.
 ''In my mind, China is the most durable emerging market in terms of breadth,'' he said. But in recent years, he said, most stock prices there had become ''just totally nonsensical.'' 
 ''The prices for much of the emerging world were wildly out of whack,'' Mr. Leverenz said. ''That's why this year we're seeing a big pullback. The math didn't work. The underlying expectations were too high, and we're getting a natural correction.''
 The good news for investors who still have an appetite for emerging markets, he said, is that the cleanup after the storm is probably more than halfway complete.

FIDELITY 
 By Grace Paley. 
 83 pp. Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $20. 
 Take this quiz. Was Grace Paley, who died in 2007 at 84, (a) a poet or (b) a fiction writer? The answer is (c) a dramatist. 
 Both in the stories that made her famous and in her little-known poems, Paley most often wrote in voices -- essentially, dramatic monologues and dialogues. Many speakers in her fiction had some Yiddish in their heads (as did she; her parents were Russian Jewish immigrants to Manhattan's Lower East Side), although she could evoke Irish-inflected speech with charming accuracy, too. Her best stories, often so short and telegraphic you could call them sketches, imparted theatrical vividness, as if talented actors were performing them. 
 Paley had the playwright's gift, as well, of manifesting her imagery, not just verbalizing it. In the story ''Faith in a Tree,'' for instance, the narrator's point of view is literally from on high. We're at a playground, where Faith Darwin, an oxymoronically-named mother (and recurrent Paley character), assumes an amusingly godlike vantage on everyone else: ''I am sitting on the 12-foot-high, strong, long arm of a sycamore, my feet swinging.'' A symbolic tree has been set onstage, and we don't demand a real one. The nature description here is about as elaborate as we ever get in Paley. Self-consciously beautiful writing is not what she's after: people, after all, don't talk that way.
 In a preface to her 1994 ''Collected Stories,'' Paley recounted her seismic genre-shift in the 1950s. She had written poetry since childhood, but ''I was beginning to feel the storyteller's pain: Listen! I have to tell you something! I simply hadn't known how to do it in poetry.'' 
 A perfectly good argument can be made that the story-writer Paley, who went on making poems until her last days, wasn't a ''real'' poet. (She studied briefly at the New School with a great one -- W. H. Auden -- whose influence is wholly undetectable in her work.) Adept enough at rhyme and meter, she could provide believable lyrics ostensibly written by the taxicab driver/pop song writer in the title story of her collection ''Enormous Changes at the Last Minute'': ''I will call you and together / We will cuddle up and see / What the weather's like in Key West / On the old-age home TV.'' And yet her best poetry can usually be described simply as economical, convincing speech that breaks into roughly rhythmic lines. She employs few formal techniques; when she tries devices like alliteration, for instance, she tends to overdo them: ''uprooted storm-thrown hemlock / (hurricane of 'thirty-eight) a humped / and heaving graveyard.'' 
 That quotation is from ''Fidelity,'' her final book, and in it Paley reproduces with touching fidelity what it is to be old, and sick, and missing one's vanished friends, and philosophical up to a point -- but unwilling to part with dear life. The authenticity of her response to experience, which includes political protest (she never stopped being a liberal activist, even on the page), remains winning as ever. I was surprised how much I liked a poem such as ''The Hard-Hearted Rich,'' for instance, which in its last lines rises above its tired premise. After refusing smugly to give coins to beggars, at the end of the day the rich in their beds ''decide to try / love as a kind of heart softener / they are tired and think to try love.'' 
 Those odd blank gaps within lines, a frequent choice in Paley's verse, and her paucity of capitalization and punctuation, create a somewhat E. E. Cummings effect; but then Cummings owed much to Emily Dickinson. Where Dickinson used capitals and dashes to create unexpected pauses, and thus to heighten meaning, Paley uses lowercase letters and white space. It's hard not to hear Dickinson's ''I'm Nobody! Who are you? / Are you -- Nobody -- too?'' behind Paley's untitled poem that begins ''before I was nobody / I was me after / I was nobody I / was me.'' 
 To know your identity, you must presumably be equipped with memory; but here we have a self-aware poetry of old age in which loss of memory is accepted for what it becomes -- a new facet of one's identity. ''On Occasion'' begins: 
 I forget the names of my friends and the names of the flowers in my garden my friends remind me Grace it's us the flowers just stand there stunned by the sun
 The minimal capitalization and punctuation allows the author's own name, and the power of the word Grace, to leap off the page. And the friends whose names are at least ''on occasion'' forgotten are re-named by way of the set-apart, intimate phrase ''it's us.'' 
 To distinguish speakers in her fiction, Paley often favored an initial long dash, rather than quotation marks, and sometimes she provided no indication at all, not even ''he said'' or ''she said.'' Such techniques are inherently poetic, if we take intentional ambiguity as one of poetry's hallmarks. Paley's poem ''I Met a Woman on the Plane'' (its childlike title is knowingly naive) conveys the speaker's empathetic identification with a stranger's story: 
 I liked her a lot she'd had five children no she'd had six one died at twenty-three days
 Who's making the correction ''no she'd had six'' -- the author or her new friend? The remaining lines make the answer only less clear, and better for that. 
 Most of the poems in ''Fidelity'' aren't as successful as those quoted here. Yet they consistently appeal in their wry but heartfelt voices, their dramatization of the human condition. In the title poem, Paley salutes (with strong echoes of Dickinson's meters and vocabulary) the pleasure of reading fiction:
 the characters were now my troubled companions I knew them understood I could reenter these lives without loss so firm my habitation
 Speaking now to us from the grave, Paley is writer, character, actor -- a wise companion. Though offstage, her voice seems likely to be heard a long while.

HEADLINE: Holding On

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The New York Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
There is a street in northern Vermont, called Spear Street, that I think of as one of the more appealing places anybody could live. It starts at the campus of the University of Vermont, but in a matter of minutes, as drivers head south out of Burlington, they find themselves in a classic landscape of barns, silos and rolling farmland. To the west, rising above Lake Champlain, are the tiered Adirondack Mountains. In the late afternoon, with the sun washing over the hills, the view is hard to beat.
 What has always struck me about the area, though, isn't just its beauty. It's that Spear Street manages to feel so removed from urban bustle without being especially isolated. On it, you are only minutes from a university, a minor-league baseball team, an annual Mozart festival, some pretty good skiing and downtown Burlington. Spear Street manages to combine the old bourgeois fantasy of retreating to the countryside with the newer one of never being too far from a Starbucks. 
 Thanks to the digital revolution, the number of people who can act on this fantasy should be bigger than ever. With the aid of BlackBerries, Wi-Fi, corporate intranets and high-speed data downloading, white-collar workers -- some, that is -- can leave behind Boston or New York without leaving behind their jobs. I've been driving Spear Street for almost 20 years now, going back and forth between relatives who live on either side of Burlington, and I have sometimes wondered why I still live in New York.
 As you might expect, houses on Spear Street have gotten more expensive during that time. Since the mid-1990s alone, prices have roughly doubled, which seems like a big jump. But relative to what has happened in many big cities, it's actually not much of an increase at all. In 1996, $300,000 would have bought you either a four-bedroom house on Spear Street, with a sunset view from the upper floors, or a small two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan. Today the house would sell for about $600,000, while the apartment would cost more than $1 million. For a longtime New York homeowner thinking about relocating, Spear Street has actually gotten more affordable.
 This isn't because of anything unique to northern Vermont, either. One of the defining features of the great turn-of-the-century housing bubble was the degree to which it made the nation's most expensive cities even more expensive. Throughout the 1980s and early '90s, a typical home in the San Francisco area sold for about twice as much as the average home nationwide. By the time the real estate market peaked, in 2006, San Francisco was more than three times as expensive as an average city (like Philadelphia, Raleigh or Colorado Springs). Other similarly expensive real estate markets -- New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington -- also widened their lead over almost everyplace else.
 Now, of course, the boom is over. For the first time since the government began keeping records in 1950, the price of a typical house in the United States fell last year. It seems perfectly reasonable to imagine that the bust will hit especially hard in the cities that boomed the most. Telecommuting really is easier than ever today, for one thing. And many stretched middle-class families would seem to have good reason to leave expensive cities, which would bring prices there down. Yet the gap between the most expensive cities and almost everywhere else is now wider than it has been in decades, if not longer. This seems to be one of those anomalies -- like dot-com companies with soaring stock prices and no profits -- that shouldn't be able to survive a bursting bubble. 
 But that's not exactly how the bust is playing out so far. Prices are indeed falling in San Francisco and New York. But they're falling fastest in another category of once booming areas, like Las Vegas, Phoenix, Sacramento and South Florida. These were the places that seemed to be on the leading edge of a flight to affordability. Refugees from big coastal cities came to these areas, in part because they were more affordable. Once real estate in the most expensive cities no longer seemed to be a can't-miss investment, you might have thought more people would flee, bringing prices down sharply. That would further shrink the gap between a place like San Francisco and one like Sacramento. Instead, the gap is growing again.
 There is a smaller-scale version of this trend occurring within many metropolitan areas, too. While the commuter towns 25 to 50 miles east of Los Angeles are in the midst of a true real estate crash, the Beverly Hills market is hanging in there. In the 90210 ZIP code, prices haven't fallen much, and sales dropped only 7 percent between the fourth quarter of 2006 and the fourth quarter of last year. In a handful of high-end ZIP codes -- including 10583 (Scarsdale, N.Y.), 94040 (Mountain View, Calif.) and 95014 (Cupertino, Calif.) -- sales were flat or even rose over the past year. 
 The real estate business is full of cliches that offer tidy explanations for all of this. Doubtless, you have heard one of them: Manhattan is an island; there is no more land in Beverly Hills; houses in good school districts hold their value; it's the up-and-coming neighborhoods that always get hit hardest. The idea is that valuable real estate, by definition, cannot become overvalued.
 But even a few minutes of contemplation exposes the shallowness of this argument. Valuable items end up becoming overvalued all the time. The technology bubble of the 1990s, for instance, lifted the stocks of both the likes of Pets.com and solid companies like Microsoft, Intel and even General Electric. Each of these giants was in fact benefiting from the digital revolution, but their stocks still became overvalued. Each trades for less today than it did in 2000. 
 Even more to the point, the real estate market has proved the cliches wrong in the recent past. Between the end of 1989 and the end of 1995, the per-square-foot price of homes in Beverly Hills fell 36 percent, according to DataQuick, a research firm that tracks sales and prices by ZIP code. Adjusted for inflation -- which is the better way to think about any price -- the decline was almost 50 percent. During those same years, Manhattan was going through its own slump. Jason Haber, a real estate agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman, recently reminded me of a scene in the 1991 movie ''Regarding Henry,'' in which the character played by Annette Bening laments the fact that her apartment is worth less than it was five years earlier. I won't be too surprised if New Yorkers are saying the same thing in 2011.
 What, then, can explain the contours of this housing bust? The best answer is that the sheer scale of the bubble obscured another -- in all likelihood, more lasting -- trend: despite all the ways that technology has made distance matter less, geography matters more. It may be easier to transport an individual job from New York to Vermont, but the value of being in New York is actually greater than it used to be. 
 ''The essence of cities is physical proximity,'' explains Edward Glaeser, a Harvard professor who specializes in the economics of geography. ''They've always had the advantage of making the movement of people easier, the movement of goods easier and the movement of ideas easier.'' What has changed over the last few decades, Glaeser says, is that good ideas -- be they in finance, entertainment, technology -- have become much more valuable. The best ones can be turned into products that are soon being sold all over the world, thanks to globalization, FedEx, the Internet and a host of other forces. But it's still much easier to come up with a good idea when you are surrounded by a lot of other people working on the same problems as you are. 
 The textbook example is Silicon Valley. In 1955, the physicist William Shockley set up a semiconductor laboratory in Mountain View, partly to be near his mother in Palo Alto. Some employees of Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory later left the company to found Fairchild Semiconductor, and Fairchild alumni in turn founded Intel. In 1980, an Intel salesman named John Doerr quit to become a technology investor, and he helped provide seed money for Netscape, Sun Microsystems and Google, among other companies. The story is not wholly new -- there is a similar one about Detroit in the early 20th century -- but the benefits from this kind of clustering are bigger than ever. The Ford Motor Company wasn't distributing its products in China a dozen years after its founding. Google is.
 As a result, inequality hasn't just increased among workers; it has also increased among cities. In recent years, New York, Boston, Washington and San Francisco have widened their lead in household income and educational attainment over much of the rest of the country. So it makes perfect sense that they have widened their lead in housing prices, too. 
 Mark Zandi, who runs Moody's Economy.com, has built a statistical model designed to predict the proper level for housing prices in every major metro area. The model is based on population, housing supply, income and various other factors. As of the end of last year, Zandi estimated, prices were still 30 percent too high in much of Florida and roughly 25 percent too high in Las Vegas and Phoenix. But prices looked somewhat more sensible in New York (16 percent overvalued), Los Angeles (10 percent), Washington (9 percent), Boston (7 percent) and San Francisco (6 percent). 
 Zandi told me that he thought prices in the high-cost metropolitan areas could fall by even more in the next couple of years, as the psychology of the bust takes hold. The recent turmoil on Wall Street has shown what can happen in the aftermath of euphoria. But he doesn't expect the new geographic inequality to reverse itself anytime soon. Other economists, including Glaeser, agree. However much Americans may fantasize about having a big house in the countryside, or in the exurbs, this is still a golden age for a handful of glamour cities.
 It occurred to me, in the course of thinking about all of this, that I'm part of the problem. For almost a decade now, my wife and I have lived in Manhattan, and we have spent much of that time imagining life in a more affordable place -- Colorado, Connecticut and, yes, northern Vermont. This summer, we are finally going to pull the trigger and leave the city. But where are we moving? To the suburbs of Washington, D.C., where even a little town house costs as much as one of those four-bedroom colonials on Spear Street. .

HEADLINE: A Shift in the Debate Over Global Warming

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
The charged and complex debate over how to slow down global warming has become a lot more complicated.
 Most of the focus in the last few years has centered on imposing caps on greenhouse gas emissions to prod energy users to conserve or switch to nonpolluting technologies. 
 Leaders of the Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change -- the scientists awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year with former Vice President Al Gore -- have emphasized that market-based approach. All three presidential candidates are behind it. And it has framed international talks over a new climate treaty and debate within the United States over climate legislation 
 But now, with recent data showing an unexpected rise in global emissions and a decline in energy efficiency, a growing chorus of economists, scientists and students of energy policy are saying that whatever benefits the cap approach yields, it will be too little and come too late. 
 The economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, head of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, stated the case bluntly in a recent article in Scientific American: ''Even with a cutback in wasteful energy spending, our current technologies cannot support both a decline in carbon dioxide emissions and an expanding global economy. If we try to restrain emissions without a fundamentally new set of technologies, we will end up stifling economic growth, including the development prospects for billions of people.''
 What is needed, Mr. Sachs and others say, is the development of radically advanced low-carbon technologies, which they say will only come about with greatly increased spending by determined governments on what has so far been an anemic commitment to research and development. A Manhattan-like Project, so to speak.
 And time is critical, they say, as China, India and other developing nations march headlong into the modern world of cars and electric consumption on their way to becoming the dominant producer of greenhouse gases for decades to come. Indeed, China is building, on average, one large coal-burning power plant a week.
 In an article in the journal Nature last week, researchers concerned with the economics, politics, and science of climate also argued that technology policy, not emissions policy, must dominate.
 ''There is no question about whether technological innovation is necessary -- it is,'' said the authors, Roger A. Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the University of Colorado; Tom Wigley, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research; and Christopher Green, an economist at McGill University. ''The question is, to what degree should policy focus directly on motivating such innovation?''
 Proponents of treaties and legislation that would cap emissions don't disagree with this call to arms for new, low-carbon technologies. But they say the cap approach should not be ignored, either. 
 One of them is Joseph Romm, a blogger on climate and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a nonprofit group pushing for federal legislation to restrict greenhouse gases.
 ''Of course we need aggressive investments in R. and D. -- I for one have been arguing that for two decades,'' Mr. Romm wrote in a post to his blog, climateprogress.org. ''But if we don't start aggressively deploying the technologies we have now for the next quarter century, then all the new technologies in the world won't avert catastrophe.''
 Another expert who has emphasized the importance of capping emissions, Adil Najam of Boston University, said he hoped this emerging debate would not distract from doing whatever is possible now to curb emissions. 
 ''You can do a tremendous lot with available technology,'' said Professor Najam, one of the authors of the intergovernmental panel's report on policy options. ''It is true that this will not be enough to lick the problem, but it will be a very significant and probably necessary difference.''
 But Professor Pielke and his co-authors say that a recent rise in emissions -- particularly in fast-growing emerging powers -- points to the need for government to push aggressively for technological advances instead of waiting for the market to force reductions in emissions. 
 Mr. Sachs pointed to several promising technologies -- capturing and burying carbon dioxide, plug-in hybrid cars and solar-thermal electric plants. ''Each will require a combination of factors to succeed: more applied scientific research, important regulatory changes, appropriate infrastructure, public acceptance and early high-cost investments,'' he said. ''A failure on one or more of these points could kill the technologies.''
 In short, what is needed, he said, is a ''major overhaul of energy technology'' financed by ''large-scale public funding of research, development and demonstration projects.''
 At the same time, China and India continue to insist that economic growth is both their priority and right. They argue that the established economic powers should be responsible for spearheading the research to reduce carbon emissions. After all, the United States and Europe spent more than a century growing wealthy by burning fossil fuels.
 Developing countries repeatedly made that point last week in Bangkok in the latest round of United Nations talks over the shape of a new climate agreement. But the United States rejected a proposal from China that 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product of industrialized countries be used to disseminate nonpolluting energy technologies. 
 As if to underscore the energy and emissions trajectories in Asia's emerging powerhouses --and the priority placed on growth there and among important international institutions -- the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank is planning to vote on Monday on helping to finance a four-billion-watt complex of coal-burning power plants, the ''Ultra Mega'' complex, in Gujarat State in India.

GRAPHIC: GRAPHICS: WASTED ENERGY: About 56 percent of all energy in the U.S. economy is wasted. Some energy is always lost when fuels are burned and heat escapes. Inefficient technology and design are also culprits. Efficiency's role in cutting emissions is a matter of debate. Most scientists agree that both cleaner fuels and greater efficiency are needed. Here is how much energy goes unused, by sector.
ELECTRICITY: Most is generated from coal and natural gas
the heat from burning those fuels is largely lost. Then transmission lines leach out electricity, as much as 10 percent of what is generated.
TRANSPORTATION: Needed: lighter vehicles with more efficient engines. Plug-in hybrids, using electricity generated from carbon-free sources, could drastically reduce energy loss and emissions.
INDUSTRY: Efficiency can be improved by harnessing excess heat to power production.
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS: Higher efficiency lighting and appliances would decrease energy loss. Reduced demand for heating and cooling from improved insulation and architecture would lower energy use. (Source: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)

HEADLINE: Guitar Licks That Resonate And Lyrics That Linger

BYLINE: By BILLY BRAGG

 BODY:
ON his 12th studio album, ''Mr. Love & Justice'' (Anti-), due out April 22, Billy Bragg, troubadour of the oppressed and bard of the lovelorn, sings about -- you guessed it -- love and justice. Mr. Bragg, 50, fancies himself a bit of a punk rocker who writes songs tinged with soul and folk. His inspiration lies in the protest songs of the 1960s. His blend of humor and outrage is evident in songs like ''The Johnny Carcinogenic Show,'' in which he sings about ''grandchildren you will never know.'' 
 After playing at South by Southwest, on ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and on a bill with the Pogues last month, Mr. Bragg returned home to England to relax with his family at their house on Chessel Beach. He begins his European tour this month with three days of songwriting workshops and a concert at Liverpool Prison on behalf of his foundation, Jail Guitar Doors, which puts guitars in the hands of inmates. He comes to America in June. While looking out his window at the waves, Mr. Bragg spoke by phone with Winter Miller about what he's listening to now. 
 Ry Cooder
 Ry Cooder is probably my guitar hero, as much for what he doesn't play as what he plays. The economy of his playing is something to be admired at a time when guitar players tend to think the more notes you play the better you are. ''My Name Is Buddy'' (Nonesuch) is up my street because it's capital-P Political. It's the story of the Depression told by a cat named Buddy. This does sound a bit odd -- he travels around with a mouse and a frog -- but it works and hangs together beautifully. 
 There's a lot of love in the songs; they fit well in the tradition. Woody Guthrie's spirit runs through this record very strongly. Cooder plays stuff that we now refer to as Americana, but nobody called it that then. His excursions have been great, but for him to come back to where he began is pretty cool. 
 The Hold Steady
 I was drawn to them by their lyrics; they have a wonderful levity. They come out of Craig Finn's mouth at a great velocity. The band looks really ordinary, but their guitars are ecstatic. To my untrained ears they're a mixture of early Bruce Springsteen and Cheap Trick. ''Boys and Girls in America'' (Vagrant) has mostly up-tempo songs, good for jumping up and down in the living room. 
 There are some albums that take you back to your early teens -- before they invented Guitar Hero III -- when you'd get by with your bedroom mirror and a tennis racket for a guitar. This would be my tennis racket album of the year. 
 Grinderman
 I really like ''Grinderman'' (Anti-). It's Nick Cave's side project, and it's very garagey, back-to-basics. He said it's not like ''The Birthday Party,'' but he's a bit disingenuous because it is like that album. 
 There are songs on here that deal with the aging process and how to grow old gracefully. My favorite song is a laugh-out-loud track in which he's trying to get a young lady to consummate their relationship. ''I read her Yeats, I tried my best to stay up late, I fixed the hinges on her gate, but still she just never wanted to.'' He gets more and more exasperated as the song goes on. It's just a cry from the soul. The whole idea of how to be a 50-year-old rock star, Nick Cave gives us a shot in the arm: We can do this. I'm not recommending it out of middle-aged solidarity; it's great. 
 Duke Special
 He's a very interesting-looking guy. He's got dreadlocks, wears eye makeup and a kind of old-style army uniform -- slightly Sgt. Pepper -- and he has a bit of an Ulster brogue. ''Songs From the Deep Forest'' (V2) is a lovely album. Americans might refer to his music as vaudevillian; we would say it's got a musical twist. He writes beautiful songs, mostly love songs, which he sings in a plaintive voice. He's a bit like an Irish Rufus Wainwright; he's got that sort of vibe. He has that sense of drama, except he's not quite as fey as Rufus, he's a little bit more up close and personal. Being a songwriter, I get sucked into the lyrics first. The song ''Portrait'' makes my son and me want to hoof around the kitchen, Gene Kelly style. 
 The View
 ''Hats Off to the Buskers'' (Columbia) drew me in with a really great guitar track on the second song, ''Superstar Tradesman.'' I heard it on the radio, got the single and played the hell out of it. It has Clash-like guitars, and the lyrics are very funny. It's basically talking about someone who's a carpenter or plumber making a lot of money in a town where people aren't making a lot of money. ''You have a house in the ferry and a new guitar that's never been played before and it never will.'' I know guys like that with a Les Paul on a stand in their living room, gathering dust. Might as well put it on the mantelpiece. 
 The View sing as if their lives depended on it, and they have a great joy in what they sing. They've got self-knowledge about what a stupid job we do. I like bands that give a wink and a nod that they know they're having a great time and getting paid for it, hurrah.

HEADLINE: Amid the Upheaval, Opportunity in Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
INFLATION was already creeping up when the credit market's near meltdown last month unleashed a flood of fresh liquidity from the Federal Reserve that could put more upward pressure on prices.
 ''Many investors are worried,'' said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust. They fear ''that the Fed's actions are leading to a surge in inflation,'' Mr. Stern said.
 Among its actions, the Fed sharply lowered short-term interest rates and gave investment banks access to cheap credit at the Fed's discount window, a privilege that had been reserved for commercial banks. 
 If you think this is a textbook argument that prospects are dim for all bonds and bond funds, however, you are probably not looking closely enough. Specialists point to what they consider some appealing opportunities. 
 It is true that a flight to quality has forced down yields on much Treasury debt to the levels of a low student grade-point average, leaving little room for further gains and quite a lot for loss of principal.
 As for corporate bonds, defaults will almost certainly rise as the economy flirts with -- or slips clearly into -- a recession.
 Consider, though, the juicy returns that general market turmoil has provided, for example, in municipal bonds and low-quality corporate bonds.
 Some experts also point to what they regard as good value in bonds backed by commercial mortgages, the sovereign debt of countries riding a commodities boom and loans in which interest rates reset periodically to levels set in financial capitals like London, and which reflect world, not American, rates.
 Municipal bonds, commonly called tax-exempts, have become so appealing that portfolio managers who usually stick with corporate bonds, and even those who run stock funds, are buying them. That is the observation of Mary J. Miller, who supervises $80 billion in fixed-income securities at the T. Rowe Price Group, the Baltimore fund company. 
 Yields on long-term tax-exempts are hovering about one-half of a percentage point above those of taxable Treasury bonds of the same maturity, a dislocation of rare dimension.
 ''This has not happened in my lifetime before -- and I've worked here for 25 years,'' Ms. Miller said. ''It's an extraordinary time.''
 Normally, tax-exempts trade at about 80 percent of Treasury yields. 
 It's not just that safety-seeking investors have driven Treasury yields to the floor. Municipal yields themselves have climbed for various reasons, including forced selling by hedge funds that have ventured into the market and have suffered losses elsewhere. 
 Another factor has been the cloud cast by the suspect viability of some of the municipal bond insurance companies in the continuing global financial crisis.
 ''As long as you have people worrying about whether municipal bonds are backed or not, you're going to have them paying, relative to taxables, what seem to be ridiculously high rates,'' said Gary Silverman, a financial planner and investment manager in Wichita Falls, Tex.
 But because more than half of municipal bonds carry triple-A or double-A ratings on their own, without the backing of insurance, even a disappearance of coverage would leave much choice merchandise at distressed prices.
 Still, investors don't yet seem to be clamoring for municipals. Many investors are still smarting from poor recent price performance of these bonds.
 ''A lot of people are saying, 'Are you sure?' '' said Willard L. Pugh, an income-oriented strategist at Dawson James Securities in Boca Raton, Fla., when he suggests that clients buy more to take advantage of what he calls ''unprecedented'' yields.
 Jeff Tjornehoj, senior research analyst and fixed-income specialists at Lipper, sees a similar reluctance.
 ''It's tough for people to buy them,'' Mr. Tjornehoj said, when recent experience has been so negative. ''We've seen people back away from munis like the plague,'' he added.
 Nevertheless, he cautions against indiscriminate buying. ''There could be more selling into the muni market'' in coming months if general turmoil persists in the credit market, he said. 
 Another attractive part of the bond market, various specialists said, is the high-yield corporate -- often called junk -- sector. Yields there have widened to nearly 8 percentage points above Treasuries from last summer's historic low of about 2 1/2 points.
 Ms. Miller says that this implies a default rate of about 7 percent, but that she thinks it will peak no higher than 5 percent, compared with 1 percent currently. ''We don't think things will get as bad as the market is pricing in,'' she figures. 
 Mr. Pugh also sees value in junk.
 ''There's opportunity in high-yield bond funds,'' he said. He favors the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate fund, which has an expense ratio of one-quarter of 1 percent. ''The spreads are wide, and as the economy improves these bonds will be worth more.''
 But in some areas, appealing yields can be had without major compromises in quality, several analysts said.
 ''Investors are very eager to minimize their exposure to even good-quality bonds,'' creating values for those willing to commit in a risky climate, Mr. Tjornehoj said. 
 In fact, while most analysts contend that Treasury bonds have become far too expensive, Mr. Silverman said he still considers Treasury Inflation Protected Securities worth buying because he believes they will eventually pay off big.
 ''I'm taking the long view,'' he said. With the Fed rapidly pouring liquidity into the economy, ''I have a feeling inflation is going to raise its ugly head.''
 For investors who have never used TIPS, which were slow to be accepted when they were first offered in 1997, Mr. Silverman said, ''it's time to start learning about them.''
 Currently, however, these bonds are so richly priced that the real return on at least one issue has fallen below zero, suggesting that buyers accept current loss of purchasing power to ensure that they won't suffer from inflation in the future. 
 Bonds supported by commercial, not residential, mortgages, are also attracting buyers, as are funds invested in bank loans with rates tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
 There are also overseas attractions, including emerging markets, where heavy demand for raw materials has strengthened credits. 
 Foreign bonds offer not only diversification and substantial yields but also protection against further declines in the dollar, so long as investors use funds that do not hedge currencies. 
 In general, this period, with its market disruption and pockets of irrational pricing, seems no time for investors to cower in the comfort of United States Treasuries. ''I would advise investors to be patient and to maintain a diversified bond portfolio,'' said Ms. Miller at T. Rowe Price. ''I don't think investors should stay on the sidelines and earn just money market returns. There are some unique opportunities that are emerging, and it would be a shame to miss that.''

HEADLINE: The Mortgage Bust Goes Global

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: Basel, Switzerland 

 BODY:
 NORMALLY, St. Jakob's Hall here is home to soccer tournaments or the occasional hockey game. But on a sunny morning in February, the stadium offered a corporate face-off every bit as contentious as any athletic event. More than 6,000 shareholders of the Swiss banking giant UBS packed the house to vent their fury over tens of billions in losses on American subprime mortgages and what they saw as an insult to traditional Swiss values like prudence and thrift.
 The target of their anger wasn't just UBS's chairman, Marcel Ospel, or any of the bank's other top executives, who were arrayed under a giant screen near where goalies usually tend the net. Instead, much of their ire was aimed at the United States itself -- specifically an addiction to high-octane risk-taking, easy credit and dubious financial assumptions that created the domestic mortgage mess in the first place.
 ''The American El Dorado has become a scene from a Western,'' declared one middle-aged shareholder, Therese Klemenz. ''UBS was the figurehead of Swiss business. As a good housewife, I know you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket. A bank is not a casino.'' 
 Thomas Minder, a local shareholder activist, was even more outraged. ''What happened here is a scandal,'' he thundered. ''You're responsible for the biggest loss in the history of the Swiss economy. Put an end to the Americanization of the Swiss economy!'' At that point, Mr. Minder charged the podium, only to be dragged away by security guards.
 While the housing slump has come to dominate American presidential debates and has sent Wall Street into a tailspin, the consequences of millions of foreclosures across the United States are also being felt far overseas. Nowhere is that more true than in this serene land of snowy peaks, ice-cold lakes and staid banks long considered to be among the most cautious in the world.
 Until now, that is. That's because UBS -- with $3.1 trillion in assets, Switzerland's biggest bank -- made an astonishingly large bet on risky mortgage securities. At one point, that wager amounted to $80 billion, a gambit the bank lost. UBS has already been forced to write down about $37 billion of that financial roll of the dice -- more than Citigroup, more than Merrill Lynch, more than any other bank in the world. 
 Last week, after enduring months of fierce criticism, Mr. Ospel abruptly announced that he would step down as chairman later this month. Shares of UBS rallied, but that's cold comfort to people like Mrs. Klemenz, who have watched the stock drop by half since last summer.
 IN Switzerland, they say, if you want to be nice, speak Italian. If you want to be understood, speak French. And if you want to be heard, speak German.
 Like much of the financial and political elite here, Mr. Ospel is Swiss-German, and he speaks fluent English and French. But his style is definitely Teutonic. When a shareholder at the Basel meeting insisted on speaking in Italian, one of Switzerland's four official languages, Mr. Ospel cut him off. 
 ''You can speak Italian if you want to, but I won't understand,'' he said.
 Looking out at the huge crowd over a pair of half-rim glasses, Mr. Ospel, 58, never lost his poise. When a shareholder named Jakob Trump called for him and the rest of the board to resign, adding that ''a normal worker would be sacked for this,'' Mr. Ospel coolly responded, ''Danke, Herr Trump.''
 But during an interview on Friday at UBS's neo-Classical headquarters in downtown Zurich, the steely composure Mr. Ospel brandished at the Basel meeting was gone. Sitting in a plain white conference room adorned with maps of the world and the United States, his hands trembled and his eyes were cast downwards.
 ''I'm the chairman of this firm and ultimately responsible for what has happened,'' he said, taking a long drag on a cigarette. ''But I have the highest respect and confidence for the leadership as it is now in charge.''
 Mr. Ospel said he first became aware of the extent of the threat UBS was facing in early August -- three months after its Dillon Read Capital Management hedge fund unit was shuttered after big trading losses. This was six weeks after the implosion of two highly leveraged Bear Stearns hedge funds kicked off the credit crisis for the rest of Wall Street. 
 ''I remember when I came back from summer vacation, Rohner explained we had this gigantic exposure,'' he recalled, referring to UBS's chief executive, Marcel Rohner.
 Like others at UBS interviewed for this article, Mr. Ospel said the bank's failure stemmed from a fundamental misreading of the market for mortgage securities. But he also acknowledged that the losses showed that UBS's vaunted risk-management system had broken down.
 ''The key issue is that the system operated within its limits, given the assumed quality and liquidity of the assets,'' he said. ''Clearly, there was a problem when you build such a concentrated exposure and it doesn't appear on any of the appropriate radar screens.''
 And he ruefully noted that until UBS's disastrous foray into what turned out to be Wall Street's riskiest market, the bank's success in the United States was a source of satisfaction in Switzerland.
 ''People were proud that a Swiss firm had established such a significant footprint in the most competitive market on the globe,'' he said. ''So the greater the disappointment with what they have had to digest.''
 DISAPPOINTMENT is widespread. ''People now question UBS's ability to manage risk and judge just what a conservative investment is,'' says Dirk Hoffmann-Becking, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. 
 UBS bought mortgage-backed securities on Wall Street, rather than making loans directly to American home buyers with bad credit histories and no assets, but that's a distinction lost on the Swiss public. 
 ''A large part of the population thinks we did what Countrywide did,'' says Mr. Rohner, the UBS chief, referring to Countrywide Financial, the troubled California company that is the largest American mortgage lender. ''People think we gave subprime mortgages in the U.S. We did not.''
 Maybe so, but even after the huge write-downs, UBS still has more than $30 billion in exposure to securities linked to the kind of risky mortgages that Countrywide and other lenders doled out when home prices were still rising. And there's no guarantee that the red ink has been stanched.
 ''We still have positions, and I can't foretell the future,'' Mr. Rohner acknowledges. ''The real issue is that if liquidity dries up, there is no way out.''
 Even UBS's wealth management arm, which is the most popular private bank in the world for wealthy people seeking safety and discretion and has $2.1 trillion in assets, has seen its global luster dimmed by the American losses.
 Although UBS has replaced or forced out many executives, most members of the committee responsible for assessing potential risks remain in senior positions in Zurich. The incoming chairman of UBS, Peter Kurer, was on this committee, as were Marco Suter, the current chief financial officer, and Mr. Rohner.
 These days, UBS executives are rushing around the globe reassuring clients that the bank doesn't face the kind of threats that brought down Bear Stearns last month.
 That's especially true in the United States, where UBS employs roughly 30,000 people, slightly more than in Switzerland itself. In New York, UBS's top investment bankers say they are scrambling to make sure competitors don't try to pick off wary clients. UBS executives also say the bank has no plans to pull back from the American market, despite pressure from many Swiss shareholders to do so.
 While Wall Street giants like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch have seen their chief executives depart amid billions in mortgage-related losses, UBS has been unusually open about its failure to foresee the subprime crisis and the inability of its sophisticated risk-controls to sound alarms. 
 Partly that's because UBS is desperate to shore up its reputation, given scenes like the one here in Basel. But it's also because its top leaders seem puzzled that their bank could lose this much, this fast.
 ''It's been hard emotionally because we were the safe bank, the conservative bank, and we worked very hard on that,'' says Daniel Coleman, an American who is a top equities executive with UBS's investment bank in Stamford, Conn. ''Mortgages were viewed as a safe, liquid asset, which turned out to be wrong.''
 STRETCHING out over the length of two football fields, UBS's open trading floor in Stamford is the largest of its kind in the world. Surrounded by 5,000 computer monitors and a sea of blinking lights, traders at one end of the floor appear as mere specks to their colleagues at the other end. Heating is unnecessary, because all the computers and bodies give off enough heat to warm the room even on the coldest days. The site has its own backup generators as insurance against blackouts. 
 Unlike other European financial heavyweights like Deutsche Bank or Barclays, which failed to establish a major presence on Wall Street over the past decade, UBS has been relatively successful on American shores. A creation of the 1998 megamerger of the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation, UBS went on to acquire the PaineWebber Group, a major American brokerage firm, in 2000. 
 After that, it continued to do well in the fiercely competitive realm of investment banking, and now it ranks not far behind American stalwarts like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Although UBS has advised on megadeals like Procter & Gamble's acquisition of Gillette, the Swiss giant still feels slighted. 
 ''In investment banking, UBS doesn't get its due,'' says J. Richard Leaman III, the joint global head of investment banking at the firm. ''If you asked who is in the top five, I'm not sure our name would come up for the uninformed.''
 Yet, for all the strides UBS made in investment banking in the United States, over the last few years its executives began to feel like laggards in one area that was booming: the mortgage market.
 They watched enviously as rivals like Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch practically minted money in the mortgage frenzy. So, about three years ago, UBS jumped into the fray. 
 ''They were late to the game,'' says Jon Peace, a Lehman Brothers analyst in London. Still, UBS had other advantages, Mr. Peace says, like access to billions of dollars it could borrow at very low interest rates, thanks to its position as the bedrock of conservative Swiss banking.
 In 2005, UBS started buying billions in mortgage-backed securities, profiting from the higher yields these bonds carried and trusting their AAA credit ratings, despite the risks inherent in the underlying mortgages.
 At the same time, its Dillon Read unit was doubling up on the same bets. If all this weren't enough, UBS's fixed-income desk was also scooping up mortgages and repackaging them as securities that could be sold to other investors or simply added to the bank's already-swelling inventory.
 With important parts of the UBS empire gorging on mortgages, profits and revenues rose smartly, Mr. Peace says. But by the beginning of 2007, problems were cropping up as American subprime lenders like New Century filed for bankruptcy. With losses mounting, UBS moved to shut down Dillon Read in early May, making it Wall Street's first casualty of toxic mortgage debt.
 ''We like to say we're in the moving business, not the storage business,'' says Robert Wolf, the president of UBS's investment bank. ''But we got away from that philosophy.''
 UBS officials like Mr. Wolf now blame Dillon Read for adding to the magnitude of the disaster, but a former senior trader at Dillon Read says he warned bank managers in early 2007 that credit markets were on the verge of a meltdown. 
 ''I first started selling in March but they thought we were crazy, that we were panicking,'' recalls this trader, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly discuss UBS affairs. 
 In interviews, this trader, as well as several other former senior managers of UBS, said the company's layered system of management committees compounded the problem. Before major decisions could be put into effect, the investment bank's management committee needed to sign off. Then a special risk-monitoring team had to review it. Lastly, an entity known as the Group Executive Board bestowed the final seal of approval. 
 Or maybe not. In some instances, the chairman's office in Zurich, made up of Mr. Ospel and two other senior Swiss executives, would also weigh in.
 ''UBS's reputation was conservatism, and bureaucracy goes hand in hand with that,'' Mr. Peace says. ''Things were much more controlled out of Zurich at UBS.''
 While bureaucracy offers a buffer against ill-considered investment and trading strategies, once those decisions are set in motion it can cause a bank to be less dexterous when markets turn in unforeseen and unpredictable directions. UBS is Exhibit A for both sides of that divide. 
 The bank's measured, formal pace may have undermined UBS when it collided with rapidly shifting American capital markets. The senior trader from Dillon Read points to the ability of more nimble competitors like Lehman Brothers -- and especially Goldman Sachs -- to speedily reposition themselves; that agility helped them to avoid the worst of the fallout from the mortgage mess. 
 ''No one got out unscathed,'' he says. ''But the committee process inhibited UBS from acting quickly.''
 By the time UBS got around to unloading its hoard of subprime assets late last year, prices for those assets were already plunging. In some cases entire markets were freezing up, making further sales impossible. ''If you compare UBS to other banks, UBS clearly held on to these positions until very late,'' says Mr. Hoffmann-Becking, the Sanford C. Bernstein analyst.
 For Swiss shareholders, however, something more than stunning losses is gnawing at them. They say the larger mystery is why UBS got involved with American-style investment banking in the first place, rather than sticking to its core strengths as a private money manager for the world's wealthy and its traditional banking activities in its home market.
 ''Everyone should know that investment banking is dangerous,'' says Roby Tschopp, managing director of Actares, a Swiss organization that represents shareholders and is one of Mr. Ospel's loudest critics. ''For everyone in Switzerland, UBS remained the big retail bank -- reliable, quiet, ordinary. They didn't know UBS is no longer what they had in mind.''
 TWO months ago, Mr. Leaman, a straight-talking Pennsylvania native who has been with UBS for more than a decade, gathered several hundred of his investment bankers for a town-hall-style meeting in Manhattan. 
 ''I put up a horrible headline on the screen and said: 'This is what you are going to be looking at. This is what you're going to be reading about. This is what you're going to sell,' '' he recalls. 
 His thoughts were prescient. When UBS announced a $13.7 billion write-down last fall, the bank received relatively little media attention in the United States. American banks were revealing their own titanic losses at the time, and UBS stayed beneath the radar. But last week, after announcing a $19 billion write-down, the bank landed on the front page. 
 Mr. Leaman says he has urged his bankers to be candid with customers about the write-downs, while assuring them that ''we're alive and well and very, very much in business.''
 ''If you write down $19 billion, you have to go out and you talk to your clients, quickly,'' he adds. Mr. Leaman and his team scored one notable success recently when UBS was given a key role in the $18 billion initial public offering by Visa last month, the biggest I.P.O. in Wall Street history.
 From the trading floor in Stamford, Mr. Coleman is making similar phone calls, and in some cases he is arranging conversations between Mr. Rohner, the C.E.O., and UBS's trading partners and investors to reassure them. 
 ''Our clients are staying with us,'' Mr. Coleman says. ''It could be a lot worse.''
 Sticking with activities like trading and underwriting now, he argues, will ultimately pay off. He compares the current crisis to the economic downturn that ravaged overseas markets a decade ago. ''We are the best I-bank in Asia today because we didn't pull back in 1998,'' he says.
 UBS, meanwhile, says its private bank is thriving. Even though inflows of new cash have slowed during the subprime debacle, ''the miracle of UBS is that we gather as much net new wealth every year as some private banks have as total assets under management,'' says Marten S. Hoekstra, head of wealth management for the Americas. The bank's total assets in the United States now equal $740 billion, up from $540 billion two years ago.
 Late last year, there were rumors that UBS planned to sell the retail brokerage wing of its former Paine Webber unit, which employs more than 8,000 financial advisers. But Mr. Wolf and other UBS executives say that this business is not for sale.
 Mr. Rohner adds that he is similarly committed to the American market, and he plays down the anger at home. ''The anger wasn't at America,'' he says. ''It was at UBS. We made some mistakes. Take it with a grain of salt; it's not representative of broad Swiss opinion.''
 As for any cultural difference between the American approach to capitalism and the Swiss one, he doesn't buy it. ''I think in terms of values and culture, the U.S. and Switzerland are close together,'' he says. ''When I'm in Cleveland, Ohio, it could be Switzerland. There is not much of a division.''
 Perhaps. But some shareholders clearly see a divide, and at least one is calling for the bank to make an even more explicit division. In a letter last week, Luqman Arnold, an investor and former president of UBS, called on the company to split the troubled investment bank from UBS's crown jewel, the wealth management business. 
 Mr. Ospel, in the interview on Friday, said that this would be a mistake: ''We have reassessed the strategy over and over again and came to the conclusion that the integrated model makes sense.''
 As Mr. Rohner did, Mr. Ospel also shrugged off the resentment now brewing in Switzerland over UBS's headlong plunge into the subprime pool. ''I don't think it's about these two countries,'' he said. ''America's culture has always attracted interest and enthusiasm here.''

HEADLINE: Small Cars Seek Appeal Beyond the Cute Factor

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
AS part of a promotion for the tiny Fortwo in the United States, publicists at Smart arranged a visit for auto journalists to the Computer History Museum in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View, Calif. The automaker, part of the Daimler corporate family alongside Mercedes-Benz, wanted to point out that in the world of computers, evolution favors the small. 
 Technological progress and prestige are marked by compression and reduction; compactness is a virtue in high-tech products like cellphones and computers. 
 But ''compact'' and ''subcompact'' carry pejorative overtones when applied to cars, where greater size has long signaled power, prestige and security. 
 As drivers in the United States grudgingly adapt to higher gasoline prices, automakers seem to be taking a greater interest in building smaller cars that are more than afterthoughts to larger, more profitable models. A look at the vehicles on display at the New York auto show last month suggests that the design of scaled-down models -- often called B-class cars by the industry and city cars by marketers -- is improving. 
 ''City cars will become increasingly important, even in the U.S.,'' said James E. Press, the longtime Toyota executive who is now vice chairman at Chrysler, during a recent business conference at the Levin Institute in New York. 
 Because cars of this size are sold in many countries, they have also come to be known as world cars.
 At the New York show, Ford displayed a design study called the Verve, a version of a new small car that will be sold as the Fiesta, a name Ford has used on its world car for decades. European sales start this fall with an American introduction in 2010.
 General Motors has added smaller models from Europe and Asia to its North American lines, including the Saturn Astra, sold by G.M.'s Opel and Vauxhall brands in Europe and Britain. Detroit automakers sell still smaller models like the Opel Corsa and Ford Ka overseas, but until recently there was little reason to consider bringing them to the United States. 
 The Toyota Yaris and Nissan Versa are world cars whose sales have been expanded to the United States in recent years. A new version of Honda's rival to those models, the Fit, made its debut at the New York show, only two years after the last-generation model came to this country.
 The Fit, which is called the Jazz in other parts of the world, is available in about 100 countries. Now Honda is pitching it for cities: ''With an aggressive new face, it's perfect for the hustle and bustle of metro-centric life styles,'' a Honda advertisement says. 
 The B-class cars are increasing in popularity around the world. The so-called millenials, or Gen-Y buyers, that Ford hopes to attract with the Fiesta are accustomed to products that offer high value in small packages, said Peter Horbury, executive design director for the Americas at the Ford Motor Company. 
 Ford researchers estimate that small-car sales around the world will grow to about 38 million in 2012, from 23 million in 2002. In the United States, Ford estimates total small-car sales of 3.4 million in 2012, an increase of 25 percent over a decade. 
 The success of the Mini Cooper in the United States has changed the small-car market for both buyers and sellers. Buyers have come to expect that European automakers will offer models that are well-designed and space-efficient -- and buyers will pay more for them. 
 ''The assumption about a product is that if it is European it can be small and expensive,'' said Bryan Nesbitt, vice president for North American design at G.M. In a previous assignment at G.M.'s European design studios, Mr. Nesbitt oversaw work on models like the Opel Agila.
 But many models that flourish around the globe are not available in the United States. When the World Car of the Year was announced at the New York auto show, it was a small model unfamiliar to the locals: the Mazda 2. In the United States, the company's numbers go only as low as the Mazda 3. 
 Americans have coveted the attractive small cars of Europe for years: a recent example is the new Fiat 500, a nostalgic update of a beloved people's car. Recent exchange-rate shifts will hurt the chances of such cars coming here: the recently announced Volkswagen Scirocco is too expensive to sell in this country, the company says, although its predecessors were hits here. 
 Sales of South Korean models have relied heavily on low prices and long warranties, but now small models from Hyundai and Kia have grown more appealing. The Kia Koup, a design study that made its debut last month in New York, offers a sophisticated combination of European form and edgy American lines, reflecting the backgrounds of its creators: Peter Schreyer, formerly of Audi and now the chief design officer of Kia Motors, and Tom Kearns, formerly of Cadillac, who is today the chief designer at Kia's American design studio in Irvine, Calif., where the Koup was created. 
 The body is solid and chunky; its beltline recalls a Detroit muscle car of the 1960s. A character line that the designers call the ''swoosh and check'' runs from the front-door line back, providing the car a powerful graphic element that is recognizable from a distance. The Koup looks like a more expensive car, perhaps from Germany. 
 Saab's concept car at the show presented a convincing adaptation of syling themes seen on the much-praised Aero X show car to a smaller vehicle. The 9-X BioHybrid could become the smallest Saab, possibly called the 9-1. Like the Volvo C30 and BMW 1 Series, Saab's offering suggests that even European luxury brands are thinking smaller. 
 Many new models are likely to arrive in the market slot between the conventional compacts and the very smallest cars, like the Smart Fortwo or Toyota's new rival to the Smart, the iQ, which will not come to the United States. Volkswagen's Up family of cars, a set of concepts shown in Japan and Europe but not at the New York show, offers a vision of a global small car that can be dressed up or down, as a fashion designer might say, for markets around the world. A stripped version could sell in emerging economies and a more elaborately equipped one might be offered in Europe or the United States. 
 The new, smaller cars are taking unconventional forms as well. In the past, many small cars appeared to be merely shrunken versions of larger siblings. Now we may see novel shapes that will be exclusive to small cars. 
 ''We will see more small cars in the U.S. and they will be more different'' in design, Shiro Nakamura, design director of Nissan, said in an interview at the New York show. More small niche models will appear, he said. He pointed to the Nissan Cube, due here next year. The boxy Cube, he said, comes from nonautomotive design traditions and is aimed at young people. ''It is not for everyone,'' he said. ''It does not smell of gasoline. It is more product design than automobile design.'' 
 Changes in the design of smaller cars may be part of a deeper change in attitude of the sort that Smart's trip to the Computer History Museum brought out. The success of the Mini Cooper and the iPod have changed attitudes. Smallness signals cutting-edge technology: ''thinnovation'' is the cute portmanteau word that Apple uses in advertising for its laptop computers. 
 The idea of small objects as packed with power may have migrated to the automotive world. But there is a difference: you fit your music on your iPod but you don't have to fit your legs into it.

HEADLINE: The Tricky Task Of Offering Aid To Homeowners

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and VIKAS BAJAJ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The task sounds nearly impossible: create a rescue plan for homeowners that will prevent a tidal wave of foreclosures, cost taxpayers as little as possible and avoid bailing out reckless lenders and greedy speculators.
 At the same time, policy makers and financial regulators believe, any rescue effort should be flexible enough that if housing prices rebound, the government can recoup its costs, lenders can recover some losses and homeowners can still enjoy gains.
 Tough as this may seem, some Democratic lawmakers are convinced it can be done. With housing problems dragging down the wider economy, they are eager to pursue what could become the most sweeping government intervention on behalf of homeowners since the New Deal.
 While an initial, relatively modest housing-aid bill is likely to be approved Tuesday by the Senate, the main stage for a more ambitious plan is expected to be the House. The speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and other House Democrats are pushing to aid as many as 1.5 million homeowners by expanding the availability of federally insured loans. 
 After weeks of accusing the White House of dragging its feet on aid for everyday Americans, even as the Federal Reserve rushed to prevent the collapse of the Bear Stearns investment bank, Democrats will open hearings on their proposal this week. Skeptical Republicans, with the political tide running against them, warn that government meddling in the market may only cause more harm.
 The Democratic plan, developed by the House Financial Services Committee, would make available up to $300 billion in federally insured loans to help troubled owners refinance risky adjustable-rate mortgages into more affordable 30-year, fixed-rate loans -- at an up-front cost to taxpayers of about $10 billion. 
 The proposal hinges on persuading lenders to take substantial losses on mortgages written during the boom that now exceed the value of homes. Qualified lenders would then make new loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
 Lenders, who face the prospect of even steeper losses if huge numbers of homes go into foreclosure, say they are intrigued by the idea but want to see more details.
 The Democratic plan seeks to avoid helping speculators who made risky investments, as well as irresponsible home buyers who could never afford to pay off their loans.
 Advocates say that the program would help owners keep only the home they live in, not vacation or investment property, and that no taxpayers' money would be used to pay down mortgages -- a prospect that lawmakers realize is unappetizing to the majority of homeowners who pay their loans on time. 
 Borrowers would have to meet stringent criteria, showing their ability to pay a new loan. They would also have to pay insurance premiums to the F.H.A., reducing the risk to taxpayers of any defaults. And if the home was sold, the government would get a share of the profit.
 ''No vacation people, no speculators,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who is the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and the principal author of the leading Democratic plan. ''These are people who are guilty of having borrowed too much money for a home for themselves and their families. They didn't shoot anybody. They didn't rob anybody.'' 
 Mr. Frank added, ''They are guilty of not having anticipated that housing prices would drop.'' 
 Under the Democratic plan, existing limits on F.H.A. loans would still apply. In the most expensive markets, like New York or the San Fernando Valley in California, that limit is $729,750. 
 A variety of other proposals are circulating both on and off Capitol Hill, including one by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates savings and loans. That plan would give a share of any profits to lenders to compensate them for losses they took by cutting the balances of troubled loans.
 ''There is a logic to what you have to do here,'' Mr. Frank said.
 Aides to Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, also say she will press President Bush to endorse the effort at a meeting at the White House on Wednesday. And Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the chairman of the banking committee, who tried but failed to include a similar plan in the Senate's more modest bill, now hopes to draft separate legislation. He will begin his own hearings this week, paralleling Mr. Frank's effort in the House.
 But these plans have fierce critics on all sides. 
 On the left, advocacy groups like the National Community Reinvestment Coalition say the government should be more aggressive and become, essentially, a vulture investor, buying up defaulted loans at a discount and modifying them into more traditional mortgages that can be resold to private investors.
 On the right, some Republican policy makers are urging restraint, warning that the government may only make things worse by risking tax dollars to insure dubious loans and by delaying an inevitable and necessary correction in home prices. 
 ''There is a line that I believe we should not cross,'' said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the banking committee. ''That line is represented by a taxpayer-funded bailout of investors or homeowners who freely and willingly entered into mortgages that they knew or should have known they could not afford.'' 
 Senior Republican aides say Mr. Shelby remains open to some Democratic proposals but intends to scrutinize them rigorously, just as he is questioning whether the Federal Reserve was right to intervene with Bear Stearns. 
 The White House says it doubts that Democrats can help as many homeowners as they predict without risking a huge bill for taxpayers.
 Democrats say they realize that some homeowners in trouble can probably work their way out of the crisis without government help, and they also acknowledge that many owners are in a hole so deep that they are beyond help.
 Their plan would focus on a group in the middle, as many as 1.5 million people who want to keep their homes but can do so only with significant changes in their mortgage terms.
 About 4 million, or nearly 8 percent, of the nation's 52 million first mortgages were delinquent or in foreclosure at the end of last year. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com, estimates that 3.5 million more will run into trouble in 2008 and 2009 as home prices fall, the job market weakens and monthly payments on some loans rise.
 Some economists say that policy makers must act before the tide of foreclosures becomes self-perpetuating. 
 ''In the market that we have in front of us, prices decline and supply increases, driving prices down further,'' said Susan M. Wachter, a real estate finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''The worst case is not a recession but a housing depression.''
 Supporters of government intervention acknowledge significant limits on what can be done to assist homeowners, but they say that does not excuse inaction.
 Banking trade groups have expressed guarded support for Mr. Frank's plans. Floyd E. Stoner, the chief lobbyist of the American Bankers Association, says the outlines he has seen suggest that it could ''put a floor under the housing market.'' 
 But central players in Washington remain divided over many issues. Mortgage companies, for instance, want to share in any future increase in home values, which Mr. Frank proposes to split between homeowners and the government. Regardless of how the program is set up, housing experts say a central issue will be the standards that administrators use in underwriting fresh loans-- the nuts and bolts of any lending business. If standards are too strict, which some experts say is a problem with current F.H.A. programs, fewer people will be helped. 
 F.H.A. Secure, a program created by the Bush administration to refinance troubled subprime loans, has backed more than 140,000 new loans since August; government administrators say it is on track to insure another 260,000 by year end. But critics say that is a fraction of the 1.6 million delinquent subprime loans and that it includes mortgages made to borrowers who are not in trouble.
 Conversely, if the government is overly lenient in backing loans, taxpayers could be put at risk. If the F.H.A.'s insurance reserves proved insufficient to cover defaults, the Treasury would be on the hook. Some studies show that modified loans default anew at a rate of about 50 percent.
 During the 1930s, when the government set up the Home Owners Loan Corporation to buy and modify defaulted loans, the agency ended up foreclosing on 20 percent of its borrowers, said Alex J. Pollock, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He said any new plan should be set up to withstand losses on a sizable number of loans. Mr. Frank said his proposal would do that by charging relatively high insurance fees, giving the F.H.A. a large cushion.
 The fresh F.H.A. loans will be less risky than many existing loans ''because they will be smaller and at lower interest rates, but they will still be risky loans,'' said Mr. Pollock, who has called for an agency similar to the loan corporation of the '30s. ''There will be redefaults, and there will be losses.''

HEADLINE: In the Shadow of Foreclosures

 BODY:
In the subprime mortgage squeeze, some regions are feeling the pain more acutely than others.
 Although many Southern metropolitan areas have high percentages of subprime mortgages, homeowners in those areas have largely been able to pay their bills, so subprime foreclosure rates are low. 
 Not so in the Rust Belt, where subprime mortgages are less common but foreclosure rates are sky-high, mostly a result of rising unemployment.
 And overbuilding in regions of Florida, California and other states with housing bubbles lured overeager residents to become speculators, buying up many homes with the expectation that their values would rise. Getting subprime loans was all too easy.
 But paying the loans as housing prices fall is all too hard, and many economists believe that foreclosures will continue to rise.
 ''The collapse will affect other markets, like New York, Boston and D.C.,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. ''Suburban areas near those cities are already seeing prices plunge.''

HEADLINE: In a New Generation of College Students, Many Opt for the Life Examined

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. 

 BODY:
When a fellow student at Rutgers University urged Didi Onejeme to try Philosophy 101 two years ago, Ms. Onejeme, who was a pre-med sophomore, dismissed it as ''frou-frou.''
 ''People sitting under trees and talking about stupid stuff -- I mean, who cares?'' Ms. Onejeme recalled thinking at the time. 
 But Ms. Onejeme, now a senior applying to law school, ended up changing her major to philosophy, which she thinks has armed her with the skills to be successful. ''My mother was like, what are you going to do with that?'' said Ms. Onejeme, 22. ''She wanted me to be a pharmacy major, but I persuaded her with my argumentative skills.'' 
 Once scoffed at as a luxury major, philosophy is being embraced at Rutgers and other universities by a new generation of college students who are drawing modern-day lessons from the age-old discipline as they try to make sense of their world, from the morality of the war in Iraq to the latest political scandal. The economic downturn has done little, if anything, to dampen this enthusiasm among students, who say that what they learn in class can translate into practical skills and careers. On many campuses, debate over modern issues like war and technology is emphasized over the study of classic ancient texts.
 Rutgers, which has long had a top-ranked philosophy department, is one of a number of universities where the number of undergraduate philosophy majors is ballooning; there are 100 in this year's graduating class, up from 50 in 2002, even as overall enrollment on the main campus has declined by 4 percent. 
 At the City University of New York, where enrollment is up 18 percent over the past six years, there are 322 philosophy majors, a 51 percent increase since 2002.
 ''If I were to start again as an undergraduate, I would major in philosophy,'' said Matthew Goldstein, the CUNY chancellor, who majored in mathematics and statistics. ''I think that subject is really at the core of just about everything we do. If you study humanities or political systems or sciences in general, philosophy is really the mother ship from which all of these disciplines grow.''
 Nationwide, there are more colleges offering undergraduate philosophy programs today than a decade ago (817, up from 765), according to the College Board. Some schools with established programs like Texas A&M, Notre Dame, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, now have twice as many philosophy majors as they did in the 1990s. 
 David E. Schrader, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, a professional organization with 11,000 members, said that in an era in which people change careers frequently, philosophy makes sense. ''It's a major that helps them become quick learners and gives them strong skills in writing, analysis and critical thinking,'' he said. 
 Mr. Schrader, an adjunct professor at the University of Delaware, said that the demand for philosophy courses had outpaced the resources at some colleges, where students are often turned away. Some are enrolling in online courses instead, he said, describing it as ''really very strange.''
 ''The discipline as we see it from the time of Socrates starts with people face to face, putting their positions on the table,'' he said.
 The Rutgers philosophy department is relatively large, with 27 professors, 60 graduate students, and more than 30 undergraduate offerings each semester. For those who cannot get enough of their Descartes in class, there is the Wednesday night philosophy club, where, last week, 11 students debated the metaphysics behind the movie ''The Matrix'' for more than an hour.
 An undergraduate philosophy journal started this semester has drawn 36 submissions -- about half from Rutgers students -- on musings like ''Is the extinction of a species always a bad thing?'' 
 Barry Loewer, the department chairman, said that Rutgers started building its philosophy program in the late 1980s, when the field was branching into new research areas like cognitive science and becoming more interdisciplinary. He said that many students have double-majored in philosophy and, say, psychology or economics, in recent years, and go on to become doctors, lawyers, writers, investment bankers and even commodities traders.
 As the approach has changed, philosophy has attracted students with little interest in contemplating the classical texts, or what is known as armchair philosophy. Some, like Ms. Onejeme, the pre-med-student-turned-philosopher, who is double majoring in political science, see it as a pre-law track because it emphasizes the verbal and logic skills prized by law schools -- something the Rutgers department encourages by pointing out that their majors score high on the LSAT. 
 Other students said that studying philosophy, with its emphasis on the big questions and alternative points of view, provided good training for looking at larger societal questions, like globalization and technology. 
 ''All of these things make the world a smaller place and force us to look beyond the bubble we grow up in,'' said Christine Bullman, 20, a junior, who said art majors and others routinely took philosophy classes. ''I think philosophy is a good base to look at a lot of issues.''
 Frances Egan, a Rutgers philosophy professor who advises undergraduates, said that as it has become harder for students to predict what specialties might be in demand in an uncertain economy, some may be more apt to choose their major based simply on what they find interesting. ''Philosophy is a lot of fun,'' said Professor Egan, who graduated with a philosophy degree in the tough economic times of the 1970s. ''A lot of students are in it because they find it intellectually rewarding.''
 Max Bialek, 22, was majoring in math until his senior year, when he discovered philosophy. He decided to stay an extra year to complete the major (his parents needed reassurance, he said, but were supportive).
 ''I thought: Why weren't all my other classes like that one?'' he said, explaining that philosophy had taught him a way of studying that could be applied to any subject and enriched his life in unexpected ways. ''You can talk about almost anything as long as you do it well.''
 Jenna Schaal-O'Connor, a 20-year-old sophomore who is majoring in cognitive science and linguistics, said philosophy had other perks. She said she found many male philosophy majors interesting and sensitive. 
 ''That whole deep existential torment,'' she said. ''It's good for getting girlfriends.''

HEADLINE: When the Splurge Takes Its Toll

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KOTKIN

 BODY:
ON the way up, financial toxic waste was sold as ''a new paradigm.'' Now, on the long way down, the response is ''Help, the sky is falling!''
 Two angry new books attempt to explain what happened. In ''The Trillion Dollar Meltdown'' (Public Affairs, $22.95), Charles R. Morris offers a persuasive diagnosis of the long-building credit crash, with a regulatory prescription. In ''Bad Money'' (Viking, $25.95), Kevin Phillips decries the ''debt-gorged and negligent financial sector'' and its clout, reflected in bailouts.
 Mr. Morris, a former banker and an especially graceful writer, recognizes the benefits of high finance. In his telling, American industry and post-World War II Keynesianism got their comeuppance in the 1970s. Paul Volcker at the Federal Reserve cleaned up the horrific mess -- ''one of the great episodes of American public service'' -- but in the view of Mr. Morris, this opened the way for a new excess: the market religion of Chicago School economics and the helium Fed of Alan Greenspan. 
 The scary trillion dollars of Mr. Morris's title is his estimate for the great unwinding now just beginning. He calls out for a new Volcker to save us from the limbo suffered by post-bubble Japan, even as he suggests that the Fed lacks the power it once had (a point now being debated). Nor is he sure if only another 25-year cycle is ending, this one of deregulatory dogma, or if the United States is in relative global decline. 
 Mr. Morris accessibly explains Wall Street's arcane instruments, and spikes his narrative with aphorisms. (''As a general rule, only the very smartest people can make truly catastrophic mistakes.'') He lays bare today's mess by tracing the 1980s leveraged-buyout boom, precursor to the 2000s private-equity ball, as well as the ''scams'' of the savings-and-loan crisis and ''the staggering fatuity of portfolio insurance.'' This is a smart layperson's guide.
 Conservative policies, Mr. Morris writes, produced not just excess but a great market restructuring, while government can become bloated. Even so, he stumps for a return to what he calls high-quality government, which builds infrastructure and exercises ''effective oversight over the finance industry.'' 
 Events have rocketed most of Mr. Morris's suggestions from nonstarter status and into the glare of suddenly worried lobbyists: for example, having loans to superleveraged parties carry penalty capital charges, or moving now secretive trades in high-volume credit derivatives into public exchanges. On the slog to regulatory revision much bruising politicking looms, but the current framework has become indefensible. 
 Mr. Phillips, who worked for the Nixon administration and published ''The Emerging Republican Majority'' back in 1969, presaged a rightward realignment around the South and the western Sun Belt. As this conservative ascendancy wore on, however, he took to denouncing Wall Street, American oil gluttony, Christian theocracy and the House of Bush, which he saw as all interlinked. In his new book, he writes that maybe the end is nigh -- not just for Republicanism, but for American predominance.
 Nobody planned it, Mr. Phillips argues, but the financial sector has taken over, assuming top rank in the economy at more than 20 percent of gross domestic product. (He adds that in 2004, financial services' share of all corporate profits reached 44 percent, compared with 10 percent for manufacturing.) To his eye, this was possible because debt -- which he likens to crack cocaine -- was turned into a profit machine. 
 The indignation runs deep: powerful interests elbow and shove to get the financial system they want. In their minds, they help first-time home buyers realize their dreams and spread the risk by securitizing it and releasing it to the marketplace. But in the process, they privatize profits while socializing costs, and put all of us in jeopardy. The democratic political system, driven by money, colludes.
 Mr. Phillips practices his own mild form of securitization, slicing and packaging ideas of his previous works in this new product. And chunks are thrown in from Financial Times columnists, Austrian School economists and the theory that global oil production has peaked. Putting energy profligacy on a par with indebtedness, Mr. Phillips tries to bundle it all into a theory of history. 
 Changeovers in energy regimes, he asserts, induce shifts in dominant world powers. The Netherlands, which so long ago mastered wind and water energy, yielded to Britain when coal rose to prominence. And Britain was displaced by the United States with the rise of oil, he writes. But a separate argument blames the absence of industrial policy. ''Money is 'bad,' '' Mr. Phillips speculates, ''when a leading world economic power passing its zenith'' indulges ''in finance at the expense of harvesting, manufacturing, or transporting things.'' 
 Never mind that finance aided the rise of the 17th-century Netherlands and 18th-century Britain, or that each is exceptionally well off today. Even though no new energy regime appears in the offing, Mr. Phillips hints at the eclipse of America by ''Asian state capitalism.'' As the new joke goes, he writes, ''Shanghai, Dubai, Mumbai or goodbye.'' 
 Of course, those are all financial centers. Competition from them, as well as from London, is a big reason the design challenge for new regulation in the United States will be mighty. Another is that any American regulatory framework would need to remain effective even if enforcement became lax. 
 Mr. Morris can berate Mr. Greenspan for having refused to exercise the Fed's oversight over the mortgage market, but his critique cannot eradicate the deep antiregulatory sentiment that pervades the corporate culture and produces people like Mr. Greenspan in the first place.
 In the end, Mr. Phillips and Mr. Morris agree on a great deal: after the gargantuan write-downs, foreclosure fights, possible punishments, rescues and regulatory overhaul, someone will still need to blow the whistle on America's oil-and-debt toga party.

HEADLINE: Down and Out in America's Last Boomtown

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABAN. 
Jonathan Raban is the author, most recently, of the essay collection ''My Holy War'' and the novel ''Surveillance.''

DATELINE: Seattle 

 BODY:
 IF the American economy is on the brink of meltdown, it's hard to credit it from here. Unemployment in the area is at 3.6 percent, the house-price curve has very slightly dipped but not plunged, and a new business and residential district is climbing fast immediately north of downtown, where the masts and swinging jibs of tower cranes crowd the sky, excavators dig yawning pits in the ground, and men in hard hats swarm over a square mile of concrete, rebar and forsythia-yellow gypsum board. In still-booming Seattle, it's left to the homeless to remind us of economic calamity.
 Tourists interviewed for a recent article in The Post-Intelligencer sang the city's praises but complained of the panhandlers and ''transients.'' Thinking it a bit rich for tourists to beef about other people's transience, I took a homeless man out to lunch. 
 Fred Spruitenberg came here in 2001, drawn, like so many new Seattleites, by the prospect of employment. In Salinas, Calif., he read in a newspaper about the magnitude-6.8 earthquake that February and imagined a city knee-deep in fallen masonry and broken glass: ''I know how to work a broom and shovel.'' He bummed the Greyhound fare from a Catholic charity and took the 25-hour ride north to his new life. ''Best move I ever made,'' he said. ''A person who goes hungry in Seattle has to be crazy. People here are so kind-hearted.''
 He was just shy of 50 at the time, and in better shape than he is now. Short-sighted, short-winded, with the weathered face of a foretopman, Fred's full of rueful humor at his own recklessness. He laughed when I asked him when he'd last owned a car: ''1999,'' he said. ''Never again. The world doesn't need me as a driver -- I just never know how much I'm going to drink.''
 Most nights he sleeps on a narrow pad at the St. Martin de Porres shelter for men over 50. The pads are ''this far apart,'' he says, his hands framing the size of a smallish trout. Most mornings he goes to his usual spot on Second and Madison, near the entrance to the Federal Building, and sells Real Change, the lively local weekly put out by homeless advocates and sold by homeless people, who buy the paper for 35 cents and charge $1. Twenty copies a day net Fred $13, plus bonuses from customers who give him a $5 bill and tell him to keep the change. 
 He loves books. Over lunch, he talked of O. Henry, Steinbeck and Khalil Gibran, and insisted that I read Christina Rossetti's ''Goblin Market,'' a poem I'd often skipped over in anthologies. I'm now as hooked as he is on the poem, which on one level is about the peril of addiction to the intoxicating fruit hawked by the goblin men: ''She sucked and sucked and sucked the more/ Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;/ She sucked until her lips were sore ...'' On another, with its constant refrain of ''Come buy, come buy,'' it's about the treacherous allure of shopping itself.
 Like Fred, Seattle has been a longstanding client of the goblin merchants. The city is littered with expensive toys and baubles, like Paul Allen's grand folly, the Experience Music Project, a globular, multicolored extravaganza designed by Frank Gehry and known as ''the hemorrhoids'' by employees of the public TV station that overlooks it, but which now appears to my eye as a cornucopia of goblin damsons, figs and pomegranates. 
 Likewise, the new $52 million, 1.3-mile streetcar line, a pet project of the mayor, which runs from downtown to the giant construction site of South Lake Union, and whose shiny red, orange and purple cars are cute, quaint and eerily underpatronized. This is the city that a couple of years ago came within an inch of spending $11 billion (including the cost of debt service) on a new monorail system, cool as an iPhone but of doubtful utility. 
 As the faint breeze from the east strengthens into the frigid wind of recession, Seattle will have to reckon with its weakness for the goblin stuff. A chastening reading of Fred's favorite poem might be a good place to start.

HEADLINE: Taking The Pulse Of the Boroughs

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
THE real estate markets of the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island are suffering from the housing downturn that has afflicted much of the country, and yet they still have some pockets of strength. 
 In parts of Brooklyn, buyers are still paying top dollar for coveted brownstones, and in some neighborhoods in Queens, the market is buoyed by immigrant buyers who won't let a housing slowdown blindside their dreams of homeownership. And yet in the Bronx, foreclosures are rising in poorer neighborhoods. In Staten Island, prices are flat and foreclosures are up. At the top and bottom of the market, houses are still selling. 
 The markets in these four boroughs are more varied than those in Manhattan and the suburbs. Manhattan co-ops and condominiums are still getting record prices; the average sales price in the first quarter reached a record $1.7 million, although activity seems to be slowing. Suburban home prices are declining. 
 Figures released by Standard & Poor's/Case-Schiller showed that prices for single-family homes in the New York City area dropped by 5.8 percent from January 2007 to January 2008. 
 At first glance, much of the market in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island looks as sluggish as in the suburbs, according to data from several sources. PropertyShark.com says that the median sales price fell by 27 percent in Queens from February 2007 to February 2008, by 6 percent on Staten Island and Brooklyn, and by 2 percent in the Bronx. 
 There are serious signs of a slowdown. Fewer people are buying: sales volume in Queens dropped by 25 percent from February 2007 to February 2008, 31 percent in Brooklyn, 36 percent on Staten Island and 50 percent in the Bronx.
 Then there are foreclosures. In the four boroughs, 895 homes were lost to foreclosure in the first quarter of this year, compared with 529 in the first quarter of 2007.
 But based on interviews with more than two dozen real estate brokers, the weaker sales figures don't tell the entire story, because prices vary by neighborhood and within neighborhoods. 
 Part of the question is: How do you define a slowdown? Some Staten Island brokers see a rising number of foreclosures, while their counterparts in Brooklyn see fewer bidding wars on co-ops in Fort Greene. In both cases, this represents a changing, and slower, market, but it also represents very different realities. 
 The brokers all agreed that real estate prices and sales volume aren't what they used to be. ''It's taking longer to sell anything,'' said Bill Shepherd, a 15-year broker with Brown Harris Stevens who hasn't closed on a house in Prospect Lefferts Gardens in Brooklyn since October. ''What might have taken a month to three months, it can take three to six months.''
 Brooklyn
 In Brooklyn, prices have been holding relatively steady and there has been only a small rise in foreclosures. The median price for a home sold in Brooklyn fell to $392,313 in February 2008 from $418,700 in February 2007, according to PropertyShark.com. These numbers reflect the high prices being paid for brownstones in neighborhoods like Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights. In other areas, like East New York, homeowners are facing foreclosure. In fact, foreclosures in Brooklyn rose to 140 in the first quarter this year, compared with 129 in the same period a year earlier. 
 Brokers find themselves trying to keep up with an increasingly confusing market. In February, Marty Ellman, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, closed on her first short sale, a $785,000 home in Prospect Heights. (A short sale occurs when the sales price is less than the amount owed on the mortgage.) 
 But in March, she mediated a bidding war among 15 buyers for a two-bedroom apartment in Fort Greene that got $50,000 more than the asking price. At this point, she sees more bidding wars than short sales. ''Properties are flying off the shelf,'' she said.
 For the right price, buyers are also still buying in less affluent neighborhoods like East Williamsburg and Clinton Hill, said Highlyann Krasnow, executive vice president of the Developers Group, a real estate marketing company. Her company sold 20 of the 24 one-bedroom condos at 223 Maujer Street in East Williamsburg at prices that began at about $360,000. She said that before the housing slowdown, prices would have been $40,000 to $50,000 higher. 
 ''Most of our buyers are still coming from Manhattan,'' she said.
 But these buyers are doing more homework, and they want good deals. 
 They could learn from the experience of a broker who did a lot of research before buying her own place in Brooklyn.
 In January, Ailene Quinlan, a 34-year-old broker with the Developers Group, signed a contract on a one-bedroom condo at 111 Steuben Street in Clinton Hill. 
 Before she bought, she rented nearby, researched the frequency of G train service and made sure she liked the local cafes and supermarket. She knew the neighborhood well enough that she was ready and able to pounce on the lower ''presale'' price of $400,000, compared with the current price of about $435,000 She chose an apartment with a large terrace because she thought it would help its resale value. 
 ''This is an opportunity I wouldn't have had if I had waited,'' she said. 
 But Brooklyn prices could fall further if Manhattan prices start to slip. Sam Haskel, the executive vice president of HMS Associates, an appraisal firm based in Brooklyn, said that the success of Brooklyn hinges on buyers who cannot afford to stay in Manhattan. He said Brooklyn prices would stay high if Wall Street executives and foreign buyers continued to drive up Manhattan prices.
 ''As long as Manhattan is going to be strong, Brooklyn will survive,'' he said.
 But some Williamsburg condo owners who bought as investors are already unhappy with their purchases and are renting or selling at a loss, according to David Maundrell, the president of Aptsandlofts.com, a Williamsburg brokerage. So far this year, his brokerage has helped three sellers who have been disappointed with what they could resell their condos for. 
 One woman who tried to sell her one-bedroom decided to rent it out, despite a shortfall of $350 a month, because she could not face a loss of principal. Another couple sold their two-bedroom at a loss of about 5 percent when they had to relocate. A third couple just sold a one-bedroom, bought a year ago, also at a loss of about 5 percent. 
 ''They thought they could get a lot more than they can,'' Mr. Maundrell said. 
 Queens
 Queens may be the most difficult market to explain, because prices can vary by neighborhood and even by block. 
 The median price of all homes and apartments in Queens plummeted to $283,665 in February 2008, compared with $390,000 in February 2007, according to PropertyShark.com. Foreclosures jumped to 508 in the first quarter of this year, compared with 319 in the same quarter the year before.
 Brokers also say that there may be no rhyme or reason to prices in Queens, or even to what type of house will sell. 
 Sal Crifasi, the owner of Crifasi Real Estate with offices in Ridgewood and Middle Village, Queens, and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said that in Middle Village, semidetached houses at 76th Street and Juniper Boulevard have held their value, while row houses a block away dropped by 10 percent. One reason is supply -- there are fewer semidetached houses -- and people like semidetached houses because they have private driveways and more windows than in a row house. 
 At the same time, Mr. Crifasi said, Polish immigrants are buying both detached and semidetached houses in the $600,000 to $800,000 price range for 5 to 7 percent less than they cost a year ago in parts of Middle Village, Ridgewood and Glendale. He says these buyers don't have trouble getting mortgages -- or don't need them at all -- because they save until they can put down 50 to 100 percent of the purchase price.
 According to Mr. Crifasi, many of these buyers have relocated from Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Renters from Greenpoint are finding that they can't afford to buy in their neighborhood. Owners in Greenpoint are selling to buyers from Manhattan and upgrading to larger homes.
 ''They're selling their homes for a lot higher in Greenpoint, cashing out and buying more living space,'' he said. ''They can afford more. If they could, they would have no mortgages.'' 
 Real estate is also attracting investors leery of the stock market. 
 Celia de Campos, who is from Brazil, wanted her college-age daughters, Barbara and Juliana, to have apartments near her and her husband in Astoria when they finish their schooling. Last April, with help from Adriano Hultmann, a broker for the Corcoran Group, she bought a one-bedroom condo at CityView in Long Island City for $390,000. In March, she paid the same amount for a one-bedroom apartment at Astor I in Astoria.
 She is renting out the apartments until her daughters are ready for them -- even though she says she is losing $2,700 a month after mortgage costs and common charges. 
 She said she believed that real estate was a smarter investment than the stock market in the long run, and she was confident in Long Island City and Astoria. ''Immigrants go for the basics,'' she said.
 Although fixer-uppers in all segments of the market and in all four boroughs are not finding buyers the way they once did, those willing to renovate are finding good deals. 
 Last month, Steven Toledo and his partner, Pedro Julio Serrano, signed a contract on a one-bedroom co-op in Jackson Heights for $220,000. They negotiated the original asking price down from $240,000 after pointing out to the seller's agent, Jorge Mejia of the Argo Corporation, that the bathroom tiles needed to be replaced. 
 Mr. Toledo said they bought now because they didn't think the apartment's price would drop any further. The apartment they bought is a sponsor unit, and they had to put down only 10 percent, or $22,000. They also were able to get a mortgage at 6 percent interest. 
 Mr. Toledo pointed out that this is an established immigrant community, not a gentrified neighborhood that is dependent on Manhattan transplants for price appreciation. 
 ''When I see other neighborhoods around there,'' he said, ''I think this neighborhood has so much room to grow.''
 The Bronx
 In the Bronx, the picture is discouraging in some neighborhoods because sales activity has slowed. But then there are neighborhoods like Riverdale that attract Manhattan buyers. 
 According to PropertyShark.com, the median house and apartment price dropped slightly, to $195,000 in February 2008 from $198,500 in February 2007. The number of foreclosures in the first quarter of 2008 jumped to 73, compared with 47 during the same quarter last year. 
 But Sasha Catus, a broker who specializes in the South Bronx, says the market is much worse than these numbers show. 
 He called his business ''a well that has dried up'' and said that for every four homes he sold a year ago in the South Bronx, he now sells one. 
 Still, he said, sellers want high prices for their homes, even if that isn't realistic. ''I don't know any of them who are getting the price they want,'' he said.
 John Ng, one of Mr. Catus's clients, took a three-family house in Melrose off the market when he couldn't find a buyer willing to pay his price. Mr. Ng, a 30-year-old investment research analyst who relocated to Florida from New York, tried for eight months to sell his house for $640,000, turning down offers for $600,000.
 In November, he decided to rent it out again. ''We weren't getting the type of offers we originally had wanted,'' he said.
 Other homeowners in the South Bronx say they don't have the ability to wait out a slow real estate market. 
 Isaac Suero, 34, who drives a candy delivery truck throughout the Bronx, tried for eight months to sell a three-bedroom house near Crotona Park for $339,000. He got two offers that fell through: one buyer lost his job before the closing, and the second had a co-signer back out on the morning of the closing. 
 By last month, Mr. Suero was ready to sell the house to another investor at $270,000, which is what he still owes on his mortgage. At the last minute, he received an offer from a couple for $295,000. They are scheduled to close on the house next month. 
 While much of the Bronx is suffering, homes in Riverdale are still getting record prices. Jill Sloane, a Halstead Property broker, recently sold a co-op there for $1.8 million, a record price for a co-op in the area. She says the market is good because Riverdale appeals to buyers priced out of Manhattan.
 ''I'm seeing the market still very strong up there because I think people are still willing to go a little bit north to get more,'' she said.
 In Woodlawn, a neighborhood with lots of Irish residents, prices have slowed. Fred Levy, a Halstead agent, estimated that activity and prices were down about 10 percent since the beginning of the year, but he said he expected prices to rise in the coming months as more people come to the area in the wake of a slowing economy in Ireland.
 Staten Island
 Prices are flat in Staten Island, but some buyers have been finding bargains on foreclosures. 
 Median prices are down by 6 percent, according to PropertyShark.com, to $390,583 in February 2008 from $415,000 in February 2007. In the first quarter of this year, foreclosures jumped to 174 from 34 the same time the year before.
 Alex Papirov, the owner of Homes-R-Us, a brokerage on the south shore of Staten Island, said that apartments priced below $400,000 were selling to first-time buyers who still want to get into the market, and that those priced above $1 million were also finding takers. 
 But the middle of the market is weak. Brokers agree that homes selling for $400,000 to $1 million are taking the longest to sell. 
 George Wonica Sr., the owner of Wonica Realtors, estimates that prices in this range have dropped by about 5 percent in the last six months.
 His office has handled 75 homes in foreclosure so far this year on behalf of banks, compared with 10 for all of 2007. Much of his growing inventory is coming from owners selling before they have to face a short sale. 
 Some buyers see a risk in buying a house that needs lots of renovation.
 ''We're not going to move into a house that needs $60,000 in work,'' said one buyer, Nicholas Siclari. He and his wife, Michele, have looked at 40 houses on Staten Island, but Mr. Siclari, an electrician, thought they all needed too much structural work, especially the foreclosed houses that owners damaged before moving out. 
 ''It's like putting a coat of paint on the Titanic,'' Mr. Siclari said. 
 But foreclosures are creating opportunities for some buyers. Karlo Barranca, a Wonica Realty client, and his girlfriend, Kristen Janowitz, are two of them. 
 They are looking for a house in the $400,000-to-$450,000 range and have seen 30 so far. Some of these homes have been foreclosed on. Mr. Barranca, who works as a medical software engineer, said he was prepared to do the renovations that many of these houses need, so he was shopping for the best deal.
 ''There are a lot of houses out there,'' he said. ''You need to do your homework.''

 BODY:
THE KELLER HOTEL, an old seaman's inn, has seen a few tides come and go. An Irish coal merchant constructed it in the late 1890s along a salty stretch of the Greenwich Village waterfront, at a time when the docks there were some of the busiest in the world. During the Depression, the Keller served as a flophouse for out-of-work sailors, who boozed and brawled in its ground-floor saloon. As the decades passed and economic forces pushed ships toward other ports, the West Side docks rotted, the Village deteriorated and a new clientele moved into the Keller. By the 1980s, the city was housing indigents upstairs, while the downstairs tenant was a gay leather bar, reputedly New York's oldest. Then, in 1985, a real estate investor named William Gottlieb purchased the property for $1 million. That's when things started to get weird. 
 Some people pass almost unnoticed through life, only to become legends once they're gone -- symbols of New York's mythic past when all the neighborhoods had character, all the rents were low and all the landlords knew their tenants' names. Bill Gottlieb died in 1999, but residents of Greenwich Village talk about him to this day, retelling tales that get more colorful with each passing year. A rumpled, elusive fellow who would walk the streets carrying shopping bags stuffed with cash and documents, Gottlieb spent decades quietly amassing an empire of run-down tenements, abandoned warehouses and weedy vacant lots. The properties cost Gottlieb little, but they could now be worth as much as a billion dollars altogether as the grimy neighborhoods where he shopped for bargains have long since given way to a landscape of luxury lofts and pet-grooming salons. Gottlieb's approach to real estate was to buy a building and hold on to it at minimal expense, instituting a sort of nonaggression pact with his tenants: he wouldn't ask for much rent if they didn't complain about broken doorbells or wheezing boilers. So as the waterfront underwent its own transformation, the Keller Hotel just sat there, a dilapidated Renaissance Revival vestige.
 By the time of Gottlieb's death, there were no more indigents residing at the Keller. When the leather bar shut down, the building was boarded up. It became one of those haunted structures surrounded by urban vitality that cause puzzled passers-by to stop and stare. The Keller sits on a stretch of West Street between 1 Morton Square (where the Olsen twins own a penthouse) and three diaphanous buildings designed by the famed architect Richard Meier. ''It's this horrible eyesore, and yet I have to think that it has to be one of the most valuable pieces of real estate in the neighborhood,'' says John Attalienti, a financial consultant who lives next door at 130 Barrow Street. ''I mean, unobstructed river views.''
 New York's professional speculators have also noticed. They all want a piece of Gottlieb's portfolio, which amounts to more than 100 buildings spread across a three-mile swath of Manhattan: from Henry Street on the Lower East Side, where his estate owns a six-story tenement with a storefront Pentecostal church, to the velvet-roped environs of the meatpacking district, where it is landlord to numerous nightspots. Some of Gottlieb's eclectic holdings are architecturally notable, like a few carriage houses along the cobblestone lanes of the West Village and the Northern Dispensary on Waverly Place, a wedge-shaped landmark where Edgar Allen Poe reputedly once received treatment for a head cold. Others, like a tiny corner parking lot on Prince Street, are the sort of blank spaces that make imaginative real estate developers giddy. ''What a great treasure trove of undeveloped sites,'' says Alf Naman, who builds residential projects downtown. ''Those are properties I've coveted for years.''
 Even after Gottlieb's death, however, his heirs wouldn't listen to offers. ''They told me that to them, 'sell' is a four-letter word,'' says Cary Tamarkin, an architect and developer. Historic preservationists have appreciated that intransigence; over the years, they came to see Bill Gottlieb as a sort of cheapskate savior, whose hands-off management style saved many buildings from insensitive renovations or outright demolition. Christine Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, once said that Gottlieb was possibly ''the biggest preservationist in the history of the West Side.'' But he was also a secretive businessman, careful to conceal his true intentions, and that inscrutability seems to run in his family.
 In 2004, five years after Gottlieb's death, with no fanfare or public announcement, workmen began showing up at the Keller Hotel. They would come and go at odd hours, sometimes in the middle of the night. Neighbors noticed they spent a lot of time inside a garage adjacent to the hotel. A building permit taped to the Keller's door said it was being renovated as a 20-unit apartment building. At long last, it seemed, the Gottlieb family was getting into development.
 One morning, Regina Joseph, another resident of 130 Barrow Street, was startled to hear a loud drilling sound emanating from next door. Then a crack appeared in her ceiling. Joseph called the city buildings department, and the agency's emergency-response team came to inspect. Joseph and the city inspector walked to the garage and peered through a round hole. They could see that, without proper permits, the construction workers had opened an enormous gash in the wall that separated the garage from the hotel. The buildings department issued a stop-work order but ultimately allowed work to continue. 
 Since then, Greenwich Village has been rife with theories about what was happening at the Keller Hotel and why it has now sputtered to a stop. Some speculate that the Gottlieb family ran out of money for the project. Some doubt that they were really behind it at all. The construction at the Keller has fueled rumors about changes coming to other Gottlieb buildings. Tenants complain that apartments are left empty and that management is refusing to renew leases. In keeping with longstanding custom, no one from the William Gottlieb Management Company responded to many interview requests made for this article. ''We've been requested by the Gottliebs not to give out any information about the project,'' Michael Devonshire, an architect that the family has hired as a consultant, said in a voice mail message. ''As you can imagine, they're a little gun-shy.''
 ''It's a huge neighborhood mystery,'' Regina Joseph says. ''It just makes you wonder what is really going on and who's in charge.''
 THE THREE-STORY town house at 136 Bank Street is covered with ivy vines, and the coat of white paint on its old wooden front door is cracked and peeling. Pasted beneath its buzzer is a large stenciled G, a remnant of the man who bought the place in 1972, for $37,000, and resided there until he died. The neighborhood changed all around him -- a house two doors down sold last year for $4.5 million -- but Bill Gottlieb remained a local curiosity up to the end. Gottlieb liked to call himself ''the Big G.'' As with all outsize figures, you have to sort the truth from folklore. ''Didn't he live in his car?'' one downtown broker asked me. Posthumously, Gottlieb has been cast as a real estate genius blessed with uncommon prescience and a sentimental investor in a vanishing culture of bohemianism, but it's far from clear that he ever intended to play either role. Many who knew the man suspect his ramshackle fortune was actually a product of parsimony and plain luck.
 ''I'm from the island,'' Gottlieb used to say when introducing himself. ''Coney Island.'' He was born at the height of the Great Depression. His father ran a restaurant and didn't own much of anything. ''One of my favorite stories about Billy,'' says Don Gabay, a lifelong friend of Gottlieb's who is a partner in the law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, ''was a meeting at the seller's attorney's office, an old-time Wall Street-type firm. We would meet in their mahogany-paneled office, and Billy would come in, in his broken-down clothing and probably a shopping bag carrying his files -- that's typically Billy -- and during a lull in the conversation, the two lawyers are talking to each other and one lawyer is saying to the other, 'his country club' and 'his golf club,' and he's telling him, 'Oh, at my club we do this and that.' '' Finally, Gabay recalls, Gottlieb silenced them with a stickball reference: ''At my club we can hit three sewers.''
 Gottlieb's first job in real estate was as a leasing representative for a brokerage firm belonging to Harry Helmsley, then one of New York's largest property owners. At night, Gottlieb took classes at Brooklyn Law School. With a little seed money from his sister, Mollie, and her husband, Irving Bender, who owned a bar called Poor Joe's, Gottlieb started buying buildings. 
 Working on commission, Gottlieb had struggled as a salesman, but he took note of how Helmsley, a legendary skinflint, made his money -- by buying buildings and slashing their operating expenses. Later in life, he liked to say that Helmsley had taught him another important lesson: never sell. When Gottlieb started acquiring buildings in the 1960s, the city was slouching toward bankruptcy. Gottlieb trolled for distressed sellers and reeled in properties at foreclosure auctions.
 Often, he'd revive a building's cash flow by installing a restaurant in its ground-floor commercial space. Many of these he ran himself. A place on Bleecker Street was called Gottlieb's; a Chinese restaurant was named for an Asian woman he was dating at the time. He and a subsequent girlfriend, a Jamaican, opened a string of Caribbean eateries. Though Gottlieb kept a paper-strewn office on Hudson Street, he preferred to work out of back rooms at the restaurants, serving drinks and inventing dishes when he wasn't closing deals.
 Gottlieb was heavyset and invariably dressed in wrinkled pants and an old golf shirt, which some people suspected he seldom changed. He wore big, black-framed glasses and carried a pendulous chain of keys. During the 1970s, Gottlieb used to outfit his orange Volkswagen Thing with loudspeakers and drive it through the Village, blasting disco music. Later on, he trundled around in a green station wagon with a busted heater and a broken window, sometimes stopping to offer lifts to his tenants. 
 ''A lot of people refer to him as an eccentric,'' his friend Gabay says. ''I don't think he was an eccentric. Maybe they call him eccentric because he could afford so much and chose to live simply. To me, that's not an eccentric. He knew who he was. He didn't have to pretend or show off.''
 Bill Gottlieb never married or had children. Friends say the passion of his life was not money, but ownership. ''He was a collector of buildings,'' one associate says. Thomas Elghanayan, the president of Rockrose Development Corp., sold an entire block in the meatpacking district to Gottlieb in 1986. ''Back in the early, early days, he owned a building on West Street that had a restaurant in it called the Inca,'' Elghanayan recalls. ''If you wanted to talk to Gottlieb, he was the bartender. Otherwise he was impossible to get ahold of.'' The city had imposed development restrictions on an entire block of meat lockers that Rockrose owned along Gansevoort Street, and Elghanayan was willing to unload them at Gottlieb's $2.5 million price. Today Gansevoort Street is lined with bistros. A comparably sized building on nearby Washington Street sold for $28 million six months ago, though it was not encumbered by the same development restrictions.
 ''If you saw him walking down the street, you would have thought he was a homeless guy, a bum,'' Elghanayan says. ''He was almost like a comical figure. But a good guy, a straight shooter, smart -- and he actually had great foresight.''
 In 1999, Bill Gottlieb, still a year short of 65, seemed to be embarking on ambitious plans. He filed for permits with the city buildings department, indicating that he finally intended to refurbish the crumbling Keller Hotel. He also fixed his sights on a large piece of property: a row of warehouses along 10th Avenue between 13th and 14th Streets, adjacent to a derelict elevated railway track known as the High Line. Another bidder, Alf Naman, thought he had a deal for the site, but Gottlieb made a stealthy approach to the sales broker. ''He just kind of swooped in,'' Naman recalls. The price, several million dollars, was high by Gottlieb's standards, but he could see how the meatpacking district was gentrifying. He told friends he figured this was his last chance to buy a property like that.
 A month after the 10th Avenue deal closed, Gottlieb collapsed at his company's office on Hudson Street after complaining of dizziness. He died a few days later of complications from a stroke. 
 For all his canniness when it came to real estate, it soon became evident that when it came to preparing for one future eventuality, Gottlieb had been extremely shortsighted. ''I know that he went to several law firms and got advice on a will,'' says Earle W. Kazis, a friend of Gottlieb's from the days when they both worked for Harry Helmsley. ''But he never proceeded, because he wasn't willing to pay the fees.''
 There actually was a will, as it turned out -- a simple, four-page document prepared in 1972, back when Gottlieb was just starting out, that would become the crucial piece of evidence in a long court battle for his immense fortune. But in the beginning, there was nothing but confusion, an empty space left behind by his death -- and into that void rushed a fractious cast of would-be heirs.
 Gottlieb's sudden death left his business in chaos. His older sister, Mollie Bender, had worked in his office for years doing clerical work during the day and cooking Gottlieb's dinner in the evening. But not even she could make sense of his disorganized office. Mollie was named co-administrator of the estate, along with her brother, Arnold, who lived in Florida. Mollie's son, Neil, quit his job at a mortgage brokerage and took a desk at Gottlieb's company. ''I went to my mother's side,'' he testified at one of the many court proceedings that ensued. ''My uncle was dead.'' Her other child, Cheryl Dier, came up from Maryland with her husband, Jerry, a lawyer, who was soon working for the estate as a paid consultant. 
 Within three weeks of Gottlieb's death, according to court documents, the family was fighting. Arnold showed up at the Hudson Street office in the company of his lawyer, and a melee ensued. Mollie claimed that the lawyer punched and kicked Cheryl and struck her husband. (In a New York Observer article at the time, the lawyer disputed that he struck anyone.) Then Mollie filed papers in the city's Surrogate's Court, which handles estate cases, claiming she'd made a discovery in her brother's cluttered office: that musty 1972 will. Mollie stood to inherit everything. 
 During this period, Mollie began to rely heavily on Neil, according to those who had dealings with the estate. Like his uncle, Neil Bender had a law degree, but he'd never passed the bar. His youthful passion was rock music; he followed bands and shot concert films on his Super 8 camera. Neil worked for Bill Gottlieb for a short time when he was younger, but according to friends and family members, he didn't get along with his uncle. Records show that between the late 1980s and mid-1990s, Neil Bender defaulted on several loans, twice pleaded guilty to drunken-driving charges and had a tax lien placed on him by the I.R.S. Though he got a job at a mortgage brokerage that sometimes did business with Bill Gottlieb, he closed only about two dozen deals in a decade of work for the firm. Earle Kazis told me he urged Gottlieb to rehire his nephew on several occasions, if only to assure that there would be a clear successor within the family, but Gottlieb always refused. ''He'd say, 'No, I've had it with Neil,' '' recalls Kazis, who has had his own falling out with Gottlieb's heirs.
 Because Gottlieb hadn't prepared his estate, his family had little shelter from inheritance taxes. Mollie and Neil Bender held meetings with a half dozen Midtown law firms, hiring and firing several as they worked their way through the probate process. Ultimately, the family was able to work out a settlement with the I.R.S. over the estate-tax bill. The assessment, which stood at $50 million in 2004, is being paid in installments over 15 years.
 The settlement of the tax matter did little to repair the embittered relationships within the Gottlieb clan. Cheryl Dier watched with resentment as her brother, Neil, installed himself in the real estate office. In a court filing related to the subsequent estate dispute, she complained that his growing influence represented a ''bold and brazen attempt to steal the identity of William Gottlieb.'' In other court papers, Dier claimed her brother insisted on situating his desk so that he could maintain eye contact with Mollie Bender, in order to exercise ''mind control.'' Three months after Gottlieb's death, Dier sent an angry letter to her mother, calling Neil a ''rude and nasty dictator'' and demanding to be paid $100 an hour for her help around the office. 
 ''Yes, money does strange things to people,'' Dier wrote, ''and if they do not know how to handle it, it can destroy them.''
 Dier's husband, Jerry, an attorney who specialized in defending indigent criminals in Washington, D.C., had seen a huge increase in his income since he started billing the estate. But in June 2000, his consulting agreement was terminated. A year later, Cheryl Dier filed for divorce. By this time, her parents were sending her tens of thousands of dollars for living expenses. In court papers, Jerry Dier claimed his wife had told him that she was seeking the divorce only because her family was demanding it as a condition of her inheritance. Jerry Dier fought a long court battle to force Neil, Mollie and Irving Bender to give depositions. Then, in November 2004, Cheryl Dier abruptly fired her attorney and turned on her parents. The Diers have since dropped the divorce case. Neither of them would comment for this article.
 Then another family member entered the fray: Michael Corbett, Cheryl Dier's son from a previous marriage. He had his own grievances. Corbett was raised by his grandparents at the Bender family town house on Bethune Street. After Bill Gottlieb's death, he claims, his uncle Neil forced him out. In court filings related to the Gottlieb estate, Corbett further claims that his uncle tried to give Mollie and Irving Bender the impression that his wife, a Broadway actress and an astrologer, had a criminal past, and says that Neil Bender instructed his grandparents not to pick up the phone unless it rang a coded number of times. 
 Last June, Mollie Bender, who was 85, fell and broke her hip. On June 23, while in the hospital, she signed legal papers requesting that her son be appointed administrator of the Gottlieb estate. Shortly afterward, she was brought home to her apartment. When Michael Corbett and Cheryl Dier tried to visit her there on June 30, they were barred from entering by security, according to their signed affidavits. They went back the next day, in the company of the police, but Mollie Bender was sleeping and couldn't be disturbed. She died later that day.
 MOLLIE BENDER LEFT a will, which was prepared in 2005. It unambiguously disinherits her daughter, leaving everything to her elderly husband and her son. Nonetheless, Cheryl Dier, who is 58, and her 38-year-old son, Michael Corbett, brought separate challenges to the will in Surrogate's Court and have argued for Neil Bender's disqualification as executor on the grounds of incompetence. (Bender, through Kekst and Company, a public-relations firm specializing in ''crisis management,'' declined to comment for this story.) Neil Bender has hired several of New York's most prominent estate attorneys to defend his claim. None of them responded to requests for comment. In legal filings, however, they claim Dier is ''spiteful'' over her disinheritance. 
 Corbett, a personal trainer, previously worked for Bill Gottlieb as a restaurant manager and as a disc jockey at a family-owned roller rink. In the dispute over the Gottlieb fortune, he has tried to cast himself as the champion of the public interest. Corbett and his lawyer, Carl J. Mayer, held a press conference in August in front of the Northern Dispensary and have since been pressing their campaign on a Web site named savegreenwichvillage.com. Citing evidence of more than 500 outstanding housing violations against Gottlieb properties, Mayer calls Neil Bender ''derelict in the management of these properties.'' A spokeswoman for Bender's company says the city's records are out of date, while his attorneys suggest in their court filings that Corbett has a crasser motive for challenging his uncle: money. Corbett, they contend, is merely trying to force his uncle to accept an ''extortionist demand'' for a settlement.
 They point to an e-mail message in which Mayer said his client would drop the lawsuit in return for $50 million. ''If this estate is worth a billion dollars,'' Mayer responded in an interview, ''a $50 million offer is wholly reasonable. But the other side just won't negotiate.'' 
 Whatever Corbett's motives, there is considerable concern among residents in buildings owned by the estate. On February 21, State Senator Thomas Duane's office and the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenants' rights organization, held a public meeting for Gottlieb tenants in the basement of a church on Thompson Street. More than 100 worried people bombarded the organizers with complaints about rats, bedbugs, broken front doors and unreturned phone calls. The people sitting next to me had no heat, while the people in front of them were broiling at night. Joe Catron, a Metropolitan Council employee, asked the audience, ''How many of you have faced problems with lease renewals?'' Almost every hand shot up. Gottlieb tenants say that once vacated, empty apartments in their buildings are not being filled, while many storefronts have stood vacant for months. (A spokeswoman for William Gottlieb Management said the company ''is actively maintaining or improving all of its properties, and we respond to requests for service and other issues in a timely manner.'') After the meeting officially adjourned, Corbett, a slender man in a dark, baggy suit, gave an emotional speech, his voice cracking and the tendons on his neck bulging as he read aloud a letter from an unsettled tenant. ''They want everyone out!'' he shouted.
 Empty buildings would make renovation or sale easier. ''A building that's vacated is worth 30 to 40 percent more than one that isn't,'' says Leonard Steinberg, a broker who works downtown for Prudential Douglas Elliman. Neil Bender's filings in Surrogate's Court place the current value of the Gottlieb portfolio at $135 million -- an average of a little more than $1 million a property, an absurdly low appraisal by the standards of the Manhattan real estate market. Real estate professionals say the true sale price of the estate would surely be much higher, even in a depressed market. According to Steinberg, condos in Greenwich Village are still fetching more than $1,500 a square foot, and land for new construction is extraordinarily scarce. ''There is no property in the Village,'' says Vals Osborne, senior vice presidentat Stribling & Associates. ''There is nothing, nothing, nothing.''
 On the other hand, some say the estate's holdings may have lost considerable value in recent years, because zoning changes and historic-district initiatives have put tight use-and-height restrictions in place. Edward Baquero, a managing partner of Coalco, a development firm, looked into purchasing the estate back in 2000. ''It was interesting at first,'' he says. ''But when I drove around and looked at some of the sites, I realized that only a handful of them were desirable. But today, you know, those properties may look very different.'' Taking all the portfolio's warts into consideration, Baquero still says that he believes an investor would pay $700 million for all the properties. ''And I wouldn't fall off my chair if it's a billion,'' he adds.
 The most valuable properties are probably the meatpacking district warehouses Gottlieb bought just before his death. One of them burned down a few years ago, and the others are in a state of disrepair, but the site sits next to the High Line -- now being turned into a park -- and across the street from a gargantuan half-built hotel called the Standard, New York. (Four years ago, the group developing the Standard, led by hotelier Andre Balazs, paid $25 million for the land on which it sits.) There are other interesting pieces: a charming riverfront building on West Street that once held a gay bar called the Ramrod; an assemblage of deserted structures between Downing Street and West Houston, right across from the Film Forum; and a number of properties on the Lower East Side, where gentrification and lax height restrictions have given rise to condominium skyscrapers. 
 Some smallish Gottlieb parcels would be precious to builders who are trying to assemble large blocks of land for development. Building around the Gottlieb family is notoriously frustrating. Michael Romanoff, a meatpacking district developer, says that for years he has been trying to talk Neil Bender into selling a building the estate owns adjacent to some of his property on West 13th Street. ''He doesn't respond, he doesn't answer phones, he doesn't communicate,'' Romanoff says. Peter Moore, an architect who recently spent $34 million for three properties surrounding a Gottlieb tenement on West Street, described a similar experience. ''We would like to buy the Gottlieb site, but that doesn't seem to be possible,'' Moore says. ''I guess when I pass from this earth and I'm hopefully in heaven, maybe I'll run into Bill and we can do a deal up there.''
 Despite Bender's reputation for intransigence among developers, he does seem to want a seat in the clubby world of New York real estate. He attended the Real Estate Board of New York's annual banquet, a $900-a-plate networking event, in January. ''I think his attitude is going to be businesslike,'' says a friend of Bill Gottlieb's who still talks with Neil Bender and who declined to be identified because he wanted to preserve the relationship. ''Everybody thinks they should be doing something. Everyone thought that Bill should have been doing something 20 years ago. Now something is happening, but it's a surprise. They've got us lulled, those Gottliebs.''
 IF NEIL BENDER has big plans for the properties, he's not talking. At least not now. But there are hints lurking in public places. The Gottlieb estate for years waged a fight in the City Council and the courts seeking to have the development restrictions removed from its properties on Gansevoort Street, a change that would have allowed a developer to build office space. (A court ruled against it in 2006.) Recently, Neil Bender hired a Williamsburg architectural firm with a background in green development. He has been meeting with the architects about the stop-and-start renovations at the Keller Hotel. They're also designing a building for a smidgen of waterfront land at West 12th and West Streets. The architects would not comment, but evidence filed in connection with a 2006 lawsuit between the estate and John Chen, a structural engineer who once worked on the project, reveals plans for a six-story luxury residential building named the Inca, after the restaurant Bill Gottlieb once ran on the property.
 Earlier this year, demolition crews began taking down the old Inca building, only to inexplicably stop halfway. Cary Tamarkin, who is putting up a residential building next door, has watched the progress, such as it is. ''They take out a couple of bricks every couple of days,'' he says. ''They're bizarre.'' 
 A recent ruling by the Surrogate's Court judge Renee R. Roth could begin to resolve the disputes. In mid-January, she heard arguments over Neil Bender's petition to be named administrator of his uncle's estate. Cheryl Dier, a slim, dark-haired woman, stepped forward to accuse her brother, who was not present, of mounting a ''hostile takeover.'' But in February, Roth issued a ruling that gave Neil and Irving Bender control of the estate. In a statement released by his public-relations firm, Neil Bender said he hoped the favorable ruling would allow him ''to continue focusing on the business.'' Michael Corbett, however, has pledged to appeal. ''This will go on for a very long time,'' says Carl J. Mayer, Corbett's lawyer. ''If anybody is thinking of developing this area, bulldozing it over with another high-rise in the Village, I don't think they're properly analyzing the litigation.''
 ON BARROW STREET, people still wonder about the Keller Hotel. ''It was totally, totally mysterious,'' said Katy Bordonaro, a neighborhood activist, as we stood across the street from the partially renovated flophouse one recent afternoon. Local preservationists were somewhat comforted when the city designated the building a landmark last March. A death announcement for Mollie Bender, published in The New York Times, said the project is supposed to be completed by the end of this year. Yet Bordonaro told me that there had been only sporadic activity. 
 ''There's still a lot of us who remember it when it was the Keller Hotel,'' says the Barrow Street resident Regina Joseph. ''When the West Village actually had pockets of seediness.'' Joseph, one of the founders of Blender, the music magazine, used to buy cigarettes at the Keller's downstairs bar. She is now a part-time writer, art curator, branding consultant and diet guru. ''If it wasn't for William Gottlieb, the West Village would all be covered in ugly glass Meier towers,'' she continues. Scuzzy as the Village sometimes was, Joseph misses the time when it was a place of oddity and transgression and a little danger. ''It was not this shiny, glossy, hedge-fundy neighborhood back then,'' she told me. ''That building is one of the last remnants of that world.''

HEADLINE: Almost as if the Sky Were Falling

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
SO far, not so good. The year began with the worst quarter for the stock market in six years, a decline of more than 9 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 The average equity fund recorded a loss of 9.0 percent, so the statements that investors receive this month from the companies that manage their money will not make for pleasant reading. Yet with all the problems afflicting the economy, financial system and markets, there may also be some relief that the results were no worse.
 ''Consumers have record debt, home prices are falling, jobs are harder to come by, we're paying more at supermarkets and the gas pump than we have in a long time,'' said Russ Koesterich, senior portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investors. ''It's a combination of events that is finally starting to take a toll.''
 The focal point for the stock market's difficulties has been the precarious state of the banking system. Unsure of the worth of exotic instruments -- collateralized debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities -- on their balance sheets, let alone the balance sheets of the institutions with which they trade, banks have been reluctant to lend money to one another, or to anyone else. 
 The mounting losses reported by banks as these securities continued to go bad, as well as uncertainty about the extent of the damage and the impact of dried-up credit, sent stocks in the sector sharply lower and dragged down the rest of the market, too.
 ''What we heard in the first quarter was the sound of credit crunching everywhere and the effects that that had on a wide variety of markets, including mutual funds,'' said P. Brett Hammond, chief investment strategist at the fund manager TIAA-CREF.
 Selling in the stock market reached twin crescendos after uneasy weekends resulting from startling developments at major banks. In mid-January, Societe Generale of France revealed that an employee had accumulated losses of about $7 billion; the bank had to sell stocks worth tens of billions in a hurry to unwind his positions.
 Then, in March, the once-venerated investment bank Bear Stearns was delivered into the arms of JPMorgan Chase in what amounted to a shotgun wedding in which both barrels were aimed at the bride and the trigger pulled. The Federal Reserve engineered the purchase of Bear at $2 a share, igniting an outcry so vigorous among Bear's shareholders that JPMorgan raised the price to $10 a few days later.
 Tobias Levkovich, the chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research, described the reaction to the forced sale of Bear Stearns, especially the $2 price tag after the stock closed the previous Friday in the $30's, as ''stunned fear.''
 ''It was not abject fear or slit-your-throat fear,'' Mr. Levkovich said. ''People were just stunned that it could happen so quickly. They said, 'Oh, my God, it could happen to anybody.' ''
 The fact that it has not happened to anybody else, at least not yet, may account for the recovery in last weeks of the quarter. The S.& P. 500 ended the quarter up 5.2 percent from the low on March 17, and some of the best recoveries were in sectors that had suffered the biggest losses, like banking and home building.
 When share prices sank last month roughly to where they were when the Societe Generale news came out, investors collectively said, '' 'We can hold here; the world isn't coming to an end,' '' Mr. Levkovich said.
 For many segments of the stock market, however, it spun with a noticeable wobble through the first quarter. Morningstar tracks eight varieties of equity funds that focus on specific industries, and just one -- precious metals -- came out ahead in the period, by 5.4 percent.
 Four of the other seven sectors had double-digit losses, from 16.1 percent for communications to 11.9 percent for health care. Utilities lost just under 10 percent, and natural-resources and real estate funds showed more muted declines.
 Funds that specialize in foreign stock markets have been big winners for several years, but they fared about as poorly in the first quarter as funds that trolled the domestic market. The average international fund fell 9.0 percent, according to Morningstar.
 CERTAIN bond funds served as a refuge for investors. The average taxable bond fund scratched out a return of 0.1 percent for the quarter, with gains concentrated in funds that own long-term government bonds and foreign bonds. The first group benefited from falling yields, as investors continued to factor a recession into prices. The second got a lift from rising currency values, which increase returns when translated into dollars.
 Other types of bond funds were victims of the credit crisis. Concern about defaults left high-yield and municipal funds with losses for the quarter.
 Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief investment officer of the TCW Group, expects those concerns to persist, along with the slump in the housing market. Defaults may accelerate as interest-only mortgages reset to conventional ones, he warned.
 ''I would expect delinquencies to absolutely explode'' when the resets gather pace, he said in a recent conference call to reporters. ''The day of reckoning is probably coming.''
 But investors tend to factor reckonings into prices long before the day arrives, and Mr. Gundlach contends that this is happening in the bond market. The rally in high-quality instruments like Treasury bonds is close to running its course, he predicted, while low-grade paper may be due for a rebound.
 In an effort to ''take advantage of the distress,'' he said, his funds have been buying some of the mortgage securities that have been sold heavily.
 As the second quarter continues, investors in the stock market will also have to decide how much bad news is reflected in prices and whether it's time to buy. Henry Herrmann, C.E.O. of Waddell & Reed, glimpses signs of one necessary condition for a lasting bottom: an awareness of just how grim things are.
 ''The severity of the impact of securitization crystallized in the first quarter,'' Mr. Herrmann said, and the impact of bad debts arising from the sausage-grinder packaging of loans into tradable securities ''became pretty well understood by everybody.'' That warrants buying stocks, he added, but in a conservative way.
 ''I don't think we're close to good times rolling, but I do think most of the bad stuff has been recognized,'' he said.
 Mr. Koesterich at Barclays, meanwhile, is worried about the indebtedness of shoppers.
 ''The economy right now is unusually dependent on the consumer,'' he said. If spending ''slides dramatically, there is nothing else to offset it.''
 Mr. Koesterich expects the stock market to hold its own or to fall slightly over the next few months. He advises investors to keep a lower allocation in stocks than they usually do and to concentrate on defensive sectors like health care and consumer staples, while avoiding consumer-discretionary industries, like automaking, lodging and retailing.
 He would also steer clear of utilities -- which he said might suffer from concern that a Democrat as president, along with a Democratic-controlled Congress, would mean higher dividend tax rates in the future. And he would avoid commodity producers, whose shares he thinks have rallied beyond what fundamental economic and corporate developments warrant.
 Mr. Levkovich also expects commodity-related assets to decline -- sooner rather than later, he emphasized -- but he is more optimistic about the general market. He encourages investors to begin buying stocks in sectors that tend to do best when an economic recovery begins, like financial services and semiconductors.
 Forecasts for the stock market differ among investors, but one remark by Mr. Herrmann probably reflects a nearly universal consensus. ''The first quarter was about as rough a quarter as you're going to get,'' he said. ''I wouldn't want to annualize it.''

HEADLINE: Duck and Cover: It's the New Survivalism

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
THE traditional face of survivalism is that of a shaggy loner in camouflage, holed up in a cabin in the wilderness and surrounded by cases of canned goods and ammunition. 
 It is not that of Barton M. Biggs, the former chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley. Yet in Mr. Biggs's new book, ''Wealth, War and Wisdom,'' he says people should ''assume the possibility of a breakdown of the civilized infrastructure.''
 ''Your safe haven must be self-sufficient and capable of growing some kind of food,'' Mr. Biggs writes. ''It should be well-stocked with seed, fertilizer, canned food, wine, medicine, clothes, etc. Think Swiss Family Robinson. Even in America and Europe there could be moments of riot and rebellion when law and order temporarily completely breaks down.'' 
 Survivalism, it seems, is not just for survivalists anymore. 
 Faced with a confluence of diverse threats -- a tanking economy, a housing crisis, looming environmental disasters, and a sharp spike in oil prices -- people who do not consider themselves extremists are starting to discuss doomsday measures once associated with the social fringes. 
 They stockpile or grow food in case of a supply breakdown, or buy precious metals in case of economic collapse. Some try to take their houses off the electricity grid, or plan safe houses far away. The point is not to drop out of society, but to be prepared in case the future turns out like something out of ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' if not ''Mad Max.'' 
 ''I'm not a gun-nut, camo-wearing skinhead. I don't even hunt or fish,'' said Bill Marcom, 53, a construction executive in Dallas. 
 Still, motivated by a belief that the credit crunch and a bursting housing bubble might spark widespread economic chaos -- ''the Greater Depression,'' as he put it -- Mr. Marcom began to take measures to prepare for the unknown over the last few years: buying old silver coins to use as currency; buying G.P.S. units, a satellite telephone and a hydroponic kit; and building a simple cabin in a remote West Texas desert. 
 ''If all these planets line up and things do get really bad,'' Mr. Marcom said, ''those who have not prepared will be trapped in the city with thousands of other people needing food and propane and everything else.''
 Interest in survivalism -- in either its traditional hard-core version or a middle-class ''lite'' variation -- functions as a leading economic indicator of social anxiety, preparedness experts said: It spikes at times of peril real (the post-Sept. 11 period) or imagined (the chaos that was supposed to follow the so-called Y2K computer bug in 2000). 
 At times, a degree of paranoia is officially sanctioned. In the 1950s, civil defense authorities encouraged people to build personal bomb shelters because of the nuclear threat. In 2003, the Department of Homeland Security encouraged Americans to stock up on plastic sheeting and duct tape to seal windows in case of biological or chemical attacks. 
 Now, however, the government, while still conducting business under a yellow terrorism alert, is no longer taking a lead role in encouraging preparedness. For some, this leaves a vacuum of reassurance, and plenty to worry about.
 Esteemed economists debate whether the credit crisis could result in a complete meltdown of the financial system. A former vice president of the United States informs us that global warming could result in mass flooding, disease and starvation, perhaps even a new Ice Age. 
 ''You just can't help wonder if there's a train wreck coming,'' said David Anderson, 50, a database administrator in Colorado Springs who said he was moved by economic uncertainties and high energy prices, among other factors, to stockpile months' worth of canned goods in his basement for his wife, his two young children and himself.
 Popular culture also provides reinforcement, in books like ''The Road,'' Cormac McCarthy's novel about a father and son journeying through a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and films like ''I Am Legend,'' which stars Will Smith as a survivor of a man-made virus wandering the barren streets of New York.
 Middle-class survivalists can also browse among a growing number of how-to books with titles like ''Dare to Prepare!'' a self-published work by Holly Drennan Deyo, or ''When All Hell Breaks Loose'' by Cody Lundin (Gibbs Smith, 2007), which instructs readers how to dispose of bodies and dine on rats and dogs in the event of disaster.
 Preparedness activity is difficult to track statistically, since people who take measures are usually highly circumspect by nature, said Jim Rawles, the editor of www.survivalblog.com, a preparedness Web site. Nevertheless, interest in the survivalist movement ''is experiencing its largest growth since the late 1970s,'' Mr. Rawles said in an e-mail, adding that traffic at his blog has more than doubled in the past 11 months, with more than 67,000 unique visitors per week. And its base is growing. 
 ''Our core readership is still solidly conservative,'' he said. ''But in recent months I've noticed an increasing number of stridently green and left-of-center readers.''
 One left-of-center environmentalist who is taking action is Alex Steffen, the executive editor of www.worldchanging.com, a Web site devoted to sustainability. With only slight irony, Mr. Steffen, 40, said he and his girlfriend could serve as ''poster children for the well-adjusted, urban liberal survivalist,'' given that they keep a six-week cache of food and supplies in his basement in Seattle (although they polished off their bottle of doomsday whiskey at a party). 
 He said the chaos following Hurricane Katrina served as a wake-up call for him and others that the government might not be able to protect them in an emergency or environmental crisis. 
 ''The 'where do we land when climate change gets crazy?' question seems to be an increasingly common one,'' said Mr. Steffen in an e-mail message, adding that such questions have ''really gone mainstream.'' 
 Many of the new, nontraditional preparedness converts are ''Peakniks,'' Mr. Rawles said, referring to adherents of the ''Peak Oil'' theory. This concept holds that the world will soon, or has already, reached a peak in oil production, and that coming supply shortages might threaten society. While the theory is still disputed by many industry analysts and executives, it has inched toward the mainstream in the last two years, as oil prices have nearly doubled, surpassing $100 a barrel. The topic, which was the subject of a United States Department of Energy report in 2005, has attracted attention in publications like The New York Times Magazine and The Wall Street Journal, and was a primary focus of ''Megadisasters: Oil Apocalypse,'' a recent History Channel special. 
 Another book, ''The Long Emergency'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2005), by James Howard Kunstler, an author and journalist who writes about economic and environmental issues, argues that American suburbs and cities may soon lay desolate as people, starved of oil, are forced back to the land to adopt a hardscrabble, 19th-century-style agrarian life. 
 Such fears caused Joyce Jimerson of Bellingham, Wash., a coordinator for a recycling-composting program affiliated with Washington State University, to make her yard an ''edible garden,'' with fruit trees and vegetables, in case supplies are threatened by oil shortages, climate change or economic collapse. ''It's all the same ball of wax, as far as I'm concerned,'' she said. 
 Scott Troyer, an energy consultant in Sunnyvale, Calif., said he was spurred by discussions of peak oil -- ''it's not a theory,'' he said -- and other energy concerns to remake his suburban house in anticipation of a petroleum-starved future. Mr. Troyer, 57, installed a photovoltaic electricity system, a pellet stove and a ''cool roof'' to reflect the sun's rays, among other measures. 
 Mr. Troyer remains cautiously optimistic that Americans can wean themselves from oil through smart engineering and careful planning. But, he said, ''the doomsday scenarios will happen if people don't prepare.'' 
 Some middle-class preparedness converts, like Val Vontourne, a musician and paralegal in Olympia, Wash., recoil at the term ''survivalist,'' even as they stock their homes with food, gasoline and water. 
 ''I think of survivalists as being an extreme case of preparedness,'' said Ms. Vontourne, 44, ''people who stockpile guns and weapons, anticipating extreme aggression. Whereas what I'm doing, I think of as something responsible people do.
 ''I now think of storing extra food, water, medicine and gasoline in the same way I think of buying health insurance and putting money in my 401k,'' she said. ''It just makes sense.''

HEADLINE: Moral Hazard

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
''You did moral hazard in 1998,'' writes Steven Weisman, a Times colleague with an archival memory. ''Everyone is using it now to describe the supposed 'moral hazard' of bailing out Bear Stearns. An oldie but goodie; maybe it's time to return to it.''
 ''We're very aware of moral hazard,'' Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. told George Stephanopoulos of ABC a few weeks ago, as the Federal Reserve Board stepped in to allay the risk in J. P. Morgan Chase's takeover of the anxiety-attacked investment bank, ''but our primary concern right now . . . is the stability of our financial system, the orderliness of our markets.'' He saw the risk of growing panic to be greater than the risk of undermining the discipline of punishment. Here's what that means: 
 There are times when helping people in the short run may hurt them in the long run. Contrariwise, there are times when refusing to help people in the short run means they won't have a long run at all. That's the dilemma inherent in the phrase moral hazard. Does protection against risk tempt a person to do ever-riskier things? Does it endanger your moral sense -- undermine a person's character or weaken an institution's self-discipline -- to reduce the severe consequences of foolish action?
 Put punchily, does it weaken morality to lessen the lesson of loss?
 The phrase was born in the controversy in the mid-19th century about the wisdom of the ascending scale of life-insurance premiums, encouraging the healthy to drop out and the sickly to stay in. The American Cyclopedia in 1875 called that ''a moral hazard too great to be incurred in the present state of society.'' Economists seized the phrase in 1895: ''Lack of moral character,'' reported The Quarterly Journal of Economics, ''gives rise to a class of risks known by insurance men as moral hazards.''
 There are still those who mutter that burglary insurance discourages people from locking their doors, but the idea of all kinds of insurance -- purchased by individuals or given by government -- seems to have caught on. The concern of conservatives that government ''relief'' undermined the work ethic led to bipartisan reforms that encouraged ''workfare''; the worry of liberals was that large companies or leading banks would undergo moral hazard if they were protected by government as too big to fail. That phrase, used in a 1936 Times subheadline about a call by the former governor Al Smith (''He Says New York Is Too Big to Fail in Duty of Giving to Private Welfare Agencies'') surfaced again in a 1975 Business Week headline about a government loan guarantee to protect Lockheed Aircraft: ''When Companies Get Too Big to Fail.'' Later that year, The Economist noted ''all the scary stuff about what the collapse of New York would do to the domestic and world financial system'' and predicted the city's rescue because ''it is too big to fail.'' 
 The reader who wants a profound look at the phrase that launched a thousand Wall Street arguments about the effect on moral character of the forgiveness of failure can find it in the December 1996 Texas Law Review article ''On the Genealogy of Moral Hazard,'' by Tom Baker. To see how that phrase applies to the pros and cons of bailing out those banks, speculators and homeowners embroiled in the subprime mortgage mess -- a surefire campaign issue -- consult today's front pages.
 Bailout
 Before too big to fail became a nervously practical answer to the worry about moral hazard, the word coined to describe the method used to rescue a financial entity from the consequences of risky or irresponsible behavior was bailout.
 The verb to bail, ''to throw water out of a boat in buckets or bails,'' has been with us since 1613. In 1930, that term for the rescue of fishermen lightening the load of a leaky boat was applied to pilots who saved their lives by throwing themselves out of aircraft in parachutes. But as Business Week noted in its 1975 article about the Lockheed case (mentioned above), ''The mounting number of bailouts . . . blurs the distinction between the capitalist revolution and the Marxist version.''
 When did the noun bailout gain its pejorative connotation? As far as I can tell, it started out as a word with built-in disapproval. Deep in the vast file of citations at Merriam-Webster is a 1951 report by Time magazine in which Senator Stuart Symington accused a former federal bureaucrat, then with an oil company, of directing a loan ''damned by the Senate Banking Subcommittee as a 'bail-out' for big banks and Massachusetts insurance companies.'' The definition is now in the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary as ''a rescue from financial distress.'' 
 When challenged to antedate that, Jesse Sheidlower of the O.E.D. ran the traps of search engines to come up with a 1940 Wall Street Journal usage quoting a Securities and Exchange Commission official saying he would ''prohibit loans to officers and other methods of effecting a 'bail-out.' ''
 What's the significance of all this? (Or as Vice President Cheney succinctly put it last month to a questioner: ''So?'') So, if you're not worried about the moral hazard of removing the penalties that inhibit too much risk-taking, and you can justify intercession by the government because the demise of an erring institution would spread and is thus too big to fail, then proceed with the bailout. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. (Where's that from?)

HEADLINE: A Brighter Spotlight, Yet the Pay Rises

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
WASN'T 2008 supposed to be the year of shareholder victory on the executive compensation front? 
 After all, tighter disclosure rules kicked in last year, and -- the theory went -- once companies had to shine a spotlight on their compensation practices, they were bound to make them better. Politicians, never loath to acknowledge the national mood -- particularly in an election year -- held several hearings about excessive pay.
 But signs of sweeping change remain few. Once again, many -- perhaps most -- companies filled their proxies with a blizzard of words and numbers that did more to obscure their processes than to illuminate them. And most irksome of all, true links between pay and performance remained scarce.
 Shareholders were mad about excessive compensation last year, when the economy was booming. This year, governance experts say, they are livid. ''They are furious about the dichotomy of experiences -- their shares fall, yet C.E.O. pay still rises,'' said Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at the Corporate Library, a governance research group. 
 The compensation research firm Equilar recently compiled data about chief executive pay at 200 companies that filed their proxies by March 28 and had revenues of at least $6.5 billion. And the data illustrates Mr. Hodgson's point. It shows that average compensation for chief executives who had held the job at least two years rose 5 percent in 2007, to $11.2 million (If new C.E.O.'s are counted, that number is $11.7 million). Even though performance-based bonuses were down last year, the value and prevalence of discretionary bonuses -- ones not linked to performance -- were up. A result is that C.E.O.'s who have held their jobs for two years received an average total bonus payout of $2.8 million, up 1.1 percent from 2006.
 ''We're not against pay,'' said Dennis Johnson, a senior portfolio manager who is responsible for corporate governance for Calpers, the California pension fund. ''But we are certainly against pay for failure, or for just showing up.'' 
 Certainly, some of the highest-paid chiefs -- including Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle, Alan G. Lafley of Procter & Gamble and Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs -- presided over companies that did very well. But in other cases, it was hard to see a connection between high pay and savvy management.
 Soaring oil prices, not stellar strategy, brought huge profits to many oil companies last year, yet Ray R. Irani, chief of Occidental Petroleum, saw his compensation rise 21 percent, to $33.6 million making him the sixth-highest-paid executive in the group of 200 in the survey.
 Conversely, the aftermath of the subprime mortgage debacle wreaked havoc at Merrill Lynch, causing the ouster of E. Stanley O'Neal last fall. It is too soon to know whether John A. Thain, who now has the top spot, can restore Merrill's former glory. But thanks in large part to a hefty sign-on bonus, he was the highest-paid executive in the survey, with a compensation package that totaled almost $83.8 million. 
 Then again, the financial services industry traditionally pays well. The heads of four financial companies -- Mr. Thain, Mr. Blankfein, Kenneth I. Chenault of American Express and John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley -- were among the 10 highest-paid chief executives in the survey. 
 Even when the credit crisis cost financial chiefs their jobs, it did not hurt their paychecks. Mr. O'Neal at Merrill and Charles Prince at Citigroup both walked away with fortunes. 
 Washington Mutual, meanwhile, decided that write-offs would not count when it calculated performance-based bonuses, a decision that one compensation expert referred to as calculating batting averages without counting strikes.
 ''Boards are just too willing to change the goal posts in bad times,'' said Scott A. Fenn, managing director of policy for the proxy advisory firm Proxy Governance.
 A result, said Charles M. Elson, a corporate governance expert at the University of Delaware, is that ''we're paying executives like successful entrepreneurs, without asking them to take entrepreneurial risks.'' 
 THAT seemed particularly apparent among real estate companies that are coping with a housing downturn. Jeffrey Mezger, the new chief at KB Home, received a discretionary bonus of $6 million even though the company is suffering. Robert Toll, the chief at Toll Brothers, received no bonus in 2007 -- but the company has rewritten the compensation plan so that he will probably get one this year even if home building does not recover.
 ''Directors have to look at C.E.O. pay in terms of return on investment, just like they judge any other dollar they allocate,'' said Nell Minow, editor and co-founder of the Corporate Library. ''They have to ask, 'What are we getting back for this money?' '' 
 In many cases, the answer would be ''not much.'' According to Equilar, the chiefs of the 10 largest financial services firms in the survey were awarded a combined total of $320 million last year, even though the firms reported mortgage-related losses that totaled $55 billion and that wiped out more than $200 billion in shareholder value. 
 Still, even the angriest shareholders acknowledge that some companies are trying to take inequities -- and the mystique -- out of their compensation plans. The chief executives of Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns did forfeit their bonuses after the subprime mortgage debacle decimated company profits. And Morgan Stanley said it would introduce performance-related stock options. 
 At the 200 companies that Equilar studied this year, the average value of performance-based bonuses granted to chief executives who had been in their jobs for at least two years was $1.8 million, a drop of 2.5 percent from 2006. Moreover, only 73 percent of the chiefs got performance bonuses, down from 78.6 percent in 2006. 
 Equilar also said that 14.7 percent of the stock options and shares awarded to executives in the fourth quarter of 2007 had performance-based vesting criteria -- a small percentage, but a big increase from 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.
 More companies adopted clawback provisions, in which executives are required to return bonuses or stock options that were based on faulty numbers. The Arkansas Best Corporation even established one for outside directors if any ''misconduct'' on their part ever contributed to the need to restate finances. (Wal-Mart Stores adopted a similar clause two years ago.) 
 And a handful of chief executives and directors led the charge against excessive pay themselves. 
 Four years ago, when David P. Steiner was promoted to chief of Waste Management, he took what he calls a ''surgical look'' at the compensation system. It rewarded executives, including the chief, for bringing in new customers and orders, even unprofitable ones. ''It sent the wrong message, that we wanted growth for growth's sake,'' he said. 
 Gradually the board, at Mr. Steiner's prodding, changed the formula. Last year, 75 percent of Mr. Steiner's long-term incentive plan was tied to specific targets for earnings growth and return on invested capital. And for the first time, the plan included a clawback provision, saying he must return any payments if they were based on numbers that had to be restated.
 And next year's proxy will reflect even more changes. Mr. Steiner's pay is now linked entirely to achieving those targets. And some perks he used to get -- about $35,000 worth of items like car allowances and country club dues -- are gone, though their value will be added to his base salary or bonus.
 RiskMetrics just went public this year, and M. Ethan Berman, its chief executive, insisted on getting it right from the start. Last year, RiskMetrics bought Institutional Shareholder Services, the high-profile proxy watchdog organization, so Mr. Berman knew that, as he put it, ''Ours will be one of the world's most well-read proxies.'' He also buys into the concept, he said, that an excessive pay package can indicate a board that is too beholden to top management. 
 Thus, his incentive compensation will be based on attaining a mix of financial growth and client and employee retention objectives that are clearly spelled out in the proxy. Mr. Berman said he already owns 10 to 15 percent of the company -- ''more than enough to align my interests with shareholders,'' he said -- so he receives no stock grants or options. And he does not have a severance package. ''I get the same four weeks vacation as any other employee, and if I leave, I'll get the same severance,'' he said. 
 Some companies that have been castigated for compensation fiascos in the past are emerging in the best light now. In 2007, shareholders howled when they discovered that Robert L. Nardelli's contract as chief of Home Depot enabled him to command a severance package totaling $210 million when he was ousted.
 The Home Depot board did not make the same mistake when it wrote the contract for Frank Blake, Mr. Nardelli's successor. ''Frank Blake's package is so tied to performance that it is almost the mirror image of Nardelli's,'' said Ms. Minow of the Corporate Library. ''Home Depot went from the worst pay package imaginable to one that is close to exemplary.''
 Still, shareholders say praiseworthy packages remain in the minority. And they have plenty of compensation issues they continue to attack. 
 A group of investors, led by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, is asking companies to limit or bar ''gross-ups,'' in which companies pay the taxes the C.E.O.'s incur from their pay packages. 
 The timing is not surprising. Many shareholders were aghast last year when Angelo R. Mozilo, who earned $100 million at Countrywide Financial in 2006, successfully argued that Countrywide should pay the taxes that were incurred that year when his wife accompanied him to business functions on the corporate jet. 
 And gross-ups certainly have not disappeared this year. R. Chad Dreier, the chief of Ryland Homes, earned almost $8.2 million last year. Only $1 million of his pay was salary, and a bit over $2 million was bonus. More than $4 million was gross-ups to cover taxes incurred by vesting of restricted stock that was granted in previous years. 
 The Corporate Library has just released data showing that 20 percent of chief executives received a tax gross-up on part of their income in 2006. The median gross-up amount was just $13,000, but the concept -- that any corporate chief should receive tax assistance on top of multimillion-dollar payouts -- stuck in shareholders' craws.
 ''We're putting this research out early enough so that shareholders can wave it at directors,'' Mr. Hodgson said. 
 Shareholders are also concerned about pay packages that can encourage executives to sacrifice the future for a present-day payout. Mr. Hodgson points to Sprint Nextel as a prime example. In a recent filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it had redesigned its compensation plans so that incentive pay for progress toward goals would kick in every quarter. 
 ''If you put a carrot in front of a donkey's nose, it simply chases that carrot,'' Mr. Hodgson said. ''Better you add the carrots to the feedbag, but you don't let the donkey eat any of them until it's accomplished what's needed for long-term success.'' 
 And a growing cadre of investors are asking that companies reward only superior performance -- for example, if the company was more profitable than its peers. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters has filed pay-for-superior-performance proposals at 33 companies, including Best Buy, Honeywell International, WellPoint and Northern Trust, according to RiskMetrics records.
 Disclosure -- or lack thereof -- remains a huge issue for shareholders.
 ''We don't want to see boilerplate,'' said Hye-Won Choi, head of governance for TIAA-Cref, which has made compensation the cornerstone of its governance campaign this year. (Last year it was majority voting for directors.) ''We want to see how the compensation plan is integrated into the business plan and strategic goals and how it is tied to the performance of the individual and the company. And we want companies to clearly articulate targets for payout.''
 So does the S.E.C. The agency has contacted 350 companies to insist that they specify performance targets and couch their disclosures in understandable English. 
 It has also revamped its own Web site, to make it the go-to spot for companies seeking guidance on plain-English disclosure. 
 ''It's our aim to break down all the legalese and the jargon, and the dense cover-your-assets boilerplate that reads more like the insurance policy it is than the helpful guide to investors that it's meant to be,'' Christopher Cox, the agency's chairman, said in a speech last year. 
 But excess, incomprehensible verbiage was not the only problem with disclosure this year. Many companies -- most citing a reluctance to disclose competitive information -- couched the criteria by which they measured performance in the vaguest of terms. According to the Corporate Library, two-thirds of companies listed fuzzy performance targets -- and of those, no more than 30 percent were really competitively sensitive. 
 ''Sure, we understand if you don't want competitors to know that your chief executive's bonus is tied to opening 10 stores in Delaware,'' said John Nestor, director of the S.E.C.'s office of public affairs. ''But you could at least say the bonus is dependent on successfully expanding.''
 Shareholders, for the most part, say they accept that companies cannot divulge sensitive information. But they do not accept that stock price appreciation or profit growth goals belong in that category. 
 ''Companies are still failing to disclose the performance hurdles that trigger pay for performance, and that remains a hugely contentious issue for shareholders,'' said Patrick McGurn, special counsel to the RiskMetrics Group, the new name for Institutional Shareholder Services. 
 Perhaps surprisingly, not all governance experts buy into the idea of forced transparency on targets. Some worry that if shareholders win on this issue, it might be a pyrrhic victory. 
 ''We worry about unintended consequences,'' said Rebecca K. Darr, a senior fellow at the Aspen Institute, which convenes forums at which executives and shareholders discuss governance issues. ''If companies have to say how they measure individual performance, they might simply revert to easily quantifiable numbers like earnings per share, rather than complex long-term goals.'' 
 In fact, some compensation consultants say the S.E.C. disclosure rules went too far. Pearl Meyer, a senior managing director at Steven Hall & Partners, suggests that executives who missed performance targets might still deserve hefty bonuses, if they managed to stem losses even as economic factors beyond their control -- say, soaring oil prices or a housing slowdown -- decimated their industry. But, she said, it would be hard to lay out a cogent formula for that. Thus, she concludes, making directors spell out the details of their compensation plans could force them toward rewarding conventional short-term performance.
 OF course, some governance experts are suggesting the quintessentially simple fix: Have directors sit down with shareholders and ask what they really want to know. 
 ''When it comes to disclosure, last year was a dud,'' said Stephen M. Davis, project director at the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance at Yale. ''So you'd think that, since the proxy statements are supposed to communicate to the investor community, the boards would ask shareholders what should or should not go into them.''
 Pfizer, for one, seems to be doing just that. Shareholders were outraged last year when Hank McKinnell, the company's former chief, walked away with nearly $200 million when he was ousted. So last October, the Pfizer directors invited representatives of large shareholder groups to sit down and air any governance issues that troubled them. About a third of the discussion revolved around compensation. 
 ''They billed it as a listening session, but it was interactive and seemed productive,'' said Ms. Choi at TIAA-Cref, who said one of her colleagues attended. But she quickly added: ''Of course, we don't yet know if it will result in any action.''

 CORRECTION:
A table and a chart last Sunday with a report on executive pay misstated the change in total 2007 compensation of David M. Cote, chief executive of Honeywell International. It fell 2 percent; it did not rise 123 percent. (The error resulted from an incorrect treatment of his long-term incentive plan award in calculating the total change, according to Equilar Inc., the compensation research firm.)

HEADLINE: How Big Sky Went Dark

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE McNAMER. 
Deirdre McNamer is a professor of creative writing at the University of Montana and is the author of the novel ''Red Rover.''

DATELINE: Missoula, Mont. 

 BODY:
 A FEW years ago, one of my students told me a story that struck me as a quiet tragedy. Lonnie was from Butte, and his father had worked many years for the electricity company, Montana Power. The state regulated its rates, among the lowest in the country, and the Power (as everyone in Butte refers to it) had a monopoly.
 In 1997, the Montana Legislature passed a last-minute bill, strongly supported by the governor at the time, Marc Racicot, that deregulated the price of electricity and opened up the market to competition. Within six months, the company began selling off its generating assets, then announced it was getting out of the electricity business altogether to embrace the dot-com revolution under a new name, Touch America. 
 This decision was taken by the utility's chief executive, Bob Gannon, with the counsel of the investment behemoth Goldman Sachs, and without consulting the stockholders. ''The debacle,'' as Lonnie refers to it, was the result.
 Electricity prices in Montana shot through the roof, the dot-com bubble burst, Touch America tanked (but not before Mr. Gannon and three other executives set aside $5.4 million for their golden parachutes.) The stock became essentially worthless, and hundreds of former employees, Lonnie's father among them, found themselves staring at wiped-out savings and pension accounts.
 Mr. Racicot, a Montana native, went on to become a lobbyist for clients that included Enron. In 2002 and '03, he was chairman of the Republican National Committee. Then he headed George W. Bush's re-election campaign.
 Bob Gannon built himself a multimillion dollar home on lovely Flathead Lake, but he found himself shunned in Butte and eventually left the state.
 Lonnie's father went to work in Wyoming as a natural gas technician for a subsidiary of Enron. His job involved a lot of hours standing outside in sub-zero temperatures. Lonnie's mother stayed behind in Butte because the couple had hoped the arrangement was relatively temporary.
 I caught up with Lonnie last week -- he's now 32 years old and teaches at an Oregon middle school -- and he told me his parents were eventually forced to sell their Butte house. His mother moved to Wyoming four years ago, and his father, who has three years to go before he can retire, had a heart attack last fall. Since then, citing his health, Lonnie's father has sworn off involvement in the employee and stockholder lawsuits against those responsible for the Power's demise. Once a diehard Republican (not an unknown category in Butte), he has also ''lost his taste for partisan politics,'' says Lonnie.
 Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were both scheduled to attend a Democratic Party dinner yesterday in Butte that sold a capacity 4,000 tickets in a matter of minutes. The candidates were undoubtedly prepped about Butte's economic history (raucous copper-mining town in its heyday, union town, company town, Democratic stronghold), its demographics (white, blue-collar, Catholic, lots of Irish), its decline (drastic population loss, abandoned mines, Superfund site, the Power debacle), the faint sparks of economic hope (a windmill turbine plant, an influx of artists and environmental cleanup folks), its surrealness (that 90-foot statue of the Virgin Mary, looking down from a mountaintop at a denuded landscape dotted with mine mainframes and an abandoned open-pit mine the size of a small county!). 
 But when you're traveling hard and fast on the campaign trail, it's easy to miss the nuances that might have a bearing on your political fate (now that Montana's paltry delegate vote is suddenly of some significance). Butte is mostly white, yes, but in the '40s two-thirds of its population had been born in other countries and it remains an ethnic melange. An All-American football player from Butte, in the early '60s, had the improbable name of Bob O'Billovich. 
 As for Lonnie, he said he and his friends are leaning toward Mr. Obama. He thinks his mom might vote for Mrs. Clinton. And his father, the Republican? ''He tells me the other night he would only feel comfortable voting for Jesse Ventura,'' Lonnie said, laughing. ''Believe me, I heard a lot more about Ventura than I ever wanted to.''

HEADLINE: It's About Laws, Not Light Bulbs

 BODY:
The issue of climate change is now in a sad state of political and legislative suspension, awaiting an election, a new president and a new Congress.
 The first anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic decision ordering the regulation of greenhouse gases came and went last week without any action by the administration, forcing state governors and other plaintiffs in the case to return to court to compel a response. 
 In the Senate, Joseph Lieberman continued to speak hopefully of getting a veto-proof majority for a bill he is co-sponsoring with John Warner to start capping emissions across the entire economy. Yet time is running short to get such an ambitious program right, and in any case, there is no movement in the House. 
 As it has for years, America's inertia remains in sharp contrast to the work by Europe, which took an early lead in efforts to curb global warming by establishing the world's most comprehensive carbon management system. Recently, Europeans pledged to cut emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. More important, they proposed to tighten the rules for allocating pollution allowances to make emitters pay the government for these allowances instead of getting them for free. This would eliminate the windfall profits that plagued the system in the beginning while raising large sums of money to invest in new and cleaner ways of producing energy. 
 The Lieberman-Warner bill would also set ambitious targets, establish a system of tradeable allowances and require investments in new technologies. The difference is that Europe's program is in business, whereas America's best ideas are still on paper.
 Therein lies the motivation for Al Gore's latest climate change initiative. Though the next occupant of the White House will improve on President Bush -- all three major-party candidates have endorsed federal limits on greenhouse gases -- Mr. Gore is taking no chances. Last week he announced a three-year, $300 million campaign to build awareness of the dangers of climate changes and light a fire under Washington.
 Mr. Gore's ambition is not just to change individual behavior by getting people to buy energy-saving light bulbs: it is to change policy. Whether he can compete with the public's preoccupations with war and the economy is unclear, but it is certainly worth the effort.

HEADLINE: In Web World of 24/7 Stress, Writers Blog Till They Drop

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
They work long hours, often to exhaustion. Many are paid by the piece -- not garments, but blog posts. This is the digital-era sweatshop. You may know it by a different name: home.
 A growing work force of home-office laborers and entrepreneurs, armed with computers and smartphones and wired to the hilt, are toiling under great physical and emotional stress created by the around-the-clock Internet economy that demands a constant stream of news and comment. 
 Of course, the bloggers can work elsewhere, and they profess a love of the nonstop action and perhaps the chance to create a global media outlet without a major up-front investment. At the same time, some are starting to wonder if something has gone very wrong. In the last few months, two among their ranks have died suddenly.
 Two weeks ago in North Lauderdale, Fla., funeral services were held for Russell Shaw, a prolific blogger on technology subjects who died at 60 of a heart attack. In December, another tech blogger, Marc Orchant, died at 50 of a massive coronary. A third, Om Malik, 41, survived a heart attack in December. 
 Other bloggers complain of weight loss or gain, sleep disorders, exhaustion and other maladies born of the nonstop strain of producing for a news and information cycle that is as always-on as the Internet.
 To be sure, there is no official diagnosis of death by blogging, and the premature demise of two people obviously does not qualify as an epidemic. There is also no certainty that the stress of the work contributed to their deaths. But friends and family of the deceased, and fellow information workers, say those deaths have them thinking about the dangers of their work style. 
 The pressure even gets to those who work for themselves -- and are being well-compensated for it.
 ''I haven't died yet,'' said Michael Arrington, the founder and co-editor of TechCrunch, a popular technology blog. The site has brought in millions in advertising revenue, but there has been a hefty cost. Mr. Arrington says he has gained 30 pounds in the last three years, developed a severe sleeping disorder and turned his home into an office for him and four employees. ''At some point, I'll have a nervous breakdown and be admitted to the hospital, or something else will happen.''
 ''This is not sustainable,'' he said.
 It is unclear how many people blog for pay, but there are surely several thousand and maybe even tens of thousands.
 The emergence of this class of information worker has paralleled the development of the online economy. Publishing has expanded to the Internet, and advertising has followed.
 Even at established companies, the Internet has changed the nature of work, allowing people to set up virtual offices and work from anywhere at any time. That flexibility has a downside, in that workers are always a click away from the burdens of the office. For obsessive information workers, that can mean never leaving the house.
 Blogging has been lucrative for some, but those on the lower rungs of the business can earn as little as $10 a post, and in some cases are paid on a sliding bonus scale that rewards success with a demand for even more work. 
 There are growing legions of online chroniclers, reporting on and reflecting about sports, politics, business, celebrities and every other conceivable niche. Some write for fun, but thousands write for Web publishers -- as employees or as contractors -- or have started their own online media outlets with profit in mind. 
 One of the most competitive categories is blogs about technology developments and news. They are in a vicious 24-hour competition to break company news, reveal new products and expose corporate gaffes. 
 To the victor go the ego points, and, potentially, the advertising. Bloggers for such sites are often paid for each post, though some are paid based on how many people read their material. They build that audience through scoops or volume or both. 
 Some sites, like those owned by Gawker Media, give bloggers retainers and then bonuses for hitting benchmarks, like if the pages they write are viewed 100,000 times a month. Then the goal is raised, like a sales commission: write more, earn more. 
 Bloggers at some of the bigger sites say most writers earn about $30,000 a year starting out, and some can make as much as $70,000. A tireless few bloggers reach six figures, and some entrepreneurs in the field have built mini-empires on the Web that are generating hundreds of thousands of dollars a month. Others who are trying to turn blogging into a career say they can end up with just $1,000 a month. 
 Speed can be of the essence. If a blogger is beaten by a millisecond, someone else's post on the subject will bring in the audience, the links and the bigger share of the ad revenue.
 ''There's no time ever -- including when you're sleeping -- when you're not worried about missing a story,'' Mr. Arrington said.
 ''Wouldn't it be great if we said no blogger or journalist could write a story between 8 p.m. Pacific time and dawn? Then we could all take a break,'' he added. ''But that's never going to happen.''
 All that competition puts a premium on staying awake. Matt Buchanan, 22, is the right man for the job. He works for clicks for Gizmodo, a popular Gawker Media site that publishes news about gadgets. Mr. Buchanan lives in a small apartment in Brooklyn, where his bedroom doubles as his office.
 He says he sleeps about five hours a night and often does not have time to eat proper meals. But he does stay fueled -- by regularly consuming a protein supplement mixed into coffee. 
 But make no mistake: Mr. Buchanan, a recent graduate of New York University, loves his job. He said he gets paid to write (he will not say how much) while interacting with readers in a global conversation about the latest and greatest products.
 ''The fact I have a few thousand people a day reading what I write -- that's kind of cool,'' he said. And, yes, it is exhausting. Sometimes, he said, ''I just want to lie down.''
 Sometimes he does rest, inadvertently, falling asleep at the computer.
 ''If I don't hear from him, I'll think: Matt's passed out again,'' said Brian Lam, the editor of Gizmodo. ''It's happened four or five times.''
 Mr. Lam, who as a manager has a substantially larger income, works even harder. He is known to pull all-nighters at his own home office in San Francisco -- hours spent trying to keep his site organized and competitive. He said he was well equipped for the torture; he used to be a Thai-style boxer.
 ''I've got a background getting punched in the face,'' he said. ''That's why I'm good at this job.''
 Mr. Lam said he has worried his blogging staff might be burning out, and he urges them to take breaks, even vacations. But he said they face tremendous pressure -- external, internal and financial. He said the evolution of the ''pay-per-click'' economy has put the emphasis on reader traffic and financial return, not journalism. 
 In the case of Mr. Shaw, it is not clear what role stress played in his death. Ellen Green, who had been dating him for 13 months, said the pressure, though self-imposed, was severe. She said she and Mr. Shaw had been talking a lot about how he could create a healthier lifestyle, particularly after the death of his friend, Mr. Orchant. 
 ''The blogger community is looking at this and saying: 'Oh no, it happened so fast to two really vital people in the field,' '' she said. They are wondering, ''What does that have to do with me?''
 For his part, Mr. Shaw did not die at his desk. He died in a hotel in San Jose, Calif., where he had flown to cover a technology conference. He had written a last e-mail dispatch to his editor at ZDNet: ''Have come down with something. Resting now posts to resume later today or tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: Diversity in Unlikely Spot: Iranian Blogosphere Tests Government's Limits

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Troll through the Iranian blogosphere and you can find all manner of unexpectedly harsh critiques denouncing the government of the Islamic Republic, from reformists who revile it as well as conservatives who support it. 
 One conservative blogger deplored the rampant inflation undermining the middle class, saying it forced girls into prostitution to support their families. Others identified themselves as fans of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, yet they condemned government corruption and what they called arbitrary arrests. A fourth declared that government statistics were a lot of nonsense. 
 What gets filtered out is not entirely predictable either. Even some religious topics are deemed unacceptable. The government blocked the site of a blogger advocating the Shiite Muslim custom of temporary marriage, which is legal and considered a way for the young to relieve their sexual frustration without breaking religious laws.
 Over all, a new study by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School shows that Iran's blogosphere mirrors the erratic, fickle and often startling qualities of life in the Islamic republic itself. The rules of what is permissible fluctuate with maddening imprecision, so people test the limits. 
 Like women who inch their head scarves back to see how much hair they can show or people who flout the ban on alcohol by drinking at home, bloggers seem to be testing just how far they can push. And, like Iran's other rule breakers, some pay a price. 
 In 2004, according to Human Rights Watch, 21 bloggers or people who worked at Internet news sites critical of the government were arrested, and some of them were tortured. Periodic arrests since then have ended with jail terms. 
 The study, conducted over the last year by the Berkman Center, was financed by the State Department and is part of a larger and longer project on the impact new communications media are having on democracy and democratization in several countries. The research being released Sunday documents what types of blogs are being posted in Iran. 
 Researchers used computer software to analyze more than 6,000 blogs by subject matter to get a general sense of what issues Iranians were discussing; then the team, which included Persian-speaking students, read more than 500 of the postings. 
 To build a fuller picture of the Iranian blogosphere, the researchers also used the results of a parallel study that documents what blogs were being blocked by the authorities in 60 countries, including Iran. That study is also being done at the Berkman Center in collaboration with universities in Canada and Britain.
 The researchers' general conclusion was that, ''despite periodic persecution,'' many Iranians are able to use blogs to express ''viewpoints challenging the ruling ideology of the Islamic Republic.'' 
 The study found, for instance, that fewer than a quarter of blogs pushing for change, including those written by expatriates, were blocked. In addition, conservatives of all stripes maintain a lively debate about President Ahmadinejad. 
 ''Arguing about stuff, arguing about public affairs, is taking root in the blogosphere on the conservative side, on the reformist side, all over,'' said John Kelly, the founder of Morningside Analytics, a New York company that took part in the study and created the software that helped researchers group blogs together by subject and social networks. 
 ''We don't know if the government is not trying or not able to block as much as we thought,'' said Mr. Kelly, who wrote the study with Bruce Etling, the director of the project at Berkman. ''They may allow a certain amount of online discourse to be there because it seems to underline the legitimacy of the system.''
 Political groups bash each other with gusto from both sides of the political divide. One conservative blogger mocked reformists for pretending to care about economic matters. ''The nature of the reformists is actually extremism,'' wrote a blogger under the name Shahrahedalat or the Highway of Justice, adding that the Iranian people would not be deceived.
 Reformist supporters give back as good as they get. Even if supporting reformist politicians is nearly futile, wrote a blogger under the name Inharfha or These Talks, it is ''much better that sitting back and watching how our country is being taken back to the ruins of Medieval times.''
 Iran seems to handpick which blogs it blocks, but researchers admit that Iran's filtering policy and techniques remain opaque. 
 ''Our sense is that the government in Iran doesn't see the blogosphere as bad as a whole,'' Mr. Kelly said, noting that Iranian exiles have alleged that the government organizes and pays bloggers to put out the party line. ''What they are trying to do is to promote more young religious voices, to pile as many conservatives into the network as they can.''
 Researchers said many of the religious sites they found used the same artwork and linked to one another. During last month's parliamentary elections, for example, many religious blogs displayed a banner encouraging Iranians to vote and a picture of President Ahmadinejad.
 Blocked blogs discussed topics as varied as erotic poetry and computer coding. The blog of an Iranian woman who wrote about the joys of working in a relaxed, nonsegregated environment with men was blocked, as was that of a poet who used curse words. 
 The map of the Iranian blogosphere that the Internet and Democracy Project produced (available Sunday at cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2008/Mapping--Irans--Online--Public) resembles the night sky, with each dot representing one blog and the main constellations indicating groups of blogs that share common interests and attitudes. 
 Sprays of yellow and green represent secular/reformist blogs. More women and expatriates appear here than anywhere else. The points colored red, turquoise and orange show all the blogs on the religious/conservative pole. 
 The study found that the next largest group of bloggers, hundreds of them, concentrated on romantic poetry. So many blogging bards might be uncommon in many other countries, but in Iran it is simply a reflection of a culture that so reveres poetry, where many children grow up dreaming of becoming great poets in the way many young Americans dream of a future in sports. 
 The mapping program assigns each dot its place through factors including lists of words that it checks for and that indicate the likely focus of the blog: reformist, conservative or other. 
 For example, Masoud Dehnamaki is a conservative who helped found the Basiji, a hard-core group notorious for its bloody attacks against antigovernment demonstrators. In recent years he has become a documentary filmmaker, focusing on social problems like prostitution.
 The large dot representing his blog sits almost at the middle of the map, indicating that it is popular among both conservatives and reformists. The dot representing the Web site of former President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate leader, sits to his left, deeper into the reformist field.
 Mehrangiz Kar, an Iranian dissident in Boston who is aware of the project but not directly involved, said that over the long run the blogosphere would bring change within certain limits. 
 Bloggers are not permitted to criticize the Islamic system itself, Ms. Kar said, but they are far freer than writers for newspapers or other news media.
 ''These Web logs are very effective,'' she said. ''They create conversation. Not just about elections or democracy, but about cinema, theater, arts, literature. These fields are very important for changing that society.''

HEADLINE: They Got Game. It Just May Be the Wrong Game.

BYLINE: By DON VAN NATTA Jr.

 BODY:
Is it even possible for a grown man to bowl a 37?
 Granted, Senator Barack Obama rolled only seven frames at the Pleasant Valley Lanes in Altoona, Pa., the other night. But his ludicrously low 37 will hardly score him points with the blue-collar voters he was trying to impress. 
 It was the first time Mr. Obama had stepped into a bowling alley since the late 1970s, a fact that became obvious in the first frame. After throwing an initial gutter ball, and then knocking down just four pins with his second ball, Mr. Obama couldn't help sheepishly declaring, ''My economic plan is better than my bowling.'' 
 ''It has to be!'' a man yelled. 
 A left-hander, Mr. Obama failed to bowl a single strike; several lanes away, a man wearing a T-shirt that said ''Beer Hunter'' fell on his backside as he bowled and still managed to throw a strike.
 Like presidents and would-be presidents who have come before, Mr. Obama had sought to assure voters he was just like them by attempting to play a game. Beginning with William Howard Taft, who was a comically bad golfer, and continuing through George W. Bush, who bruised his face after falling off his mountain bike, presidents and candidates have risked all self-respect in the relentless pursuit of sport. Along the way, they usually reveal something about their character.
 Lyndon B. Johnson tried golf, reluctantly, after an aide persuaded him that he could use the links as a place to buttonhole recalcitrant senators. L.B.J. said, ''One lesson you'd better learn if you want to be in politics is that you never get out on a golf course and beat the president.'' Heeding that advice was nearly impossible, however, because L.B.J. routinely blasted 300 shots per round.
 Jimmy Carter went fishing one evening in 1979. The Associated Press told it this way: ''A 'killer rabbit' attacked President Carter on a recent trip to Plains, Ga., penetrating Secret Service security and forcing the chief executive to beat back the beast with a canoe paddle. The rabbit, which the president later guessed was fleeing in panic from some predator, actually swam toward a canoe from which Carter was fishing in a pond. It was hissing menacingly, its teeth flashing and nostrils flared, and making straight for the president.''
 Mr. Carter escaped uninjured, but the same could not be said for his reputation. Two months after surviving the killer rabbit, the president made what came to be known as his ''malaise speech,'' in which he spoke about Americans' ''crisis of confidence.'' A connection between those two events was never proved.
 During his first term, Bill Clinton consulted a poll to decide on a vacation spot acceptable to voters. Mr. Clinton preferred to go on a golf getaway, but the survey found that voters preferred their president to hike in the mountains. So, dutifully but grimly, he trekked to Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park, where he spent a full day going through the tent-pitching and trail-hiking motions. He was not a natural.
 The 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John Kerry, was photographed, infamously, windsurfing. Although Kerry the Windsurfer was fodder for comedians who said his weekend pursuit smacked of elitism, he's pretty good.
 Like Mr. Kerry, Mr. Obama is a fine athlete; he's a devoted treadmill runner and a talented basketball player (who defeated a Sports Illustrated writer in two pick-up games in Iowa in December). That low bowling score was perhaps less damaging to his sports credibility in games-mad Pennsylvania than the fact that he bowled in a necktie.
 The uptight image evoked memories of Richard Nixon's late-night, all-alone bowling sessions in the White House basement. Nixon, who also wore a tie on the lanes, was as awkward bowling, fishing and golfing as he was working a rope line. When Nixon was president, this joke made the rounds in Washington:
 ''I shot a 128 today,'' Nixon announces.
 ''Your golf game is getting better,'' Henry Kissinger tells him.
 ''I was bowling, Henry.'' 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: WATCH THAT LINE: Richard Nixon was not very good at sports, but he was an avid bowler. He would sometimes steal away at night to play alone in the basement of the Executive Office Building. But score this delivery an ''F.'' His left foot crossed the foul line. (PHOTOGRAPH BY DARRYL HEIKES/BETTMAN - CORBIS)
LIFE'S NOT FAIR: Dwight D. Eisenhower was obsessed with golf, devoting countless hours to thinking about the game. Lyndon B. Johnson was completely indifferent to it. When the two played in Palm Springs in 1968, Eisenhower won every hole but the last, the only hole, to Ike's chagrin, that was played in front of the press. (PHOTOGRAPH BY BETTMANN/CORBIS)
NO JOKE: Warren G. Harding, top, sometimes acted more like a frat boy than a president, but he was serious about golf. He placed a wager on every swing, and despite Prohibition, he sipped cocktails as he played. After his on-course drinking caused an uproar, he switched to a private club where black-jacketed butlers served Scotch-and-sodas from silver trays. (PHOTOGRAPH BY CORBIS)
 HITTING THE WALL: Jimmy Carter, above, was a runner, so let's just say it wasn't his day. Wobbling, moaning and pale, Mr. Carter dropped out of this 10K race at the four-mile mark. ''I pressed myself too much,'' he said later. ''But they had to drag me off.'' (ASSOCIATED PRESS)

HEADLINE: Change Makes A Call on Levittown

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SOKOLOVE. 
Michael Sokolove, a contributing writer for the magazine, worked for years as a reporter in Philadelphia. His latest book, ''Warrior Girls: Protecting Our Daughters Against the Injury Epidemic in Women's Sports,'' will be published in June.

 BODY:
The Obama for President headquarters in Levittown, Pa., is set on a busy thoroughfare just to the east of where all the houses begin -- 17,311 of them built by the developer William Levitt between 1952 and 1957. Right next door is the Dairy Delite, which began selling soft-serve ice cream 50 years ago and is still going strong. About four miles north, along the Delaware River, is what Levittowners have always just called ''the mill'' -- the mighty Fairless Works, a U.S. Steel plant that grew up alongside the town and at its peak employed some 10,000 workers.
 Any longtime resident could lead you to the other sites where the men of Levittown found muscular, good-paying work -- Vulcanized Rubber and Plastics; Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M); Thiokol, a defense contractor; the big General Motors plant across the river in Trenton. They worked their shifts and came home to their young families and their little patches of green. Many had moved here from the cramped neighborhoods of Philadelphia's blue-collar ''river wards'' or from coal country in upstate Pennsylvania. 
 You could call the Levittown experience the American dream, but that does not get to what was best about it: its concrete, earthbound specificity. The union wage. The house you could purchase in the mid-1950s for $8,990, with a down payment of $100. The elementary schools that Levitt & Sons put right in the neighborhoods, so that no young child would have to ride a bus. The Olympic-size public pools and the Levittown Shop-a-Rama, with its department stores and soda fountains and its parking for 6,000 cars.
 Last month, as the epic struggle for the Democratic presidential nomination between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton reached Pennsylvania, I came to watch it through the prism of Levittown -- its past and present. The dream is vanishing in the same specific ways it came to life. The young men of the community no longer follow their fathers into the mill, because the work force at U.S. Steel has dwindled to fewer than 100. A Spanish-owned company now occupies part of the site, where it makes wind turbines. The old 3M plant has become something called the Bristol Commerce Center, and most of the other manufacturers are long gone. The town's main intersection, Five Points, is dotted with check-cashing agencies and pawnshops. The original Shop-a-Rama was leveled.
 I was focused primarily on Levittown's response to Obama. Here, after all, was a place that needed a big change, a new dream, which for many voters Obama -- with his mixed race, international background, inspiring life story and his soaring rhetoric -- represents. But Levittown, while largely Democratic, is composed of many white, working-class ''Reagan Democrats,'' exactly the part of the electorate that has been least receptive to him -- even before the controversy over the incendiary remarks by Obama's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright.
 And on matters of race Levittown has a particularly shameful history. It was billed as ''the most perfectly planned community in America,'' and part of the plan was for it to be whites-only: 5,500 acres, stretching across three Pennsylvania townships and one borough, closed off to blacks. The first development of mass-produced homes by Levitt & Sons, Levittown, N.Y., on Long Island, which dates from 1947, had the same exclusionary policies. William Levitt weakly insisted that he would love to sell houses to black families but had ''come to know that if we sell one house to a Negro family, then 90 to 95 percent of our white customers will not buy into the community. That is their attitude, not ours.''
 In 1957, when a black family, the Myers, finally did move into Levittown, Pa., after buying from an original owner, their home was besieged for several nights by a mob that numbered in the hundreds. Rocks were hurled through the windows. In seeking a court order to stop the harassment, Daisy Myers referred to ''annoying practices,'' which included parades of cars rolling by her home as the occupants sang ''Old Black Joe'' and ''Dixie.''
 That was a half-century ago. Still, by the numbers, Levittown is not much changed. According to the last U.S. Census, just 2 percent of its 54,000 residents are African-American; about an equal percentage are Hispanic. The town's white population includes many second- and even third-generation residents. Could Obama connect here? When his impassioned volunteers came around, would people open their screen doors and talk to them? And if Levittown seemed to prefer Hillary Clinton, did that make it a place that remained wary of blacks -- or one that, for whatever economic or cultural reasons, was just not attuned to his message?
 At 6 p.m. on a weekday evening in mid-March, about 15 people crowded into a small conference room at Obama's Levittown headquarters. A half-dozen more spilled over into an adjoining area, where they stood near a whiteboard on which someone had written the oft-quoted -- and oft-mocked -- line from one of Obama's speeches: ''We are the ones we have been waiting for.'' Meetings of Obama volunteers begin with what his professional field organizers call ''relationship building.'' Everyone talks about what brought them together and what they have in common, which, of course, is Obama.
 The first to testify, as if in church, was Jack Field, a soft-spoken 78-year-old retiree who said that he had been a Republican for nearly 60 years but had changed his registration so he could vote in Pennsylvania's Democratic presidential primary on April 22. ''I read both of Obama's books,'' he said. ''I thought to myself, Here's a guy I can believe in.''
 Next was John Annunziata, a former politician who had once been council president in Bristol Township, one of Levittown's four municipalities. ''I got disillusioned with the process and dropped out,'' he said. ''This is something special. I saw his Jefferson-Jackson Day speech, and it just blew me away.'' Then came Rose Abondio, a native of Sudan who works in banking. ''I am very far out of my comfort zone,'' she said in a gentle lilt, referring to her new political activism. ''But all I've been doing is watching CNN and MSNBC. I'm addicted to cable news.''
 One of the last to contribute was Rich Cucarese, a 41-year-old second-generation Levittowner who described himself as one of the last employees of U.S. Steel at Fairless Works. ''There's about 75 of us left,'' he said. ''It's nice to hear a candidate talk about the blue-collar worker. We're the ones who built this country up.''
 This was Obama's ''Team No. 7.5'' in Bucks County. Its members had come together through his campaign Web site. They were a mix of volunteers from Levittown and nearby towns, split about evenly among blacks and whites (with one Hispanic man and one Asian man). Most of them were in their 30s, 40s and 50s.
 Their mission, at this meeting, was to organize a drive to identify Obama supporters among voters registered as independents and persuade them to change their registrations so they could vote in Pennsylvania's ''closed'' Democratic primary. This is painstaking, low-yield work, but the Obama campaign's strategy everywhere has been to try to expand the universe beyond traditional voters.
 Rachel Levine, a recent college graduate and paid field organizer who had earlier worked for Obama in South Carolina and other primary states, stood in a corner of the room but said very little. In each new state, the campaign tries to build leadership from the ranks of volunteers, and it considers taking over from them to be ''disempowering.'' Whenever Levine joined the conversation, she did so skillfully and almost apologetically, at one point saying, ''Rachel Levine from Bethesda, Md., is not going to be able to convince the people here to vote for Barack Obama.''
 Ersula Cosby became the co-leader of Team No. 7.5 because she seemed to have energy and a talent for organizing. She had worked as a technical writer while attending Temple University's law school at night and was living in a newer condominium complex in Levittown. The only time that Cosby, a black woman raised in Pittsburgh, betrayed an awareness of the tough terrain they were stepping into was when she mentioned where she hoped to open a law practice. ''People have advised me I definitely need to get north of Route 1,'' she told me, meaning out of Levittown and toward the middle part of Bucks County, which is perceived as being more socially tolerant.
 Annunziata, the former council president, was probably the most politically astute of the volunteers. ''It's silly to ignore it or pretend Obama's race isn't a factor, especially for some of the older people,'' he said. Annunziata lives in Levittown with his 78-year-old father, Carmine, but said he had not yet been able to make him an Obama voter. ''I have to realize that this is a big change for him,'' he said. ''So far, the best I've been able to do is move him from Hillary to undecided.''
 Annunziata had been a motel manager but is not currently working. He thought Obama needed to ''touch people in the wallet'' in Levittown, but he was not primarily attracted by detailed campaign proposals. At times, he sounded almost mesmerized. The very challenge that Obama faced in Levittown and similar places -- winning the hearts and votes of people who may never have dreamed they would vote for a black man for president -- is part of what entices Annunziata. ''When he won Iowa, it touched my soul,'' he said. ''I was very emotional. I felt like we were moving toward what this country should be.''
 A few days after this meeting, Cosby and her team were joined by a large number of out-of-towners that included college students from Princeton and Philadelphia, as well as Peggy Kerry, the sister of Senator John Kerry, and her husband, George Kaler. Sophia Danenberg drove down from Connecticut with her husband, Dave, and her background seemed particularly apt for the difficult job of conquering Levittown for Obama: she was the first African-American to climb to the top of Mount Everest.
 My parents moved to Levittown in 1955 from their one-bedroom Philadelphia apartment, even though my father's first impression of the new suburb was distinctly negative. A young lawyer and World War II veteran, he had traveled there from the city to represent a home buyer, and the freshly built town reminded him of a huge Army camp. Houses sprawled in every direction over bare terrain, with newly strung electrical wires crisscrossing overhead. The baby trees planted by William Levitt's workers were not yet much taller than the Fords, Chevys and Studebakers parked in the driveways.
 But Levittown was what my parents could afford. The purchase price of their two-story, three-bedroom house, which Levitt called a ''Jubilee,'' was $11,250. They borrowed their $100 down payment from my mother's father, a grocer, and paid a mortgage of $65 a month.
 I was born the following year, the second of three children, and spent my entire childhood in that house. Nearly everything about Levittown seemed normal to me. Even the name of our street, Vulcan Road, seemed normal enough. (All Levittown streets started with the first letter of the name of their section. We lived in Violetwood, which probably presented a challenge, especially since there was also a section called Vermillion Hills.)
 A newspaper account from the era described typical Levittown home buyers as ''young persons of moderate financial circumstances who had small children and might expect others.'' They not only expected them but also produced them. In the early years, close to 30 percent of Levittown's population was under 5 years old. On summer nights, we played hide-and-seek in backyards and kick-the-can in the street. When the trees matured, we found that they produced pears, a fruit too exotic to appeal to most of the families (a rare miscalculation on Levitt's part), so we had great fun throwing them at one another.
 Like every boy I knew in Levittown, I learned how to do manual labor and to value work, and workers, of all kinds. During my high-school summers, I cut grass in parks and on the medians of highways, unloaded trucks and walked beside road-paving equipment with a rake to smooth the hot asphalt along the curbs. During a long strike by the schoolteachers, I found a job in one of the area's small steel plants. Even for kids, there was good money to be made. My best friend took a year off from college to mix big vats of chemicals at the 3M plant, where an old-timer told him, ''Remember, don't take all your money and buy a boat with it; buy property.'' When times were good at the steel mill and overtime was plentiful, it seemed as if half of Levittown had Winnebagos or other gargantuan recreational vehicles parked in their driveways. Land boats.
 My parents were deeply involved in local politics. They worked the polls every election, and my brother, sister and I stood alongside them, handing out literature and helping keep track of who voted and who needed to be reminded or picked up and delivered to the election site. When I turned 18, my mother instructed me on everything she believed I needed to know about voting. ''Just pull the big lever,'' she said, by which she meant the Democratic lever that automatically cast votes for the party's entire ticket.
 There were a few small black neighborhoods on the fringes of town, non-Levitt-built houses, and their children attended our schools, but not comfortably. Periodically, brawls broke out between white and black students, and I spent parts of my high-school years with police and police dogs stationed in our corridors to keep the races apart. The word ''nigger'' rolled off the tongues of many of my classmates, and sometimes I would object, which had no effect other than to give me an adolescent's fleeting sense of superiority.
 I felt of Levittown -- and apart from it. I was always among just a small handful of Jewish kids at my schools, and my father was the rare college-educated person on our side of town. (There were more Jewish families in the other end of town, which fed into a different school district.) He belonged to the N.A.A.C.P. and A.C.L.U., and he hired into his small firm the first black lawyer in Bucks County, a graduate of Yale Law School who had been turned away at numerous other firms and went on to be the county's first African-American judge. I saw my father take stands that were not always in his personal interest, and although he did not talk about it much, I knew the Bronze Star he kept in a little plastic case came to him for breaking cover and risking artillery fire to come to the aid of a wounded fellow soldier.
 My father became a judge in 1981, and soon after my parents moved away from Levittown and closer to the county courthouse. In the course of researching this article, I asked my parents for their memories of when the Myers family broke Levittown's color line. ''That case is very sensitive to me,'' said my father, who is 82. ''I think it represented a show of cowardice on my part.''
 A small group of Levittowners stood vigil in front of the Myers home in opposition to the mob and in support of the family. My father said he wanted to join them but was running for township commissioner, the equivalent of city council. ''My political friends very easily talked me out of going over to that house,'' he said. ''They said it would be a disaster for my prospects to be elected. They were probably right. But I took the easy way out and sat back.'' 
 I went along on a Saturday with a group of Obama canvassers in the Plumbridge section of Levittown. Ersula Cosby led seven others in the group, including Marjory Apollon-Shields and four of her children. Things did not start out in a promising way. ''I'm not interested!'' a man called out loudly enough to be heard through a closed door. If barking dogs could register to vote, the canvassers would have really been in business, because there seemed to be many more of them at home than actual residents -- though sometimes those residents apparently just weren't coming to the door.
 But the day picked up, and they found a warmer reception than I might have imagined. ''I like him -- how do you say his name?'' Carol Bianchini, a home health aide, said. ''I like how he presents himself. I don't think he's for the black community or the white community. I think he's for everyone. And I don't like Hillary. I don't like the way she talks to him. He looks so sad when she does that. He's my guy.''
 Bianchini said she did not need a form to switch her registration from independent; she had already done so in order to vote in the Democratic primary. She was approached while walking out to her car with her 26-year-old daughter, Melissa Lauver, who also said she was for Obama. ''I liked him the first time I saw him on television,'' she said. ''He was on 'Oprah,' I think. He just seemed honest.'' I asked her if Obama's race was a factor at all. ''Not for me or any of my friends,'' she answered. ''The older people, I don't know.''
 The lists the canvassers worked from were supposed to contain only the addresses of independent voters, but they found some Democrats as well as unregistered residents at the homes they visited. Colin Radicke, who is 23 and works in the produce section at a supermarket, signed up to vote as a Democrat, telling one volunteer, ''I want to get out of Iraq.'' As for his candidate, he said, ''I think I would go with Obama.''
 Michael Branigan came to the door with his young son, whom he is raising alone after the death of his wife. He seemed just about euphoric when told that he could change his registration right on the spot. ''Awesome -- thank you!'' he said. ''I was going to do this, but I thought it would be a pain and take too much time, so I was just going to blow it off.''
 Branigan, who is 36, works in Philadelphia as a civil rights investigator for the U.S. Department of Education, looking into complaints of discrimination. ''I didn't think this would happen in my lifetime, or at least not this soon,'' he said, referring to a black man's being a serious contender for the presidency. ''It's, like, futuristic. By the time this came, I thought I'd be flying around in a spaceship or driving in some kind of little Jetsons vehicle.''
 When the canvassers came to the door of Harry Berko, a union electrician and former employee at the steel mill, they got a more grounded response, although friendly enough. He said he was ''doing good'' and making a decent living, but he added: ''We need change. We need to end the war. We need better jobs.'' He was already a Democrat and did not reveal whom he favored. As they walked off, he called out to them, ''Good luck to yas.''
 As topsy-turvy as the Obama-Clinton race has seemed at times, the demographic alignments have been mostly static. Obama dominates among black voters, while Clinton has big margins with white women and Hispanic voters of both sexes. The one segment that has swung back and forth is white men. In some states where Obama won by double-digit margins -- Wisconsin, Maryland, Virginia -- he captured close to, or better than, 50 percent of white male voters. He did best in Wisconsin, winning 63 percent of the votes cast by white men. But they flocked back to Clinton in Ohio, where she won 58 percent of their votes and an even higher percentage among those with less education and lower incomes, according to exit polls by Edison/Mitofsky. Overall, Clinton won by 10 percentage points and nearly 230,000 votes. A headline on Yahoo News declared, ''Obama Momentum Slowed by 'Archie Bunker' Voters.''
 Levittown is whiter, older and less educated than the rest of the nation -- and Pennsylvania is made up of many Levittowns. The Democratic governor, Ed Rendell, said in February that some in his state were ''probably not ready to vote for an African-American candidate,'' a remark that many would accept as self-evident but that nonetheless earned him sharp criticism. Rendell and most of the state's Democratic establishment support Clinton, although Senator Bob Casey, a socially conservative, anti-abortion Democrat, endorsed Obama late last month just as Obama began a six-day bus tour across the state.
 Campaigns do not much like talking about what parts of the electorate they are struggling to connect with because that only highlights what's not working. If the issue involves race, they are even more reluctant. ''She did better in Ohio than we did'' is how Sean Smith, the Obama campaign's spokesman in Pennsylvania, put it to me. ''I don't think that means she is automatically assigned that part of the electorate. He's going to introduce himself to the people of Pennsylvania.''
 Neil Oxman is a political consultant in Philadelphia and may know Pennsylvania better than any political professional. He was the media consultant for Rendell in his campaigns for governor, as well as for the current mayors of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. (He consulted for Bill Richardson, the governor of New Mexico, before Richardson dropped out of the presidential race and has not stated a preference for either of the remaining Democrats.) ''Pennsylvania is like a home game for Hillary,'' Oxman told me. ''In places like Levittown, he was cutting into her demographic. The blue-collar males were available to him partly because they did not like her. But about four or five days before the Ohio and Texas primaries, she turned the election from a referendum on change to a referendum on experience, and he lost them.''
 More than 200,000 people have registered to vote as Democrats in Pennsylvania in the last five months. ''I think it's fair to say probably two-thirds of them are Obama voters,'' Oxman said. ''That changes the math by 4 to 8 percentage points. But that's not enough. He has to regain the magic he had to change the campaign back from experience to change and to connect the change message with all the financial things that blue-collar people are worried about.''
 Obama's most important ally in the Levittown area is the first-term congressman Patrick Murphy, the son of a Philadelphia cop, an Iraq war veteran and a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of self-identified Democratic moderates and conservatives. His Eighth Congressional district is among the more volatile in the nation and regularly swings back and forth between Democrats and Republicans. (Even Murphy's wife is a Republican and a swing voter. She switched parties to vote for Obama in the primary and plans to switch back. ''I pick my spots,'' Murphy told me in explaining why he did not think it was worth trying to prevail upon her to stay a Democrat. ''She voted for me, or at least she says she did.'')
 Murphy, who is 34, says he believes that Obama offers the best chance for quickly ending the American involvement in Iraq, which he fervently opposes. He told me, ''Barack Obama is going to win Levittown.'' I asked him if he really believed that. ''Yes, I do,'' he said. ''He will win it.''
 The number of adults in Levittown with college degrees was 13 percent, according to the 2000 census, roughly half of the national figure. Its median income was $52,514, a little more than $10,000 above the national level then. Some of that money came in pension payments from old union jobs, and some people worked multiple jobs. ''You've got four or five jobs in a household now,'' Carl LaVO, a longtime Levittown resident and an editor at The Bucks County Courier Times, told me. ''The jobs are retail clerks, painters, warehouse clerks, truck drivers.''
 On one of my days in Levittown, I visited with Janet Keyser, a childhood friend from the next street over who is now chairwoman of the local Democratic Party and the director of the water and sewer authority. ''There's not many $25-an-hour jobs anymore,'' she said. ''It's very, very sad in Levittown right now. It's not like it was, where the father got his son a job in the mill, and then when the son got out of high school, he came into the mill full time. We get the list of foreclosures and sheriff's sales at the authority, and every month, it's more. And these aren't bums or people on drugs. They're good people.''
 Near the end of our visit, Keyser asked me if I remembered the milk trucks that came around and dropped bottles into boxes we had in front of our houses. She rhapsodized about the schools that we could walk to, the now-closed public pools and the Woolworth's and W. T. Grant's at the old shopping center. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama is bringing back any of that. But Hillary Clinton evokes memories of eight years of better times, and she would bring back Bill -- who, here in Levittown, is not a damper on her campaign but rather a security blanket.
 In early March, Keyser's Democratic Party endorsed Hillary Clinton. ''She's got the experience of being in the White House,'' Keyser said. ''That's part of the asset. And she has Bill with her.''
 From the diner where I talked to Keyser, I drove over to Gleason's Bar, around the corner from my old house. That, too, was a sort of a reality check after spending a few days dwelling with Obama's devout enthusiasts. Eight men sat around the bar, and not one of them supported Obama.
 The cascade down the job ladder -- with one job not as good as the last -- is a particularly working-class syndrome. It is the sort of slide that makes a person less likely to take a chance and more prone to cling to the familiar. Marty Clark, whom I knew in high school, worked at the mill and then as a longshoreman and now has a nonunion job driving a truck. ''I don't know Obama that well,'' he said as he sat at the bar at midafternoon on St. Patrick's Day. ''It seems to me like he's got no experience. She'd be the way I'd go.''
 Steve Woods sat drinking a Coors Light and talking with his buddies. A Philadelphia Phillies spring-training game was on TV, and he glanced up at it every time the audio picked up the crack of the bat. I asked him if the presidential campaign interested him. ''Absolutely,'' he said. Rapid fire, he told me the issues he cared about: ''No. 1, gas prices. It's killing everybody. No. 2, immigrants. They should go back to Mexico. Three, guns. Everybody should have the right to bear arms. In fact, everyone should have a gun in this day and age.''
 I wondered if he was a Republican. ''Are you kidding?'' he said. ''I'm a Democrat all the way. I hate Republicans.''
 Woods, who is 32, said that he had been trained at the local technical high school as a land surveyor but had been working only sporadically. He had been picking up ''side jobs,'' a term I heard over and over again in Levittown. It refers to temporary labor: carpentry, landscaping, junk hauling.
 Woods was for Hillary Clinton, and if Obama was the Democratic nominee, he said he would vote for the Republican, John McCain, in November. ''Hillary all the way,'' he said. ''We need Hillary. She knows the game. Obama has no experience. He talks about change, change, change. Everybody says he's new; he's refreshing; he's charismatic. I don't think he's got a clue.''
 Obama's lofty rhetoric did not move these men, but neither did it go over their heads, exactly. They heard it, and it seemed to have the opposite of its intended effect. It bothered them. All insisted that his race had nothing to do with their coolness to him. ''The guy does a lot of talking, but I haven't heard him say anything great yet,'' said Dennis Haines, a 38-year-old self-employed electrical contractor and a Democrat who thought he would vote for Clinton in the primary but probably for McCain in November.
 The real language of Levittown is arithmetic. The hourly wage. The mortgage payment. How to make ends meet or, better yet, get ahead. Another of the men in the bar, Brian Foley, was a Teamsters truck driver. He explained to me the difficult math for a driver who owns his own rig: ''Diesel fuel is up to $4.19 a gallon. Let's say you're fully loaded at 80,000 pounds. You get four miles a gallon, five max. You tell me how that works?''
 One day I watched as Barack Obama, his dark blue suit smartly tailored, his stride confident, walked onto a factory floor at U.S. Steel's old Fairless Works, the mill, to promote his environmental and economic initiatives. ''Green jobs are the jobs of the future,'' he told workers employed by Gamesa, the Spanish-owned manufacturer of wind turbines. This was an entirely conventional political event, a town-hall-style meeting of the kind that has become a ritual in modern presidential campaigns. Except that nothing involving Obama is really conventional. That is part of his allure -- and his challenge.
 Here was a man with roots in Kenya and a childhood split between Hawaii and Indonesia saying why he should be president as he stood squarely within what was once the industrial heart of an all-white town. Obama's remarkable personal narrative, his stirring American journey, has certainly won him votes from Americans who see in him hope for a better nation. But that is an abstract political desire. Levittowners and other blue-collar voters, with their own pressing concerns -- and their ear for the specific and concrete -- are less easily romanced by an interesting life story. I remember my hometown as a place that craved the familiar. The normal. Its racism was hard-edged and overt. Like everywhere in America, it is more tolerant than it once was, but still, Obama's differences probably do not help him in Levittown. The question that remains is how much they hurt him.

HEADLINE: Some Truth About Trade

 BODY:
There's nothing like international trade to help bridge the nation's ideological divide. As Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton travel the Rust Belt, the Democratic candidates seem to be eschewing the advice of their economic advisers and turning to Karl Rove's playbook. 
 It was Mr. Rove who urged Dick Cheney in 2000 to forget the free trade spiel and promise voters in West Virginia that a Bush administration would protect American steel from cheap imports. ''If our trading partners violate our trade laws, we will respond swiftly and firmly,'' Mr. Cheney thundered. 
 Those words seem to echo in Mr. Obama's attacks against ''unfair'' trade deals -- including Nafta, Cafta and President Bill Clinton's decision to establish regular trade relations with China. Mrs. Clinton seems to draw inspiration as well, railing to the Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O. against alleged dumping of Chinese steel: ''When I'm President, China will be a trade partner not a trade master,'' she said.
 Such pandering may play on the stump, especially in Pennsylvania, where workers fear for their jobs as the country's manufacturing base shrinks. Mr. Bush won West Virginia, only the fourth Republican to do so since 1932. Still, whoever wins in November would be foolish to choose protectionism. 
 Democrats need to tell voters the truth: First, trade is good for the economy, providing cheap imports and markets for exports, spurring productivity and raising living standards. And second, while trade can drive down some wages and displace some jobs, Democrats have real ideas to help workers cope. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama should base their approach on these ideas. They would not only make sound policy, they would also provide a competitive advantage over John McCain. 
 Fortunately, presidents don't have as much power on these matters as candidates claim. When President Bush put stiff tariffs on imported steel in 2002, he infuriated European allies and then had to lift the tariffs when the World Trade Organization declared them illegal. 
 Senators Clinton and Obama know protectionism could have disastrous consequences. Do they really want a trade war with China, the United States' second-biggest trading partner? Would they want to block a global trade accord designed to help the poorest countries? 
 Strengthening rules on workers' rights in Nafta would be a good thing to do, on the merits. But it would do little to help American workers compete with cheaper Mexican labor. If a President Obama or a President Clinton were to fulfill their pledge to renegotiate the deal, he or she would quickly find that Canada and Mexico would want changes, too. Immigration reform would most likely top Mexico's list. And if push came to shove, would either candidate take the country out of Nafta when about a third of its exports go to Mexico and Canada?
 American workers need more to help them cope in a globalizing economy. The puny program to help workers displaced by trade needs to be strengthened and broadened to include other workers displaced by economic forces beyond their control, including technology.
 Workers need affordable health insurance that will not disappear when they are laid off. Unemployment insurance needs to be strengthened, perhaps to include some form of insurance to shore up the wages of displaced workers who are forced to take lesser-paying jobs. A more progressive tax policy could help redistribute some of the gains of trade accruing to those on the top of the income scale. More investment in physical and human capital -- from roads and railways to workers' lifelong education -- would enable businesses and workers to better compete. 
 Senators Clinton and Obama can offer policies that will help American workers embrace rather than fear a globalized world. American voters certainly deserve a more serious discussion about trade.

HEADLINE: Bombs Strike Foreign Complex In Yemeni City

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: SANA, Yemen 

 BODY:
A housing complex used by foreigners here in Yemen's capital came under attack late Sunday, with explosions shattering windows and prompting residents to evacuate with suitcases and boxes. 
 Nobody was wounded in the attack on the upscale Haddah neighborhood. The United States Embassy said ''three explosive rounds'' hit the compound, with two blowing up inside.
 After the blasts, Westerners were seen evacuating the compound. Some rolled suitcases and carried boxes to vehicles with diplomatic plates. Women huddled in idling cars, while children lugged backpacks.
 Yemen, the poorest country in the Arab world, is Osama bin Laden's ancestral homeland and has a persistent branch of Al Qaeda that has attacked and killed foreigners on several occasions.
 Last month, mortar shells were fired at the United States Embassy but exploded instead at a nearby girls' school, killing a security guard and wounding more than a dozen students.
 A Yemeni security official, describing himself as the head of security in the Haddah area, said that Sunday's blasts were caused by multiple ''projectiles.''
 Speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the news media, he said they caused broken windows but no injuries.
 A witness said an explosion shook the neighborhood.
 ''I heard a big blast that shook the southern suburb, but there was no fire or smoke coming out of the area,'' said Muhammad Omar, 30, who lives nearby.
 The attack came amid a backdrop of violence in Yemen's south, where security forces have been trying to quell riots by former southern Yemen army officers, political activists and unemployed men who accuse the government of unequal treatment. Two people were killed and eight others were wounded Sunday in continued clashes there.

HEADLINE: High-Tech Crime Is an Online Bubble That Hasn't Burst

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
There are no storefronts or corporate headquarters in the cybercrime industry, just savvy sellers in a murky, borderless economy who are moving merchandise by shilling credit card numbers -- ''two for the price of one.''
 ''Sell fresh CC,'' promised one who offered teaser credit card numbers. ''Visa, MasterCard, Amex. Good Prices. Many countries.'' 
 Electronic crime is maturing, according to security experts, and with its evolution, criminals are adopting conventional approaches like supermarket-style pricing and outsourcing to specialists who might act as portfolio managers or computer technicians.
 ''It's a remarkable development of a whole alternative business environment that's occurred over the last couple years,'' said Richard Archdeacon, a senior director of global services for Symantec, an Internet security company with 11 research centers around the world. ''What's been so astonishing is the speed with which it's developed.''
 In the United States alone, victims reported losses of $239 million to online fraud in 2007, with average losses running about $2,530. The complaints are recorded by a special Web-based hotline operated by the F.B.I. and the National White Collar Crime Center, a nonprofit corporation focusing on electronic crime.
 The most common frauds were fake e-mail messages and phony Web pages, and the crimes were organized from the United States, Britain, Nigeria, Canada, Romania and Italy, according to an F.B.I. report issued last month.
 Despite the increasing sophistication and elusiveness of online criminals, judges remain reluctant to order much jail time for computer crime, according to some national law enforcement officials and major companies like Microsoft.
 A case in point is Owen Thor Walker, an 18-year-old hacker from New Zealand who pleaded guilty last week to criminal charges arising from his development of a vast international network of individual computers, which he had infected with hidden software, or ''malware,'' and remotely controlled.
 In the parlance of the trade, he was a ''bot herder'' who offered his ''robot network'' for hire to a company in the Netherlands, which wanted to covertly install its advertising software.
 Walker's borderless network first surfaced in an F.B.I. investigation of a computer attack in 2006 that caused the crash of a computer server at the University of Pennsylvania. The F.B.I. singled out a Pennsylvania student in the attack who ultimately led investigators to Mr. Walker.
 Mr. Walker's sentencing is scheduled for May, but the judge on the case indicated that he would consider community detention and work release or some home detention for punishment of the teenager, who has Asperger syndrome, a mild form of autism marked by poor social skills and compulsive behavior.
 ''Most of the time, it's very difficult for a judge to understand what's going on and what the risks are,'' said Eric Loermans, chief inspector of a Dutch high-tech crime unit.
 Mr. Loermans was part of a cybercrime forum in Strasbourg last week that was convened by the Council of Europe to develop guidelines for closer international cooperation between law enforcement and Internet service providers. More than 200 people representing government agencies and private companies from Europe, Africa and the Americas participated in the conference.
 Mr. Loermans's plainclothes high-tech unit now numbers about 25 people, but the police are also developing training programs for everyone on the staff down to the officer on the beat, according to Mr. Loermans.
 ''Years ago, we saw cybercrime as a speciality,'' he said. ''Now we have added cybercrime in every form of police training, so we are raising the level of the entire Dutch police force. There's no crime anymore where there are no digital components built in.''
 David Roberts, chief executive of the Corporate IT Forum, which represents 150 companies in Britain, said his group was pressing for a single confidential channel through which corporate security chiefs could report cybercrimes.

HEADLINE: Low-Fare Airline Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Skybus Airlines, a low-fare carrier that started operations less than a year ago, filed for bankruptcy after stopping service. 
 The airline is the third to seek bankruptcy in the last two and a half weeks on rising fuel costs and a slowing economy, joining the Aloha Airgroup and ATA Airlines. Skybus started service on May 22, with some tickets as low as $10 for a four-hour flight.
 ''Our financial condition is such that our board of directors felt it had no choice but to cease operations,'' Skybus said on Saturday.
 The closely held airline, based in Columbus, Ohio, has assets of $100 million to $500 million and debt of $50 million to $100 million, according to a Chapter 11 petition filed in Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. The largest unsecured creditor is World Fuel Management of Chicago, with an $8.5 million claim, according to the filing.

HEADLINE: Insulated From Recession, But Not From Leaks

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus @nytimes.com

 BODY:
The lobby of the Jumeirah Essex House on Central Park South doesn't offer a refuge from the hustle of nearby Seventh Avenue, but a continuation of it. The hotel now contains some high-end apartments, but it's still a hotel, and the piped-in jazz burbles just above the clatter of bellmen pushing luggage and the sound of men in suits talking loudly on cellphones. Sit still for more than a few moments, and a waiter is likely to approach to ask if you'd like a drink, testing the fine line between luxury service and a hard sell.
 On the 40th floor of the same building, however, all was silence and celestial light Friday afternoon in one of the building's four penthouse condos. Outside the windows, a thick layer of cloud floated about, as if it were an amenity designed to muffle wayward sounds. From the living room, Central Park, perfectly framed but miniaturized by the distance, had the look of a carefully groomed private yard. 
 A retired publisher, dressed in three contrasting shades of flannel (gray, dark gray and darker gray), was touring the home with a real estate broker, considering a move. He already had a sprawling apartment on the East Side with more square footage on the terrace than most people in Manhattan have for indoor space, but he was interested in room and maid service, luxuries his current building couldn't offer. 
 Elsewhere in New York, certainly in places like southeast Queens and central Brooklyn, maybe even on those winding Central Park paths that looked like the tracks of a train set, people were probably asking themselves unanswerable questions that cloudy morning: How would they pay their mortgage when their adjustable interest rates ballooned? How far would the subprime market fiasco go, and would it take their jobs with it? 
 At the Essex House duplex for sale, the questions bandied about floated on a wholly separate plane, one held up by at least a decade of good investments in a roaring market. Could someone install an elevator in those hallway closets on the two floors? Might the building allow an atrium, if not a terrace, to be built just off the bedroom?
 As was widely reported last week, there seems to be no crisis of confidence in the high-end housing market of New York. In the first three months of this year, average apartment prices in Manhattan rose by 33.5 percent to $1.7 million -- and much of that increase was carried by the boom in sales of apartments at the high end. In the same period, the number of apartments that closed for more than $10 million, for example, rose by 318 percent, according to calculations based on public records and provided by Brown Harris Stevens, a luxury residential real estate firm. 
 Not that even those kinds of prices promise perfection. The front door of the Essex House duplex -- 2,800 square feet going for close to $10 million -- opened up on a stairway whose Champagne-colored carpet looked dingy. A telltale towel on a windowsill revealed a leak, and there was an excess of mirrors on part of the first-floor ceiling, with predictable results. Anyone in the market for a $10 million home would inevitably renovate anyway, but it was surprising -- no, it was heartening -- to see that even buyers with that kind of money have to endure a boring bit of patter from the broker about the repointing work being done to the exterior.
 ''Where are the sellers from?'' asked the prospective buyer, looking skeptically at a tall, husklike sculpture in the bedroom. California, the broker told him. ''That explains it,'' he said.
 The availability of new luxury housing like 15 Central Park West and the Plaza accounts for much of the high-end real estate boom -- but how to explain that in those buildings, priced at $5,000 to $6,000 a square foot, bidding wars are still not uncommon, even as the economy wobbles, from many reports, on the edge of a precipice? 
 ''Scarcity,'' said Nancy Candib, the broker showing the duplex. 
 The subprime mortgage fiasco may be complicated, but the high-end real estate market is not: There are still more people who can afford to have it all than there are apartments that actually have it all -- the views, the space, the prime location and the amenities.
 This is what makes New York sometimes feel unlivable: the notion that you can be asked to spend close to $10 million on an apartment with a leaky window, or $6 million on one with low ceilings and no views, and still have to pay $275,000 for storage, as was the case with one apartment viewed last week on the Upper East Side. You could even walk out of 15 Central Park West, as the wife of an electronics magnate did last week, feeling disappointed in the cramped kitchen of an apartment going for $15 million.
 But those absurdities are also part of New York's shiny allure. This is a city so well populated by the super wealthy, even they are forced to compromise. New York promises the attainability, in all economies, of untold affluence; it's everywhere, there for the making or taking. It advertises the possibility of wealth, as well as the consoling limitations of what it can buy, all in one real estate market. 
 The former publisher left the Essex House apartment expressing enthusiasm mostly for the possibility of that elevator. The lack of a terrace, not his stock portfolio, might be what held him back.
 As for the wife of the electronics entrepreneur, she wasn't in a hurry to decide. 
 ''I think the prices are going to start coming down in a few months,'' she said, explaining why she'd wait before making an offer. If the high-end market does soften, it probably won't be because of the buyers' financial anxiety. 
 ''I think we're heading for a period of really dark times,'' she said. 
 From her point of view, the market could only get better.

HEADLINE: Grains Gone Wild

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
These days you hear a lot about the world financial crisis. But there's another world crisis under way -- and it's hurting a lot more people. 
 I'm talking about the food crisis. Over the past few years the prices of wheat, corn, rice and other basic foodstuffs have doubled or tripled, with much of the increase taking place just in the last few months. High food prices dismay even relatively well-off Americans -- but they're truly devastating in poor countries, where food often accounts for more than half a family's spending.
 There have already been food riots around the world. Food-supplying countries, from Ukraine to Argentina, have been limiting exports in an attempt to protect domestic consumers, leading to angry protests from farmers -- and making things even worse in countries that need to import food. 
 How did this happen? The answer is a combination of long-term trends, bad luck -- and bad policy.
 Let's start with the things that aren't anyone's fault.
 First, there's the march of the meat-eating Chinese -- that is, the growing number of people in emerging economies who are, for the first time, rich enough to start eating like Westerners. Since it takes about 700 calories' worth of animal feed to produce a 100-calorie piece of beef, this change in diet increases the overall demand for grains.
 Second, there's the price of oil. Modern farming is highly energy-intensive: a lot of B.T.U.'s go into producing fertilizer, running tractors and, not least, transporting farm products to consumers. With oil persistently above $100 per barrel, energy costs have become a major factor driving up agricultural costs.
 High oil prices, by the way, also have a lot to do with the growth of China and other emerging economies. Directly and indirectly, these rising economic powers are competing with the rest of us for scarce resources, including oil and farmland, driving up prices for raw materials of all sorts.
 Third, there has been a run of bad weather in key growing areas. In particular, Australia, normally the world's second-largest wheat exporter, has been suffering from an epic drought.
 O.K., I said that these factors behind the food crisis aren't anyone's fault, but that's not quite true. The rise of China and other emerging economies is the main force driving oil prices, but the invasion of Iraq -- which proponents promised would lead to cheap oil -- has also reduced oil supplies below what they would have been otherwise.
 And bad weather, especially the Australian drought, is probably related to climate change. So politicians and governments that have stood in the way of action on greenhouse gases bear some responsibility for food shortages.
 Where the effects of bad policy are clearest, however, is in the rise of demon ethanol and other biofuels. 
 The subsidized conversion of crops into fuel was supposed to promote energy independence and help limit global warming. But this promise was, as Time magazine bluntly put it, a ''scam.'' 
 This is especially true of corn ethanol: even on optimistic estimates, producing a gallon of ethanol from corn uses most of the energy the gallon contains. But it turns out that even seemingly ''good'' biofuel policies, like Brazil's use of ethanol from sugar cane, accelerate the pace of climate change by promoting deforestation.
 And meanwhile, land used to grow biofuel feedstock is land not available to grow food, so subsidies to biofuels are a major factor in the food crisis. You might put it this way: people are starving in Africa so that American politicians can court votes in farm states.
 Oh, and in case you're wondering: all the remaining presidential contenders are terrible on this issue.
 One more thing: one reason the food crisis has gotten so severe, so fast, is that major players in the grain market grew complacent. 
 Governments and private grain dealers used to hold large inventories in normal times, just in case a bad harvest created a sudden shortage. Over the years, however, these precautionary inventories were allowed to shrink, mainly because everyone came to believe that countries suffering crop failures could always import the food they needed. 
 This left the world food balance highly vulnerable to a crisis affecting many countries at once -- in much the same way that the marketing of complex financial securities, which was supposed to diversify away risk, left world financial markets highly vulnerable to a systemwide shock.
 What should be done? The most immediate need is more aid to people in distress: the U.N.'s World Food Program put out a desperate appeal for more funds.
 We also need a pushback against biofuels, which turn out to have been a terrible mistake.
 But it's not clear how much can be done. Cheap food, like cheap oil, may be a thing of the past.

HEADLINE: The Torture Memo, and the Outrage

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re '' '03 U.S. Memo Approved Harsh Interrogations'' (front page, April 2): 
 It's high time that the authors of the Bush administration's legal recipe book for torture be brought out of the kitchen and into the courtroom. Yet despite volumes of highly credible evidence of human rights crimes, or even war crimes, a negligent Congress continues to fail miserably in its responsibility to mandate proper investigations into these cruel policies.
 The United States' moral and political standing in the world have completely eroded, and legitimate prosecutions of crimes against humanity against the United States have been compromised. Congress must finally face its own complicity in torture with concrete measures -- not shortsighted hearings -- by ordering a full, independent investigation into how torture became United States modus operandi and holding those responsible accountable. Curt Goering 
 Deputy Executive Director
 Amnesty International USA
 New York, April 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The Bush administration attributes detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere to the rogue actions of a few soldiers and a lack of clear interrogation guidelines. But the mounting evidence, particularly the declassified memo by John C. Yoo, a former Justice Department official, proves that administration officials themselves are responsible for the torture and cruel treatment of detainees in United States custody. 
 The continuing effort to exempt the president from anti-torture law, among other revelations, shows that the government's calculated policy of torture originated at the highest levels of the administration. The Justice Department's interpretation of long-held tenets of American and international law provided the executive branch with the unlimited power to treat detainees as it saw fit. 
 Longstanding legal precedents were willfully twisted to justify a systematic regime of abuse employing the expertise of military psychologists and medical personnel. These ''enhanced'' techniques inflicted severe and lasting harm on detainees -- the kind of harm explicitly criminalized by the United States War Crimes Act. 
 The use of these interrogation techniques has eroded our international standing and compromised the rule of law. The question is no longer who is responsible. The question now is whether they will be held accountable. 
 Frank Donaghue
 Chief Executive

 Cambridge, Mass., April 3, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your April 4 editorial ''There Were Orders to Follow'' brings attention to additional evidence that it could take years to unearth the full extent of the damage inflicted on our nation by this Bush administration. 
 While it will never happen, once the election is over, an independent commission should be appointed to investigate once and for all the nation's unseemly march to war, the administration's apparent disregard for civil liberties and international standards of conduct, and its support of policies that served to advance cronyism, self-dealing and economic waste on a monumental scale. 
 For future generations to be able to identify and marginalize such conduct, it needs to be identified and exposed. While security demands vigilance to thwart the enemy from without, we should not ignore the more insidious dangers posed by contemptible policies foisted on us from within. 
 Robert I. Goodman
 Rye Brook, N.Y., April 4, 2008
 To the Editor:
 I was reminded of how differently the Truman administration was advised to respond to the Soviet Union.
 In 1946 George F. Kennan was asked to explain why the Soviet Union was behaving as it was. In his famous ''long telegram,'' Kennan discussed how the Kremlin leaders justified the dictatorship and the ''cruelties'' they inflicted, along with the threat that Communist expansion posed to the West.
 The way to respond to despotism and the Communist threat, he concluded, was to ''have the courage and self-confidence to cling to our own methods and conceptions of human society. After all, the greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem of Soviet Communism, is that we shall allow ourselves to become like those with whom we are coping.''
 It is more than regrettable that John C. Yoo and others in the Bush administration failed to remember Kennan's sage advice. Kenton Clymer

PERSON: Rabbi Herbert Friedman 

HEADLINE: Rabbi Herbert Friedman, U.J.A. Leader, 89

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Rabbi Herbert A. Friedman, who as chief executive of the United Jewish Appeal raised more than $3 billion to support the fledgling state of Israel and led efforts to close the educational gap there between European Jews and those from other lands, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89. 
 His death was confirmed by Joe Berkofsky, a spokesman for United Jewish Communities, the organization into which the U.J.A. was merged in 1999.
 The United Jewish Appeal was formed in 1938, with an initial mission of rescuing and resettling European Jews after Kristallnacht. After Israel was established in 1948, the U.J.A. became the major financial link between American Jews and the Jewish state. 
 Rabbi Friedman was its chief executive from 1954 to 1971. In addition to his fund-raising, he created the organization's Solidarity Missions, which send donors to Israel to see how their contributions will be used. Similar programs have become standard in Jewish philanthropy. 
 In 1964, Rabbi Friedman began a $127 million fund-raising campaign that led to the construction of 119 high schools in Israel with the mission of improving the education of Sephardic Jews, those primarily from the Middle East, Africa and Asia, who were not performing as well as Ashkenazi Jews, those with European roots.
 ''We who hold Israel's future dear,'' Rabbi Friedman told The New York Times at the time, ''know that intensive aid to her effort to close the educational and cultural gap is as vital as security and economic growth.''
 In 1985, with Leslie H. Wexner, chairman of the Limited Corporation, a clothing retailer, Rabbi Friedman started the Wexner Heritage Program, which has trained about 1,500 Jewish community leaders in 31 cities in the United States and Canada. He was president of the foundation for 10 years. 
 Herbert Aaronson Friedman was born in New Haven on Sept. 25, 1918, a son of Israel and Rae Aaronson Friedman, immigrants from Eastern Europe. After graduating from Yale in 1938, he studied at Hebrew Union College in New York and was ordained in 1943.
 Rabbi Friedman was an Army chaplain during World War II and later was an adviser on Jewish affairs to General Lucius D. Clay, the commander of American occupation forces in Germany. David Ben-Gurion, who later became the first prime minister of Israel, recruited Rabbi Friedman into the Haganah, the paramilitary organization that became the core of Israel's army. As a member of the Haganah, Rabbi Friedman participated in the Aliya Bet, the illegal transport of European Jews to Palestine. 
 Rabbi Friedman's first marriage, to the former Elaine Schwartz, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, the former Francine Bensley; three children from his first marriage, Judith Unice, of Marlton, N.J.; Daniel, of Washington; and Joan Bentsen, of Copenhagen; two sons from his second marriage, David and Charles, both of New York; two brothers, Stanley, of Lacey, Wash., and Sam, of Boca Raton, Fla.; four grandchildren; and two great-grandsons.
 In a memoir, ''Roots of the Future''(Gefen Books, 1999), Rabbi Friedman wrote of his devotion to Israel. He called it a ''sliver of sacred space at the confluence of three continents'' where Jews ''wrote the most significant book known to the human race and spawned two globe-girdling daughter religions.''

HEADLINE: Sharpening the Soft Skills (Which Aren't Really Touchy-Feely)

BYLINE: By MARCI ALBOHER

 BODY:
When I was struggling with my discomfort about doing the self-promotion needed to successfully market my book I spoke to Peggy Klaus, a consultant who is best known as the author of the book, ''Brag!'' Ms. Klaus quickly persuaded me that self-promotion is a necessary skill and that if done properly, there is nothing unseemly about it. Self-promotion is just one example of what Ms. Klaus calls the ''soft skills'' a subject she tackles in her latest book, ''The Hard Truth About Soft Skills.''
 Ms. Klaus coaches people inside companies like JPMorgan Chase, Chevron and the National Football League on how to master these soft skills. And in her view, these are the areas where careers are made and unmade.
 I spoke with her last week about why so of us many neglect these skills and how we can stop getting in the way of our own success. Below are excerpts of that conversation. 
 Q.What exactly are soft skills and why should we be worried about them?
 A. The hard skills are the technical expertise you need to get the job done. The soft skills are really everything else -- competencies that go from self-awareness to one's attitude to managing one's career to handling critics, not taking things personally, taking risks, getting along with people and many, many more. 
 Q.Do you really think these skills are undervalued -- after all, David Allen's ''Getting Things Done,'' a book about staying organized, has been perched on top of business best-seller lists for years?
 A. I absolutely think people aren't paying attention to these things. I see it in academia. Recruiters come back and say this batch of second-year M.B.A.s are brilliant at quantitative skills, but they don't know things like how to get along, work in a team or be good communicators. And until recently, they were also undervalued in corporate America where everyone thought going to the right schools was what would make you successful. 
 Q.Why do you think these things have a reputation for being touchy-feely?
 A. When I tell people what I do, people say, ''You teach those warm and fuzzy skills.'' I say, ''What is so warm and fuzzy about how to deal with a colleague who steals credit, pitching an investor for his multimillion dollar portfolio or inspiring and motivating people after your company has laid off thousands?''
 Q.With so much talk of recession and inevitable layoffs, what are the most common issues coming up with your clients?
 A. People are very frightened and anxious. So what they do is they play the ostrich. The head goes right into the sand and they hope the whole thing will blow over. Instead, they should act like detectives -- finding out what's going on in the company, talking to the boss and the boss's boss and checking out the rumors. That's the first huge mistake. The second is not letting people know what it is that they are doing -- not, if you will, self-promoting to their boss, the boss's boss or across silos in their organization or their clients. So people don't know why they are indispensable and shouldn't be let go.
 Q.You say that procrastination is not necessarily a bad thing and that it is usually telling us something. What can our procrastination tell us?
 A. It really can pinpoint when you don't have the needed information, the resources or the help that you need. It can also mean that a certain project or a certain kind of work is no longer interesting to you and that you need to stretch yourself.
 Q.Every week produces another research study about generational divides in the workplace. What is happening inside the companies where you consult?
 A. The biggest issue is the lack of respect for one another. I find that boomers have little respect for the Y generation because they see them as being coddled by their parents, not willing to put in the time and effort, and expecting to have things given to them immediately. They also find them lacking in some very basic soft skills such as ability to communicate. Boomers claim that newer hires are inarticulate, can't spell and fail to use the social niceties of please, thank you, let alone a formal thank-you note.
 On the other hand, the Y generation thinks boomers are stuck in their ways, cannot wrap their minds around new technologies and should basically retire and get out of their way.
 Q.You do see some positives here, right?
 A. It's an incredible opportunity for generations to learn from each other. I give an example in the book of an important bond that was created when an older worker needed to get a presentation out the door and a guy in his mid-20s who he barely knew was able to Photoshop it for him in a few minutes. As a boomer myself, there is a whole new zeitgeist around culture that young people clue me into. It might be my prejudice as a boomer, but I think there is so much that younger people can learn from the older people -- political savvy, networking, how to navigate a career, how to take calculated risks and what is not worth wasting the calories worrying over?
 Q.Now it is time for my own personal bugaboo. What is your advice to those of us who have difficulty saying ''no'' and then wind up overwhelmed with the number of projects on our plate?
 A. First, I think it's important to ask yourself why you have difficulty saying no? Is it because you are truly interested in all of the things you're being asked to do? Or do you feel guilty about saying no? Or do you think it is in some way going to hurt you and your career to say no? If it's about guilt, get over it. If you really do want to say yes, then prioritize the projects that are already on your plate, figure out how much time you need to complete each project, and decide whether you can fit one more. If you fear career damage, then define how you think it will hurt you and whether the fear is legitimate or you are being paranoid. 
 Q.Is there a best way to say no, especially if it is a request from a boss or major client?
 A. The key is to express your interest and appreciate that they've asked you, making sure to leave the door open for some time in the future. Also, express that it would not be good for either of you if you took on the project. If the person asking is your boss, sit down and show a list of things you are already doing and ask for some help prioritizing where this new project fits in. 
 Q.You encourage telecommuters to come up with a visibility plan to make sure they don't fall off the radar. How does that work?
 A. Working outside the office should not mean that people in the office never see you. If there are opportunities to go to business lunches, retreats, conferences, find them. Seeing a face is just so important, especially in a down market. 
 Q.Do you have any tips for how to handle it when your mentor, your boss, the person who brought you a client or some other person crucial to your success leaves their position?
 A. This is the problem with having one person as a key cheerleader. You should have people across the company who know of your expertise and brand, and you should be building those relationships from the moment you walk in the door. Often, we think we have a mentor, but the more people you have the better.

HEADLINE: 'The Era of the White Man'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Baton Passes to Asia,'' by Roger Cohen (column, The New York Times on the Web, March 31): 
 Before anyone really thinks that ''it's the end of the era of the white man,'' let me point out a few things. 
 The rates of economic growth in China and India are high because these are modernizing countries playing a game of catch-up. When you look at G.D.P. per capita numbers, the United States is still far ahead of both countries. 
 Second, 450 million cellphones in China, a country of more than 1.3 billion people, means that only over a third of its people have a mobile handset, much lower than the ratio in most developed (typically white) countries. 
 Yes, Asia is large, and the economic gravity is shifting (back) toward Asia, but this is simply natural given, that most of humanity lives there. 
 Go to China or India and see how far the world's paradigm must shift before the era of ''white is right'' is over. The female ''natives'' virtually worship the white male expatriates in Asia, in part because of the huge income disparities and the deep prejudices of self-inferiority. 
 Moreover, open the fashion magazines in China and India and you will see white models (male and female) hawking all sorts of styles and products to the Asian market, including, and especially, skin whitener.

HEADLINE: Access to Food Stamps

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''As Jobs Vanish and Prices Rise, Food Stamp Use Nears Record'' (front page, March 31) correctly notes recent increases in food stamp enrollment in New York State, and attributes them to a downturn in the economy. 
 What the article does not mention is that changes in New York State's program, announced last year, are enhancing access to food stamps for working people. We are eliminating resource limits for low-income applicants, substituting telephone for in-person interviews, and, later this spring, launching an online application process. 
 Traditional, time-consuming application procedures can pose a significant hardship for working applicants, and we believe that these changes are contributing greatly to the recent growth in enrollment. 
 Our Working Families Food Stamp Initiative is making it easier for New York's low-income families to apply for and receive food stamp benefits, and is a harbinger of increased efforts by the state to bolster the economic security of our low-income working families. 
 David A. Hansell Albany, March 31, 2008

HEADLINE: Risk-Based Management

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Plastic Card Tricks'' (editorial, March 29) suggests that pending federal credit card legislation provides a perfect antidote to America's recent economic woes. 
 But the bills, rather than delivering the ''reasonable changes'' that your editorial espouses, would effectively demolish risk-based management -- an essential pricing tool card issuers use to base interest rates on a user's likelihood to repay.
 Risk-based management makes common sense. Just as safe drivers pay lower premiums, people with good credit habits should enjoy the best rates. 
 The legislation's proponents claim to protect consumers, but these bills would have negative consequences for virtually every American with a credit card. If companies can't precisely assess risk, interest rates will increase for everyone except the most negligent credit card users. 
 Additionally, consumers will have less access to credit -- at a time when some Americans, befallen by economic hardship, may need it most.

HEADLINE: BMW Turns to the Web for Its 1-Series

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
REMEMBER when Procter & Gamble peddled Ivory soap as ''99 and 44/100 percent pure''? A campaign for a new model from BMW, which makes extensive use of nontraditional media, is trying to promote the purported purity of 1.
 The campaign, now under way, introduces the BMW 1-Series, a compact in coupe and convertible versions. The car, starting at $28,600, is meant to appeal to a younger, somewhat less well-heeled driver than the current BMW model lineup. 
 The campaign seeks to reassure potential buyers that the new model is indeed a ''pure BMW'' despite being smaller and less expensive. The ads are the result of a collaboration between two agencies: GSD&M Idea City in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group, and Dotglu in New York, part of the Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners division of MDC Partners.
 Almost half the spending for the campaign, estimated at $15 million to $25 million, is being devoted to online media. By comparison, executives at BMW of North America say, Internet ad spending for other models ranges from 1 percent to 15 percent of the total ad budgets.
 The online elements of the 1-Series campaign include letting members of Facebook, the social-networking Web site, design virtual cars and send them to Facebook friends; buying dominant positions, known as take-overs, on the home pages of msn.com and yahoo.com; posting video clips on YouTube; and developing a microsite devoted to the 1-Series (bmwusa.com/new1).
 The campaign is indicative of efforts by mainstream marketers to alter their media mixes as consumers change their media habits. A recent survey by PQ Media projected that by 2012, advertisers will increase spending by 82 percent from 2008 in areas like search-engine marketing, online video and e-mail messages.
 The automotive category, which spends more each year on advertising than any other, is no exception. Automakers were initially slow to adapt to the realities of the new media but have begun to embrace them.
 The goal has become ''to give people a reason to engage with or participate in your advertising,'' said Patrick McKenna, manager for marketing communications at BMW of North America in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
 The introduction of the 1-Series represents ''the highest concentration of nontraditional media of any BMW launch,'' he added.
 The new media offer ''a great opportunity to get to a new audience,'' Mr. McKenna said, which he identified as ''20-somethings and 30-somethings'' who consider driving fun rather than a chore.
 To match that attitude, ''we're trying to let our hair down a bit and have some fun'' with the campaign, he added.
 That is evident in the offbeat ads being created for Facebook, which include the chance to design virtual cars.
 Other applications being developed include a ''road trip,'' allowing Facebook members to send a make-believe 1-Series on a journey from one profile to another, and a virtual toss of car keys between Facebook friends.
 ''The online generation is all about controlling the brand experience,'' said Brendan Starr, interactive media supervisor at Idea City.
 ''It's their choice if they want to draw a car,'' he added. ''We're not pushing anything down their throats.''
 Facebook members have not been shy about demonstrating their displeasure at the presence of advertisers if they perceive the paid content to be pitching rather than entertaining.
 ''That's why we try to make what we're doing simple and fun,'' said Marc Hartzman, associate creative director at Dotglu.
 ''If they can interact with the brand in an entertaining way, it's not something that would turn them off,'' he added.
 Mr. Hartzman said he was heartened by data showing that as of Friday, more than 6,000 Facebook members had already entered a BMW contest, which began on March 29, by submitting car designs.
 There are some unconventional approaches for the traditional media, too. Three magazines -- City, Dwell and Paste -- are printing pure-white covers that are glued over the actual front covers of the issues; there are ads for the 1-Series on the other sides of the extra covers. 
 And magazines like City and AutoWeek are running tiny ads for the 1-Series with numerical themes at the bottom of editorial pages, which double as page-number identifications.
 For example, there is an itsy-bitsy white car on page 26 of the April issue of the magazine City next to this sentence: ''26: number of bones in right foot you'll use to crush the gas pedal on the all-new BMW 1-Series.''
 At the bottom of page 60, there is a miniature red car and this sentence: ''60: m.p.h. you can reach in 5.1 seconds with the all-new BMW 135i coupe.''
 Publishers, ''today more than ever, have to figure out how to do different things that wake people up and make a higher impact,'' said John McDonald, editorial director and publisher at City in New York, part of Spark Media.
 BMW of North America spent $147 million to advertise in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres, compared with $134.6 million in 2006.
 The 1-Series campaign joins an autobahn's worth of new ads vying for attention as automakers struggle to connect with consumers in a weak economy.
 They include campaigns for Volkswagen of America, featuring a 1964 Beetle that speaks with a German accent, by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, part of MDC; Porsche Cars North America, focused on the Boxster and Cayman, by Cramer-Krasselt; and the new G8 from the Pontiac division of General Motors, by Leo Burnett, part of the Publicis Groupe.

HEADLINE: When Foreigners Buy the Factory: 2 Towns, Opposite Paths

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: HOLLAND, Mich. 

 BODY:
Four years ago, a low-slung factory on the fringes of town here was stagnating and shedding workers. Then Siemens, the German industrial giant, bought the plant and folded it into a global enterprise. Today, the factory is shipping wastewater treatment equipment to Asia and the Middle East and employing twice as many workers.
 ''Globalization has been good for Holland,'' said David J. Spyker, once the plant manager and now vice president of a Siemens unit with operations around the world.
 About 60 miles to the northeast, such talk provokes contemptuous snickers. Two years have passed since a Swedish multinational shut down what had been the largest refrigerator factory in the country, a sprawling complex along the Flat River in Greenville. 
 The company, Electrolux, sent production to Mexico, eliminating 2,700 jobs from a town of 8,000 people.
 ''Everybody talks about Electrolux around here the way the rest of the country talks about Katrina,'' said Becky Gebhart, manager of a nonprofit medical clinic that opened last November in Greenville, 30 miles northeast of Grand Rapids, that serves people with little or no health insurance.
 As foreign buyers descend upon the United States, capturing widening swaths of the industrial landscape and putting millions of Americans to work for new owners, these two cities offer sharply competing narratives for a nation still uneasy about being on the selling end of the global economy.
 And with the dollar losing much value in recent years, the pace is picking up again, as some of the country's most valuable assets go on the block at bargain-basement prices. 
 For many communities, like Holland, Mich., the consequences include new jobs at decent pay, fresh capital to finance expansion and links to markets around the globe. 
 Yet many others, like Greenville, are suffering from being branded redundant by huge enterprises with factories around the world.
 To travel Michigan today is to experience America's often ambivalent relationship with the global economy.
 Foreign capital is putting more American businesses in the control of major enterprises based in Europe or Asia. It is also creating jobs, some of them in emerging areas like alternative energy, where prospects for expansion may be greatest. And it is aiding the growth of American exports, a source of vigor in an economy hobbled by a collapsing housing market.
 More than 200,000 Michigan residents worked for subsidiaries of foreign companies as of 2005, according to government data.
 Yet in a state that has lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs since 2000, foreign investment has not been enough to compensate; indeed, it has sometimes exacerbated the erosion.
 Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, was bitterly disappointed by Electrolux's decision to abandon Greenville.
 She had promised to persuade the company to stay, assembling a package of more than $120 million in state and local tax credits. The city offered to build a new plant. The local union agreed to give up as much as $33 million a year in wages.
 ''They said, 'There is nothing you can do to compensate for the fact that we are able to pay $1.57 an hour in Mexico,' '' Ms. Granholm recalled during a recent interview. ''That's when I started to say, 'Nafta and Cafta have given us the shafta,' '' she added, using the acronyms for the North American and Central American free trade agreements.
 Electrolux bought the Greenville factory in 1986 from an American firm. It succeeded for many years, but two decades later, Electrolux -- like a lot of other companies -- decided it could cut labor costs by moving production to another country.
 As unemployment benefits expire, many of the city's former workers are still seeking the next job. Sales at restaurants, hardware stores and car dealerships have plummeted, prompting them to dismiss workers, adding to a downward spiral.
 Despite the bitterness, Ms. Granholm has traveled to Japan and Europe in pursuit of expanded trade and foreign capital. ''We don't want to just be victims of the global economy,'' she said. ''Pursuing international investment is one strategy to get jobs.''
 The Economic Trade-off
 Several factors have propelled the surge of foreign money reaching the United States. The dollar's weakness against the Japanese yen and European currencies makes American companies cheap for many foreigners looking to invest. The United States remains the world's largest market, and buying an American company is typically the swiftest way in. And in the wake of the mortgage crisis, American companies are finding credit scarce, making many willing to sell assets to raise cash.
 Not least, the United States is living on borrowed money, with the value of imports exceeding exports by more than $700 billion last year. Selling companies to foreigners is one step toward squaring the accounts.
 It is a business climate that creates all kinds of cross-border deals, like Ford's sale last month of Jaguar, the pride of Britain, to Tata of India.
 ''To the extent that the United States continues to have low levels of savings, well, the rest of the world, they are not going to give us that excess for free,'' said Matthew J. Slaughter, an economics professor at Dartmouth. ''We have to sell them something. There's no metaphorical free lunch for the United States.''
 Between 1998 and 2007, foreign companies paid more than $1.7 trillion for major stakes in American firms or to set up operations in the United States, according to the Commerce Department. More than five million Americans work for domestic affiliates of foreign companies. 
 In 2006, affiliates of foreign companies reinvested $65.4 billion of what they earned in the United States, according to a study by Professor Slaughter underwritten by the Organization for International Investment, a Washington lobbying firm financed by foreign companies. They paid more than $335 billion in wages and salaries, for an average annual compensation of $66,042, nearly a third higher than the average private-sector job. 
 Three years ago, Congress prevented a Chinese state-owned energy company from buying Unocal, the California oil company. The following year, a company based in the United Arab Emirates failed in a bid to run several American ports. Sovereign wealth funds -- state-controlled pools of investment from China, Russia and the Middle East -- have stoked worries that they could skew markets by pursuing national interests.
 But even as emerging players have grabbed headlines, more than two-thirds of the foreign capital buying American companies in 2006 still came from Europe. 
 Siemens is part of that wave. Since 2004, the company said, it has sunk more than $17 billion into buying American firms. That year, it paid $954 million for a company that made wastewater treatment equipment. And last year, it paid $3.6 billion for a business management software company, $2.7 billion for a maker of medical diagnostic technology and $7 billion for another medical testing company. 
 ''A lot of the innovation remains in the United States,'' said George Nolen, president and chief executive of the Siemens Corporation, the American subsidiary of Siemens AG, which is based in Munich. 
 The factory here in Holland, a town of 34,000 with shingled homes on tree-lined streets, was a part of those deals.
 Holland is home to major office furniture makers, including Herman Miller. In the late 1990s, as the technology boom filled office parks from Silicon Valley to Boston, factories here cashed in by supplying the chairs. But when the bubble burst, Holland's furniture plants laid off thousands. So did local auto parts factories. 
 The town hit bottom in 2003, when a Lifesavers candy factory shut down, shifting production to Canada to escape the high cost of American sugar -- an industry the United States protects with tariffs. 
 But Holland is salvage-minded. When the Baker Furniture factory closed, a developer turned it into loft-space apartments and offices, with original wood floors and exposed brick walls lending an air of urban chic. A French designer of auto interiors set up shop upstairs.
 Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant, is shutting down a factory in Holland but will hand over a laboratory there to Michigan State University, which plans to use it as an incubator for alternative energy businesses.
 Downtown, the newly opened CityFlats Hotel is a monument to natural light, sleek design and energy efficiency, with ''green'' certification to prove it. Furnished with recycled glass tiles and cork floors, it is the brainchild of Charles Reid, president of Charter House Innovations, whose local factory makes furniture out of recycled materials.
 Mr. Reid is planning to franchise his hotel idea into a national chain, selling the furnishings to generate jobs for his factory, where the work force has nearly tripled, to 100, over the last five years.
 ''We're a design company that happens to manufacture,'' Mr. Reid said on a recent evening, presiding over a packed dining room at his penthouse restaurant. ''I'm trying to keep our guys working.''
 The German Giant
 Into this landscape landed Siemens. 
 The previous owner of the plant had also been a foreign player: Vivendi, a French water company that reinvented itself as a media conglomerate in a strategy that yielded a jumble of ill-fitting parts. Vivendi was in the business of managing water plants, and it ordered the plant managers in Holland not to supply Vivendi's competitors with equipment, they said. 
 ''Our international business collapsed,'' said Mr. Spyker, the longtime plant overseer, who grew to loathe meetings with his French bosses. ''You were called over to get instructions, and all the orders had been made behind the scenes before you arrived. If I never have to make another trip to Paris, it's too soon.''
 Now, he would be making trips to Munich.
 Mr. Spyker worried about Siemens's reputation for bureaucracy, but he saw abundant upsides. The company had a presence in 190 countries. He could tap into this network to lift sales, particularly in fast-growing markets like China, where relationships with high-level officials are crucial.
 ''Now, we weren't just dealing with a purchasing agent who might deign to see us,'' Mr. Spyker said. ''Now, we're dealing at the ministry level.''
 Revenue has tripled, the company says. The work force has grown to 237 from 105.
 ''Before, people didn't see where their next paycheck was coming from,'' said Jeff Whipple, a manufacturing supervisor who has worked at the plant since 1995. ''Morale has definitely improved. People see the benefit of having a strong parent behind them.''
 Greg Costner, a father of two, was hired as a machine builder in February after being laid off from his two previous jobs, at a factory that makes forklifts, then at an auto parts plant.
 Mr. Costner, 46, says he now earns about a third less than he did at the auto parts factory, where he spent a dozen years. But a paycheck is a paycheck.
 ''With the world market the way it is, I don't feel secure that I'll be here until I retire,'' he said. ''I come in, I do the best job I can, and I hope for a good future.''
 When the Benefactor Leaves
 In Greenville, where Electrolux recently razed its old plant, leaving a bald patch of gravel, even that modest aspiration seems beyond the reach of many.
 For decades, the refrigerator factory gave thousands of people -- most with only a high school diploma -- a middle-class life. 
 ''We had 1,000 folks who hadn't had to shop for a job in 25 years,'' said Don Pellow, who was in charge of the bargaining committee at the old union chapter and now runs a state-financed jobs center. ''You come to work every day, you're a hard worker, but that doesn't cut it anymore.''
 Simeon Line, 54, and his wife had both worked at the plant for nearly 32 years when it closed. ''I thought I'd die there,'' he said.
 They each made just under $16 an hour. It was enough to buy a house and a snowmobile. They took annual vacations to Florida.
 Since Electrolux shut down, Mr. Line has applied for jobs at a lumberyard, as a dump truck operator and as a sales clerk at home improvement stores.
 ''It seems like the minute your toe is in the door,'' he said, ''they say, 'We're not hiring.' '' His wife is training for a job in a beauty salon. His unemployment benefits recently ran out. ''We're spending our savings,'' he said.
 On Main Street, Huck Huckleberry, owner of a restaurant that bears his name, has shrunk his staff from to 12 from 32 since Electrolux left.
 ''It's heartbreaking,'' he said during a recent lunch shift, as the AC/DC anthem ''Highway to Hell'' blared through his mostly empty dining room. 
 ''When people here were making a living, they bought houses, cars, paid for shoes,'' he said. ''On weekends, Mom and Dad would get groceries, then come in and have a steak and a beer, and life is good. They quit coming.''
 Several businesses on his block have shut down, including a sports bar and an office supply store. Two tattoo parlors have opened up.
 Greenville has gained one new industrial operation, United Solar Ovonic, a maker of solar panels. About a quarter of its 200 workers are former Electrolux people. Most are earning about $14 an hour -- less than they made at Electrolux, but in an emerging industry and with a profit-sharing plan.
 ''I consider this my window of opportunity,'' said Hope Conley, a former Electrolux worker, as she inspected freshly produced solar panels. ''Instead of making products that are going in the landfill, we're doing something for the world. I mean, the world needs refrigerators, but we need to get off that fossil fuel, too.'' 
 For Greenville's city manager, George Bosanic, the plant epitomizes the future he seeks as he courts new investment. A Swedish company may have broken Greenville's heart, but he is eager for more foreign capital.
 ''We know this is a global economy and companies are going to come and go,'' Mr. Bosanic said. ''It's a matter of taking advantage of what opportunities there are.''

HEADLINE: Executive Says No to G.O.P. on New Jersey Senate Bid

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
First, it was no. Then, it was maybe. Then, others said probably. But finally, it was never mind.
 In the latest twist in a Senate race in New Jersey that has featured an avalanche of rumors about candidates and would-be candidates, John F. Crowley, a biotechnology executive from Princeton, said on Sunday that he was sticking to his original position regarding a possible bid in the Republican primary: Thanks, but no thanks.
 ''In my heart I really wanted to find a way to do this,'' Mr. Crowley said in a telephone interview. ''But in my gut, I decided that now is not the time. We were awful close, but at the end, it became an intensely personal decision.'' 
 Mr. Crowley, who turns 41 on Monday, first said no weeks ago to a possible Senate run. But after fielding calls from Senator John McCain of Arizona and other prominent Republicans in recent days, he reconsidered. And several Republicans who had talked to Mr. Crowley lately said he was setting up the machinery to run, with supporters even contacting the media to arrange interviews.
 But by early Sunday morning, Mr. Crowley said, the word was no, again.
 The Republicans are not the only ones for whom the Senate campaign has had more than its share of drama.
 Last week, United States Representative Robert E. Andrews, a veteran Democrat from South Jersey, stunned his party's establishment by announcing a last-minute challenge to a fellow Democrat, Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, touching off a frenzied power struggle for endorsements and ballot positioning.
 For Republicans, though, Mr. Crowley had been an especially attractive candidate -- even though most conceded that they did not know where Mr. Crowley, a Navy reservist with a law degree from Notre Dame and a business degree from Harvard, stood on key issues, like the war in Iraq, the economy and abortion rights. 
 Instead, the fascination with Mr. Crowley revolved around two factors: his compelling personal story of grit and resourcefulness, and his ability to spend millions of his own dollars to run against a well-financed Democratic opponent in a general election.
 A decade ago, Mr. Crowley was an executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical company, when he learned that two of his three children had a rare muscular disorder called Pompe disease. He left Bristol-Myers, started his own biomedical company to search for a cure, then sold that company for $130 million in 2001 to a company that later developed a treatment for the disorder. 
 Mr. Crowley's story was the subject of a book by a Wall Street Journal reporter that was titled, ''The Cure: How a Father Raised $100 Million and Bucked the Medical Establishment in a Quest to Save His Children.'' A movie based on the story, produced by two people who were behind the movie ''Erin Brockovich,'' will begin filming in September, Mr. Crowley said.
 On the decision not to run, Mr. Crowley said he had made a list of 50 questions. ''No'' answers to two of those questions ultimately made his decision, he said. 
 One was whether his children Megan, 11, and Patrick, 10, who are battling Pompe disease, were stable enough in their treatment. 
 The other, he said, was whether his abrupt departure would have been difficult for his company, Amicus Therapeutics, of which he is president and chief executive.
 Mr. Crowley declined to endorse any of the three Republican candidates left to take on the eventual Democratic nominee. They include two conservatives, State Senator Joseph Pennacchio, a dentist from Morris County, and Murray Sabrin, a finance professor at Ramapo College; and a moderate, Andrew Unanue, a nightclub owner and Manhattan resident whose family runs the Goya food company. 
 There had been speculation that Mr. Unanue -- who has been criticized for refusing to leave an extended family vacation in Vail, Colo., to meet with Republican Party faithful in New Jersey -- would drop out if Mr. Crowley (who had been his classmate at Bergen Catholic High School) entered the race.
 But on Sunday night, Republicans said that Mr. Unanue was en route to the East Coast, and would file his petition to run before the 4 p.m. deadline on Monday.
 ''He will be in Trenton tomorrow,'' said Robert Ortiz, a friend of Mr. Unanue's who is the chairman of the Bergen County Republican Organization. ''Andy has every intention of filing his petitions.''

HEADLINE: A Passage to Tibet

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: UBUD, Indonesia 

 BODY:
 Remember how we had to learn about the Shia, the Sunnis, the Kurds and all the smaller agents of Iraqi fragmentation? Over the next four months, until the Beijing Olympics open, the world is going to get a crash course in China's various ethnic and religious minority groups and their resentments.
 Violent stirrings in Tibet are just the beginning. With the world as stage, the Uighur Muslims of the northwestern Xinjiang region, the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual movement, Mongols and Kazakhs and whoever else wants his moment in the sun will have a dream opportunity to rail. 
 I hope violence is contained, and the Chinese authorities show flexibility, but I'm not optimistic after a big demonstration in London on Sunday.
 If a Tibetan monk grabs the Olympic torch in San Francisco this week and immolates himself, nobody should be astonished. If the 19th anniversary on June 4 of the Tiananmen Square crackdown passes quietly, everyone should be surprised.
 Playing in the major leagues is no breeze. That's where China is after the remarkable transformation that led to the hosting of the Olympics. No talk of ''peaceful rise,'' ''harmony,'' ''multilateralism'' - self-effacing Chinese buzzwords all - can hide that a global power must make tough calls, decide what it represents, and be judged.
 China can no longer pretend to be the unobtrusive power par excellence, in contrast to American intrusiveness. In Burma and beyond, that just won't wash.
 President George W. Bush has called President Hu Jintao twice since the troubles began to urge him to reach out to the Dalai Lama, stop vilifying him, establish a dialogue, and open Tibet to foreign journalists.
 But Christopher Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia, who advised the president on these calls, told me Bush's laudable pleas had fallen on deaf ears. ''I don't really expect anything good over the next few months,'' he said.
 Hu, who crushed protests in Tibet as party chief there in 1989, typifies the national consensus that China has delivered Tibetans from feudalism, ushering them toward modernity with infrastructure and investment. Tibet, in this view, should be grateful, and the region's obstinate ''splittists'' crushed.
 At the Williamsburg Conference here, an annual high-level get-together on Asian themes, I did not hear one word from Chinese delegates that deviated from the view that outside agitators have stirred up the Tibet protests, that foreign media are mendacious or malevolent, that lectures on human rights are unacceptable, and that no government can tolerate a separatist movement.
 In short, I heard the typical conspiracy theories of any one-party state unable to reach beyond the logic dictated by its own need for control.
 ''There was an order for disruption,'' said Wu Jianmin, the president of the China Foreign Affairs University. ''But it would be a terrible mistake to politicize the Olympics. Everyone will be hurt. The people of Tibet were serfs and have made huge progress.''
 I don't dispute the feudal aspects of Tibetan society. I'd be surprised if there were not seditious plans hatched outside Tibet. But the Chinese authorities need to face some greater truths.
 These include the facts that a half-century of repression has not worked; that the Dalai Lama is the most moderate Tibetan interlocutor they will find; that he has called for autonomy but not independence; and that he is a revered global figure.
 Rather than decry foreign plots, China should also recognize that the mass arrival of Han Chinese has fed legitimate Tibetan fears of cultural extinction, and that a stop-go approach to allowing foreign journalists into Tibet is ham-fisted.
 For a long time the core question about China has been whether a dictatorship with an open market economy can resist its internal contradictions. The core question now is how you federalize a diverse society under one-party control.
 Or, as Raja Mahan, an Indian political scientist, put it to me: ''In a country that does not separate party and state, how do you create the space for different peoples to express themselves?''
 Democratic India is V. S. Naipaul's land of ''a million mutinies.'' Each mutiny is a safety valve. ''But China cannot afford even one mutiny,'' Mahan noted.
 China's Communist party leadership has proved remarkably adept at adjusting to the country's explosive growth. But in crisis it is not nimble. The next few months will present a number of crises that I see, at root, as challenges to the fashionable authoritarian-capitalist model.
 Bush is right to attend the Olympic opening ceremony. Boycotting it would only accentuate old Chinese feelings of victimization. That's good for nobody. But China needs to get over the repressive reflexes of the one-party state, talk to the Dalai Lama, and understand that harmony in rigidity is impossible.
 A multi-ethnic dictatorship is of its essence brittle; it will be more so if it does not bend at its Tibetan edge.

HEADLINE: 'War Horses' Differ, but See Hope for Future Accord

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: SOCHI, Russia 

 BODY:
President Bush has met with Vladimir V. Putin of Russia more than with any foreign leader other than Tony Blair -- 28 times -- and has disagreed with few leaders more than he has with Mr. Putin.
 On Sunday, meeting for the last time as presidents, they again failed to come to agreement on perhaps the most contentious issue between them: American missile defenses in Europe.
 Yet they declared that their open and sometimes testy friendship had left a solid foundation for cooperation between their two countries on that and other international security and economic issues.
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin -- ''two old warhorses,'' as the American president put it at the NATO summit meeting in Romania on Friday -- completed a joint statement on Sunday morning that included language describing how they would in the future address the issue of missile defenses, a statement that administration officials had suggested was unlikely the day before. 
 The brief statement was part of an 11-page ''strategic framework'' that largely restated well-established positions on security and economic matters, though Mr. Bush and his aides described the provisions on missile defense as important progress. 
 ''I happen to believe it is a significant breakthrough,'' Mr. Bush said, appearing beside Mr. Putin one last time at the presidential retreat here on the Black Sea, ''simply because I've been very much involved with this issue and know how far it's come.''
 Even agreement on three paragraphs about missile defense remained uncertain until dinner on Saturday night, after Mr. Bush arrived, underscoring the diplomatic delicacy of the issue. 
 At the dinner, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, haggled over whether the statement would say ''assuaging'' Russia concerns rather than simply ''easing'' them, scribbling the words out on paper before settling on the former, a senior administration official said on the plane on the way home, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was describing diplomatic negotiations. 
 While Ms. Rice and Mr. Lavrov talked, the two presidents danced with a Russian folk troupe, prompting Mr. Putin to declare Mr. Bush ''a brilliant dancer.''
 Mr. Putin, for his part, said he welcomed an agreement to hold additional talks on proposed American missile-defense radar, and missiles in Poland and the Czech Republic. But he added, the ''devil is in the details'' and flatly restated his opposition to American plans that the administration considers a part of Mr. Bush's global legacy.
 ''This is not about language; this is not about diplomatic phrasing or wording; this is about the substance of the issue,'' Mr. Putin said. ''I would like to be very clear on this. Our fundamental attitude to the American plans has not changed.''
 With Mr. Putin stepping down from office on May 7, handing the office -- if not the reins of power -- to his protege, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the meeting on Sunday had a reflective mood, if not an elegiac one.
 Barely a year after the Russian leader compared the Bush administration's foreign policy to that of the Third Reich, the two leaders clearly strived to avoid any unpleasant public rifts in this meeting, and largely succeeded.
 Each praised the other for a respectful personal relationship that has often seemed at odds with the steady deterioration of relations between their countries since 2001, when Mr. Putin offered Russian assistance after the Sept. 11 attacks.
 ''A lot of times in politics you have people look you in the eye and tell you what's not on their mind,'' Mr. Bush said here on Sunday. ''He looks you in the eye and tells you what's on his mind. He's been very truthful, and to men, that's the only way you can find common ground.''
 Mr. Putin painted a portrait of the American president that is rarely heard or seen in Russia's state-owned news media. ''I've always appreciated his honesty and openness, his willingness to listen to his partner,'' Mr. Putin said, ''and this is precious.''
 Still, Mr. Putin noted areas in which the countries remain at odds. In addition to missile defense, he cited negotiations for further reductions in nuclear arsenals; the stalled treaty regulating conventional forces in Europe; and the continued expansion of NATO. At its summit meeting last week, NATO invited Croatia and Albania to join the alliance while leaving open the door for still more members, including the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Georgia.
 Mr. Bush spent much of his week in Ukraine, Romania and Croatia extolling the virtues of the alliance's expansion to include all democratic nations of Europe, but Mr. Putin denounced the expansion as the ''old logic'' that perceived Russia as an adversary.
 ''As Churchill said, if you can't change the subject,'' he said, ''it is a sign of radicalism.''
 In the agreement, Russia did signal that it was willing to consider cooperating with the United States and NATO on regional missile defense and even a global system, something the Russian leader called ''the best guarantee of security of all.''
 Mr. Bush dismissed a question about whether the agreement on Sunday simply passed the dispute to his successor, possibly one who would not pursue the missile defense program as aggressively as he has. ''You can cynically say it's kicking the can down the road,'' he said. ''I don't appreciate that.''
 Still there was a sense of time passing that even he noted. ''It's a moment where life just moves on,'' he said. 
 Mr. Bush also met separately with Mr. Medvedev, a far younger man elected in March as the third Russian president after a vote that few outside Russia considered fair, though the administration's criticism was subdued. 
 Mr. Bush, who famously described looking into Mr. Putin's eyes and getting a sense of his soul when they first met in 2001, described his impressions of the new leader in a less mystical way. He called him ''a smart fellow.''
 Mr. Putin will not disappear from public life. Mr. Medvedev announced that Mr. Putin would be the next prime minister, leaving foreign policy, in accordance with Russia's Constitution, to the president's office, Mr. Putin emphasized.
 Mr. Bush said he and the new president would probably meet again at the next meeting of the Group of 8 in Japan in July.
 Asked whether relations were better or worse after their roughly parallel terms in office, Mr. Putin noted that, at least, a repeat of the Cuban missile crisis was now impossible. ''We always want to have more of a good thing,'' he said, according to a transcript of the official translation, ''and we shouldn't forget that, as we say, the better is the worst enemy of the good.''

HEADLINE: Tough Guy in a Mean Business

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Since taking control of the Tribune Company in December, Sam Zell has drawn a lot of attention in journalism circles for speeches laced with profanity, political incorrectness, insults and self-deprecating humor.
 But all the twittering and tut-tutting over Mr. Zell's remarks -- and his suggestions that some reporting jobs are not needed -- masks a more serious concern. With the newspaper industry going through an unexpectedly sharp contraction, Tribune is struggling under $12.8 billion in debt, and its financial condition has deteriorated, creating what specialists say is a very real risk of credit default in the next year or so.
 That has forced the company to consider the sale of Newsday, one of its most profitable newspapers -- precisely the kind of move Mr. Zell had said he did not want to make. ''We didn't do this deal to figure out what to get rid of,'' he told the company's flagship paper, The Chicago Tribune, last year.
 Mr. Zell said from the start that he would sell the Chicago Cubs baseball team, but that deal has been delayed. Now, analysts say, Tribune probably needs to sell both the Cubs and another major asset like Newsday, and relatively soon, to remain solvent. 
 Of course, if this house is ablaze, Mr. Zell has supplied much of the kindling. Almost $8 billion of Tribune's debt came from the highly leveraged deal, which he engineered, that took the company private. That borrowing now looms as the biggest threat to the company, at least in the short run.
 ''There's very little margin of safety,'' said Mike Simonton, senior director at Fitch Ratings. ''The company needs to execute asset sales and cost cuts in order to make its debt service payments and offset the significant revenue declines.''
 Mr. Zell understands that. He had criticized the previous management for repeatedly cutting newspaper staffs, but under him, the Tribune Company has eliminated more than 400 jobs at The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, Newsday, The Baltimore Sun, The Orlando Sentinel, The Hartford Courant and other papers. 
 ''I have discussed with many of you our mutual concern about the cyclical eroding of content quality to meet budgets manufactured in the corporate office,'' he wrote in a staff memo in February. ''I promise you, in time, we will end that downward spiral.''
 Mr. Zell and the company declined to comment for this article, but they have scheduled a conference call with bankers and journalists on April 17 to discuss Tribune's finances.
 Meanwhile, he has been making business moves and rallying the troops, supplying what analysts and Tribune executives say are healthy ideas and a needed sense of urgency. He has dashed around the country to Tribune newspapers and television stations, warning that a somnolent corporate culture had better get moving.
 At a company known for its cautious pace, he has made quick decisions and given more authority to managers who felt hamstrung by the top-down style of the old regime.
 But at times, his message has been overshadowed by confrontational or provocative statements. He told reporters in Washington, D.C., that there were far too many of them, and said to employees they should be free to look at explicit Web sites while at work. He has also told journalists that they must be part of the quest for revenue, an unsettling prospect for people in a line of work who have prided themselves on remaining apart from their employers' business concerns.
 When Tribune agreed to an $8.2 billion takeover offer from Mr. Zell in April 2007, many analysts said the price was high and left little maneuvering room. 
 ''This thing looked shaky from the start,'' said Ken Doctor, lead analyst with Outsell. ''It looked worse by the time the deal closed in December, and it's gotten worse since then.''
 But Mr. Zell was not taking on much of the risk. He put up $315 million, and the company borrowed the rest. Tribune's stock is now held by an employee stock ownership plan. That makes the company tax-exempt, partially offsetting the interest payments, but as profits dwindle, so do the tax savings. Tribune reported $87 million in net income last year, down from $594 million in 2006. And the company cannot escape capital gains tax on asset sales until it has been tax-exempt for 10 years. 
 Since Mr. Zell made his bid for Tribune, things have been worse for newspapers than many predicted, with advertising revenue down almost 8 percent in 2007 and 2008 off to a poor start.
 Tribune's papers fared worse yet, losing 10.5 percent of ad revenue last year. Even so, the company's operating margins were healthy by industry standards. What sets Tribune apart is its debt burden. Its debt service bill this year is almost $1 billion, not including a $650 million balloon payment from the takeover financing that is due in December, and one for $750 million due in mid-2009.
 Last year, the company had earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of about $1.2 billion. But 2008 is expected to be more difficult, and the company's bond covenants require it to have earnings around $1.1 billion or risk being declared in default -- even if it has the cash to make its interest payments.
 Tribune's credit rating has slipped several notches below investment grade, and its bonds are trading far below their face value, signaling that the market sees a high risk of default. The company's long-term, unsecured debt can be bought for less than 50 cents on the dollar.
 Despite these problems, some of Mr. Zell's strategic moves have been praised by some industry analysts. Tribune created a subsidiary to combine and streamline back-office operations of television stations, and sold Tribune's Hollywood production studios and some related real estate for $125 million. It merged the online operations of a Miami television station, WSFL, and the Fort Lauderdale newspaper, The Sun-Sentinel.
 The company shifted a San Diego station, KSWB, from the CW network to affiliation with the more lucrative Fox network, and gave The Baltimore Sun the go-ahead to start a youth-oriented tabloid. Several stations have new general managers, and The Orlando Sentinel has an interim publisher.
 Tribune has replaced most of the company's upper management, hiring some highly regarded television executives, and also some from the radio and music industries who have no experience in television or newspapers. One of the latter, Lee Abrams, the chief innovation officer, has already gained something of a reputation with long, rambling, excited e-mail messages to the staff, loaded with references to the history of rock 'n' roll, that have left people scratching their heads.
 ''If we can morph the Soul of Dylan ... with the innovation of Apple and the eccentric-all-the-way-to-the-bank of Bill Veeck, the WORLD will be a better place,'' he wrote in one missive.
 Still, a Tribune executive who, like others interviewed, declined to speak on the record, said, ''I think that people are energized, where before they felt nobody could make any decisions, but there is still a healthy amount of skepticism and they know it's going to be very hard.''
 An equity analyst who follows the company said, ''These mostly look like smart moves, but they might only help on the margins.''
 Things have not gone according to plan for Mr. Zell on several fronts.
 Last year, he said he did not want to part with any newspapers, but he recently began fielding offers for Newsday, based in Melville, N.Y.
 He set out to sell the Cubs and their home, Wrigley Field, and Tribune executives talked of reaching a deal in 2007. But the talks have been slowed by the complex arrangements Mr. Zell is seeking, and Tribune executives now say the team might not be sold until after the baseball season ends in October.
 He wants to sell the ballpark to a state agency, the team to a private buyer, and possibly the naming rights to the field to a third buyer. And he has insisted that a stadium deal has to be in place before he negotiates for the team.
 Tribune put out word last month that it might sell Newsday, and three newspaper publishers with properties nearby signaled that they want it -- Mortimer B. Zuckerman, owner of The Daily News; Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which publishes The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal; and the Observer Media Group, which publishes The New York Observer. The Dolan family, owners of Cablevision, Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers, have also expressed interest.
 People advising potential buyers said the price for Newsday could exceed $500 million. But they also said that as with the Cubs, Mr. Zell has included an unusual twist that could delay a deal.
 To minimize Tribune's capital gains tax bill, they said, Mr. Zell wants much of the payment to be noncash and possibly deferred, most likely involving a real estate transfer.
 Selling the Cubs and Wrigley makes sense because they could fetch a high price but do not generate proportionate income. Tribune executives have talked about reaping as much as $1 billion for the team, the ballpark and the naming rights.
 Analysts say Tribune might also sell another valuable asset that is not part of the core business, its stake in the Food Network.
 But Newsday seems like the kind of property a long-term owner would want to keep if he could. It is part of the core business -- the newspaper business that Mr. Zell said he wanted to be a part of -- and has the kind of cash flow the company will need for years as it pays off its bonds.
 As Mr. Simonton of Fitch put it, ''There is absolutely a paradox there.''

HEADLINE: That Old Albany Rut

 BODY:
Once again the New York State Capitol has become a very quiet place just as lawmakers face their busiest season. Business -- in particular the state's $124 billion budget -- has moved behind closed doors. Big issues like the crucial congestion pricing plan for New York City are once again stuck under the leadership's heavy thumb. It is not a budget season to be proud of. 
 Gov. David Paterson owns a good part of the blame for this retreat into business as usual, though, to be fair, he walked into the job only two weeks before this budget was due. The new governor, who replaced Eliot Spitzer, has acknowledged his retreat, but says he was more concerned this time about stability than transparency. Going forward, Mr. Paterson will need to re-establish his credentials as a reformer before it is too late.
 The new governor apparently has been trying to send legislators signals that revenues are drying up fast. His office has become alarmed about reports from Wall Street showing its tax contributions dropping more than 75 percent compared with last year. Lawmakers seem to be missing the point as they lard this budget with their favorite items.
 Long Island Republican senators, who always demand an oversized share of the education budget, are already smiling like champions at this year's gains. After prison operators complained about the closing of mostly empty prisons and juvenile detention centers, voila, they are being kept open for another year.
 Judges are again being stiffed, their very modest pay raises held hostage by Democratic legislators who won't allow more pay for the judiciary until they get more for themselves. The judges are taking their complaint -- where else? -- to court. It is an extreme move, but the blame for such disruptions should land squarely on Democrats and their leaders in Albany.
 The budget process itself has been a throwback to Albany's worst old days. Legislators have been voting blindly on bits and pieces of the budget. So much for the budget reform lawmakers passed last year. That law requires memos attached to budget bills to explain what they are really for and how much they will cost. 
 It is not too late for Albany to wrap the budget in a little glory by passing congestion pricing, which is vital for reducing traffic and pollution and producing needed mass transit revenue. The deadline for securing more than $350 million in federal funds is about to pass. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who has been the roadblock, needs to act right away.
 For Mr. Paterson, who should veto or line-item out the excesses, his handling of this budget will set the tone and perhaps the course of his governorship. His friends suggest that if he can hold the line at $124 billion in an election year, that counts as a political miracle. At this point, he may need an economic miracle as well.

HEADLINE: Top Clinton Aide Leaving His Post Under Pressure

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Katharine Q. Seelye contributed reporting from New York, John Harwood from Washington and Adam Nagourney from Santa Monica, Calif.

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE 

 BODY:
Mark Penn, the pollster who has advised Bill and Hillary Clinton since 1996, stepped down under pressure on Sunday as the chief political strategist for Mrs. Clinton's struggling presidential campaign after his private business arrangements again clashed with her campaign positions.
 Mr. Penn, who was widely disliked by Mrs. Clinton's fiercest loyalists and had bitterly feuded with many of them, sealed his fate last week by meeting with officials from Colombia, which hired him to help secure passage of a bilateral trade treaty with the United States that Mrs. Clinton, a senator from New York, opposes.
 Mr. Penn met with the Colombians in his role as chief executive of Burson-Marsteller, a global public relations firm. He has refused to sever his ties to the company, which also represented Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender, and through a subsidiary represented Blackwater Worldwide, the military contractor blamed for numerous civilian deaths in Iraq. 
 Mr. Penn's shift -- he will continue to do some polling -- is the latest upheaval in a campaign that has seen its manager replaced, faced critical money shortages and has often lagged behind Senator Barack Obama of Illinois in a cohesive message and ground strategy. The move comes at a crucial juncture, just two weeks before the Pennsylvania primary on April 22, which Mrs. Clinton needs to win to keep hope of her nomination alive.
 Mr. Penn's work on the trade treaty with Colombia threatened to undercut Mrs. Clinton's support among the blue-collar voters who are a crucial part of her base, as well as call into question the sincerity of her populist economic message. 
 A statement from Maggie Williams, the campaign manager, and comments from aides suggested that Mr. Penn voluntarily stepped aside, but other knowledgeable aides said that Mrs. Clinton was furious when she learned of the Colombia talks and insisted on Mr. Penn's demotion. Mr. Clinton concurred in that judgment, aides said.
 The Clinton campaign declined to make Mr. Penn available for comment. On Friday he apologized to the campaign for taking on the Colombian contract.
 For months, many have wondered why Mrs. Clinton had protected the gruff, rumpled strategist. Many rivals within the campaign held Mr. Penn responsible for the flawed electoral strategy that is considered partly to blame for Mrs. Clinton's difficult political position, trailing Mr. Obama by more than a hundred delegates and facing a very narrow path to winning the Democratic nomination. 
 Mr. Penn advocated the plan to focus on a limited number of big state primaries, ignoring many smaller states and caucuses, where Mr. Obama built what appears to be an impregnable lead in pledged delegates.
 Mr. Penn also early on resisted efforts to humanize Mrs. Clinton, insisting that her personality was not a detriment and that voters would be drawn to her experience and presumed competence. He repeatedly pointed to polling data to support his position, leading to battles with other aides who later said it was the glimpses of vulnerability and humanity seen after her loss in Iowa that enabled her to rebound.
 In a terse statement Sunday evening, Ms. Williams, the campaign manager, said, ''After the events of the last few days, Mark Penn has asked to give up his role as chief strategist of the Clinton campaign.'' 
 His polling firm, Penn, Schoen and Berland Associates, will continue to provide polling and advice to the campaign, the statement said. Geoff Garin, who has been conducting polling for the campaign and will continue to provide data, and Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's longtime communications director, will coordinate the campaign's strategic message from now on, the statement added.
 Mr. Penn's departure as chief adviser could have an effect on Mrs. Clinton's message during the remaining contests. His strategy -- emphasizing Mrs. Clinton's strength and experience -- has been controversial for months. Critics have complained that his approach allowed Mr. Obama to seize the larger theme of change that has come to define the 2008 election.
 As the former first lady's initial approach failed to blunt Mr. Obama's rise, Mr. Penn increasingly favored tougher attacks; some colleagues argued internally that they would be counterproductive. 
 Mr. Garin, who advised Mrs. Clinton's winning campaign for a Senate seat in 2000 and only recently joined her presidential bid, has argued throughout the primaries that her route to victory lies less in assailing Mr. Obama than in buttressing her own image as a leader who could connect with average Americans and improve their lives.
 Mr. Penn's decision to meet last Monday with Colombia's ambassador to the United States in his role as head of Burson-Marsteller put Mrs. Clinton in a precarious political position as she tries to convince Pennsylvania voters that she is the best candidate to address their concerns about jobs and the economy. Many voters in Pennsylvania, like in Ohio, which Mrs. Clinton won, blame trade agreements for the hemorrhaging of jobs that has left areas like Scranton with high unemployment rates and a preponderance of lower paying jobs. 
 The Colombian government hired the Burson-Marsteller firm last year under a $300,000 one-year contract to help secure passage of a bilateral trade treaty with the United States. Mrs. Clinton, like many Democrats, has opposed the deal, saying it is unfavorable to American workers.
 On Saturday, the Colombian government fired Mr. Penn's firm, saying his efforts to distance himself from them were an insult. 
 There has been a long history of resentment toward Mr. Penn within the Clinton campaign because of the feeling that he was letting his business interests trump the interests of the campaign. People from the beginning have questioned why he had not recused himself from his role at Burson-Marsteller.
 Although the end of the primary season is drawing near, campaign aides said Mr. Penn's demotion would change the internal dynamics of the Clinton camp, with a more collegial atmosphere replacing the first-among-equals structure Mr. Penn created around himself.
 Mr. Penn worked his way into the Clintons' favor during President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign. He provided the polling used by Dick Morris, then an influential adviser to Mr. Clinton, to create Mr. Clinton's small-bore campaign strategy, much of it aimed at wooing so-called soccer moms with positions like support for school uniforms and for the V-chip to monitor violence on television.
 When Mr. Morris had to quit in 1996 because of his association with a call girl, Mr. Clinton's campaign went on ''seamlessly,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in her memoir, ''because Mark Penn continued to offer the thoughtful research and analysis.'' He remained for the second Clinton term and through Mr. Clinton's impeachment trial, demonstrating, among other things, one of the virtues that the Clintons prized most: loyalty.
 In 2000, Mr. Clinton's vice president, Al Gore, initially considered hiring Mr. Penn for his presidential campaign, but he decided Mr. Penn was too devoted to the Clintons to offer him objective advice. Mrs. Clinton, who described him in her memoir as brilliant and intense, shrewd and insightful, hired him for her first run at the Senate.
 Mr. Penn and his business partner, Doug Schoen, began their polling firm in 1977 when they worked for Edward I. Koch's campaign for mayor of New York. They went on to become deeply involved in campaigns for politicians in other countries, including Menachem Begin in Israel in 1981. He also advised David N. Dinkins in 1989 in his successful New York mayoral race over Rudolph W. Giuliani.
 Mr. Penn advocated that Democrats did best when they campaigned from the center, although this did not always sit well with others in the party. His clients have included the Democratic Leadership Council and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, defeated in his Democratic primary and now an independent.
 Mr. Penn described his philosophy in his book, ''Microtrends,'' published last year. Because of ''niching,'' he wrote, ''there is no one America anymore'' but ''hundreds of Americas.'' His extensive polling led him to believe that ''Americans overwhelmingly favor small, reasonable ideas over big, grandiose schemes.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton has not spoken to reporters since the news of Mr. Penn's meeting with the Colombian officials broke at the end of last week. In several public appearances this weekend, she gave no indication of anger or a pending shake-up in her campaign. But at a rally on Sunday morning in Missoula, Mont., she said the contest with Mr. Obama was still very close and predicted many ''twists and turns'' before it was resolved.

HEADLINE: Rifts in Family and Companies Hang Over Redstone's Legacy

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO

 BODY:
In mid-March, the media mogul Sumner M. Redstone was in Palm Beach, Fla., for a Wall Street firm's annual media conference when he was asked about his legacy. 
 ''I guess I'd like to be known as a loving and supportive father and grandfather,'' Mr. Redstone said.
 This was an uncharacteristically wistful note for Mr. Redstone, the chairman and controlling shareholder of Viacom and CBS, which together represent one of the world's largest media empires. 
 Despite Mr. Redstone's sentiments, his relationships with family and business associates remain complicated. Like many who have risen to preside over large business empires, Mr. Redstone, who turns 85 next month, has left a trail of tattered relationships -- with family members, executives and, in his case, one very famous movie star. 
 Nearly three years ago, Mr. Redstone announced plans to split his empire into two publicly traded companies, and it seemed for a time that he would recede into semi-retirement. However, in the late summer of 2006, in rapid succession, Mr. Redstone acrimoniously ended a longstanding relationship between Tom Cruise and Paramount, a Viacom property, and then fired Tom Freston as chief executive of Viacom.
 And for nearly a year, Mr. Redstone has been embroiled in a dispute over corporate governance with his daughter, Shari, who is nonexecutive vice chairman of both Viacom and CBS. The falling out between father and daughter has not been resolved, but Mr. Redstone has not sought to remove Shari from the boards of Viacom and CBS. In July, executives close to Mr. Redstone said he was expected to try to oust her. 
 Their sparring has been uncomfortable for Mr. Redstone's friends and executives, and he frequently, at dinners and business meetings, has used abusive language toward his daughter, said one person who has been present during such incidents. 
 Through a representative, Mr. Redstone declined to comment.
 Mr. Redstone's frayed relationship with his daughter makes the issue of who will succeed him as controlling shareholder -- a question that hovers over the future of Viacom and CBS -- much more difficult. She was once regarded as the clear successor. Last summer, Mr. Redstone settled litigation with his son, Brent, buying out his son's stake in National Amusements, the family holding company. This week, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is to hear arguments in an appeal involving Mr. Redstone's nephew Michael, who has argued he was cheated out of a share in the family business.
 Like all business titans, however, Mr. Redstone's legacy will rest less on his relationships than on the performance of his companies. Here, too, he has expressed some ambivalence about perhaps his biggest decision, breaking Viacom into two entities. 
 When asked at the Florida conference, convened by Bear Stearns, to reflect on how he split the companies two years ago, Mr. Redstone replied: ''Would I do it the same way? You know, you're never sure. I think so.''
 The jury is still out among executives and investors as to whether or not that was the right decision. Only lately are the two companies performing as they were expected to at the time of the split, when Viacom was billed as the company that would grow faster and CBS was said to be the slow-growing broadcast network that would pay steady dividends.
 For the first two years after the split, CBS's stock outperformed Viacom's, but that is no longer the case. Both stocks are down from where they were at the time of the split: the combined market capitalization was $50 billion then, and today the value of the two companies combined is $40.8 billion. (Of course, other media companies have declined in value over that time as well.)
 Initially, the post-split Viacom was disappointing when measured by the stock price, and Mr. Redstone reacted by firing Viacom's chief executive, Mr. Freston, who was popular among the staff and in the industry. Mr. Redstone said publicly at the time that Mr. Freston had been too slow to expand Viacom's businesses on the Internet. 
 Mr. Freston was pushing to bid for the social networking site MySpace but was overruled by Mr. Redstone, according to two people involved in the process who asked not to be identified because the discussions were intended to be confidential. MySpace wound up in the hands of Rupert Murdoch of the News Corporation, who bought it for $580 million. 
 Shortly after firing Mr. Freston, Mr. Redstone appeared on the PBS program ''The Charlie Rose Show'' and criticized Mr. Freston for being too late in jumping into the MySpace sweepstakes.
 ''Before Rupert got into the act,'' he said, ''MySpace was sitting there, ripe for the taking, for $500 million. Tom never took it. So the board had legitimate concerns.'' 
 Mr. Freston was barred from talking publicly about Viacom, as part of his $85 million severance package.
 Under Mr. Freston's successor, Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom has undoubtedly improved, both in its operating performance and its stock market performance. Shares are up more than 18 percent since Mr. Dauman took over in September 2006. 
 Since then, CBS shares have declined about 17 percent: its core broadcast television business is barely growing and is expected, for the first time in six years, to lose its status, and slogan, as ''America's most watched network.''
 When the current broadcast season ends in May, Fox, the News Corporation property that broadcasts the hit show ''American Idol,'' is expected to surpass CBS, becoming the highest-rated network by total viewers. 
 Inside CBS, executives point to the recent writers strike and note that Fox benefited because it broadcast more reality programming and fewer scripted dramas than the other networks.
 ''CBS is starting to bleed,'' said Marc Berman, a television programming analyst for Mediaweek. ''It's partially due to the writers strike. But a lot of their shows are aging, and they're not coming up with new hits.'' 
 Of CBS's five new scripted shows this season, only the comedy ''The Big Bang Theory'' was picked up for a full season. A CBS spokesman, however, said that one show, ''Kid Nation,'' had been intended for only one season, and another, ''Moonlight,'' may yet be picked up for another season. 
 Over the same period, the network has suffered the high-profile decline of its evening newscast after luring Katie Couric to the anchor's chair with a five-year contract estimated at $15 million a year.
 Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company who covers both Viacom and CBS, said that CBS's losing its position as the No. 1 broadcast network would matter little to investors. ''It's only a title for people who write press releases,'' he said. ''It doesn't mean much for Wall Street.''
 Mr. Nathanson, nonetheless, said the companies never should have been divided. ''I don't think the separation has created any value,'' he said. 
 Two factors have conspired to drive CBS's share price lower. Wall Street has punished companies that are heavily dependent on advertising, and CBS derives about 70 percent of its revenue from advertising -- compared with 35 percent for Viacom and even less for competitors like Time Warner and the Walt Disney Company. 
 Secondly, before the current economic crisis cut off the flow of easy credit, CBS's stock price was driven higher because of speculation that the company's management would team up with private equity firms to take CBS private -- something that was in fact considered by Mr. Redstone and CBS's chief executive, Leslie Moonves. 
 While Mr. Redstone appears focused on the workings of Viacom and CBS,he has left the family holding company, the movie theater operator National Amusements of Dedham, Mass., to the care of his daughter, Shari. While Mr. Redstone has said that it is ''likely'' Shari will succeed him at the helm of CBS and Viacom, that comment was made before the feud with his daughter. 
 Nearly six years ago, during his divorce from his wife, Phyllis, Mr. Redstone created a new trust, called the SMR Trust, which holds his shares in National Amusements. 
 ''What happens to those shares is the question we haven't been able to find an answer to,'' said William H. Narwold, a lawyer with Motley Rice in Hartford who represents Mr. Redstone's nephew. ''It's like state secrets.''
 As they did last month at the Bear Stearns conference, investors and analysts are likely to keep pressing Mr. Redstone about his legacy, which is perhaps a polite way of trying to divine some answers to the succession question. 
 Mr. Redstone would have none of it. He says he works out for 70 minutes a day and eats ''every antioxidant known to man'' to stave off aging.
 ''There's a bean called the goji bean,'' Mr. Redstone said at the conference. ''It comes from the Himalayas. They say if you eat enough of them, you will never die.''

 FINALISTS ''Nixon and Kissinger: Partners in Power'' by Robert Dallek; ''The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War'' by David Halberstam.
 DRAMA 
 Tracy Letts
 ''August: Osage County''
 Even for some of those familiar with his dark comedies about contemporary American life, Mr. Letts, 42, seemed to have come out of nowhere with ''August: Osage County,'' a knock-down, opera-size comic drama about three generations of a drug- and secret-addled family in Oklahoma. ''I had this specific story to tell,'' he said, ''and it seemed like the right vehicle for this story was the big American play.'' 
 FINALISTS ''Yellow Face'' by David Henry Hwang; ''Dying City'' by Christopher Shinn. 
 BIOGRAPHY
 JOHN MATTESON
 ''Eden's Outcasts: The Story of Louisa May Alcott and Her Father'' 
 Louisa May Alcott is widely known, but Professor Matteson, 47, an associate professor of English at John Jay College in New York City, turned his attention to her father, Bronson Alcott. He was a teacher and lecturer, a friend of both Emerson and Thoreau and the seeker of a utopian community. 
 ''I found him very inspirational,'' Professor Matteson said. ''He was almost completely self-taught.''
 FINALISTS ''The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein'' by Martin Duberman; ''The Life of Kingsley Amis'' by Zachary Leader. 
 MUSIC
 DAVID LANG
 ''The Little Match Girl Passion''
 Mr. Lang, 51, is co-founder of Bang on a Can, the boundary-crossing new music collective. His Pulitzer-winning work is for a quartet of singers.

 FINALISTS ''Meanwhile'' by Stephen Hartke; ''Concerto for Viola'' by Roberto Sierra.
 FICTION
 JUNOT DIAZ
 ''The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao''
 Mr. Diaz, 39, arrived in the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1974, not speaking or reading English. His riotous novel tells the story of a family of Dominican immigrants, both in the present in New Jersey and in the past in the Dominican Republic.
 Mr. Diaz said he kicked around the idea for his first novel for about four years and then spent seven years writing it. ''In some ways I think that this book waited for me to become a better person before it wrote itself,'' he said.

 GENERAL NONFICTION
 SAUL FRIEDLANDER
 ''The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945''

''Usually the history of the Holocaust is written from the viewpoint of German documents and archives,'' said Mr. Friedlander, who was born in Prague, escaped to France in 1939 and emigrated to Israel in 1948. He teaches history at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 FINALISTS ''The Cigarette Century'' by Allan M. Brandt; ''The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century'' by Alex Ross.
 POETRY
 ROBERT HASS

 Ms. Priest, 50, who won the 2006 Pulitzer for beat reporting, praised the courage of soldiers who spoke on the record. ''People wanted to be good soldiers and go up the chain,'' she said, ''and at some point we caught them at a frustration level that was so high that they were willing to, in their minds, risk their careers.''
 FINALISTS The Charlotte Observer; Newsday, Long Island, N.Y.

 Mr. Bogdanich, 57, winning his third Pulitzer, and Mr. Hooker, 34, were honored for ''A Toxic Pipeline,'' articles exposing toxic ingredients in cough syrups, fever medications, toothpaste and other Chinese-made products that killed 100 people in Panama more than a decade after similar hazards killed dozens of children in Haiti. The articles led to crackdowns by American and Chinese officials. ''It's a story I've wanted to do for 12 years since I found that babies were dying in Haiti,'' Mr. Bogdanich said.
 The staff of The Tribune won for 10 articles on lead-tainted toys and dangerous car seats, cribs and other products, leading to extensive recalls and federal legislation to reform government regulatory work. 
 FINALISTS Miles Moffeit and Susan Greene of The Denver Post. 
 INTERNATIONAL REPORTING
 STEVE FAINARU
 The Washington Post
 Mr. Fainaru, 46, described how the contractors from Blackwater USA and other private security forces operate outside many of the laws that govern American forces. He highlighted one of the many complexities of the United States' involvement in Iraq.

 FINALISTS Staff of The New York Times; staff of The Wall Street Journal.
 NATIONAL REPORTING
 JO BECKER
 AND BARTON GELLMAN
 The Washington Post
 Ms. Becker and Mr. Gellman were honored for their four-part series describing what the judges said was Vice President Dick Cheney's ''powerful yet sometimes disguised influence on national policy.''

 FINALISTS Staff of The New York Times; Howard Witt of the Chicago Tribune. 
 EXPLANATORY REPORTING
 AMY HARMON
 The New York Times
 The Pulitzer jury saluted Ms. Harmon, 39, for her ''striking examination of the dilemmas'' and moral issues created by genetic testing.

She shared a 2001 Pulitzer for national reporting.
 FINALISTS Beth Daley of The Boston Globe; staff of The Oregonian, Portland.
 LOCAL REPORTING
 DAVE UMHOEFER
 The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
 Mr. Umhoefer, 47, had long had his eye on a project about how county employees were padding their pensions.

By the end of his reporting, county officials had admitted widespread violations and had turned in a filing to the Internal Revenue Service.
 FINALISTS Chris Davis, Matthew Doig and Tiffany Lankes of The Herald Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.; Jeff Pillets, John Brennan and Tim Nostrand of The Record, Bergen County, N.J.
 BREAKING NEWS REPORTING
 THE WASHINGTON POST

 They plan to donate the $10,000 prize to a commemorative fund at Virginia Tech.
 FINALISTS Staff of The Idaho Statesman; staff of The New York Times.
 FEATURE WRITING
 GENE WEINGARTEN
 The Washington Post
 Mr. Weingarten's feature for The Washington Post Magazine about a world-famous fiddler's anonymous performance was, the writer acknowledged, a stunt.
 He asked the Grammy Award-winning violinist Joshua Bell to perform inside a subway station at rush hour, and Mr. Bell obliged, enabling an essay about art, context, perception and ''the moral mathematics of the moment.'' 
 In exquisite detail, Mr. Weingarten, 56, recounted Mr. Bell's 45-minute presentation, counting each commuter who rushed by (1,070) and the total donations (a meager $32.17). 
 FINALISTS Thomas Curwen, The Los Angeles Times; Kevin Vaughan, The Rocky Mountain News.
 CRITICISM
 MARK FEENEY
 The Boston Globe
 Mr. Feeney, who has held almost every job possible in The Boston Globe's culture departments -- he started in 1979 as a researcher in the newspaper's library -- won for what the judges called his ''penetrating and versatile command of the visual arts, from film and photography to painting.''
 Mr. Feeney, 50, was a Pulitzer finalist for feature writing in 1994 and is the author of ''Nixon at the Movies,'' a 2004 book that examines the life of the 37th president through the lens of the movies and vice versa.
 FINALISTS Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post; Inga Saffron of The Philadelphia Inquirer.
 COMMENTARY
 STEVEN PEARLSTEIN
 The Washington Post
 Mr. Pearlstein, 56, a business columnist, won for a series of columns on the troubled United States economy. The Pulitzer judges praised Mr. Pearlstein's writing for its ''masterful clarity.''

HEADLINE: Corporate Croesus

 BODY:
As accustomed as we are to the other-worldly rewards lavished on captains of finance and industry, it is still galling that the chiefs managed to finagle a raise last year as many of the companies they led were in trouble. 
 A study published on Sunday by The Times of many of the biggest companies found that chief executives who had held their jobs for at least two years got an average pay increase of 5 percent last year, despite poor results at many of their companies.
 Net income at Office Depot fell 23 percent last year compared with 2006; its share price fell 64 percent. Steve Odland, its chief, made nearly $18 million all told -- some 85 percent more than in 2006. With the share price of Toll Brothers, the luxury home builder, plummeting, it seems reasonable that Robert Toll, its chief, got no bonus. Still, the company took steps to ensure that he gets one this year, even if home-building doesn't recover.
 It's hard to square the conceit that chief executives are rewarded for improving companies' performance with the fact that chiefs at 10 financial-services firms in the study made $320 million last year, even as their banks reported mortgage-related losses of $55 billion.
 Meanwhile, the average earnings of typical workers have failed to keep up with inflation in four of the past five years. According to the economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics, average incomes in the highest-earning 1 percent of the United States grew 11 percent year-over-year between 2002 and 2006. Incomes in the bottom 99 percent grew by 0.9 percent annually over the period. This year looks bad, too.
 This polarization is producing a pattern of income distribution rarely seen outside Africa or Latin America, and unheard of in the United States, at least since the gilded age. In 2006, the 15,000 families in the top 0.01 percent of the income distribution -- earning at least $10.7 million apiece -- pocketed 3.48 percent of the nation's total income, double their share in 1993.
 Some analysts argue that the spectacular rise in executive pay is to be expected in a marketplace in which bigger and bigger firms compete for talent. Others suggest it has more to do with the ability of chief executives to manipulate their boards to set their own pay. 
 In any case, the combination of inexorable income growth at the very apex of society and stagnation everywhere else can serve no public good.
 The Bush administration has focused its economic policies on cutting taxes for the very richest Americans. Taxation needs urgently to become more progressive. If the United States is to continue to embrace globalization, technological innovation and other forces that contribute to economic growth, it has to share the spoils better.

HEADLINE: Investors Await the Quarterly Reports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street started the week with a narrowly mixed performance Monday as many investors moved to the sidelines, awaiting quarterly profit reports.
 Stocks rose in early trading, extending last week's big advance on talk of a $5 billion private equity investment in Washington Mutual, which is said to be in discussions with the Texas Pacific Group and other investors about selling a stake for cash.
 But with earnings on tap and the Federal Reserve issuing minutes from its March meeting on Tuesday, investors, while feeling more confident over all, decided to play it safer late in the day. 
 Alcoa, which announced first-quarter results after the close, was the biggest loser among the 30 Dow Jones industrials, falling $1.56, or 4 percent, to $37.44 ahead of its earnings release. The aluminum company said its net income dropped 54 percent, more than the market expected. 
 The Dow rose 3.01 points, or 0.02 percent, to 12,612.43, after rising more than 120 points earlier in the day and finishing last week up 393.02, or 3.22 percent.
 Broader stock indicators were mixed Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 2.14 points, or 0.16 percent, at 1,372.54, after rising as high as 1,386.74. The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.15, or 0.26 percent, to 2,364.83.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.05, or 0.15 percent, to 712.68.
 ''Over all, I'm getting the sense here that the Street is starting to focus on fundamentals and the timing of a potential recovery in the economy, and trying to move past the credit crisis,'' said Craig Peckham, market strategist at Jefferies & Company.
 As earnings pour in over the next couple of weeks, however, it is possible that investors could grow anxious again -- especially if banks reveal bigger losses than expected, Mr. Peckham said.
 Alcoa's results might stir some of that anxiety. The company said it earned 37 cents a share in the first quarter, compared with analysts' expectations of 48 cents.
 But there were many signs during the day that Wall Street was feeling more optimistic.
 After news that Washington Mutual might sell a stake for cash -- a move that banks like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have already made -- its shares shot up $2.98, or 29 percent, to $13.15. Other banks rose: Merrill Lynch was up $1.30, or 2.8 percent, to $47.55; Bear Stearns gained 20 cents, to $10.67; and Goldman Sachs added $3.33, to $178.73.
 In other deal-making news, the Swiss pharmaceutical maker Novartis said it would spend about $38 billion in a two-step bid for a majority stake in the American eye care company Alcon. Alcon rose $2.19, to $150.63, and Novartis fell $2.12, to $50.
 Yahoo fell 66 cents, to $27.70, after Microsoft gave it three weeks to agree to a takeover or face a proxy fight. Microsoft closed flat at $29.16.
 Light crude rose $2.86, to $109.09 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold prices also increased, and the dollar gained against most other major currencies.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 19/32, to 99 22/32. Its yield, which moves opposite its price, jumped to 3.54 percent, from 3.47 percent.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills.

PERSON: Simon Michael Bessie 

HEADLINE: Simon Michael Bessie, a Publisher Of Major Literary Figures, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT; Douglas Martin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Simon Michael Bessie, who in 1959 left a top editorial position at what was then called Harper & Brothers to help found Atheneum Publishers, perhaps the last major literary house to be started from scratch in the 20th century, died on Monday at his home in Lyme, Conn. He was 92.
 His wife, Cornelia, announced the death. 
 Mr. Bessie was Atheneum's president from 1963 to 1975, but he was also known for his strengths in acquiring manuscripts. Over his career he edited writers like Daniel J. Boorstin, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Kenneth Tynan and Elie Wiesel.
 His reputation as an enterprising editor was burnished by a story John Cheever often told, about the publication of Cheever's first novel, ''The Wapshot Chronicle.''
 As Susan Cheever recounts it in a memoir of her father, ''Home Before Dark'' (1984), Mr. Cheever had offered the novel to Random House in 1954, but the publisher turned it down. In despair, he rented a house that summer on Nantucket Island, took his family there and continued working on the novel. One day, as Cheever was staring out the window, a sailing yacht appeared in the harbor and dropped anchor. A man in white flannels and a double-breasted blazer was rowed ashore in a dinghy and announced in the voice of a literate aristocrat to the small crowd that had gathered to greet him, ''I'm looking for John Cheever.''
 ''It was Simon Michael Bessie,'' Ms. Cheever writes, ''a senior editor at Harper & Row, and he had come to buy 'The Wapshot Chronicle.' ''
 The novel was published in 1957, sold well, was bought by the Book of the Month Club, was favorably reviewed and a year later won the National Book Award.
 Even so, in 1959, Mr. Bessie was passed over for the position of editor in chief of Harper & Row in favor of Evan Thomas. He then teamed with Alfred A. Knopf Jr. -- then working for his parents, Alfred and Blanche Knopf, at their publishing house -- and Hiram Haydn, an editor at Bobbs-Merrill, in founding Atheneum. They lined up four backers, each willing to put up $250,000, and established offices in a four-story brownstone on East 38th Street in Manhattan. Cornelia Schaeffer, who would go on to marry Mr. Bessie, joined the house as an editor about a year later.
 Atheneum achieved quick success. Its first three lists produced three No. 1 best-sellers: ''The Last of the Just'' (1960), a novel about the Holocaust by Andre Schwarz-Bart; ''The Making of the President, 1960'' (1961), the first book in Theodore H. White's series on presidential campaigns; and ''The Rothschilds: A Family Portrait'' (1962) by Frederic Morton. 
 Other books also did well for the house. The first list included Jan de Hartog's crime novel ''The Inspector,'' Wright Morris's ''Ceremony in Lone Tree'' and William Goldman's ''Soldier in the Rain.'' Later came Edward Albee's play, ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' (1962).
 But there were also misjudgments. Having published Mario Puzo's second novel, ''The Fortunate Pilgrim'' (1965), Atheneum turned down the author's next effort, ''The Godfather,'' because, Mr. Knopf said, Mr. Haydn thought it ''junk.'' (G. P. Putnam's Sons published it in 1969.)
 Atheneum prospered until the 1970s, when straitened economic conditions began to make it harder for independent publishers to stay afloat, and the house began to look for a larger company to buy it. When Mr. Bessie received a bid from his former employer, now called Harper & Row, Mr. Knopf demurred, not wanting to work for someone else.
 Mr. Bessie then parted company with Atheneum and, in 1975, accepted a senior vice presidency at Harper, with an agreement that it would finance his and his wife's own imprint -- Cornelia and Michael Bessie Books -- when he turned 65 in 1981. (Harper followed through on that promise.) In 1978, Atheneum merged with Charles Scribner's Sons.
 Mr. Bessie remained on the Harper board until 1987, shortly after the News Corporation bought the company and changed it to HarperCollins. Mr. Bessie followed Bessie Books first to Pantheon and then to Counterpoint, in Washington.
 Mr. Bessie was born in New York City on Jan. 23, 1916, the son of Abraham Bessie, a doctor, and Ella Bessie. He attended Harvard College, where he edited The Harvard Crimson and received his bachelor's degree in 1936.
 That summer he became a reporter for The Newark Star Eagle and then joined the research department of RKO Radio Pictures, remaining there until 1938, the year he published his book ''Jazz Journalism: The Story of Tabloid Newspapers'' (Dutton).
 After working as a reporter and editor at Look magazine, he joined the Office of War Information in 1942 and was involved in psychological warfare in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and France. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1946.
 He entered the publishing business toward the end of World War II, joining Harper, at the invitation of his boss at the Paris embassy, Cass Canfield, who had recently become the company's head.
 In 1945, Mr. Bessie married Constance Ernst, the head of the broadcasting division of the war information office in New York. They had two children, Nicholas and Katherine, both of whom survive Mr. Bessie. Mr. Bessie married Cornelia Schaeffer in 1968, having first met her when she was an editor at Harper.
 For all his success in shepherding major books into print, Mr. Bessie also let some get away. Two decisions he later regretted were his rejections of Frantz Fanon's ''Wretched of the Earth'' and Vladimir Nabokov's ''Lolita.'' 
 ''One reads under different circumstances,'' he said in an interview with the online journal Archipelago in 1997. ''I have now reread Lolita several times since then, and I cannot reconstruct the S. M. Bessie who sat there in a hotel in Paris and turned that book down! But I did.''

HEADLINE: California Feuding

 BODY:
Two couples are neighbors in Sunnyvale, Calif. One couple plants redwoods and drives a Prius. The other one installs solar panels and drives an electric car. The solar-panel couple sues the redwood couple because the trees block the sun, making the panels less effective. 
 This could happen only in California, you say to yourself, and, of course, you are right. California has more eco-conscious people per square foot than anyplace else, and occasionally they are bound to collide.
 Yet there is another and more fundamentally serious reason why this tale of backyard bickering -- recounted by Felicity Barringer in The Times on Monday -- was more likely to occur in California than anywhere else: no state has done as much to sponsor, legitimize and reward environmental virtue. 
 California has long been an innovator. It passed laws governing automobile air pollution in 1966, well before Congress did. Since 1982, it has compensated utilities for helping consumers become more efficient, in effect rewarding them for selling less energy, not more. And in 2006, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a measure requiring home builders to offer buyers solar panels. The worth of these and other efforts is reflected in one dramatic statistic: despite robust economic growth, the state's per-capita electricity use has been constant for 20 years, while the rest of the country's rose 50 percent.
 California also has been well ahead of Washington on climate change, regulating carbon-dioxide emissions from vehicles and taking steps to reduce industrial emissions of greenhouse gases by 25 percent by 2020.
 Obviously, there will be costs associated with all this virtue, and for some -- like the Sunnyvale couples -- there will be shoving and pushing. Given the alternative of a less hospitable globe, these seem to be small sacrifices.

HEADLINE: A.M.D. Cuts 1,650 Jobs; Business Off For Its Chips

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Advanced Micro Devices said it would cut about 1,650 workers -- about 10 percent of its work force -- because of deteriorating business conditions across its units around the globe. 
 The layoffs may be one of the first signs in Silicon Valley of an economic slowdown that has already affected other industries in the United States. As recently as December, many Silicon Valley executives were stating that they believed that high technology industries would be saved from a downturn. 
 Several analysts said that A.M.D., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., was facing problems largely because of a resurgent Intel, the world's largest chip maker. A.M.D. lost market share to Intel last year and has also delayed shipping a new line of microprocessors, though it has said it has worked out those problems.
 ''I think this is mostly about A.M.D.,'' said Martin Reynolds, a vice president at the Gartner Group, a market research firm. ''I don't think the tech economy has gone in the tank yet, but we will be watching closely as firms report in the coming weeks.''
 There are some signs of a slowdown among tech companies. Intel has said weaker pricing for NAND flash memory would affect its profit margins. And on Monday, iSuppli, a market research firm, said it cut its forecast for the global NAND flash memory market. It expects revenue will grow 9 percent in 2008, a sharp revision from its earlier prediction of 27 percent growth. ISuppli blamed weaker consumer spending. It singled out less demand for flash memory from Apple, maker of iPods and iPhones, and SanDisk, the single biggest buyer of flash memory.
 A.M.D. makes chips for computers and servers and has a minority stake in the flash memory maker Spansion.
 A.M.D. also revised downward its financial guidance to Wall Street analysts, stating that it expects its revenue for the first quarter, which ended on March 29, to be about $1.5 billion. That is an increase of 22 percent over the first quarter of 2007 but a 15 percent decline from the previous quarter. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had forecast higher quarterly revenue, at $1.62 billion.
 The company said it had not yet estimated the revamping charge it planned to take as a result of the new round of layoffs, which a spokesman said would take place before the beginning of September. A.M.D. said that it would offer details when it reported first-quarter financial results on April 17. Analysts have estimated a net loss of $263 million, or 42 cents a share.
 The company, which has its most advanced factory in Dresden, Germany, and other offices in Austin, Tex., has about 16,800 employees.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Sues 5 Ex-Officials In San Diego

BYLINE: BYREUTERS

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday filed fraud complaints against five former San Diego city officials who played roles in the city's financial crisis in 2002 and 2003. 
 The five were all accused of failing to disclose to municipal bond buyers that financing problems with pension and retiree health care were jeopardizing the city's finances, the S.E.C. said.
 Those named in the suit included the city's former treasurer, Mary Vattimo; the former city manager, Michael Uberuaga; and the former auditor and comptroller, Edward Ryan.
 According to the complaint, the officials knew the city's unfunded liability to its pension system for retired workers was projected to increase from $284 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2002 to an estimated $2 billion by 2009.
 But they did not disclose the information, or the estimation that San Diego's liability for retiree health was $1.1 billion, in bond-offering documents or other notices, the S.E.C. said.
 In 1996, the city decided to put less money into its retirement plan while increasing spending on benefits, relying on earnings from investments. When the stock market faltered, the city was caught without financing.
 Filed in Federal District Court in San Diego, the complaint accuses Ms. Vattimo of drafting ''false and misleading disclosures,'' and it accuses Mr. Uberuaga of signing the closing letter for one of the bond offerings, falsely certifying that it was accurate.
 According to the S.E.C., Mr. Ryan signed letters lying about the city's funds in audited financial statements, as well.
 Also named in the suit were Patricia Frazier, the former deputy city manager of finance, and Teresa A. Webster, the former assistant auditor and comptroller.
 Lawyers for the five did not immediately return calls for comments.

HEADLINE: There's Gas in Those Hills

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: HUGHESVILLE, Pa. 

 BODY:
At first, Raymond Gregoire did not want to listen to the raspy voice on his answering machine offering him money for rights to drill on his land. They want to ruin my land, he thought. But he called back anyway a week later to hear more.
 By the end of February, he had a contract in hand for $62,000, and he pulled together a group of 75 neighbors who signed $3 million in deals.
 ''It's a modern-day gold rush in our own backyard,'' Mr. Gregoire said.
 Not just his backyard either -- a frenzy unlike any seen in decades is unfolding here in rural Pennsylvania, and it eventually could encompass a huge chunk of the East, stretching from upstate New York to eastern Ohio and as far south as West Virginia. Companies are risking big money on a bet that this area could produce billions of dollars worth of natural gas. 
 A layer of rock here called the Marcellus Shale has been known for more than a century to contain gas, but it was generally not seen as economical to extract. Now, improved recovery technology, sharply higher natural gas prices and strong drilling results in a similar shale formation in north Texas are changing the calculus. A result is that a part of the country where energy supplies were long thought to be largely tapped out is suddenly ripe for gas prospecting.
 Pennsylvania, where the Marcellus Shale appears to be thickest, is the heart of the action so far. Leasing agents from Texas and Oklahoma are knocking on doors, leaving voice mail messages and playing host at catered buffets to woo dairy farmers and retirees. They are rifling through stacks of dusty deeds in courthouse basements to see who has underground mineral rights to the deepest gas formations.
 Thomas B. Murphy, a Pennsylvania State University educator who runs a program to instruct landowners on their rights, estimated that more than 20 oil and gas companies will invest $700 million this year developing the Marcellus Shale. Up to one half of that will be invested in Pennsylvania, he estimated.
 The cost to companies for leasing mineral rights jumped from $300 an acre in mid-February to $2,100 now. ''It shows you the pace this is going,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''I would call it breakneck.''
 Dale A. Tice, a lawyer representing landowners in lease negotiations, said companies were on a ''feeding frenzy.''
 Industry experts say in the last three years companies like Anadarko Petroleum, Chesapeake Energy and Cabot Oil and Gas have leased up to two million acres for drilling in the region, half of that in the last nine months.
 Whether their bets will pay off is by no means a sure thing.
 Researchers at Penn State and the State University of New York at Fredonia estimate that the Marcellus has 50 trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas, roughly twice the amount of natural gas consumed in the United States last year. But government estimates of the amount of gas recoverable from the Marcellus are relatively modest.
 Early test results have encouraged companies to keep drilling, but most are holding details of their test wells close to the vest.
 The company that has done the most work is Range Resources of Fort Worth, which says it plans to invest at least $426 million in the Appalachia region this year. 
 The company has reported promising results from the first 12 wells that it has drilled horizontally, the technique considered by most experts to be the most effective in the Marcellus. The most recent six have each produced more than three million cubic feet of production a day in recent months, and company executives say that is better than the average for wells recovering natural gas in the Barnett Shale in north Texas. 
 ''The Marcellus is important to Range and it could be important to the country but it really is still early,'' said Rodney L. Waller, a senior vice president at Range. ''I can build you a scenario where it can be significantly better than the Barnett but it's a function of economics.'' 
 Energy experts say the Marcellus, along with other smaller shale formations being developed around the country, is coming under scrutiny at an opportune moment, just when conventional domestic natural gas production and imports from Canada are diminishing. With easy-to-find gas fields in decline, the country will need to explore in deeper waters in the Gulf of Mexico and penetrate deeper under the surface on land. 
 If all goes well, the Marcellus could help moderate the steep climb in natural gas prices and reduce possible future dependence on natural gas from the Middle East, which is beginning to arrive at coastal terminals in liquefied form.
 Natural gas in the Marcellus and other shale formations is sometimes found as deep as 9,000 feet below the ground, a geological and engineering challenge not to be underestimated. The shales are sedimentary rock deposits formed from the mud of shallow seas several hundred million years ago. Gas can be found trapped within shale deposits, although it is too early to know exactly how much gas will be retrievable. 
 The gas from all the shales combined ''is a game changer,'' said Robert W. Esser, an oil and gas expert at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. He estimated that shale produced four billion cubic feet of gas a day on average last year, or about 7 percent of national production, and that shale gas production would increase to nine billion cubic feet a day by 2012, or about 15 percent of expected national production. 
 The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority estimates that developing New York's portion of the Marcellus could roughly double the amount of natural gas now produced in New York. Currently that is about 55 billion cubic feet a year, providing for 5 percent of the state's needs. 
 The Marcellus has suddenly become attractive in large part because natural gas prices have spiked in the last several years and the geologically similar Barnett Shale has been an industry sensation.
 By using horizontal drilling techniques, oil and gas companies have been able to draw natural gas from underneath the city of Fort Worth, even from below schools, churches and airports. The companies have perfected hydraulic fracturing techniques, pumping water and sand into well bores to fracture shale and release gas from its pores.
 Production in the Barnett has exploded from a trickle five years ago to over three billion cubic feet a day, and energy experts say that number could more than double by 2015. Shale gas development in other parts of Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas has also shown promise. 
 But no formation compares in size to the Marcellus. It is deeply entrenched in wooded and mountainous countryside and expensive to reach. But the reserve is also within short pipeline distance from some of the nation's most energy-hungry cities. 
 Still, not everyone here is happy about all the leasing and drilling. At meetings with the companies, landowners have asked questions about potential hazards to water and woodlands. 
 Keith Eckel, 61, a grain farmer with 700 acres in northeastern Pennsylvania, said he had not decided whether to let the companies drill on his property. ''Farmers have taken care of this land all their lives and don't want to see it destroyed,'' he said. 
 But many farmers and retirees in rural Pennsylvania appear excited that their lives are about to change. 
 ''Now I can retire,'' said Robert Deiseroth, a 63-year-old farmer and auctioneer from the town of Hickory, who recently received a $16,000 royalty check from Range Resources that he hopes will be repeated month after month. ''This was a godsend for me. If it weren't for this I would have to sell off some of my land to get some money for retirement.'' 
 Mr. Deiseroth has put new windows in his house, bought a new fishing boat and plans to build a new garage. His 89-year-old father and 90-year-old mother, who live nearby, just got a $20,000 monthly check. His father has replaced the golf cart he drove around his farm with a Kubota utility vehicle, while his mother has bought a flat-screen television. 
 ''When Range came in a lot of people didn't like it,'' Mr. Deiseroth said, ''But things changed when they started getting their checks.''

 BODY:
FUEL PRICES SHUT 5 AIRLINES Four low-cost airlines ceased passenger operations last week. A fifth, a charter operator, said it would shut at the end of May. All blamed high fuel costs. The four were Aloha Airlines, based in Honolulu; ATA Airlines, based in Indianapolis; Skyway Airlines, of Milwaukee; and Skybus Airlines, of Columbus, Ohio. Champion Air, which operates charter flights for sports teams and corporate incentive trips, said it would close May 31. 
 BY THE NUMBERS The six major network airlines reported an average domestic load factor of 85 percent in March. Load factors measure the percentage of available seats occupied by paying passengers. At average load factors over 80 percent, most flights are taking off with every seat full. The six airlines also reported that domestic capacity, measured in available seat miles, fell by an average of 4.3 percent in March compared with March 2007. The major network carriers are American, Delta, United, Continental, US Airways and Northwest.
 NO LETUP IN DELAYS In February, slightly over a quarter (25.96 percent) of domestic flights arrived late, the Transportation Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics reports. That is about even with February 2007, when it was 25.99 percent, but significantly above the 20.76 percent in February 2006. The major domestic airports with the worst on-time arrival records this year through March 31 were La Guardia in New York and O'Hare in Chicago, which both had late arrival rates of 44.5 percent. Among major international airports, London Heathrow had a late arrival rate of 48.1 percent in the first three months of this year, FlightStats said.
 SERVICE? THAT'S $25, PLEASE Air Canada calls it an industry first. The airline is offering ''speedy phone access to specially trained Air Canada customer service agents'' who will provide ''travel and accommodation solutions for customers whose plans have been disrupted'' by flight delays. The charge is $25 for short flights and $35 for flights over 1,000 miles. Air Canada says the phone assistance service ''goes far beyond standard industry practice of assisting customers affected by schedule changes within the airline's control.''
 CHECKED-BAG FEESContinental Airlines became the latest major airline to add a $25 charge for a second checked bag for coach passengers, with the exception of elite status members of its OnePass frequent flier program, those flying on full-fare economy tickets, and active duty military personnel traveling on orders. The fee takes effect May 5.
 NEW SERVICE TO TORONTO Porter Airlines of Canada started service with seven daily nonstop flights between Toronto City Centre Airport and Newark. Porter offers amenities like a lounge open to all passengers at the Toronto airport. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Asian Inflation Begins to Sting U.S. Shoppers

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Mery Galanternick contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.

DATELINE: BAT TRANG, Vietnam 

 BODY:
The free ride for American consumers is ending. For two generations, Americans have imported goods produced ever more cheaply from a succession of low-wage countries -- first Japan and Korea, then China, and now increasingly places like Vietnam and India. 
 But mounting inflation in the developing world, especially Asia, is threatening that arrangement, and not just in China, where rising energy and labor costs have already made exports to the United States more expensive, but in the lower-cost alternatives to China, too. 
 ''Inflation is the major threat to Asian countries,'' said Jong-Wha Lee, the head of the Asian Development Bank's office of regional economic integration.
 It is also a threat to Western consumers because Asian exporters, even in very poor countries, are passing their rising costs on to customers. 
 Developing countries have had bouts of inflation before. Indeed, some are famous for them, like Brazil, which experienced triple-digit inflation in the late 1980s and early 1990s. But two things make this time different, and together promise to send prices higher at Wal-Mart and supermarkets alike in the United States, just as the possibility of recession looms. 
 First, developing countries now produce nearly half of all American imports. Second, inflation in these countries is coming at the same time that many of their currencies are rising against the dollar. 
 That puts American consumers in a double bind, paying at least some of producers' higher costs for making their goods, and higher prices on top of that because the dollar buys less in those countries. 
 Asian businessmen say they do not have a choice about charging more. ''This is a tough time to do business,'' said Le Hoai Vu, the sales manager for the Quang Vinh Ceramic Company here in northern Vietnam. 
 The company just increased by up to 10 percent the prices it charges Pier 1 Imports in the United States for hand-painted vases because labor costs are rising 30 percent a year. 
 Over all, in Vietnam, one of the fastest-growing destinations for manufacturing investments and one of the fastest-growing sources of American imports, prices rose 19.4 percent from March 2007 to March 2008. 
 In China, Foshan Shunde Augustus Bathroom Equipment Ltd. in Foshan City is about to raise prices by 10 percent for a range of bathroom fixtures exported to North America. 
 ''Rising inflation is a way of life in China these days, you see it everywhere,'' said Faye Kong, the company's international business supervisor.
 The cost of American imports from less industrialized countries as a group is rising. A Bureau of Labor Statistics index of average prices for imports of manufactured goods from such countries fell gradually through early 2004, but is now rising briskly and was up 5.6 percent in February from the same month last year.
 That contributes to rising inflation in the United States; in the 12 months through February 2008, the prices of goods for sale in the United States increased by 4 percent, according to the government's Consumer Price Index. 
 But so far, Asian exporters have passed along only a portion of their costs. In China, for instance, prices are now rising almost 9 percent a year, triple the pace of a year ago. 
 Workers in the developing world facing higher prices have been increasingly vocal in demanding higher wages, with protests erupting in recent days in Vietnam, Cambodia and Egypt. 
 At the same time, inflation keeps rising: the Philippines announced that its inflation at the consumer level had doubled in the last five months, showing a 6.4 percent increase in March over the same month a year ago. And weekly inflation at the wholesale level has accelerated in India, reaching an annual rate of 7 percent in the week ended March 22, up from 3.1 percent as recently as last October.
 Not long ago, it would have been unlikely for a poor country with high inflation to see its money strengthen in value against the mighty dollar. But the dollar is not quite as mighty as it once was. Large American trade deficits and other problems have weakened its appeal. 
 And there are signs that the dollar could fall further if developing countries' central banks stopped supporting it, particularly in Asia.
 Vietnam's central bank even had to order the country's commercial banks late last month to resume buying dollars within the tight range of exchange rates set by the government. Many banks had started betting on dollar depreciation and refusing to accept large sums in dollars, to the point that multinationals and exporters had trouble wiring money into the country to pay their employees' salaries.
 Additionally, the dollar's weakness is itself a cause of inflation in developing countries, particularly those that have barely let their currencies rise against the dollar in an effort to hold on to export markets.
 In a street market around the corner from the 270-year-old Lungshan Temple in Taipei, Taiwan, Teresa Gau, a fishmonger, is charging up to a third more for fish and crabs than she did a year ago. That is because fishing boat owners are charging her more as they struggle to cover higher costs for diesel fuel, which is priced in dollars.
 ''They have to raise the price to compensate,'' Ms. Gau said.
 Inflation in Taiwan has started to creep up partly because the government waited until this year to allow the currency, the New Taiwan dollar, to appreciate. Taiwan imports all its oil, and only now is the slightly strengthening New Taiwan dollar starting to hold down the cost for consumers in filling up their gas tanks.
 Here in Bat Trang, an ancient ceramics center near Hanoi, Quang Vinh Ceramic's fastest-rising expense is for vivid blue ink for painting vases and other pottery. Imported from Belgium, the ink is priced in euros and has soared 80 percent over the last year in Vietnamese dong.
 Keeping the dong inexpensive in dollar terms helped Vietnam increase its exports by 24.1 percent last year, but also lured a flood of investment. Bank loans rose more than 50 percent last year, feeding a real estate frenzy that has not yet abated.
 Brick kiln owners like Le Thi Hop here in Bat Trang have responded by tripling prices in the last year.
 ''Most of the people who buy my bricks say the price is crazy, but I say, 'This is the market,' '' Ms. Hop said cheerily.
 High costs for construction materials are making it more expensive for the many multinationals like Samsung of South Korea and Hanes and Emerson Electric of the United States that are now building factories in Vietnam, partly in response to rising costs in China.
 In addition to the weak dollar, economists say that countries like Vietnam, Egypt, China and Brazil are inherently more vulnerable to inflation when, as now, rising prices are led by increasingly expensive commodities.
 Soaring food and energy costs have a far greater effect on developing countries like Vietnam, because of their large agricultural and energy-hungry manufacturing sectors, than on industrialized countries, which tend to have larger service sectors than manufacturing sectors.
 Quang Vinh, which was founded by a 15th-generation pottery maker, has raised wages by 30 percent over the past year to keep up with food prices, which have also risen. Food is the biggest expense for the company's workers, who earn $75 a month working eight hours a day, six days a week.
 ''Before, I used to go out with friends regularly,'' said Nguyen Xuan Tu, a 29-year-old Quang Vinh worker who rides a motor scooter, like many Vietnamese. ''But now, with the high cost of gasoline, I don't go out too much.''
 Two opposing trends have made it hard to gauge the true extent of inflation in the developing world.
 Very heavy investment in new factories, especially in China but increasingly in emerging countries like India and Vietnam as well, has created a lot of extra industrial capacity. That could drag down prices somewhat if the American economic slowdown causes a global slump in demand.
 But many developing countries, led by China and India, have blunted the full impact of inflation so far through a combination of price controls and subsidies, and more countries are joining them -- Vietnam has imposed price controls on transportation and gasoline over the past week, for instance.
 As businesses figure out ways around price controls, like charging the same while shrinking the quantities in each package, and as the cost of subsidies may become unsustainably high, inflation may worsen.

HEADLINE: Bush Says Economy Is Poised To Rebound

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush urged Congress on Monday to resist efforts by Democrats to pass a second economic stimulus package, saying that while the economy is ''in a rough time right now,'' he is confident it will begin to rebound by the end of the year. 
 On his first day back from a swing through Eastern Europe and Russia, Mr. Bush summoned small-business leaders to the White House to showcase the first stimulus package, signed into law in February. That package included rebates for taxpayers -- the White House says the checks will start to go out next month -- and tax incentives intended to encourage businesses to invest.
 Mr. Bush urged lawmakers to give the law a chance to work before passing a new one. ''Give this one a chance to kick in,'' he said.
 But in the wake of a bleak report on Friday that showed 80,000 jobs were lost in March, Democrats say there is no time to waste. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, has called on Mr. Bush to work with Congress in passing a new stimulus bill and has said she will raise the issue with Mr. Bush directly at a meeting scheduled for Wednesday at the White House. 
 Ms. Pelosi is proposing a package that would include an extension of unemployment benefits, a provision that the White House opposed in negotiations over the first stimulus package. At the same time, Senate Democrats and Republicans are working together on a housing bill to help struggling homeowners avert foreclosure; the White House says it has ''deep concerns'' about that legislation. 
 In pushing back against additional government intervention in the economy, Mr. Bush is drawing a sharp contrast between himself and Democrats, who intend to make rising unemployment and the economic downturn a centerpiece of their fall election campaigns. 
 But he could be making life difficult for Republicans, who will face questions from voters about what they are doing to make life better for ordinary Americans and who will have to decide whether to stick with the White House or break with Mr. Bush when the housing and stimulus bills come up for votes.
 At Monday's White House event, Mr. Bush commended a group of businessmen and women who said tax incentives had led them to invest more in their companies.
 But he conceded that Americans remained concerned, saying ''not only are people worried about their homes, they're worried about the cost of fuel.''

HEADLINE: A Fear That the Market's Watchdog Is Losing Its Bite

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
Not long ago the market police at the Securities and Exchange Commission gave JPMorgan Chase the Wall Street equivalent of a traffic ticket. The penalty: $25 million. 
 But the agency's commissioners overruled their Wall Street enforcers, calling the judgment too harsh. The agency recently lowered the bank's bill to $2 million -- less than one-tenth the amount that the enforcement staff initially recommended. 
 To some inside and outside the S.E.C., the case, and others like it, underscores a worrying development: The nation's market watchdog, its critics say, is losing its bite. 
 Wall Street and the broader business community have pushed aggressively in recent years to roll back regulation, arguing the United States is losing its competitive edge. But with the recent financial crisis, which many call the worst since the Depression, critics wonder whether the S.E.C. has given in to the push to lighten up. 
 ''There has been less emphasis on investor protection and more on this issue of the competitiveness of markets,'' said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island. 
 In March, Senator Reed and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, asked the Government Accountability Office to look into the penalties that the S.E.C. has been levying lately. Penalties, together with the return of ill-gotten gains, fell by half in the 2007 fiscal year, to $1.6 billion. 
 Staff lawyers in the S.E.C. enforcement division say high turnover, tight budgets and a new, looser attitude toward corporate wrongdoing are sapping morale. The staffing and budget of the S.E.C. have lagged far behind the explosive growth of the markets the commission must police. 
 The Bush administration has left the S.E.C., normally headed by its chairman and four other presidentially appointed commissioners, firmly in the hands of Republicans with the departure of one Democrat last fall and another in January. Nominations for both positions have been submitted. 
 Turnover is high. The percentage of employees who leave annually rose to 8.6 percent in 2007, the highest level in five years, from 7.5 percent in 2005, when Mr. Cox arrived (turnover in the late 1990s was much higher, and generally surges in bull markets, said John Nester an S.E.C. spokesman). Staff levels are down and falling. The S.E.C. budgeted for 1,093 enforcement jobs in 2009, down from 1,232 full- time enforcement employees in 2005. 
 ''The slight decrease in personnel, despite record spending on enforcement, is directly attributable to the overall higher salaries paid to enforcement personnel consistent with the S.E.C.'s priority of attracting and retaining the highest caliber staff,'' Mr. Nester said. 
 But since Christopher Cox, a former Republican congressman from California, took over as chairman in 2005, spending on enforcement has fallen from $316.3 million to $298 million in 2007. 
 ''What Cox has done to this agency is to pull state patrolmen off the highways and shackle them in one way or another in a parking lot,'' said Lynn E. Turner, who served as the S.E.C.'s chief accountant from 1998 to 2001. 
 But to many on Wall Street, Mr. Cox has struck the right balance for the times. 
 ''First and foremost the S.E.C. is a law enforcement agency, and Chris Cox has continued that longstanding tradition,'' said Ira D. Hammerman, senior managing director for the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the industry's main trade group.
 Mr. Cox succeeded William H. Donaldson, another Republican, who moved aggressively to punish mutual funds engaged in market timing, regulate hedge funds and give shareholders a more powerful vote in corporate matters. Mr. Donaldson infuriated the business community, and his five-member commission was often divided. 
 Mr. Cox, by contrast, has made consensus among his commissioners a priority. 
 ''He was more moderate in his approach on many issues at the start of his chairmanship,'' said Joel Seligman, president of the University of Rochester and author of a book on the history of the S.E.C. ''He worked very hard to build consensus to an extent that many people thought was appropriate and wise.''
 Mr. Cox has tried to clarify the commission's policy toward penalties with guidelines released in January 2006. He has said the S.E.C. generally wants to avoid punishing one set of shareholders for corporate wrongdoing that benefited another group of shareholders. 
 But enforcement staff have argued that other policies have hampered their ability to bring tough cases. Previously, for example, staff lawyers negotiated settlements and then brought them to the commissioners for approval. Now, under a pilot program, the commission requires a majority of the commissioners to approve a range for settlements. Some staff members complain that this makes them feel as if they must get permission to do their jobs. 
 But the commission has argued this change gives its lawyers more leverage. When they negotiate, companies know any settlement cannot be voted down by the commission later. 
 Whatever the case, total disgorgements and penalties, which are subject to business cycles and individual factors affecting cases, have fallen recently. The penalties portion -- the punishment that a company faces, excluding any return of ill-gotten gains -- fell from $977 million in 2006 to $505 million in 2007. But accompanying that decrease is a decline in disgorgement, suggesting that companies and officers are engaged in less wrongdoing than that the S.E.C. staff is bringing fewer cases. Return of ill-gotten gains fell to $1.1 billion in 2007 from $2.4 billion in 2006.
 Mr. Cox responded to Senator Dodd's inquiry on April 1, pointing out that in the fiscal year ended 2007, the S.E.C. brought the largest number of corporate penalty cases in its history. Since 2006, the S.E.C. has settled some high-dollar cases, including a penalty for Fannie Mae that totaled $400 million. Yet the JPMorgan case, in which the S.E.C. said the bank failed to detect wrongdoing at a client for which it was a trustee, is not the only recent case in which the commissioners have reduced bills for companies. (JPMorgan, as is usual in S.E.C. settlements, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.)
 On March 5, in a particularly high-profile case, the agency accused Fidelity Investments and 13 former and current employees of accepting more than $1.6 million in improper gifts, entertainment and travel paid by brokers doing business with the fund company.
 Among those charged was Peter Lynch, vice chairman and former portfolio manager for the Magellan Fund. He struck a deal with the S.E.C. to pay almost $30,000 in disgorgement, but the commission, excluding Mr. Cox who was recused, later reduced that to about $16,000, saying gifts should be valued at retail prices, as they are for federal employees. 
 A spokesman for Mr. Lynch declined to comment. 
 Arthur Levitt, who served as S.E.C. chairman under President Clinton, is critical that the agency is not as active as it should be. When the Treasury Department proposed a blueprint that would have stripped the S.E.C.'s powers, Mr. Cox did not condemn it.
 ''Together with other actions taken and some not taken with respect to a number of issues important to investors, it is unlikely that this commission will be known as an activist one,'' Mr. Levitt said.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Struggles to Find Candidates for Congress

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republican leaders are struggling to recruit candidates for Congressional races in the New York region, reflecting a problem for the party in other pockets of the country and giving Democrats an opportunity to build on the gains they made in the area in the last election.
 Heading into this election cycle, Republican leaders in Washington identified dozens of Congressional seats they believed they could pick up in November's election -- some where Democrats narrowly won a first term in 2006, and others where Democrats represent Republican-leaning districts. 
 But that strategy appears to have run into complications, both in the New York region and in some other parts of the country, as many potential Republican candidates -- including public officials and wealthy entrepreneurs -- have stayed on the sidelines, despite direct appeals from party leaders.
 In some cases, potential candidates see a tough climate for Republicans, largely because of a troubled economy and a protracted war, according to some Republicans. 
 Some have even started races, only to abandon the effort.
 A recent example arose after Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, a five-term Republican, announced on March 20 that he would not run for re-election in New York's 26th Congressional District, a heavily Republican area that stretches from Buffalo to Rochester.
 Days after Mr. Reynolds's announcement, the man widely considered to be the most formidable Republican candidate to replace Mr. Reynolds, George D. Maziarz, a popular state senator, declared that he would not run for the seat. 
 He said that giving up his own seat to run for Congress would be too great a gamble. 
 ''It's very difficult for a Republican in this election cycle,'' Mr. Maziarz said in a recent interview. ''It's clearly a competitive seat. And I think it's more competitive without me.''
 Republican leaders play down the difficulty of finding willing candidates. Ken Spain, a spokesman for the House Republicans' campaign committee, acknowledged the challenges in certain districts but said the party had done a good job of recruitment over all.
 ''We believe we have fielded one of the best Republican recruitment classes in quite some time,'' he said.
 But the lack of robust challengers, especially for Democratic freshmen, is clearly a concern. Members of Congress are typically considered most vulnerable after their first term in office. After that, the benefits of incumbency tend to build and protect them from serious challenges. 
 In central New York, for example, Republicans have been urging Richard Hanna, a wealthy businessman who could bankroll his own race, to run against Representative Michael Arcuri, a member of the Democratic freshman class of 2006. In that year, the party gained 30 seats and took control of the House. 
 But Mr. Hanna, who formed an exploratory committee last November, has yet to enter the race, puzzling Mr. Arcuri and Democratic leaders in Washington, who had been bracing for a tough election season for freshman lawmakers. As recently as last week, Republican leaders in Washington encouraged Mr. Hanna to run, and they say they believe he still may enter the race. 
 ''I don't know why the situation is what it is,'' Mr. Arcuri said in a recent interview. He suggested that the electoral challenges Republicans are facing, including an increasingly unpopular war, may have led ''people who might otherwise run for Congress to think twice.''
 Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who is in charge of the House Democratic campaign effort for 2008, said Democrats had started the election cycle expecting to spend much of their time and resources defending the seats captured by new members. 
 ''It's unexpected,'' he said, referring to the recruitment problems Republican have faced. ''The fact that they have not been able to field candidates in a lot of these districts means we have not had to circle the wagons and play defense.''
 The Republican recruitment effort is also facing complications on the Senate side. In New Jersey, John F. Crowley, a biotechnology executive, decided recently not to enter the New Jersey Republican primary, even after being asked to do so by Senator John McCain of Arizona and other prominent Republicans.
 Republicans have had difficulty recruiting top-tier candidates in several other states, including Ohio and Indiana. But the problems have been especially pronounced in New York, a heavily Democratic state where Democrats picked up three Republican-held seats in 2006. Republicans are in danger of suffering more losses this year, analysts say.
 In the Syracuse area, for example, Republican leaders are scrambling to find a candidate to appear on the ballot in place of Representative James T. Walsh, who recently announced that he would retire at the end of his current term.
 Republicans in Washington thought that their strongest possible candidate was William Fitzpatrick, the longtime Onondaga County district attorney, and tried to persuade him to run. But he ultimately declined. Mr. Fitzpatrick did not return a phone call requesting comment. Now, several Republicans are vying for their party's nomination, even as Democrats have coalesced around their candidate, Dan Maffei, a former Congressional aide who narrowly lost to Mr. Walsh in the 2006 election.
 Republicans have also suffered a significant setback in their efforts to defeat Representative John Hall, a freshman Democrat who narrowly won his seat in the suburbs north of New York City in 2006.
 At one point, Republican Party leaders had managed to recruit a millionaire who was expected to pour his own money into the race, causing alarm among Democrats. But the candidate, Andrew M. Saul, a vice chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, abruptly quit the race, citing personal reasons. Now, Mr. Hall is running virtually unopposed.
 The problems are also playing out in neighboring New Jersey, where Representative Jim Saxton, a longtime incumbent, announced that he would not seek re-election this year, leaving Republican leaders in a bind. 
 In an effort to protect the seat, national Republicans leaders approached State Senator Diane Allen, 59, seeing her as a strong prospective candidate, according to one person close to the situation. But the senator decided not to run because she did not relish a contested primary, the person said, leaving a muddled primary among Republicans fighting for their party's nomination for the seat.

 Newtown Creek
 And Its Deadly History
 Newtown Creek, which straddles Brooklyn and Queens, was once one of the country's busiest waterways and called ''the most polluted waterway in America.'' It has also been the site of several deadly episodes.

 DOT EARTH: 
 Breath of a Nation
 Scientists have come up with a precise way to track daily and local patterns of carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels by power plants, factories and vehicle traffic. The resulting database and maps provide a view of the ''industrial metabolism'' of our combustion-powered lives.

 AMERICAN MILITARY CONFIRMS
 Sharp Rise in Attacks in Iraq
 After a general decline in attacks against civilians and security forces in Baghdad, the number more than doubled in March from the previous month, according to statistics compiled by the American military in Baghdad. The sudden increase in overall attacks reflects new strikes against the Green Zone and renewed fighting in the Sadr City district of Baghdad. PAGE A11 
 IN KASHMIR, A NEW KIND OF BUNKER
 Naeem Akhtar, the most senior official in charge of tourism in Kashmir, has an improbable task in the Indian government's drive to revitalize the area after 18 years of militant violence: rebranding the heavily militarized Himalayan region as a global golfing destination. ''We face a lot of uncomfortable questions,'' Mr. Akhtar admits. PAGE A12 
 ZIMBABWE COURT DELAYS DECISION
 Zimbabwe's High Court delayed a decision on whether to force the government to release the results of the presidential election, as the opposition leader who requested the ruling traveled to South Africa for talks. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, urged Zimbabwe's election commission ''to release the results expeditiously and with transparency.'' PAGE A6 
 TIMES REPORTER IS RELEASED ON BAIL
 A reporter for The New York Times who was jailed for covering the elections in Zimbabwe without government permission was released on bail, according to one of his lawyers. The reporter, Barry Bearak, was swept up during a raid that seemed to be part of a government crackdown after an election that was turning against President Robert G. Mugabe. PAGE A14 
 IRAQ MAY NOT BE TERROR INCUBATOR
 After the Paris police smashed a cell suspected of sending insurgents to Iraq early in 2005, French authorities predicted a new threat: young Muslims who would return from the Iraqi battlefields to carry out terrorist acts inside France. Now, as members of the cell are awaiting a verdict in their case, French officials are saying those fears appear to be overblown. PAGE A6

 SOME HOPE NEW CLINTON STRATEGIST AUGURS A CHANGE IN TACK
 Geoff Garin is replacing Mark Penn as the top strategist on Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign team at a time when her campaign is facing fewer chances to overtake Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination and worries that the long fight for the nomination might hurt the party's chances this fall. Many party insiders believe Mr. Garin's presence at the helm of Ms. Clinton's campaign could mean a less negative approach to dealing with Mr. Obama. PAGE A16
 CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL FACES SANCTIONS
 California's health department said it planned to sanction the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center after workers at the hospital improperly viewed the records of dozens of patients. An investigation revealed that a hospital worker who had since quit opened the files of 61 patients, about half of whom were celebrities or politicians -- including the actress Farrah Fawcett and Maria Shriver, the state's first lady. PAGE A16
 AILING HOSPITAL'S $200 MILLION GIFT
 Grady Memorial Hospital, a large charity hospital in Atlanta, was on the brink of financial failure before the Woodruff Foundation provided a $200 million gift as part of the hospital's bailout. The gift to Grady is the largest on record, and goes to a hospital that provides the only emergency ambulance fleet to Atlanta and records more than a million outpatients a year. PAGE A20
 FISH IN A NEW YORK STATE OF MIND
 In a once-desolate stretch of the Atlantic, Red Bird Reef, an artificial reef off the coast of Delaware made with old subway cars donated by New York City, underwater life is booming. But that is become its own problem, as too many fish are fighting for the prime real estate, and other states have caught on to Delaware's success and begun angling for their own subway car reefs.

 BUT ARE THEY STILL FACEBOOK FRIENDS?
 Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, is looking to settle a lawsuit by three people who said he stole the idea for the social networking site from them when they were all students at Harvard, according someone briefed on the settlement talks. Facebook is valued at more than $15 billion, and the lingering legal questions about its origins could have hindered its plans to go public in 2009. PAGE C3
 PLACING BETS ON PENNSYLVANIA
 The Marcellus Shale is a layer of rock in Pennsylvania that has been known to contain natural gas for over 100 years, but it was always considered to expensive to recover. But as the technology for extracting natural gas has improved, so have efforts at exploration in Pennsylvania -- which could eventually take up huge chunks of the East -- as companies become willing to wager that it contains billions of dollars worth of natural gas. PAGE C1
 THIEVES COVET LEAD IN CHURCHES
 Lead is commanding record prices at commodities markets, thanks to skyrocketing demand from industrializing nations like China and India. That has not escaped the notice of thieves in Britain, who have begun stripping lead from the structures of churches, including some that are centuries old. PAGEC1
 SCALING BACK AT THE S.E.C.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission's efforts of enforcement have not kept up with rapid growth in financial markets. Morale at the agency is low, and since Christopher Cox became its chairman in 2005, the agency has spent less on enforcement and has a smaller staff, and some critics believe the agency has caved to the business community's push to ease up on legislation, litigation and rules.

 NEW YORK REPORT
 THE IRONY WAS NOT LOST
 On Opponents of Bloomberg Plan
 One night late last week, New York City's transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, was pulled over by state police and handed a ticket for speeding and improperly using her lights and sirens. Unfortunately for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, she was on her way to Albany to help win approval for his proposal to charge drivers entering the busiest sections of Manhattan. PAGE C13 
 BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR CORZINE
 Governor Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey swears that he wears his seat belt and says he feels so blessed to be alive that he takes far better care of himself. But ask almost anybody who works for Mr. Corzine to explain the difference between the pre-accident and post-accident governor, and the answer is remarkably consistent: What difference? PAGE C14 
 SUICIDE AMONG POLICE GROWS
 When Matthew Morelli, a 38-year-old police officer, was found slumped in a secluded parking lot with an AK-47 rifle, state and local authorities spent two days scouring the neighborhood with helicopters and police dogs. The culprit turned out to be a stealthy if surprisingly familiar cop killer: suicide. PAGE C13 
 CULTURE
 IN 'SECOND PLANE,'
 Amis Plays Provocateur
 In his new book of essays about the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Martin Amis, ever the litterateur, tries to deal with a vast historic tragedy with self-consciously literary musings, Michiko Kakutani writes. The result is such a weak and objectionable volume that the reader finishes it convinced that Mr. Amis should stick to writing fiction and literary criticism. PAGE B1 
 FAMILIAR FACE, DIFFERENT SHOW
 The fourth hour of ''Today'' badly needed some pizazz. Its answer was Kathie Lee Gifford, who appeared in her NBC debut as if she had never left morning television. She did not look or sound uncomfortable, and managed to dwell on her past triumphs without seeming self-conscious of the less savory moments. The TV Watch, by Alessandra Stanley. PAGE B1 
 WHEN ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS FOUR
 The art of the unaccompanied musician is to convince people that more things happen than actually do. One voice creates the illusion of two voices by letting listeners fill in the blanks. Bobby McFerrin's mix of singing and sound effects at Carnegie Hall, where he conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke's, continued such techniques. A review by Bernard Holland. PAGE B5 
 CONGO'S HORRORS, THROUGH A FILTER
 What has driven Lisa F. Jackson to make the ''The Greatest Silence: Rape in the Congo,'' the second television documentary in recent months to deal with the subject, isn't the tragedy itself but her own status as a rape survivor. She is therefore motivated not simply by her reportorial instincts but also by her unfortunate wish to relate, Ginia Bellafante writes. PAGE B7

 SIMON MICHAEL BESSIE, 92
 An editor renowned for his ability to acquire manuscripts, he left a top position at what was then called Harper & Brothers in 1959 to help found Atheneum -- perhaps the last major literary book-publishing house to be started from scratch in the 20th century. PAGE A25
 SPORTS
 A CLASH OF THE TITANS,
 Shelved Indefinitely
 For the first time in 13 years, there will be no game between Tennessee and Connecticut, women's basketballs two perennial powerhouses. That's partly because Connecticut was defeated by Stanford this weekend in the women's Final Four while Tennessee advanced to the final round, but also because of the lingering hostilities between Pat Summitt and Geno Auriemma. ''The sport always loses when heavyweight champions will not get into the ring because of a conflict of personality,'' Harvey Araton writes. PAGE C16
 HALL OF FAME INDUCTEES ANNOUNCED
 In 1994, centers Patrick Ewing and Hakeem Olajuwon faced off in the N.B.A. Finals, and Olajuwon's Houston Rockets defeated Ewings Knicks after seven games. Both Ewing, and Olajuwon -- as well as Pat Riley, the coach of that Knicks team -- were among the seven inductees who were elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as part of its 2008 class.

 BIG GAME'S OVER. BACK TO THE FARM.
 After the parties that followed the New York Giants victory in the Super Bowl, fullback Madison Hedgecock headed back down to the family farm near Winston-Salem on which he grew up working. ''People say football is hard work, but I just laugh sometimes,'' he said. ''Until they've worked on a tobacco farm, they don't know what hard work is.'' PAGE C18

 A CENTURIES-OLD MYSTERY ON THE PUEBLO
 In the 13th century, thousands of Anasazi left their settlements on the Colorado Plateau to head to Arizona and New Mexico. But why? Scientists had long believed that a great drought or ice age drove them to the south, but in looking deeper at ancient artifacts they are finding evidence of an ideological struggle. PAGE D1
 THE NEW HABITAT OF INTERSEX FROGS
 The frog in your backyard may have swum (or hopped) into a pickle just in time for spring: some ambiguity about its sexual role in the ritual of mating. A Yale scientist has found that common male suburban frogs are more likely than their suburban counterparts to be intersexed -- having immature female eggs growing in their testes. Some researchers attributed the phenomenon to the presence of chemicals in the water supply. PAGE D2
 A RARE DISEASE RELEASES CREATIVITY
 Dr. Anne Adams was a Canadian scientist who spent the latter part of her life compulsively painting, including a piece called ''Unravelling Bolero,'' which translated the musical score by the composer Maurice Ravel into usual form. What she didn't know was that she compelled to paint by the same rare brain disease that also afflicted Mr. Ravel. PAGE D1

 MORE TIME FOR MORE OF THE SAME?
 Americans get another chance this week to take stock of President Bush's war-without-end in Iraq. Gen. David Petraeus, the military commander in Baghdad, has signaled that there should be a pause in the withdrawal of American troops. But among the questions we would like General Petraeus to answer are: when will the Iraqi Army be ready to fight its own battles, and why -- after all of the American training and effort -- should Americans believe that his strategy deserves more time or has a real chance of success? PAGE A26
 MR. SILVER DOES IT AGAIN
 Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, used the power of his office to deprive New Yorkers of $354 million in federal funds to help mass transit, ease traffic congestion and improve the air that all New Yorkers breathe. He didn't even bring congestion pricing to a vote, failing to put New Yorkers' needs before his personal agenda. That makes him unworthy of his office. PAGE A26
 CALIFORNIA FEUDING
 Despite aggressive economic growth, California's per-capita electricity consumption has been constant for about 20 years, while the rest of the country's has increased 50 percent. No state has done more to sponsor, legitimize and reward environmental virtue. Obviously, there will be costs associated with all this virtue, but given the alternative of a much less hospitable globe, these seem to be small sacrifices. PAGE A26
 OP-ED
 DAVID BROOKS
 The troop surge in Iraq didn't create a fluid balance of power agreements between local groups, but those truces couldn't have happened without the surge. Thanks to these arrangements, ethno-sectarian violence dropped by 90 percent between June of 2007 and March of 2008. That's the result of political progress, not just counterinsurgency techniques.
