ALIEN NATION
Common Sense About
America's Immigration Disaster.
By Peter Brimelow.
327 pp. New York:
Random House. $24. 
IMMIGRATION is one of those issues that split American conservatism in two. In the libertarian wing of the conservative mansion can be found the only people anywhere in our political debate who favor completely open borders -- like Robert L. Bartley, the editor of The Wall Street Journal, and the economist Julian L. Simon. But the most intense opposition to immigration is also located in the conservative movement, over in the cultural and populist areas, whence came much of the impetus for California's Proposition 187, denying most government services to illegal immigrants. Although there is an anti-immigration tradition within liberalism too, in the main liberals seem to have settled into a sentimental, optimistic, celebratory view of immigrants.
It is this view that Peter Brimelow aims to pick mercilessly apart in "Alien Nation," which is an expanded version of a 1992 cover story in National Review and a book-length articulation of an anti-immigration position that has been bubbling up in more obscure places for several years. Mr. Brimelow, a senior editor of Forbes and National Review, treats his fellow conservatives who support immigration, especially Mr. Simon, as admirable but sadly mistaken -- while he goes after the liberals with scornful glee.
One by one he sets up the liberal arguments and knocks 'em down. The United States was not originally conceived of as a nation of immigrants, or even as multiethnic: Mr. Brimelow reminds us that the Declaration of Independence contains a rarely quoted attack on "the merciless Indian Savages." Rather than having been continuous, large-scale immigration to the United States has come in concentrated bursts, which have been followed by long, relatively immigration-free adjustment periods. Rather than being fundamentally multiethnic, the United States was, as late as 1960, just short of being 90 percent white (though how Hispanic Americans were counted at that time seems to be ambiguous).
Today, immigration is at one of its historic highs: counting illegals, well over two million people a year come to the United States, and, compared with past immigrants, far fewer of them ever leave. Immigration accounts for 37 percent of our population growth. Instead of generating economic growth and tax revenues, immigrants, Mr. Brimelow says, are a net drain on the country, crowding public schools, welfare rolls, jails and hospitals. And by their mere presence they exacerbate ethnic tension.
Mr. Brimelow describes this situation in the direst language imaginable: "There is no precedent for a sovereign country undergoing such a rapid and radical transformation of its ethnic character in the entire history of the world," he writes. Possibly the result will be "the snuffing out of the American nation -- like a candle in a gale." If that doesn't happen, at the very least, during the next century "American patriots will be fighting to salvage as much as possible from the shipwreck of their great republic."
Buried within the apocalyptic rhetoric is a much more specific complaint, namely, that the 1965 immigration law (the Immigration and Nationality Act Amendments) led to a much higher level of immigration than its authors anticipated and needs to be corrected. In an uncharacteristically calm passage, Mr. Brimelow suggests that legal immigration be cut by about two-thirds.
Passed at the height of the civil rights era, the 1965 law was meant to undo the Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924, which severely restricted immigration and also gave most of the slots to people from northern and western Europe. Much of contemporary conservatism revolves around the idea that some time in the 1960's the country took a disastrous wrong turn. Mr. Brimelow believes that the wrong turn was specifically the 1965 law, which he blames for ills ranging from the long-term slowdown of the economy to the creation of the urban underclass.
One could hold the position that the nondiscriminatory spirit of the 1965 law was laudable, but that its emphasis on admitting immigrants on the principle of family reunification as well as skills was misguided, and that the sheer number of people coming in now has moved beyond our capacity for absorption. Mr. Brimelow, however, takes an extra step. He wants to keep the immigration flow not just limited, and not just higher-skilled, but also mostly white. A waiting room of the Immigration and Naturalization Service reminds him of the New York subway: he finds each to be "an underworld that is not just teeming but also is almost entirely colored."
Most industrial nations are essentially monoethnic states that allow hardly any immigration at all. Mr. Brimelow admits that the United States has been more successfully multiethnic than any other country, but at bottom he just doesn't believe in the "American idea" that people here can transcend ethnicity through allegiance to abstract national principles like democracy and opportunity. What is required for the successful functioning of a nation, he insists, is "a link by blood."
Even "model minorities" that aren't white arouse Mr. Brimelow's suspicions. Reports of the success of Asian-Americans may be "just another immigration myth." Recently arrived Cubans "in fact participate heavily in welfare." West Indians? "It must be said that nowadays part of their enterprise goes into drug 'posses' and car-theft rings." Judging from a couple of asides, Mr. Brimelow doesn't consider Jews to meet his definition of "white" either; for example, he refers to the Clinton Administration as "a black-Hispanic-Jewish-minority white (Southerners used to call them 'scalawags') coalition." Elsewhere he points out that Jews played a major role in the passage of the hated 1965 immigration law. On the other hand, he calls it "a profound tragedy" that we don't relax our immigration restrictions to let in hundreds of thousands of eastern Europeans.
Mr. Brimelow is more an energetic pamphleteer than a reporter. He has done a good job of assembling printed material but, aside from one nocturnal visit to the Border Patrol station south of San Diego, he has not gone out in search of firsthand, irrefutable evidence that immigration actually is eating away at the very core of the country in the way he says it is. At one point he brings up a few pro-immigration arguments and then concludes, disarmingly, "I'm sure I'm right." The reason he's so sure is that it seems impossible to him that any society can remain strong for very long while allowing in large numbers of immigrants from a wide variety of ethnic groups.
When Mr. Brimelow tries to provide tangible details (as opposed to statistics) about the deteriorating fabric of life here caused by immigration, they often have an exaggerated or unproved feeling. He takes it as a given that immigrants no longer want to assimilate. In the near future, he says, Atlanta, Miami and San Antonio "will be communities as different from one another as any in the civilized world." Bilingual education is to him so obviously a program to keep people from learning English that he doesn't even bother to bring up and knock down the official rationale for it, which is that it encourages non-English speakers to stay in school while they learn the language. He views the creation of a secessionist Mexican-American state called Aztlan, a favorite cause of Southwestern student radicals in the 1960's, as a live possibility. Mr. Brimelow is right when he says that there is more risk from too much immigration than from too little, but he doesn't establish that the current situation justifies his level of alarm -- and the reason is that he finds the simple fact of substantial nonwhite immigration to be sufficiently alarming.
Several times in "Alien Nation" Mr. Brimelow mentions as one of the dangers of immigration that a significant percentage of immigrants will feel alienated from America -- the implication being that we ought not to let in too many people who are going to run down the country. This from a man who is himself an immigrant, from England, and who accuses "the American political elite" of "a species of treason"!
Mr. Brimelow's definition of "alienated" is political (it applies to complaints from the left but not the right) and his definition of "America" is racial. The amazing absence of euphemism and disingenuousness in his book helps make it clear why the immigration issue is so difficult: there is often a lot more in the opposition to immigration than straightforward policy-wonk concerns about whether we are letting in the right number of people.

HEADLINE: North Atlantic Fishing Pact Could Become World Model

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 16

 BODY:
In resolving their long-simmering confrontation over fishing rights in the North Atlantic this weekend, Canada and the European Union have reached an agreement that could serve as a model for preserving endangered fish stocks throughout the world.
The key to the accord, announced Saturday night in Ottawa and endorsed today in Brussels by European Union ambassadors, is enforcement. Independent monitors will be on every vessel fishing in disputed waters off Newfoundland to insure that conservation rules are followed. 
 The deal provides for verification of gear and catch records, steps up surveillance by satellite, sets minimum sizes to keep fish from being caught before they can reproduce and imposes stiff fines and other penalties for violations.
"Our objective was not to get a bigger slice of the pie," Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin of Canada told reporters. "Our objective was to insure that there would be pie, there would be resource for the future."
At issue was the survival of a fish known as turbot or Greenland halibut, one of the last species left in the Grand Banks fishing grounds after years of overfishing.
A three-year-old moratorium on cod fishing has left some 50,000 Canadian fishermen and fish plant workers unemployed, a crucial factor in Canada's unusual aggressiveness in the dispute.
The phenomenon has affected American fishermen as well. Last December the Commerce Department, for conservation reasons, ordered the closing of more than 6,000 square miles off the Massachusetts coast. Greenpeace International says 69 percent of the world's fish stocks are overfished or depleted.
For the first time in years, Canada, known for its role as an international peacekeeper, touched off a bilateral military confrontation.
"Obviously, Canadians are very reluctant to engage in conflict," said Robert Bothwell, professor of history at the University of Toronto. "But this was seen by most of the country as a crucial issue. And the saber-rattling certainly worked."
Spanish and Portuguese fishing boats were taking turbot beyond their internationally agreed quotas just outside Canada's 200-mile territorial waters. After repeated warnings, the Canadians seized a Spanish trawler, the Estai, on March 9, and cut the net of another Spanish boat, the Pescamaro Uno, on March 26.
Both actions in international waters touched off stiff protests from Spain and the 15-member European Union. But in Canada, opinion polls showed that the Government's toughness had the backing of 9 out of every 10 people interviewed. The conservation argument gave the exercise validity to many.
Government officials said today that the dispute was settled just as Fisheries Department vessels, backed by two armed navy vessels, were on their way to board and seize more Spanish trawlers. The Spanish boats were being protected by two armed Spanish Navy vessels.
The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, which like the European Union has 15 members, though not the same ones, was established 16 years ago to regulate the fisheries. But it lacks enforcement powers.
Putting inspectors on fishing boats and other provisions of the new agreement redresses that situation. Canada now may become the fisheries organization's chief enforcer.
The roots of the dispute were over the apportioning of shares of the organization's turbot quotas for this year. The European Union was upset that it had only received 12.5 percent of the 27,000-ton allotment, compared with nearly 60 percent for Canada. The Europeans unilaterally gave themselves 69 percent.
Under the agreement, Canada will get 10,000 of the 27,000 tons, or 37 percent. The other 6,000 tons of Canada's originally assigned catch goes to the European Union, which now has 10,000 tons. The remaining 7,000 tons goes to other members of the fisheries organization, including Russia and Japan.
But one Canadian concession allows the Europeans to haul in 5,000 tons in addition to what they have already caught this year, likely pushing them over the new 10,000-ton limit. Canada will also drop charges against the Spanish trawler Estai and refund a bond and bail money and the proceeds from the Estai's seized catch.
Fisheries Minister Tobin insisted that he was not declaring victory, but he was clearly happy with the new enforcement regime, which Canada had sought for months.
"It's a landmark agreement that will protect not only the Greenland halibut," he declared.
The settlement as well should improve the atmosphere for a broader agreement at the United Nations, which is drafting rules for so-called "straddling stocks" -- fish, like turbot and cod around Newfoundland, that swim inside and outside territorial waters.
A draft agreement reflecting what most observers said was progress in advancing international fisheries law was agreed to last week at the conclusion of the fifth round of the talks. Work on a final agreement is expected to begin at the United Nations on July 24.

HEADLINE: STRENGTH IS SEEN IN A U.S. EXPORT: LAW ENFORCEMENT

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
American law enforcement agencies are rapidly expanding overseas, deploying agents to dozens of countries in scores of joint investigations. Next week, the Clinton Administration is planning to open an F.B.I. international police training academy in Budapest, one of the most ambitious projects in this effort.
American law enforcement is being exported in response to the surge of international terrorism, narcotics trafficking, links between terrorists and drug dealers, illegal immigrant smuggling, financial fraud, corruption, arms smuggling, money laundering and the potential theft and sale of nuclear material and chemically or biologically hazardous substances. 
 Global crime is not new, nor are instances of international police cooperation. But international crime is increasingly being redefined as a national security issue at a time when there are threats to the stability of governments in the former Eastern bloc, of civilian populations in Japan and of national economies in the Andean nations. As a result, Government officials say the Clinton Administration is redirecting the manpower and resources of law enforcement and related agencies to confront international crime as never before.
Under statutes that provide Federal law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction in crimes against American citizens overseas, United States agents are working on terrorism cases in the Gaza Strip, Pakistan and the Philippines. In countries like Mexico, the Federal authorities are planning broader joint counter narcotics operations.
The new efforts involve not only traditional crime-fighting bureaucracies like the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration but also the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency. For the C.I.A. in particular, crime-fighting offers a way to try to justify its overseas networks and keep its budget intact in the post-cold-war world.
For the F.B.I., the initiatives represent a more direct expansion of its traditional activities. But while the new moves have generally found bipartisan support, some lawmakers have expressed skepticism about the emphasis on international issues, viewing it as a drain on domestic law enforcement. At a recent hearing, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a Democrat from South Carolina and a member of the appropriations subcommittee responsible for the F.B.I.'s budget, criticized the deployment of agents overseas.
"This bothers me," Mr. Hollings told Louis J. Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, at a recent hearing. "I need more agents down here on 14th Street," he said, referring to a crime-ridden neighborhood in the District of Columbia.
Mr. Freeh, who as a Federal prosecutor in the 1980's helped break up a vast Sicilian Mafia heroin ring with close cooperation from the Italian authorities, is a principal advocate of overseas law enforcement. Last year, Mr. Freeh opened an F.B.I. office in Moscow, one of an overseas network of 24 such offices, forward command posts for an increasingly global detective agency. He has also been a driving force behind the Budapest training academy, an operation to be housed in a building complex donated by the Hungarians, financed with State Department and F.B.I funds to be approved by Congress and modeled on the F.B.I. training academy in Quantico, Va.
Mr. Freeh said the 37 recent cases in which the authorities discovered illicit shipments of radioactive material transiting former East bloc countries provided a powerful rationale for the Budapest school.
"There couldn't be a better reason to have a centrally located school where we can develop a network of police partners in countries where we do not have now those relationships," he said in an interview.
The new efforts go far beyond existing international arrangements like Interpol, a worldwide police alliance that some law enforcement officials regard as little more than a communications network for alerting other countries about fugitive cases.
In recent months, the United States has begun a law enforcement project with Mexico to expand joint investigations with the Drug Enforcement Administration and the F.B.I. to stanch the torrent of Colombian cocaine shipped through Mexico.
The project is focused on four of the largest Mexican drug transportation cartels, patterned after the Colombian organizations, which haul drug shipments across the border and which are suspected of using a portion of the millions of dollars in illegal profits to pay off police and justice officials in Mexico.
In February in Pakistan, the capture of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the suspected ringleader of the World Trade Center bombing, opened a window on an international manhunt that took F.B.I. agents to three countries. The trail that led to Mr. Yousef in Pakistan began in Manila, where F.B.I. agents investigated what the authorities said was Mr. Yousef's involvement in a plot to bomb American jetliners. That connection sent agents to Tokyo to examine a Philippine airliner that had been bombed en route to Japan in what law enforcement officials suspect was a dry run by Mr. Yousef and his confederates.
In the Gaza Strip, F.B.I. agents are examining the suicide car bombing last Sunday that killed seven Israelis and an American student. Other agents are examining the killings of two United States Consulate workers in Karachi in March, while others have been sent to Japan study the implications for the United States of the poison-gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, also in March.
Even the suspects on the F.B.I.'s list of "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives" is taking on a international cast. When it was first introduced in 1950, the list included car thieves, kidnappers and bank robbers. Last month, the F.B.I. added three new names to its roster, all foreigners: Juan Garcia Abrego, the chieftain of Mexican drug cartel, and Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi and Lamen Kahlifa Fhimah, the two Libyan intelligence operatives wanted for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 that killed a total of 270 people in 1988 as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland.
An unofficial State Department survey completed this year found that eight American law enforcement agencies employ 1,649 people permanently assigned overseas. The Drug Enforcement Administration employs 499 agents in 50 countries, the United States Customs Service has 323 employees abroad and the F.B.I. has 121 employees overseas.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, a former Deputy Attorney General, announced in January that law enforcement would be a top foreign policy priority for the State Department, and assigned it to Robert S. Gelbard, the assistant secretary for narcotics and law enforcement affairs.
The Pentagon has provided aircraft and sophisticated radar gear to track drug shipments from South America and more recently has provided linguists and intelligence analysts to support antinarcotics efforts. Mr. Freeh, the F.B.I. Director, said in Congressional testimony last month that a total of 460 military personnel worked on 135 drug investigations -- often helping the authorities translate intercepted communications.
As part of the fight against illegal drugs, the Central Intelligence Agency has also expanded its role from assembling information about drug trafficking to providing law enforcement officials with intelligence on worldwide organized-crime groups and their vulnerabilities.
"With the growth of international crime, neither crime nor corruption are local matters anymore," said Jonathan M. Winer, a deputy assistant secretary of state for narcotics and law enforcement affairs.
"The weaknesses of a small haven in the Caribbean or Central Europe wind up being exploited by criminal organizations which can move money, people and goods from one end of the planet to the other regardless of how any government may feel about it. To protect ourselves, we need to help other nations develop the structural capacity to deter their exploitation by criminals."
In the former Eastern bloc, organized-crime groups that evolved from black-marketing organizations in the Soviet system had a powerful advantage over the civilian authorities in emerging democracies. The repressive tactics that controlled political dissent were also used to deter crime, and when the old regimes collapsed, so did the structures used to control lawlessness.
In some cases, the civilian authorities have had no training in specific areas like complex financial crimes.
"First you have to explain to them what a credit card is and then what a bank account is," said one law-enforcement official involved in training programs. "Then you start talking about wire transfers and Ponzi schemes and people start looking at you like an idiot."
The F.B.I. school, the outgrowth of trip that Mr. Freeh and other officials took to Eastern Europe a year ago, is in a former police academy in a residential section of Budapest. Eight-week classes will be taught by agents from American law-enforcement agencies and other European countries. The school is intended to educate middle managers of police agencies in Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet republics in such areas as criminal detection, managerial techniques and the democratic application of laws.

Heymann, the former Deputy Attorney General and State Department official who has worked on criminal justice projects in countries like South Africa and Guatemala, said that the overseas initiatives of American law-enforcement agencies were worthwhile, but that they also reflect an inevitable tendency among bureaucracies to expand their turf.
"Every domestic agency likes to have its own foreign policy," Mr. Heymann said. "It's the one situation where you do not have to actually make something work. All you have to do is teach and talk and deal."
He said advocates of the training academy should calibrate their hopes for the institution to the realities of the countries that will produce its students.
"What to American eyes appears to be lack of competence that can be solved with training is often really the problem that no one wants law enforcement to work," he said, suggesting that corruption may not be overcome by professional instruction.

U.S. Wealth Inequality Seen As Widest in Rich Nations
 New studies about the concentration of American wealth and income are showing that the United States is the most economically stratified of industrial nations.
 Federal Reserve figures show that the wealthiest 1 percent of American households -- with a net worth of at least $2.3 million each -- owned nearly 40 percent of the nation's wealth in 1989 and that the top 20 percent of Americans -- households worth $180,000 or more -- owned more than 80 percent of the country's wealth. A1. 
 Affluent Americans' taxes surged 16 percent in 1993, the first year of revisions pressed into law by President Clinton. D4.
 
Brazil's Economy Surges, Attracting U.S. Investors
 American investors and exporters are stampeding into Brazil. Trade liberalization and currency reform have produced a high-demand, low-inflation economy that is drawing imports worth billions and encouraging foreign investment. D5.
 
Fishing Agreement Is Reached
 Canada and the European Union reached agreement on fishing rights in the North Atlantic, defusing a long dispute. The pact could serve as a world model for preserving endangered fish supplies. A2.
 
The Dollar Falls Anew
 The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen in Tokyo early today, as traders said they were disappointed by a weekend meeting between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and Japan's Finance Minister. A2.
 
Big Rise in Global Deals
 International mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and minority investments rose nearly 40 percent in the first quarter, but there are signs that the recent increase in such activity may be peaking. D6.
 
End in Sight for Accountants
 While the coming of tax season is as reliable as death, getting through it without getting stressed seems impossible -- especially for accountants. This year, they dubbed it "the filing season from hell." B1.
 
A Computer in Your Mouth
 Adding computer technology to the dentist's X-ray machine, new systems are emerging that can provide sharp images of a patient's mouth while exposing patients to as little as 10 percent of the radiation they receive during film X-rays. The systems use a sensor that is placed in the mouth, where it reacts to the X-ray emission. D6.
 
A Business Model on the Web
 Even innovative publishers find that profits from "going on line" are very elusive. But glimmers of hope are emerging as the Internet and its navigators grow in popularity. Denise Caruso: Digital Commerce. D7.
 
3 Networks Are Happy
 ABC, NBC and Fox can all find some positive news in the end-of-season television ratings. Not so for CBS, which has toppled from the No. 1 position it held last season and lost ground in almost all categories. D8.
 
Few Worries About House & Garden
 The re-emergence of House & Garden magazine has aroused a great deal of curiosity but remarkably little concern among competitors in the already well-served area of home-decorating and design magazines. D8.
 
A Big Gulp of Milk And Advertising
 Some of the most prominent figures in the magazine industry have agreed to look somewhat silly in print, acting out their thanks to the milk industry for spending its entire advertising budget of $35 million in magazines. In return, the magazine executives are spending $500,000 for trade ads. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. D9.
 
Tepid Times for Tax Publisher

HEADLINE: U.S. Investors Stampede Into Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil

 BODY:
As clear as the telephone lights flashing furiously at the United States trade center switchboard here, American investors and exporters are stampeding into Brazil.
"Calls, faxes, visitors, requests -- it's doubled in six months," said Richard R. Ades, the harried director. "We had a brief drop with the Mexico crisis. Then it went right back up. In some areas, it's tripled." 
 In the last month, the Compaq Computer Corporation opened a new factory nearby capable of producing 400,000 personal computers a year, the Anheuser-Busch Companies started spending $105 million to build a brewery to market Budweiser beer to Brazilians, Caterpillar Inc. decided to move its Latin American headquarters to Sao Paulo, and the General Electric Company signed a contract to study constructing $9 billion worth of coal-fired power electricity plants in southern Brazil.
Suddenly, it is all coming together in Brazil. The trade liberalization that began several years ago, combined with July's currency reform, has produced a high-demand, low-inflation economy that is sucking in imports by the billions of dollars and encouraging an invasion of foreign investment. Even Mexico's financial collapse has had a positive ripple effect, turning foreign corporations toward Latin America's biggest economy, 155 million people.
"Everyone is coming in and positioning themselves," said John E. Mein, executive vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce here. Noting that Chamber membership had jumped 12 percent since January, he added: "It's not a matter of whether, but when and how."
And Brazil's new president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, wants more to come. On a visit to New York on Tuesday and Wednesday in which he will address hundreds of American executives, he is expected to announce that Brazil seeks $72 billion in public and private investment to expand highways, telephone service and hydroelectric power generation through the end of the decade. And he will be able to point to his country's recent economic successes to counter its long-standing reputation for protectionism and hyper-inflation.
It isn't all smooth sailing, to be sure. Rattled by Mexico, speculative investors have pulled the plug on Sao Paulo's stock market, depressing its value by a half in four months.
Wall Street portfolio managers are angry about Brazil because stock pickers gambled wrong last fall, heavily buying stocks of Brazil's state telephone and electricity companies. Privatization of these companies, never promised by Mr. Cardoso, now seems to be far off.
The trade balance has been running a deficit for several months and economists predict that 1994's trade surplus of $10.5 billion will shrink to $3 billion this year. Inflation is creeping back. The national Social Security system is bankrupt, and corrupt politicians in Sao Paulo have left Banespa, the state development bank, $20 billion in the red.
On top of all that, congressional gridlock is complicating efforts to change Brazil's Constitution to allow foreign investment in oil, mining and telecommunications.
But none of that heavily dents the upbeat mood in business. It is looking at the good news -- and there is plenty of that, too. Investment by foreign companies is surging to a projected $3.5 billion this year from $1.5 billion last year. Brazil's overall investment rate is expected to jump to 17 percent of gross national product this year from 15 percent last year. With tax receipts running at double their levels of last year, Government officials argue that Brazil's budget is in balance.
In 1995, for the third year in a row, Brazil is expected to record an economic growth rate of 5 percent.
Most important, consumer demand remains high, while inflation remains low. While some analysts predict that the inflation rate will increase to 3 percent a month from the current 1.5 percent, that still remains a far cry from the 50 percent level reached in the month before July's currency reform.
American economists calculate that the tariff hikes will affect only 4 percent of American exports. This year the United States is expected to record a trade surplus with Brazil, the first since the late 1960's.
"I'm betting on a surplus in 1995," said Mr. Ades, director of the United States Commercial Center here. Reflecting confidence in Brazil's trade opening, the United States Commerce department is to double its Brazil presence by August, opening trade offices in Belo Horizonte, Porto Alegre and Recife.
Despite the recent tariff hikes, the Government is clearly bent on accelerating Brazil's economic liberalization. To spur private investment in hydro power, it recently canceled 34 dam concessions that had languished unused. And even though the Constitution has yet to be amended, the Government is opening telecommunications to joint venture partnerships with the AT&T Corporation and others.
Hoping to earn $4 billion this year by revitalizing a lagging privatization program, the Government plans to sell two power companies, a bank, the national railroad and minority holdings in 13 chemical and petrochemical companies.
The threat of inflation remains. Demand is running so high that 50 percent of Sao Paulo industries in a recent survey said their factories were running at 81 to 100 percent capacity, 21 percent said they planned to expand their factories or build new ones, and 70 percent said they planned to invest in new machinery.
By another measure -- thirst for soda and beer -- the economy is really humming. In the first three months of this year, Coca-Cola's sales in Brazil ran 70 percent higher than during the same period in 1994. To meet the demand, Coca-Cola has imported this year from the United States 144 million cans of Coca-Cola, all printed in Portuguese.
Judging by the swelling flood of American investors here, companies have decided that now is the time to enter Latin America's largest economy.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is planning to open its first Brazilian store in May, and J. C. Penney has announced plans to open stores, too. Dairy Queen is looking for a master franchiser and TGI Friday's, a unit of the Carlson Companies, plans to open its first restaurant in Brazil in September. This year in Sao Paulo alone, Arby's is opening six restaurants, KFC, a unit of Pepsico, 20 restaurants and McDonald's 45 restaurants.
And, as the AMR Corporation's American Airlines increases its destinations in Brazil, Ramada, Marriott and ITT Sheraton are scouting for tourist hotel locations along Brazil's northeast coast.

HEADLINE: The Talk Of Detroit;
Detroit's Anxiety Over Chrysler Appears on the Rise

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 16

 BODY:
The company's rules were very clear when Chrysler's chairman and Detroit's mayor met with reporters last week to discuss plans for a new engine factory here: not a peep about the stunning bid by Kirk Kerkorian and Lee A. Iacocca to buy the auto maker.
But the mayor, Dennis W. Archer, would have none of it. 
 "I'm not going to be constrained by the same ground rules," he growled, taking the microphone. "I support Chrysler Corporation as it is, and I think they're doing a slam-bang job!"
Workers and government officials who gathered for the announcement whistled, clapped and whooped at the Mayor's challenge to Mr. Kerkorian, which crystalized anxieties that Chrysler employees and others in Detroit feel about the proposed takeover. After Chrysler's two brushes with bankruptcy during the 1980's, many here and throughout the industry view the auto maker with a certain worried, tender and proprietary pride: as the little company that could, then couldn't, could, couldn't, and now, after reporting record profits last year, most emphatically does.
But with auto sales slowing in the United States, Mr. Kerkorian's move could put Chrysler at risk again, a danger well understood in the factory town that is southeast Michigan.
Ralph Wehby, who works in construction, turned to the stranger beside him at a breakfast counter here on Saturday morning and asked the question that he and his wife, Barbara, were debating: "So, do you think Kerkorian really wants to buy Chrysler?"
The Wehbys and their friends, they said, were against a takeover, partly because Mr. Kerkorian has no track record in manufacturing. "Most people resent what he's doing," Mr. Wehby said. "They think it's manipulative."
Within Detroit's city limits, the auto companies no longer provide the jobs they once did, and some people are indifferent if not hostile to Chrysler's fate. But the auto makers still undergird the region's economy and are entwined with its history, which explains why auto parts gleam in glass cases at Detroit Metropolitan Airport and why, Mr. Wehby said, residents follow the companies' doings with the intensity, and sometimes the anguish, of sports fans.
"Our car companies are our Yankees," he said.
Within Chrysler, Mr. Kerkorian's proposal has sent a tremor of uneasiness through blue- and white-collar ranks.
"I don't know what the man's thinking," said Jim Dichiera, as he arrived for the graveyard shift at Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee plant here Thursday night. "Does he want to break the company up?"
Mr. Dichiera, who has worked for Chrysler for 30 years, said Mr. Iacocca's contributions while he was chairman were overrated. "Iacocca didn't do as much as people give him credit for," he said.
Mr. Iacocca's sterling image here already seems tarnished by his partnership with Mr. Kerkorian. Local television reports and newspapers stories have suggested that he is a hypocrite, recalling his contempt for corporate raiders during the 1980's. In an editorial cartoon, the Detroit Free Press portrayed Mr. Iacocca making peace signs with arms spread in a Nixonian pose as he declares, "I am not a raider."
But to others arriving for the late shift at the plant, on Detroit's east side, Mr. Iacocca's involvement was reassuring. "Iacocca's the one who put us back on the map, so you'd have to be satisfied with Iacocca involved in any transaction," said Charles Gaston, who helps to build Jeep Grand Cherokees. "I think it's a step in the right direction."
Many in the industry are speculating whether Mr. Iacocca, ever the restless visionary, has lent his name and committed his money to his old friend, Mr. Kerkorian, in hopes of pursuing a 20-year-old dream: topping General Motors by fusing Chrysler with foreign auto makers to create what he has often referred to as "Global Motors."
Within Chrysler's new glass-and-steel headquarters in Auburn Hills, north of here, executives hope Chrysler's board will fight the two men off. "It's such a bizarre thing that people aren't sure what to say, or even gossip about," said one executive, who asked not to be identified.
The company's top officers have appealed to underlings to put the battle out of their minds and focus on their jobs. Chrysler has said that the company is not for sale but that the board will evaluate any proposals.
So far, Mr. Kerkorian's associates have professed none of the traditional rationales for a takeover. The company is efficient, they say. They say Mr. Kerkorian is simply frustrated with Chrysler's low stock price. Auto stocks have fallen on fears that the economy is slowing.
That concern did not seem terribly noble to some observers. "Would an immediate enrichment of shareholders necessarily be in the company's best long-term interest?" The Free Press asked in an editorial.
On the television talk show "Back to Back," a local pundit, Chuck Moss, ridiculed the offer. "The question is whether or not the deal helps the management and the workers," he said. "I think it doesn't. I think it's terrible." He added that Chrysler "can become an economic cripple."
While the United Automobile Workers union has remained silent about the offer, the Canadian Auto Workers, whose members build many of Chrysler's most popular cars and mini-vans, reacted furiously.
"This move by speculators will not create jobs, it will not produce useful products, but it will risk diverting money out of Chrysler," Buzz Hargrove, the Canadian union's spirited president, said in a statement, adding that he was "mad as hell."
Executives at competing auto makers, flabbergasted by the possibile takeover, said one aspect of it clearly was not credible: Mr. Iacocca's repeated claim that he would serve only as a "consultant."
"The only thing that makes me laugh is Iacocca saying he would come in in an advisory role," said a top official at another Detroit auto maker, who would know.
"He never wanted to leave anyway," a Chrysler insider said testily, expressing a widely held opinion.
Mr. Iacocca did not return repeated telephone messages. But in an interview with USA Today that appeared on Friday, he denied being a corporate raider, repeated his desire to be only a consultant -- and took a swipe at Chrysler's current chairman and chief executive, Robert J. Eaton, for not improving the quality of Chrysler vehicles fast enough.
While repeatedly praising Chrysler's management, Alex Yemenidjian, an executive with Mr. Kerkorian's company, the Tracinda Corporation, suggested that Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. Iacocca would do things differently. "I think they're excellent," he said of the company, "and I think there's a level above that called fabulous." He said the new owners would explore "foreign strategic alliances," igniting speculation about Global Motors.
As Mr. Iacocca wrote in his best-selling, eponymous autobiography: "My dream was to put together a consortium of car companies in Europe, Japan, and the United States. Together, we'd create a major force that could challenge the dominance of General Motors." Of G. M., he wrote: "I envy their tremendous brute power."
And of being an adviser, he wrote: "I'm not the consultant type. I flourish where the action is."
While he was chairman, Mr. Iacacca sought to join Chrysler with Volkswagen, Fiat or Ford, and he bought the American Motors Corporation as well as a large stake in Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. Mr. Iacocca has denied wanting to resurrect Global Motors, but he has also declared Chrysler cannot compete without going global.
To buy the company, Mr. Kerkorian and Mr. Iacocca plan to keep their shares, and offer to buy all other stock for $55 a share. They are seeking $3 billion from other investors and $10 billion in borrowed money. And they intend to use $5.5 billion of Chrysler's own cash, which the chairman, Robert J. Eaton, has set aside to see the company through the next industry downturn.
Four credit rating agencies have said they may reduce Chrysler's debt rating, perhaps to junk bond level, if the deal goes through.
That possibility -- that excessive new debt could hobble the company -- clearly annoyed some Detroit residents. "You look at $10 billion in debt -- how long is it going to take to recoup that, even in good times?" said Eric Henley, an engineer who once worked for an auto parts supplier, as he paused on his bicycle near Chrysler's old headquarters in Highland Park, a tiny town surrounded by Detroit. Chrysler is leaving that cluster of buildings for its new offices in Auburn Hills.
"I just think it was an opportunity to push up the stock and make money for the principals," Mr. Henley said, adding that Chrysler is "a main constituent of the U.S. economy."
But the auto makers do not drive the Detroit economy as they once did; the health care industry is the city's largest private employer now. Even in announcing the new engine plant on Thursday, Mr. Eaton emphasized that it might not create jobs, since the company would shift workers there from other factories. "We're not making any promises whatsoever in that regard," he said.
As a result, some here are not too sentimental about Chrysler. "How many over here in Highland Park work for that company across the street?" asked Robert Jackson, gesturing at the headquarters. "Nobody. Maybe a janitor, but I doubt it."
Mr. Jackson, who said he was searching for work, added that he didn't care about the takeover attempt. "We're not going to get any money out of it," he said.

HEADLINE: Patents;
Tokyo Court Ruling Could Set Off New Trade Rift with the United States Over Protection of Patents

BYLINE: By Teresa Riordan 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
UNITED STATES patent experts are lamenting a little-publicized ruling made last month by an appeals court in Tokyo, warning that it may spark a new trade tiff between the United States and Japan. If approved by Japan's highest court, the decision could have detrimental consequences for industries like pharmaceuticals, where patent protection makes a big difference in how much a company can charge for its products.
The Tokyo High Court, in its Jap-Auto Products Inc. v. BBS Inc. decision on March 23 departed drastically from long-standing patent customs in most countries, including the United States and Japan. Patent protection traditionally is limited by something known as a "first-sale doctrine." In simplified terms, the inventor of a widget has the right to a royalty the first time the widget is sold. But the patent-holder relinquishes rights to a given widget once the object has been sold to another party. If the new widget owner decides to re-sell the widget to yet a third party, for example, the inventor is not entitled to a second royalty. 
 But the first-sale doctrine has historically applied only to commerce within the borders of the country that granted the patent. This prevents competitors from buying patented products in a country where they are sold cheaply because of lower economic standards or because of price regulation and then reselling them in a country where a similar patent was issued but where the product fetches a higher price.
The Tokyo court's decision concerns BBS, a German company that holds patents on aluminum hubcaps in both Germany and Japan. The court ruled that two companies, the Jap-Auto Products Company and the Lacimex Japan Company, could legitimately import the patented aluminum hubcaps made in Germany, which were cheaper, and then sell them at a higher price in Japan without violating BBS's Japanese patent.
The ruling, if it is upheld, would be good news for Japanese consumers, who would likely pay less money for brand-name goods. The strong yen would give added incentive for competitors to circumvent Japanese patents by importing cheaply transported products that have been inexpensively produced under the aegis of a patent in another country. But the ruling would likely play havoc with marketing strategies of companies whose pricing schedules are highly dependent on patents.
United States Patents Commissioner Bruce A. Lehman, who this week will be in Japan as part of a Congressional delegation, declined to comment on the case, which he is still reviewing. But Richard Maulsby, director of public affairs at the Patent Office, said that "we feel at this point that it's a very bad decision and it's certainly going to be appealed."
Hirotsuna Yamashita, director of the Washington office the Institute of Intellectual Property, a quasi-governmental Japanese agency, met with United States officials last week to discuss the case. However, Mr. Yamashita did not respond to a request for a comment.
 
Cough Stimulator Aids Quadraplegics
 Quadraplegics, whose nerve connections between the spinal cord and the rest of their bodies are severed, lose the ability to use many of their muscles -- not just those in their limbs. Often, for example, they lose the ability to use their stomach muscles and, consequently, are unable to cough on their own.
"Traditionally, someone with quadriplegia has to summon a caretaker who presses on the stomach to force a cough," said Robert J. Jaeger, a professor of medical engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. "Because they are unable to cough on their own, they are predisposed to respiratory complications, which are now the No. 1 cause of death among this population."
Mr. Jaeger and Dr. Elliot Roth, the medical director of the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, recently received their second patent on a "cough stimulator."
The device is the size of a personal cassette player and attaches to a belt around the wearer's waist. "But instead of wires coming out and going to your head phones, they connect to electrodes that attach to your stomach," Mr. Jaeger said.
When the wearer hits a switch, the electrodes, which are attached to the skin with an adhesive polymer, deliver electrical impulses, which stimulate the nerves and cause the stomach muscles to contract.
He and Dr. Roth, who are currently seeking approval for the device from the Food and Drug Administration, received patent 5,397,337.
 
Chiropractor's Idea: Pregnancy Cushion
 Peter J. Satto, a chiropractor in Baiting Hollow, N.Y., makes house calls. He said he got the idea for his "prone pregnancy cushions" when a patient got pregnant.
Patients who need the middle of their spines manipulated must lie on their stomachs, and chiropractic tables have adjustable midsections to accommodate pregnant women and others of large girth.
"But that table weighs something like a thousand pounds, and I needed something portable to take on house calls," Dr. Satto said. So he created a foot-thick foam cushion with removable sections that can be adjusted to accommodate most any belly.
"My patient said, 'Wow, this is really comfortable, could you leave this here so I can sleep on it?' " according to Dr. Satto. He recently patented the cushion and plans to market it to pregnant women.
Dr. Satto received patent 5,400,449.

HEADLINE: Global Business Activities Rose 40% in First Quarter

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
International mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and minority investments rose nearly 40 percent in the first quarter, but there are signs that the recent increase in such activity may be peaking.
The weaker dollar and continued industry consolidation in the United States have particularly driven this trend, according to a survey of international transaction activity to be released today by the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. 
 For the first time in several quarters, the United States slipped from its usual place as the No. 1 home for acquiring companies, because of stronger economic growth in Europe and the weakness of the dollar. Britain, whose marketing and food giants Grand Metropolitan and Cadbury Schweppes were aggressive acquirers, was the base for the most active companies in cross-border transactions during the first quarter, the new survey said.
In total, cross-border acquisitions, joint ventures and minority investments increased 39 percent, to $42.6 billion, in the first quarter from the first quarter of 1994, the survey said. Companies that make industrial machinery and equipment accounted for the most transactions: a total of 174 in the first quarter, while food companies accounted for the largest dollar volume of transactions.
Excluding joint ventures and minority investments, the volume of cross-border mergers and acquisitions rose a sharp 91 percent, to $27.7 billion, in the first three months of this year from $14.5 billion in the first quarter of 1994. The survey included all transactions in which the purchasing or investing company and the acquired company were based in different countries.
But the authors of the survey say the acquisition binge is coming to a head. "We may be entering into an advanced stage of the mergers and acquisitions wave," said Steve Blum, a partner with KPMG, "especially if the recent $23 billion bid for Chrysler is any indication."
Larger international mergers and acquisitions have been growing recently, the survey showed. There were nine cross-border acquisitions valued at more than $1 billion in the first quarter, up from six in the first three months of 1994.
The United States has been following the global trend. The volume of mergers and acquisitions in the United States totaled $73.25 billion in the first three months of the year, according to a survey released at the end of the first quarter by the Securities Data Company, a research consultant.
In the United States, the drug industry saw the most takeover activity, with volume for the first quarter exceeding $8 billion. Commercial banking and the food industry ranked the next-most-active sectors in the United States, Securities Data said.

$1 Million Question: What's in a Number?

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
THE zip codes may have to be changed, and the area codes, too. Maybe the public school designations, all to the number no one here can get enough of. That is number 45. The holiest number of them all, now that 23 has been left retired, now that the Bulls have reestablished themselves as contenders and resumed tormenting the hated Knicks, whom they drubbed 111-90 yesterday at the United Center.
Number 45's are everywhere in this Michael Jordan-crazed city, on jerseys, T-shirts, caps, placards, walls. Number 45 displays dominate downtown storefront windows. "And at guard, from North Carolina, number 45 . . ." And the fans erupt as if they've been promised a free Lexus for retaining their stub. 
 "The 45 jersey is what everyone wants," said Maribeth Tinnes, the manager and buyer for Sports & Novelty on Michigan Avenue. "The demand is unbelievable."
Meanwhile, my poor 5-year-old at home still has No. 23 stitched onto his jersey, front and back. There has been no rush to the mall, no unconditional surrender to that marketing autocracy, the Republic of Jordan. We are holdouts, a traditionalist, skeptical and 45-less household.
So far, so good. My son hasn't asked for "the 45," though I did notice a look of deflation when his 14-year-old cousin showed up with "the 45" on the night of their recent pilgrimage to Madison Square Garden to witness Jordan's now-legendary "55."
That, I must admit, ticked me off. I don't care who's reaping the profits, Jordan, the National Basketball Association or its licensing partners. This jersey madness amounts to consumer exploitation.
Only months ago did we actually purchase "the 23," which I considered quite the tribute to Jordan's marketing longevity and appeal. More than a year after Jordan's retirement-turned-sabbatical, here was a pre-kindergarten student of the game still dividing his video time between "Lion King" and "Threepeat," highlighting the Bulls' last championship run.
If we have seen poor Charles Smith get his shot blocked four times, we have seen it 400 times. And there hasn't been one time when father and son haven't beamed as "Threepeat" concluded with Jordan asking one of his children over the phone from Phoenix, "Who hit the winning shot?" Pause. "John Paxson?" Laugh. "O.K., let me speak to mama."
That came across as genuine, sweet. I'm not so sure about Jordan's explanation for changing his number from the one hanging from the United Center rafters to the one he wore while waving at curveballs last summer in Birmingham, Ala.
"I think he was sincere when he said it was because he wanted his father to have seen him play his last game in 23," said Tinnes. "But let's face it, from the money aspect, for the retailer, this is great. We kiss the ground he walks on."
Here's why: Champion, the company which produces all N.B.A. jerseys, can't make them fast enough. Tinnes gets calls from desperate out-of-state retailers. She has hundreds of orders on computer, while waiting for a new shipment of 50 dozen.
"They won't even make it to the rack," she said.
This is in no way intended to question the pain Jordan has endured since the horrendous crime that took James Jordan's life in August 1993. But the bottom line for basketball's one-man cottage industry always seems to be the bottom line, like when he draped an oversized American flag over his shoulder at the Barcelona Olympics to cover the logo of a rival sportswear company.
With Jordan, the corporate spin can make you dizzy. Back in early November, more than 20,000 Chicagoans paid good money for a tacky retirement party for Jordan, who, according to Bulls Coach Phil Jackson, was already hinting at a possible springtime return. And while the Bulls' owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, was ridiculing news media reports of the comeback, where was Jordan? Shooting a fresh batch of "I'm Back" commercial spots, of course.
When Jordan finally played, he said he hoped to promote the game better than the gimme-gimme Generation Xers had in his absence. His first message to the kids who, like Maribeth Tinnes, kiss the ground he walks on? Forget Derrick Coleman and Chris Webber, too. Be Like Mike. Make the switch to 45, as soon as the merchandise hits the stores.
"Actually, the day Michael announced he was coming back, the 23's flew off the racks," said Tinnes. "People still wanted them because they don't think Michael will be able to duplicate what he did wearing the 45."
That's what I'd tell any kid, including my own. I'd say that while number 45 is just getting his career off the ground, 23 was the greatest basketball player of all time. Wear it proudly and economically.

HEADLINE: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: Where the Chips May Fall Next;
As U.S. Manufacturers Enjoy The PC Boom, Asia Plans For the Next Big Market

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
American chip makers have never been cockier -- and that could make a downfall all the harder.
Since reclaiming the lead in the global semiconductor market two years ago from Japan, the United States chip industry has been on a roll, led by the Intel Corporation, whose stock has surged lately on expectations of an exceptionally strong earnings report this week. 
 American chip makers now control 43 percent of the $102 billion global market, compared with 40 percent for the Japanese. Part of the comeback is the result of United States trade pressure in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
But a lot of it stems from a strategic shift: Realizing that it didn't pay to compete with Japan on price alone for products like memory chips, American companies have learned to focus on designing chips with greater complexity and higher prices.
As a result, from small Silicon Valley boutiques like C-Cube Microsystems Inc. to giants like Intel -- which in 1992 surpassed NEC of Japan to become the world's largest chip maker -- American companies are now the acknowledged global leaders in the "logic" chips that give intelligence to everything from automobile antilock braking systems to powerful desktop computers.
"We can take the Japanese on head-to-head today and that's where the cockiness is coming from," said T. J. Rodgers, chairman of the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation in San Jose, Calif.
But even as Silicon Valley celebrates winning the last battle, a new fight is looming for which American chip makers may find themselves ill prepared.
To begin with, the enemy is no longer Japan alone. From South Korea to Taiwan to Singapore to Hong Kong, rivals have used cheap labor and government subsidies to turn out large volumes of low-priced chips. From less than 4 percent of the world chip market five years ago, the non-Japanese Asian producers are now closing in on a 10 percent market share, according to the research house Dataquest Inc. The region's chip revenue -- $10.1 billion in 1994 -- is growing at an annual rate of more than 60 percent.
What's more, these emerging powers are no longer content simply to crank out commodity memory chips that sell for as low as $20 each. Some are now gearing up to compete with American industry in logic chips, which can command prices of several hundred dollars. Rather than compete with Intel's Pentium or Motorola's Power PC chips for the personal computer market, the Asian companies are looking beyond PC's to the next generations of computerized devices that, within a few years, could outpace sales of personal computers.
Last week, for example, Hyundai, the South Korean industrial giant that is also that country's second-largest chip maker, announced plans for a new production line in its billion dollar semiconductor factory in Seoul to produce a new type of digital video chip called an MPEG decoder. MPEG stands for Motion Picture Experts Group, the international organization that sets the standard on which such chips are based.
The MPEG chip is a key component for the emerging generation of television set-top converter boxes, video-game players and digital video-disk machines. But the tiny American leader in this emerging market, C-Cube, of Milpitas, Calif., is simply a designer and does not even have its own factories.
No wonder many experts and even some American chip makers fear that the American industry may be setting itself up for its second great fall.
"I find it a little scary," said John Moussouris, founder of Microunity Systems Engineering Inc., a tiny new Silicon Valley company that is setting up a small factory there to produce its own digital-video chips. "It's a premature reversing of the tide of the battle."
 
Too Many Eggs In a Few Baskets?
 On the surface, there are few signs of trouble yet. Last October in San Jose, several thousand executives gathered for the annual dinner of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the American industry's chief trade group. At the same gathering only four years earlier, Intel's chairman, Andrew S. Grove, had warned that the United States was in danger of becoming a "technocolony," subservient to Japanese competitors that were building higher quality and cheaper microchips. This time, it was all toasts and backslapping.
"We were inhaling a little of our own smoke," concedes Fred Hoar, a longtime Silicon Valley publicist who was the master of ceremonies for the evening. Considering the steep downturn of the entire Japanese economy since 1990, and the steep rise in the yen, some of the market forces now working in the Americans' favor have little to do with their own prowess.
Moreover, American strength may rely too much on a few sturdy pillars. More than one-fifth of the United States' market share, for example, is held by a single company, Intel, which led the world last year with sales of $10.1 billion. And much of Intel's success in recent years can be traced to two factors that may or may not be sustainable: the explosive growth of the personal computer market the last few years, and the dominance of the Microsoft Corporation's Windows software for PC's. Windows requires a chip made by Intel or one of Intel's clone-making imitators -- all of which happen to be American companies, like Advanced Micro Devices, Cyrix and Nexgen.
"One is never beyond danger in business," said Mr. Grove of Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif. "A variety of bad news could come our way."
But Mr. Grove doesn't expect the bad news to entail a mass consumer defection from PC's.
Intel has ignored such potential emerging markets as video games and set-top boxes, betting heavily that consumers will continue to flock to new, improved versions of personal computers running Microsoft software. The company, for example, is now building a $1.3 billion plant in Chandler, Ariz., that it expects to start cranking out PC chips in 1997.
No one is predicting that the Intel-Microsoft axis will crumble anytime soon -- not when Microsoft is reporting record quarterly earnings, as it did last week. Still, many analysts do see much of chip-making's growth occurring elsewhere.
"In the next five years the center of gravity in the semiconductor industry will shift from Japan to Korea," said Keith Lobo, a longtime industry executive who is now president of Quickturn Design Systems Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., a maker of equipment used by chip designers. "And in the next 10 years it will probably shift from Korea to China."
 
Samsung Expanding Logic Chip Front
 Already, the Korean industry is making its mark, as Mr. Rodgers's $406 million-a-year company, Cypress Semiconductor, knows all too well. Cypress Semiconductor makes a type of specialized memory chip called a static RAM -- for random access memory -- that is used for the short-term information storage required by the fastest work stations and personal computers.
Today, Mr. Rodgers's dominant competitor is Samsung, a South Korean superpower that is the world's seventh-largest chip company and one of the fastest-growing. While most of the other world's top 10 chip makers had annual revenue growth of 20 to 30 percent, Samsung's revenue increased 61 percent, reaching $5 billion.
And Samsung is not satisfied simply to dominate the market for fast-memory chips. With low labor costs and easy access to capital at low interest rates subsized by the South Korean Government, Samsung, like its compatriot Hyundai, is racing to transform itself from a maker of commodity chips to a force in the logic-chip market. The same forces and ambitions are starting to propel other Asian chip makers, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Corporation and Chartered Semiconductor of Singapore.
For Samsung, the secret to winning the next round of chip wars is to concentrate on building logic chips for "smart" consumer products -- cellular phones, digital VCR's, personal digital assistants like Apple Computer's Newton Message Pad or even programmable microwave ovens.
"I don't need the Intel microprocessor to go into a speciality consumer market," said Keith MacDonald, senior vice president for sales and marketing for Samsung's American branch in San Jose. "The winner of the next generation is going to be consumer products that we don't even know we need today."
Already, logic chips represent 25 percent of Samsung's business, and the company expects them to reach 30 percent by 1996.
 
Manufacturers Out, But Designers Are In
 Changes in the structure of Silicon Valley itself in the last decade may also contribute to the vulnerabilty of the United States semiconductor industry. Even as most chip making has moved out of the Valley, the region has increasingly become the world's leading semiconductor design center. But the designing is not restricted to American companies. Most Asian chip companies -- including Samsung, NEC and Hitachi -- operate design studios in the Valley to tap its rich talent pool.
And there is a trend among overseas chip companies to send their most promising technologists to Silicon Valley for training, then bring them back home to develop a domestic chip-design industry. Last year, for example, one in three degree candidates in Stanford University's graduate school of engineering were foreign students.
But with profits so high, few in the Valley seem ready to acknowledge that a new semiconductor battle may lie ahead. And certainly no one is lobbying for the Government trade-policy weapons that the American industry insisted were so necessary in the last chip war.
"I just scratch my head," said one former Government trade official, who helped fight the semiconductor fight against the Japanese. The official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, admitted a certain bitterness over what he considers the short memory and short-sightedness of the American chip industry today.
"I look at these guys in their gold chains and their Bentleys," he said, "and I wonder what I was fighting for."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Asians Agree On Disclosure To Halt Crises

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: SANUR, Indonesia, April 16

 BODY:
Asia's finance ministers gingerly approached the question today of how to keep a Mexican-style crisis from happening in their own hemisphere, agreeing to disclose far more information to investors and cautioning against growing addicted to the kind of monetary policy that sent Mexico to the brink of insolvency.
American officials had expected to spend much of the day discussing the dollar's sharp decline against the Japanese yen and its effect on Asia. But at their meeting here, finance ministers from 18 Pacific Rim countries steered clear of a detailed discussion of the problem, leaving it to the United States and Japanese to sort out between themselves. 
 Instead, Mexico was clearly the subtext of much discussion at the all-day meeting, and the Asian ministers alternately sought to understand Mexico's mistakes and to convince themselves that similar problems were unlikely in their very different business cultures.
But in a communique at the end of the day, they committed themselves to taking steps to increase investor confidence in some of the world's most promising emerging markets. Their hope is that the steps could forestall the kind of instant loss of investor confidence, and the torrent of money escaping the country, that brought Mexico to its knees in December.
Just hours after the meeting concluded here on the resort island of Bali, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said that the United States would release an additional $3 billion in medium-term loans, called "swaps" because they involve the swapping of currencies, to help Mexico pay off many high-interest, short-term bonds that it issued last year in a vain effort to keep the country solvent.
The announcement was expected, and means that the Clinton Administration will have delivered approximately $8 billion of the $20 billion that it had committed to the Mexican bailout plan.
Mr. Rubin said that he saw reason to hope that the markets in Mexico were stabilizing and that the country was beginning to get back on its feet. "There are early signs that Mexico's policies and our support are beginning to have the desired effect," he said in a statement.
But Mexican officials say that it is still too early to tell whether the $20 billion package, along with commitments of another $30 billion in long and short-term aid from the International Monetary Fund and other nations, will prove enough to end the crisis. That depends on the speed with which international investors return to the Mexican market.
"It will probably be July before we can tell for sure which way things will go," one senior Mexican official said recently.
The meeting here of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, a group known as APEC that includes most Asian countries and Mexico, the United States and Canada, posed some difficult hurdles for Mr. Rubin.
The fall of the dollar against the yen has left many Asian countries wondering if American influence in the region will wane despite President Clinton's moves to shape APEC into a more powerful regional body. Surprisingly, though, there was little discussion of the dollar at the closed-door meetings today.
"I think there was a sense that this was for the U.S. and the Japanese to work out, and people were being polite in public," a participant said.
Moreover, some Asian countries have seen Mexico as a cautionary tale that free trade, deregulation and economic reform can move too fast, and the result can be a loss of economic control. Their preferred model is Japan, which in the last 40 years has used control over foreign investment as a key element of its effort to protect fledgling industries.
Mr. Rubin acknowledged the tradeoff in his comments to the group today, saying "there is an inherent tension between the reform process and the growth it engenders, on the one hand, and the risk of economic and financial instability on the other."
In their joint declaration, the finance ministers said they would attempt to steer clear of reliance on short-term investments that, as Mexico showed, can leave the country as quickly as they enter. Instead, they said they would seek "flows that generate real economic returns and hense are less susceptible to sudden reversal."
That chiefly means direct investment in factories and other facilities that are difficult to uproot if investors get nervous. Indonesia, China and several other large Asian nations have been focused on direct investment for years, and thus are considered less susceptible to what Mr. Rubin called a Mexico "contagion."
But like Mexico before the crisis, some Asian nations disclose relatively little reliable economic data that would warn investors of impending trouble. Under its agreement with Washington, Mexico is now making detailed weekly reports on a variety of economic data.
On the dollar, Mr. Rubin and his aides were cautiously optimistic after their meeting with Japan's finance minister, Masayoshi Takemura, that Tokyo was becoming convinced that the strength of the yen was a bigger problem than the weaknesss of the dollar; in fact, the dollar has stayed stable against most other currencies.
Early on Sunday, Mr. Takemura surprised Mr. Rubin by agreeing that a plan Japan proposed on Friday was too nonspecific and had failed to impress the markets. He promised more specific announcements in the next two months to convince the financial markets that Japan is serious about encouraging imports, a move that in theory should help weaken the yen.

HEADLINE: 25th Earth Day to Have a Political Accent

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 16

 BODY:
The environmental movement's most concerted campaign in a generation is about to get under way as environmental groups around the country work to use the 25th anniversary of Earth Day to rally opposition to a reversal of environmental legislation.
Trying to influence lawmakers of both parties as they meet with constituents during the Congressional recess, the groups are reviving all the usual organizing tools of a movement that came of age in 1970. They are also using new lobbying tactics that evolved after the first Earth Day, when millions of people took to the streets and helped persuade Congress to pass dozens of environmental laws in the ensuing decades. 
 With the Republicans who control Congress now trying to make fundamental changes in those laws to reduce regulatory costs, leaders of large environmental groups said they had two goals for the Earth Day celebrations on the weekend of April 22: to spread the word about Congressional plans to as wide an audience as possible, and to persuade lawmakers that mainstream public opinion does not support the environmental course Congress has taken.
It is an attempt fraught with political danger. If the public does not respond or if Congress senses greater strength among those who want the regulations changed, the environmental movement risks being relegated to the fringes of the debate just as legislation to roll back regulations comes before the Senate. That is where environmental groups believe they have the best chance of stopping provisions already passed by the House.
"This ultimately comes down to a battle for the center," said Geoffrey Garin, a pollster at Peter D. Hart Research Associates who helped design the environmentalists' campaign.
The Republican leadership, especially in the House, argues that last November's elections showed a shift away from what they call extremist environmental policies, and some Republicans are even using Earth Day as a forum for their agenda.
Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, for example, who is proposing major revisions to the Endangered Species Act and who successfully sponsored a bill to suspend existing environmental laws to increase logging on Federal land, has scheduled what he calls a "timber family hearing" in Olympia, Wash., the state capital, on April 22 to present a side of the debate that he says has been "largely unreported and untold."
But environmental groups say that most did not vote for a Republican Congress to turn back environmental regulations and do not recognize the extent of the environmental changes now moving through Congress.
More significant, they say, polling and focus groups suggest that the views of environmentalists are basically shared by mainstream voters, including independents. And, they say, voters become angry when they are told that corporate interest groups are lobbying for changes to environmental laws that would provide financial benefits to businesses.
Members of Congress, at home until after Earth Day, will be sure to notice the rallies and concerts, campus seminars, petition drives, letter-writing campaigns, phone calls and faxes and other lobbying efforts.
In keeping with the times, the advocates are also planning to make calls to radio commentary shows and send a blizzard of E-mail on the Internet and the major commercial on-line services.
Diane MacEachern, the president of Vanguard Communications, a public relations company that works on environmental causes, said that by putting a prototype "letter from home" on the on-line services and the World Wide Web, she hoped to mobilize new participants in the environmentalists' efforts.
"The language of the letter to Congress is not raise-your-fist language," she said. "It should resonate with people who may feel somewhat alienated from a more demonstrative environmental movement, but who still feel that clean air and water are important to them and their communities."
Several addresses, known as home pages, on the Intenet's World Wide Web carry information about the campaign. An example is the electronic address http://www.econet.apc.org:80/earthday/.
Compuserve, America Online, Prodigy and E-World are also carrying information about the campaign.
In some states there will also be television advertising, on a million-dollar scale that is modest by national standards but larger than environmental groups usually muster.
In an unusual concerted effort, environmental groups with millions of members have combined their mailing lists and their messages. Depending on their tax-exempt status, which can limit partisan political activities, some groups are focusing on broad educational themes while others are directly trying to influence Congress.
Rather than focusing on specific issues like wetlands or endangered species, their message is a broad one: Do not retreat from the commitment to environmental protection.
"We now have over 30 of the major national groups all galvanized to make Earth Day not only a celebration of 25 years of achievement, but also a statement that the surreptitious rollback going on in Congress cannot be allowed to succeed," said Fred Krupp, head of the Environmental Defense Fund and chairman of Earth Day activities for a committee of executives of large national organizations loosely known as the Green Group.
"You will see an outpouring before Earth Day, on Earth Day and after Earth Day that will affect the outcome in the Senate," he added. "It won't affect every senator, but it will affect the outcome."
The environmental groups are most immediately worried about risk-assessment legislation in the Senate that would subject major regulations to procedural barriers and cost-benefit analysis, giving industries new opportunities to challenge rules protecting public health, safety and the environment.
Opponents say that a strict version favored by industry groups, a measure that passed the House and is sponsored by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, would effectively undermine 25 years of environmental laws.
Brent Bahler, a spokesman for a pro-business group called Citizens for a Sound Economy, said the group was aware of the environmentalists' lobbying and would also be campaigning during the recess in support of the legislation. Radio advertisements to be broadcast in Washington beginning on Monday, he said, will emphasize that "the debate is not about dismantling regulations that protect the environment, but that the bills are formulated with balance in mind."
Environmentalists are focusing much of their advertising and lobbying campaign on states like Maine, with two moderate Republican Senators, and Nebraska, with two centrist Democrats -- states that also have the advantage of cheap television advertising and smaller populations.
Earth Day activities from coast to coast, including a concert and rally on the National Mall in Washington and demonstrations in many large cities, will urge voters to call members of Congress. There are thousands of smaller events planned for Earth Day; the Audubon Society alone has hundreds of chapters planning local events.
The strategy of the environmental groups was worked out in months of meetings and public opinion research after last November's elections. Before then, the groups were riven by dissent over the direction of the Earth Day anniversary, which would have been partly underwritten by corporations.
The corporate forces that have been lobbying for changes in environmental laws are now mainly viewed as a target, not a partner, of the environmentalists on Earth Day.
The anti-corporate theme is reflected in a petition being circulated by all the environmental groups that, along with calls to prevent pollution and to preserve wilderness areas, urges Congress to "end the giveaway of public assets," including subsidies for mining, logging and oil exploration, and to "get the big money out of politics" by enacting changes in campaign finance laws.

HEADLINE: Dollar Falls Sharply in Japan

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, April 17

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen in Tokyo today, and traders attributed the selloff to market disappointment during the weekend meeting of Japan's Finance Minister, Masayoshi Takemura, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin.
The dollar slid as low as 81.74 yen and then recovered somewhat after the Bank of Japan intervened to buy dollars for yen. By late morning the dollar was quoted at 82.07 yen, down from 83.30 late Friday in New York. 
 Meanwhile, Japanese stocks recovered from early selling set off by the plunge of the dollar. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 256 points, or 1.6 percent, at 16,304.15.
Mr. Takemura and Mr. Rubin met in Indonesia early Sunday on the fringes of a conference of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum's finance ministers.
 The United States and Japan jointly voiced concern about the steep decline of the dollar. But they did not announce fresh, strong action to rein in the surge of the yen against the dollar. On Friday the Bank of Japan cut its discount rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, to a record 1 percent, but the financial markets were mostly unimpressed.
 The rate cut was aimed at supporting a new economic package that the Japanese hoped would reduce the nation's huge trade surplus by stimulating the economy.
But the package failed to include targets for cutting the surplus or raising imports.

Dover Would Lower Sales Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: DOVER

 BODY:
Some municipalities want to raise taxes. Not Dover. It wants to cut its 6 percent sales tax in half. "We have asked the state to declare us an urban enterprise zone and let our retailers charge only 3 percent tax," said Mayor Stephen Shukailo. "We would attract more customers. And instead of sending the sales tax we collect to the state, we would spend it to upgrade the exteriors of our businesses."
Mr. Shukailo said Dover suffers from an image problem. The town's per capita income is the lowest in Morris County, and its unemployment rate is 10.4 percent. DAVID STOUT

HEADLINE: Gap in Wealth In U.S. Called Widest in West

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 12

 BODY:
New studies on the growing concentration of American wealth and income challenge a cherished part of the country's self-image: They show that rather than being an egalitarian society, the United States has become the most economically stratified of industrial nations.
Even traditional class societies like Britain, which have inherited large differences in income and wealth over centuries, going back to feudal times, now have greater economic equality than the United States, according to the latest economic and statistical research, much of which is to be published soon. 
 Economic inequality has been rising in the United States since the 1970's. Since 1992, when Bill Clinton charged that Republican tax cuts in the 1980's had broadened the gap between the rich and the middle class, it has become more sharply focused as a political issue.
Many of the new studies are based on the data available then, but provide new analyses that coincide with a vigorous debate in Congress over provisions in the Republican Contract With America.
Indeed, the drive by Republicans to reduce Federal welfare programs and cut taxes is expected, at least in the short term, to widen disparities between rich and poor.
Federal Reserve figures from 1989, the most recent available, show that the richest 1 percent of American households -- with net worth of at least $2.3 million each -- have nearly 40 percent of the nation's wealth. By contrast, the richest 1 percent of the British population has about 18 percent of the wealth there -- down from 59 percent in the early 1920's.
Further down the scale, the top 20 percent of Americans -- households worth $180,000 or more -- have more than 80 percent of the country's wealth, a figure higher than in other industrial nations.
Income statistics are similarly skewed. At the bottom end of the scale, the lowest-earning 20 percent of Americans earn only 5.7 percent of all the after-tax income paid to individuals in the United States each year. In Finland, a nation with an exceptionally even distribution of income, the lowest-earning 20 percent receive 10.8 percent of such income.
The top 20 percent of American households in terms of annual income -- $55,000 or more -- have 55 percent of all after-tax income.
"We are the most unequal industrialized country in terms of income and wealth," said Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, "and we're growing more unequal faster than the other industrialized countries." In coming months, he will publish two papers that compare patterns of wealth in Western countries.
Liberal social scientists worry about poor people's shrinking share of the nation's resources, and the consequences in terms of economic performance and social tension.
Margaret Weir, a senior fellow in government studies at the Brookings Institution, called the higher concentration of incomes and wealth "quite divisive," especially in a country where the political system requires so much campaign money.
"It tilts the political system toward those who have more resources," she said, adding that financial extremes also undermined the "sense of community and commonality of purpose."
Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, observed, "When you have a child poverty rate that is four times the average of Western European countries that are our principal industrial competitors, and when those children are a significant part of our future work force, you have to worry about the competitive effects as well as the social-fabric effects."
Conservatives have tended to pay less attention to rising inequality, and some express skepticism about the statistics or their significance. Marvin H. Kosters, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute here, said he thought the gap, as measured, was being used as a false villain. "I think we have important sociological problems," he said, "but I don't think this gets at it all that well."
Murray L. Weidenbaum, professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan in 1981-82, said he thought the measures tended to overstate the gap by overlooking Government programs like food stamps or Medicaid.
Still, he said he was uncomfortable with greater concentration of wealth "unless there's a rapid turnover" in which "this year's losers will be next year's winners."
He noted that many wealthy people have bad years and that a lot of middle-class people, like graduate students, briefly look statistically as if they are starving. The United States, he said, has "very substantial mobility."
Mr. Weidenbaum said he doubted that the Republican agenda, if it became law, would have any substantial effect on the disparity in wealth. He added that the static effect might be somewhat more concentration, but that the dynamic effect would produce a bigger economic pool for all to share.
There is little agreement as to why inequality is rising faster in the United States than elsewhere. Explanations include falling wages for unskilled workers as automation spreads, low tax rates on the rich during the 1980's, relatively low minimum wages, the decline of trade unions and the rapid rise in the 1980's of the stock and bond markets, in which rich people are heavily invested.
The most common view seems to be that Americans have witnessed the more extreme effects of several international trends toward greater economic inequality. "While many of the countries experienced many pieces of inequality, the United States is the one country that seems to have experienced all the pieces," said Peter T. Gottschalk, an economics professor at Boston College.
Mr. Wolff's papers are based on data that run through 1989. But Census Bureau figures show that the trend toward greater income inequality continued during the first year of the Clinton Administration. While incomes rose for the most affluent two-fifths of the nation's households as the economy expanded in 1993, the rest of the country suffered from falling incomes, after adjustments for inflation.
"U.S. wage distribution is more unequal than other countries and we do less in terms of tax and transfer policy" to cushion the disparities, said Timothy M. Smeeding, an American who is director of the Luxembourg Income Study Project. Mr. Smeeding is preparing two papers drawing international comparisons of income.
The project, based in Walferdange, Luxembourg, is supported by the national science foundations of nearly two dozen countries including the United States, and has gathered Government data from the member nations showing that the United States has the greatest inequalities in income distribution.
Most economists believe that wealth and income are more concentrated in the United States than in Japan. But while data show that wealth is more equitably distributed in Japan, the Government there has not released enough detailed information to make statistical comparisons possible.
Anecdotal information strongly suggests that Japan has a more equal distribution of income. The chief executives of Japanese manufacturing companies, for example, make an average of 10 times the pay of their workers. American chief executives in manufacturing are paid 25 times as much, according to a 1994 study by Towers Perrin, a management-consulting company.
Professor Gottschalk said Canada and the Netherlands seemed to have minimized disparities involving higher wages for highly skilled workers, because the number of college graduates over all had sharply increased in those countries. But other trends toward inequality, like a widening wage gap between experienced and inexperienced workers, had affected them, as well.
When American inequality began to increase is also debated, with various economists putting it anywhere from the mid-1970's to the early 1980's. The double-digit inflation and stock market slumps that followed the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973 temporarily produced greater equality, as the stocks and bonds of the rich lost value. But that effect gradually disappeared, with Mr. Wolff's data showing that the concentration of wealth among the richest had consistently exceeded Britain's level since 1978. British records are especially complete, making such comparisons easier.
The comparison with Britain is all the more striking because President Reagan and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pursued broadly similar economic policies in the 1980's.
Rising housing prices have increased the holdings of the British middle class and limited the growth in inequality there. But Mr. Gottschalk said most evidence indicated that income inequality had risen much faster in the United States and Britain than elsewhere.
Richard V. Burkhauser, an economics professor at Syracuse University, said that in studying thousands of people in Germany and the United States over seven-year periods in the 1980's, he found that the two countries had roughly the same level of social mobility.
As part of the Contract With America's tax provisions, the House on April 5 approved an increase in individuals' exemptions from the estate tax. By the Treasury's estimate, this would cut in half the number of people subject to the tax -- to one-half of 1 percent of the estates of those dying each year.
Republicans have argued that the overall tax-cut provisions would reduce annual tax bills by roughly equal percentages for rich and poor. Democrats say that because the annual tax bills of rich Americans are much larger, reducing them by about the same percentage means that most of the money would go to the rich rather than the poor or the middle class, further concentrating wealth and income.
 In addition, the chart misstated France's ranking in an index of wealth concentration. The index's rankings ran from 0 (meaning everyone has the same amount of wealth) to 1 (a theoretical case in which only one person has all the wealth). France's ranking was 0.30, placing it between Italy and Canada; it was not 0.25, which placed it between Germany and Finland.

A Federal appeals court yesterday threw out the settlement of a huge class-action lawsuit that would have given $1,000 coupons to owners of 5.7 million older General Motors pickup trucks that are suspected of posing a fire hazard in sideways crashes.
In its ruling, the three-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, said the settlement was worth little to consumers and agreed with the arguments of opponents of the deal, who had called it a "sophisticated marketing program" aimed at selling more G.M. trucks. 
 The coupons would be good only for the purchase of G.M. pickups, which can cost $7,000 to $33,000.
The ruling, which returns the case to a lower court, is the latest step in a long dispute involving full-size Chevrolet and GMC pickups made between 1973 and 1987, which are equipped with side-saddle gas tanks. Safety advocates have said the tanks, which are outside the vehicle frames, are a fire hazard in sideways collisions, an assertion that G.M. has denied.
The car maker's offices were closed yesterday for the Easter Holiday, and a G.M. spokesman reached at home, Ed Lechtzin, said the company had not had time to review and consider the court's lengthy opinion.
"Until we have had time to study the opinion it would not be proper to speculate on the possible outcomes in this matter," he said.
Clarence Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, which appealed the settlement, said, "The court has recognized that the settlement was worthless and that the only beneficiaries of it were G.M. and the lawyers."
The ruling struck down an agreement approved by a Federal District Court in Philadelphia in December 1993. The appeals panel held that the $1,000 coupons would be virtually worthless to poorer truck owners and rental companies financially unable to buy new pickups.
The panel said the lower court had failed to investigate the value of the coupons adequately.
The members of the panel were Judge Edward R. Becker, who wrote the opinion, Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Judge John R. Gibson of the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis. The Philadelphia case had consolidated 34 class-action lawsuits and covered truck owners in 49 states around the country and the District of Columbia.
A similar program involving coupons had been approved by a state court in Texas to resolve the claims on the gas tanks by 645,000 owners of older G.M. pickups in that state. But last year by a Texas appeals court rejected that settlement on much the same basis as Federal appeals court did yesterday. The Texas Supreme Court is now reviewing an appeal brought by both G.M. and plaintiffs who agreed to the settlement.
In October, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said a Federal inquiry had concluded that the trucks posed a fire hazard and sharply criticized former G.M. officials for apparently knowing the risks but selling the vehicles anyway
"G.M. management in place at that time appears to have made a decision to favoring sales ahead of safety." Mr. Pena said at the time.
But then in a turnabout, Mr. Pena dropped a threat to try and force G.M. to recall the pickups when the car maker agreed a month later to spend about $51 million on car safety and research programs.
The Government's decision was viewed as a big victory for G.M., which averted both a potentially lengthy court battle and possible payments of over $1 billion to fix and repair the trucks. Had the Transportation Department issued a formal finding that the trucks had a safety defect, the families of people killed in crashes involving the pickups could have been given powerful ammunition to use in lawsuits against the company.
The proposed coupon plan was intended to cover only economic losses that might result from any reduction in the trucks' resale value. Those participating in the proposed settlement could still seek damages for further injuries.
Analysts have said that if all the owners took advantage of the $1,000 offer, the company's obligations would total $5.7 billion. But G.M. has said that the settlement will not be a financial drain on the company.

HEADLINE: Shellshocked by Yen, Companies In Japan Still Find Ways to Cope

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 17

 BODY:
The Mazda Motor Corporation is shutting its Japanese factories for two days this month and two next month to cut production of cars bound for the United States that it can no longer sell. Mitsubishi Materials is shutting a zinc smelter in northern Japan. Sumitomo Metal Industries, a steelmaker, is planning to eliminate 1,500 more people from its work force by March 1997.
These measures, which are at least partly due to the sharp appreciation of the Japanese yen, is beginning to mount. Economists and even Government officials say the recent surge in the exchange value of the yen threatens to send Japan back into a recession from which it was just emerging after three years. The pressure is expected to worsen now that the Government's emergency economic plan, announced Friday, has failed to halt the yen's rise. 
 In New York today, the dollar fell to a record low for the end of a trading session, selling at 82 to the dollar, down from 83.30 on Friday. It also traded at a record low against the mark. [Page D22.]
Japanese corporate executives seem shellshocked by market trends over which they have no control.
The nation's big companies have become adept at dealing with the yen's rise over 20 years. They continue to cut costs, move production offshore, buy imported parts and, where possible, raise the price of their exports. From all evidence, these blue-chip companies should be able to adjust, though not without some pain, in the next year or two.
"There are no smart short cuts that will effectively cope with the situation," Yoshihiro Wada, Mazda's president, said last week, adding that his company had no other way but to speed the introduction of basic countermeasures.
Corporate Japan has been adjusting more or less continuously as the yen has strengthened from the early 1970's, when 360 of them made up a dollar. By the end of last year, many big Japanese companies were getting accustomed to an exchange rate of 100 yen to the dollar, even though they had bitterly complained two years earlier, when the dollar began a fall from 125 yen.
With the economies of Asia and the United States growing strongly, there has been room for Japanese exports, even as they become more expensive.
And some segments of Japan's domestic market, at least partly insulated from foreign competition, are growing strongly, taking some of the pressure off companies.
Auto sales, for instance, were up 11.2 percent in March over March 1994, as consumers replaced cars they bought in the late 1980's boom years. Personal computer sales rose 35.5 percent last year. With increasing domestic demand and cost cuts made during the recession, many big Japanese companies will see profit increase despite the strong yen.
A survey of 200 blue-chip companies by Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial newspaper, found that the companies expected profit to increase 5.1 percent this fiscal year, even if the yen traded at 85 to the dollar. If the yen moved to 80 to the dollar, profit would decline, but only by 1.2 percent.
Much of the assembly of low value-added consumer products, like television sets, has already moved out of Japan. Much of what is left of Japan's exports are high-value components and machinery and products in which the Japanese face little competition, like flat-panel displays for computer screens, some types of lithography equipment for making computer chips and laser-printer mechanisms.
Such components can take more time to replace than finished consumer products. Given the strong yen, for instance, the number of complete automobiles that Mitsubishi Motors has been selling to the Chrysler Corporation plummeted to 16,000 in the last fiscal year from 73,000 two years earlier. But Mitsubishi is still exporting 400,000 engines a year to Chrysler, a number that has not changed much because it is hard for Chrysler to find an alternative.
For that reason, Japan's exports seem to be showing less sensitivity to changes in exchange rates. Peter Morgan, an economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, estimates that a 10 percent rise in the yen will reduce Japanese export volume only 2 percent. Last year, despite the rise of the yen, exports rose 9.3 percent in dollar terms and stayed about even when measured in yen.
Still, monopolies are not absolute and many companies are reluctant to raise prices on exports.
When Kazuo Inamori, chairman of the Kyocera Corporation, said last month that his company would raise prices 10 percent and urged other Japanese concerns to do the same, he was met with derision. "That's easy for you to say," many other Japanese executives in effect responded. Kyocera supplies more than half the world market for ceramic packages for computer chips, giving it near-monopoly power.
Most other Japanese companies have not raised prices or have done so to a minor degree. Their executive declare that the yen's recent surge might be only temporary, but beyond that, they are afraid of losing market share.
Toyota two weeks ago raised prices in the United States by an average of only three-tenths of 1 percent, far less than the rise in the value of the yen. Mazda raised its American an average of 2.2 percent on April 1.
Such a failure to keep pace with the yen's surge subjects the companies to the threat of anti-dumping suits because the price of their goods in the United States is now less than in Japan. But some officials say that American companies must prove they are being injured to win a dumping lawsuit, something that may well be difficult for American auto makers to prove.
"American companies are enjoying their best profit, so there is no way for them to file a dumping case," said Taizo Yokoyama, a managing director of Mitsubishi Motors.
Even in industries in which Japan is strong, there is reluctance to raise prices. The Sharp Corporation, the world leader in liquid crystal displays, said it was considering raising prices for such products, but had not yet decided to do so. A factor working against such a price increase is that production volume for these screens is sharply increasing, which tends to lower costs, offsetting upward pricing pressure from the yen.
Japan's steel companies, mired in red ink, are still expected to recover their profits despite the yen, said Peter D. Edwards, a senior analyst at Schroder Securities in Tokyo. In steelmaking, capital costs and the efficiency of factories matters more than the exchange rates, he said. And for some types of flat steel products, prices have risen sharply because of strong demand, offsetting the effects of the yen.
Some analysts say that the high yen, rather than being a burden, is a blessing in disguise for Japanese companies. It has forced them to move factories to other parts of East Asia -- and has made it easier for them to pay for such factories. That puts the Japanese companies in a strong position as these countries become the fastest-growing markets for cars, videocassette recorders and other products.
But the ability of big companies to cope does not necessarily mean that Japan's broad economy will do as well. An electronics company that makes its products in Malaysia might be more competitive against its American and European rivals than if it made them in high-cost Japan. But the overall economy will not be better off because some workers will have lost their jobs.
Moreover, the big threat to the Japanese economy comes not only from reduced exports but also from increased imports at low prices. Daiei, a major supermarket chain, for instance, last year began selling imported Belgian beer for 128 yen a can, compared with about 225 yen for Japanese-brewed beers.
Such imports put pressure on domestic producers to lower their prices -- and their revenue and profit. Fear of such a deflationary spiral is one reason that Japanese bureaucrats, while espousing deregulation, are hesitant to disband all barriers and let imports flood in.
So far, unemployment remains at a rate of 2.9 percent, and this country's lifetime employment system, though frayed, is still intact. But people wonder how long that can go on. The Sony Corporation, for instance, has moved 42 percent of its output overseas and is aiming for 50 percent. Yet it has kept its Japanese factories operating.
"If we shut down a factory, the impact on the local community is enormous," Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's new president, said recently. So the company must instead slim down on a "very long-term diet." Mr. Idei said, though, that if the yen continued to get stronger, "I think we have to face real difficult decisions, more drastic actions."
While big companies can cope, the task has been much harder for little companies that usually supply parts to the big ones. These businesses have been forced to sharply cut their prices. And many of them lack the wherewithal to move overseas when their big customers do.
Hiroshi Kishida, who runs a small Tokyo metalworking plant that mainly makes parts for photocopiers, said orders had dropped to half of peak levels and he had borrowed money to stay in business. "Orders don't come to us because the big companies have moved production overseas," he said.

Chase Reports Profit Dip in First Quarter

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation reported yesterday that its first-quarter profit slid 28 percent as a result of losses in Latin American markets. The company, which is coming under increased pressure from some shareholders to improve its stock price, also said it would step up a cost-cutting campaign.
Other big banks that earn most of their income from domestic businesses fared better as borrowing rose. 
 The Nationsbank Corporation's earnings rose 6 percent, First Interstate Bancorp's profits jumped 15 percent, the Bank of New York Company's profits rose nearly 20 percent and the First Chicago Corporation's profits were flat.
Bucking the trend, the PNC Bank Corporation said earnings fell nearly 39 percent because of losses on investment sales.
Chase Manhattan, the nation's sixth-largest bank, said its trading revenue fell 58 percent, to $94 million, compared with that in the first quarter of 1994, but it was up 22 percent from the fourth quarter -- better than analysts had expected.
Chase said that it cut 1,640 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, in the first quarter and that it expected to cut costs further through the end of the year. It said that its work force now totaled 35,050 employees.
 Early this month, the Heine Securities Corporation, a New Jersey money management firm, disclosed that it had acquired a 6.1 percent stake in Chase, prompting speculation that the banking company may be acquired.
Chase said it reduced some positions in emerging-market debt, which caused a $92 million loss. The securities plunged in value with the Mexican financial crisis that erupted in late December.
The bank earned $260 million, or $1.29 a share, compared with $364 million, or $1.80 a share, in the first quarter of 1994. The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
Nationsbank, the No. 4 bank, said its average loans rose 13 percent, to $103.8 billion, compared with last year, an increase Nationsbank attributed to rising business and homeowner borrowing.
Net interest income -- that is, the interest from loans and investments minus what the bank pays for deposits and its own borrowings -- rose $25 million, to $1.34 billion.
Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, N.C., earned $443 million, or $1.60 a share, compared with $417 million, or $1.52 a share, for the comparable period a year ago.
First Interstate said real estate loans rose 77 percent and consumer loans were up 13 percent from a year ago. Over all, loans increased 27 percent, to $9.6 billion.
In a sign that the Los Angeles-based bank is putting its bad loans problems behind it, First Interstate did not set funds aside for possible loan losses, allowing more money to flow to the bottom line.
First Interstate earned $212 million, or $2.66 a share, compared with $169.4 million, including a one-time gain of $14.7 million, or $2.21 a share, in the first quarter a year earlier.
The Bank of New York said credit card loans were up 21 percent, to $7.6 billion, and the number of card accounts increased by 16 percent, to 5.7 million, from 4.9 million a year ago.
Securities-processing fees rose 11 percent, to $98 million, from $88 million in the first quarter of 1994.
Bank of New York earned $213 million, or $1.12 a share, compared with $178 million, or 93 cents, in the quarter a year earlier.
First Chicago said its credit card business had strong growth in the quarter. Card charges rose 18 percent, to $12.3 billion, and fees were up 4 percent, to $191.2 million.
Trading profits totaled $50.4 million, compared with a $25 million loss last year.
First Chicago earned $195 million, or $2.03 a share, compared with $194 million, or $2.05 a share, a year ago.
PNC Bank said it lost nearly $41 million on sales of interest rate-sensitive securities. That, combined with higher borrowing costs and interest payouts on deposits, drove net interest income down 9 percent, to $392.2 million. PNC earned $125.7 million, or 54 cents a share, compared with $205.7 million, or 86 cents a share, in the quarter last year.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Debate on Flat Tax Revives Simplicity vs. Fairness Issue

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 17

 BODY:
Three years ago, when Edmund G. Brown Jr. made his proposal for a flat tax the keystone of his campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination, the idea fell -- well -- flat.
Bill Clinton mocked it as a sop to the rich that would wreck Social Security and inflict a crushing blow to the poor. In New York, where Mr. Brown finished third in the primary behind Mr. Clinton and Paul S. Tsongas, voters who were interviewed after they left their polling places were decidedly unenthusiastic about Mr. Brown's tax plan. 
 Now, in yet another indication of how the political winds in the country have shifted, several candidates for the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination and some of the top Republican leaders in Congress are advocating replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tax.
People who spent the weekend struggling to meet today's deadline for filing 1994 income tax returns should not get their hopes too high. There is almost no chance that the current tax system, with all its forms and tax brackets, will be overhauled this year or next. But if a Republican is elected President next year, the prospects for a flat tax will be much improved.
Even President Clinton, while still not a champion of the idea, is taking a much less strident tone about it than he did during the heady days of the New York primary.
"Anything we can do to simplify the tax code, consistent with fairness and not exploding the deficit, we ought to do," the President told interviewers on CNN last week. "The first time I heard about a flat tax, I thought it sounded like a pretty good idea."
But Mr. Clinton went on to say, "Every analysis that I have seen done indicates that the flat tax proposals that are out there now will increase the deficit and increase taxes on all Americans with incomes of under $200,000 a year."
Meantime, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, who seems to delight in taking positions on economic matters at odds with the President, has said that he is working on, if not a flat tax, then a flatter one than what the nation has now.
The general idea of a flat tax is that instead of taxpayers paying a larger percentage of their income in taxes as their income grows (up to nearly 40 percent of taxable income now for the wealthiest Americans), everyone would pay the same rate. Most, if not all, deductions would be abolished.
Rather than struggling every April with columns of numbers and pages of forms, taxpayers theoretically could simply fill out a postcard with their income on one line, minus personal exemptions for themselves and their dependents on the next line, times the tax rate on the third line and the resulting tax they owed on the fourth.
There is no mystery why the idea has taken root. Almost everyone agrees that the current tax system is wrongheaded.
For companies and self-employed people, the Internal Revenue Code can be frustratingly complicated and frightfully expensive to comply with. The tax law rewards consumption and penalizes saving, exactly the opposite of the nation's economic interest. And in many instances it is patently unfair: to some working married couples, for instance, who pay much more in taxes than do unmarried contemporaries who cohabit and file separate returns.
But in many respects a flat tax is like universal health insurance, a balanced budget, gun control and mandatory prison sentences. The more the layers of the problem are peeled away, the less attractive the solution becomes. That, politicians find, is often the case with seemingly simple solutions to hideously complicated problems.
As a rule in tax policy, simplicity and fairness are at odds with each other. The simpler a tax system, the more unfair it tends to be. The fairer one is, the more complicated it is likely to be.
Perhaps the biggest political hurdle to a flat tax is that in almost all instances, middle-income taxpayers would owe a little more than they do now in taxes, and the wealthy would owe much less.
The chief Congressional proponent of a flat tax, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, advocates a flat tax rate on wages and pensions of 20 percent for three years, falling to 17 percent thereafter. Interest, dividends and capital gains would be exempt from taxation.
The personal exemption would be $13,100 for each adult and $5,300 for each child, meaning that a couple with two children and income below $36,800 would owe no income taxes. But beyond that, no deductions would be allowed: not for mortgage interest, not for charitable contributions, not for anything.
The Treasury has calculated that a plan similar to Mr. Armey's would raise nearly $200 billion a year less than the current system, would lower the taxes of people with incomes above $200,000 a year by more than 25 percent and could raise almost everyone else's taxes.
Mr. Armey does not take serious issue with the Treasury's estimate of the revenue loss. Part of the appeal of his plan, he says, is that Americans would get a tax cut. He expects Congress to find offsetting spending reductions to keep the deficit from growing.
As for the rich getting a windfall, Mr. Armey and his allies say the problem is overestimated. Affluent people, they believe, would earn so much more by putting to productive use what they would otherwise pay to the Government that they might even end up paying more in total taxes.
If that does not sound like a persuasive argument, try this one: Americans spend tens of billions of dollars a year -- hundreds of billions, by some estimates -- keeping records, hiring accountants, paying revenue agents and otherwise complying with the current tax system. What if all that money could be saved? Even if it all went into the pockets of wealthy Americans, they would invest it in ways that would put others to work, and everyone would be better off.
If the idea of a flat tax does not founder on the shoals of fairness, it faces two other serious obstacles.
The first one is that the Republican chairmen of the tax-writing committees are not enthusiastic. Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, agree that the current system needs to be completely rewritten. But they favor some form of tax on consumption, like a national sales tax.
Mr. Archer plans to hold hearings on the matter beginning in June. But he says he sees no chance of big changes in the tax system until after the 1996 elections.
The other obstacle is that far fewer Americans may be worried about the complexity of the current system than politicians think. Almost three-quarters of all taxpayers take the standard deduction. That means they do not have to itemize their deductions, and can generally submit their returns now on two pages.
For them and for the vast majority of other Americans, almost no record-keeping is required anymore. Employers send statements of wages, salaries and taxes withheld. Interest and dividend statements are sent by banks and companies. The only deductions most people can take are for mortgage interest, state and local property and income taxes and charitable contributions.
But try telling that to the folks in the line at the post office tonight. They most likely had to deal with the child-care credit, or capital gains, or Schedule C for the self-employed. Or maybe they had more than one employer, or had moving expenses or some other complication.
For these people, the tax experience can be maddening. And a flat tax could look mighty good -- even if some fat cat on the other side of town made out like a bandit.

HEADLINE: Life in the Metropolis Found Lacking

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

 BODY:
People living in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut metropolitan region are less satisfied with the quality of life in their communities than are residents of four other parts of the country, according to polls released yesterday by a regional planning group.
The polls, by the Regional Plan Association, found that only 35 percent of people living in the New York area said they were very satisfied with their quality of life, compared with 43 percent in Los Angeles and 52 percent in Seattle, for example. 
 The polls also found that 42 percent of the people living in the New York area would move out tomorrow if they had the opportunity -- about the same number found for the Los Angeles area.
The association is using the results of the polls to help draw an outline for future planning, transportation systems, economic development, environmental issues, governance and social policy in the New York region.
In addition to polling residents of the New York area, the association conducted a second poll, in the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Atlanta, Seattle and Dallas / Fort Worth, which census data show are the country's fastest-growing metropolitan areas outside the Northeast.
In the New York region, the poll found that 11 percent of the residents ranked high taxes as the thing they most disliked about their community. In the four other regions, the number was 4 percent or less.
Within the New York region, 21 percent of the people living on Long Island said that high taxes were what they disliked most about their communities, compared with just 2 percent in New York City.
In all regions, crime was identified by nearly one in four people -- regardless of age, race or economic status -- as the single most important factor affecting the quality of life.
Officials of the Regional Plan Association said they will use the data to find what can be done to improve those things that people feel are important to the quality of life.
"We're thinking about the national economy as competitive regions," said Robert Yaro, the association's executive director. "We can no longer take for granted that the major industries are bolted down here in the Northeast no matter what we do."
When asked how satisfied they were in general, 35 percent of the people in the New York area said they were very satisfied, compared with a high of 52 percent in Seattle. In the Atlanta area, 49 percent said they were very satisfied, and in the Dallas / Fort Worth area the number was 47 percent.
Prepared by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute in Hamden, Conn., the poll of the New York metropolitan region questioned 1,500 people and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. The poll of the other regions questioned 400 people each, and had a sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. In comparing data from the two polls, the sampling error is six percentage points.
The association posed nearly 50 questions, asking people to rank what they liked and disliked most about their communities, the importance of various issues, problems in their communities and their outlooks for the future.
Although residents of the Los Angeles region, like those in the New York region, said that high taxes are a big problem, only 1 percent of those polled in the Los Angeles region said that high taxes were the thing they disliked most about their community, compared with the 11 percent in the New York region.
Residents in all regions considered employment, affordable housing, safety, good schools and clean air and water as issues most affecting the quality of their lives. However, people in the New York metropolitan area -- which is known for its transient and enterprising population -- were slightly more concerned about the economy and less concerned about family, church, and faith than people in other regions.
"People have families here and they care about their church and they go to their synagogues, but business and enterprise have always been important here," said Mr. Yaro.
Fifty-three percent of the people in the region said that good public transportation was very important to their quality of life, compared with 34 to 40 percent in the other four regions. Also, residents of the New York region were more satisfied with their public transportation systems than others were.
A high percentage of people in both the New York and Los Angeles areas cited the high cost of housing and the lack of good jobs as big problems. A larger percentage of people in Los Angeles also said that racial tensions were a big problem.
When asked their impression of the quality of life in the New York region, only 1 percent of people living in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Dallas, respectively, answered "excellent." At least 13 percent of people polled across the country had lived in the New York region previously. People in all four of those regions rated their own quality of life much higher than the quality of life in the New York region.
Residents of the New York region apparently agree, as evidenced by the 42 percent who said they would move away immediately if they had the opportunity.
"The bright young people needed to fuel New York's high-tech economy are increasingly footloose," Mr. Yaro said. When asked what type of community they would move to, 50 percent said suburban areas and 33 percent said rural areas.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "DEMOGRAPHICS: Happiness May Be a State of Mind (but Your Community Helps)" shows percent of people who said they were very satisfied, somewhat satisfied or dissatisfied with their communities and percent of people who said they would stay, not sure if they would stay or move, or would move fom their communities if given the opportunity for selected cities.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bonds Close Mixed; Traders Cite Weak Dollar

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with the 30-year bond falling under pressure from rising commodity prices and a weaker dollar.
The prices of shorter maturities advanced, bolstered by Government reports on Friday that showed weak industrial production and capacity utilization. Yesterday was the first opportunity for traders to react to the data because the market was closed for Good Friday. 
 Buyers were concentrated in securities with maturities of five years or less, said Theodore Ake, Government trading manager at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago. "The long end of the market was paying more attention to the dollar's slide, and to the rise in gold, silver and oil," Mr. Ake said, "while the front end, or shorter maturities, was more tuned to manufacturing and the central bank activity."
The price of the 30-year bond fell 17/32 of a percentage point, to 103. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.37 percent, from 7.33 percent on Thursday, and was its highest in six days.
But rates at the Treasury's weekly bill auction dropped sharply. The average rate for a new three-month bill dropped 14 basis points, to 5.56 percent, while the rate for a six-month bill declined 15 basis points, to 5.69 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Despite the weakness in the 30-year bond, 'the bond market rally may not be over," said Ken McAlley, who is head of U.S. Trust Corporation's fixed income division. "The wild card is the severely depreciated U.S. dollar," he said.
The dollar tumbled to new lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark yesterday, hurt by expectations that economic measures introduced by Japan on Friday would not be effective in curbing the surging yen. A weaker dollar hurts United States bonds by making them less attractive to foreign investors.
The market was also weighed down by a sharp rise in commodity prices, including crude oil. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose 1.37 points yesterday, to 236.
In early trading, bullish technical factors coupled with the effects of Friday's weak production data briefly overshadowed the inflationary concerns raised by a weak dollar and higher commodity prices.
On Friday, the Federal Reserve said industrial output fell in March by three-tenths of 1 percent, the first decline since September. The report provided further evidence that the economy is slowing.
Few economists now expect the Fed to raise short-term interest rates when its policy-making committee meets in May.
A Reuters poll of economists shows expectations for another interest rate increase to come this summer, a marked shift from earlier surveys, when March or May were picked as the most likely time for a move. Among the reasons given were that data over the last two months have been weaker, with the March employment figures weak enough to keep the Fed on hold unless there is a significant turnaround.
"Today's technicals, along with the cash flows, were positive for the market on the short end, and will likely remain that way all week," Mr. Ake of Kemper Securities said. "While fundamentals, for today at least, were negative for the long end of the market. So far, the market has been very selective on what it has focused on. The soft landing is the predominant trade most people are working off right now."
In the municipal bond market, prices were up amid investor expectations that this week's supply of new bonds will push yields down even further, traders said.
Portfolio managers expect the new issues will run up in price because of the lack of supply compared with last year and the need for funds to buy in large blocks. According to Bloomberg Fair Value Analytics, yields on 30-year insured municipal bonds have fallen 73 basis points, or 12 percent, since January amid a 47 percent decline in new issues for the first quarter.
Following are the results of yesterday's regular Treasury weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.595	97.123	Discounted Rate	5.56%	5.69%	Coupon Yield	5.73%	5.96%	High Price	98.600	97.128	Discounted Rate	5.54%	5.68%	Coupon Yield	5.71%	5.95%	Low Price	98.595	97.123	Discounted Rate	5.56%	5.69%	Coupon Yield	5.73%	5.96%	Accepted at low price	84%	93%	Total applied for	$41,089,554	$41,742,737	Accepted	$11,604,938	$11,621,314	Noncompetitive	$1,349,637	$1,260,717	
Both issues are dated April 20, 1995. The three-month bills mature on July 20, 1995, and the six-month bills mature on Oct. 19, 1995.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Backs Bonds To Aid Irish

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said yesterday that he supported the idea of purchasing bonds with New York City pension funds to help economic development in Northern Ireland.
Mr. Hevesi, who as Comptroller is the investment adviser to New York City's $51 billion in pension funds, last year proposed establishing an Ireland Development Bank, which would issue bonds to support economic development in Northern Ireland. The bank would primarily lend to small businesses. 
 "Promoting prosperity is a powerful means for ending division and conflict," Mr. Hevesi said, "especially if the economic development programs are administered with the full and equal participation of all the communities in Ireland."
In a news conference with Archbishop John Cardinal O'Connor at the Cardinal's residence in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Hevesi discussed a proposal to establish a bond issue that could be offered to pension funds and other investors interested in channeling money into job-creating ventures in Northern Ireland.
"I'm sure that our pension funds would favorably consider these bonds," Mr. Hevesi said. He added that he was not making any "irrevocable commitment to anything because we have boards of trustees that would have to carefully review this."
But he said that the proposal to create the Ireland Peace Bonds and the development bank had been "constructed so that it would be attractive" to various pension funds.
Mr. Hevesi's proposal is loosely based on Israel Bonds, which were issued in the 1950's and raised about $1 billion a year for Israel.
Colleen Roache, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, said that the administration did not know the details of Mr. Hevesi's proposal but that the idea merited further study.
The proposal to create a development bank came during a trip Mr. Hevesi made to Northern Ireland last summer to monitor fair employment practices. Under the proposal, the development bank would receive its initial capital from the British, Irish and United States Governments in addition to the European Union, which would each have to approve the creation of the bank. Each member would provide $25 million in capital and another $25 million in guarantees over a five-year period.
"Ireland Peace Bonds would target the 40 million Irish-Americans and others who would like both a good investment and an opportunity to promote economic development in Ireland," Mr. Hevesi said. "With government guarantees, institutional investors in the United States could find the bonds to be very attractive."
About $5.5 billion of the city's pension funds are invested in stocks and bonds outside of the United States, Mr. Hevesi's office said.
Mr. Hevesi is not the first city comptroller to take an interest in investment in Northern Ireland. In the 1980's, Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin advocated measures to put pressure on American companies that did business in Northern Ireland to seek an end to discrimination against Catholics there.

HEADLINE: Stocks Retreat From Early Gains, With Dow Falling 12.80

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market seemed to defy gravity for part of the day yesterday, but it came down to earth in the last hour of trading, pulled down by a variety of factors, including a surge in oil prices following Iraq's refusal of a United Nations plan for the sale of Iraqi oil.
The surge for most of the day in stocks had come despite a surprising rise in the price of gold and silver, usually a sign of declining market confidence; a sharp drop in the bond market; and the fall to record lows for the dollar in New York trading. 
 After rising as much as 30 points, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.80 points, to 4,195.38, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 3.10 points, to 506.13. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index declined as well, finishing at 830.82, down 1.82 points.
This week, there are few economic reports that might move markets. So traders may be anticipating this Friday's quarterly expiration of two kinds of stock options, known as "double witching." Traders typically bid stock prices down before expiration, when trading is hectic and prices typically fall.
One economic report, however, may move markets beforehand. The February international trade deficit, due tomorrow, may further weaken the dollar. Even though Wall Street forecasts an improvement to a deficit of $10.2 billion, from $12.2 billion in January, the figures are volatile and often catch the market by surprise.
Yesterday, propelled by record earnings and an all-time stock high from Microsoft, the stock market staged a broad-based rally for much of the session. Another technology stock, Intel, reported higher-than-expected earnings after the market closed but traders were probably anticipating strong results.
Microsoft, which was the most active stock at almost 12 million shares, kept its early gains, rising 4 7/8, to 77 3/8. But Intel, after rising as high as 97 1/2, fell 1, to 94, in the late-session rout.
"The biggest factor was the resurgence in commodity prices," especially crude oil, said Todd Clark, managing director for equity trading at Rodman & Renshaw. Crude oil for May delivery rose 58 cents, to $19.73 a barrel, the highest since April 6 and approaching the August 1994 high of $20.55.
On Sunday, Iraq rejected as an infringement of its rights as a nation a United Nations plan to allow the sale of $2 billion in Iraqi oil to ease economic distress in Iraq. After its invasion of Kuwait, Iraq was banned from selling oil by the United Nations. The rejected plan would have increased the supply of oil on the world market, thus weakening prices.
Other traders could not attribute the failed rally to any one cause but doubted it would be long term. "It came like a bolt," said Paul Hennessey, senior vice president for equity trading at the Boston Company. "But it's just an aberration."
One factor behind the rout was likely the continuing weakness in the dollar, which fell because of worldwide trader disappointment that Japan did not follow its cut in interest rates last week with a substantive plan to further open its markets to other countries, including the United States.
The dollar fell to another record low of 82.00 yen, down 1.30 yen, and to a record low of 1.3675 German marks, down 0.0189 mark.
Among the biggest gainers yesterday was the Thermolase Corporation, a developer of lasers for cosmetics purposes, which rose 9 3/4, to 23, because of Government clearance of a laser-based hair-removal device. Its parent, Thermotrex, which will make the laser, rose 5, to 21 1/2. TRW Inc., the diversified conglomerate, rose 4 1/8, to 72 1/4 after reporting stronger-then-expected earnings.
Among the biggest decliners was the Learning Company, a developer of educational computer software, which fell 5 1/2, to 24 3/4, after management warned of possibly falling profits for the next few quarters.
Novellus Systems, a maker of equipment used to make computer chips, fell 5, to 63, when management also warned of a profit squeeze. And Compuware, a developer of computer software, fell 4 3/4, to 23. Management said it expects to post lower-than-expected earnings.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls as Japanese Plan Fails to Impress Some Traders

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled against the yen and other leading currencies as dealers remained skeptical about Japanese efforts to curb the advance of the yen.
Concerns about Japan's economic package, which was announced on Friday, increased after American officials said that Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin had expressed disappointment with the Japanese efforts during a meeting with Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura in Indonesia on Sunday. 
 Mr. Rubin's remarks lessened speculation that the two countries would act in concert to bolster the dollar, dealers and analysts said.
The dollar's decline against the yen yesterday prompted dealers to sell the American currency for German marks, as well.
"Rubin's comments reiterated that the U.S. was disappointed with the package," said Karl Halligan, vice president for strategic trading at CIC Bank New York, "and the market immediately sold dollars and bought yen."
Concern that American and Japanese officials had made little progress toward opening the Japanese auto market to imports from the United States also weighed on the dollar.
It fell as far as 81.74 yen, its lowest level in a week, when it touched a postwar low of 80.15 yen. Buying by the Japanese central bank helped the dollar recover somewhat. In New York trading late yesterday, it settled at 82 yen, a record low in New York, down from 83.30 on Friday.
The dollar also fell to a record low against the mark, at 1.3675 marks, down from 1.3915 on Friday.
It fell sharply against the Swiss franc, as well, ending at 1.1265 francs, down from 1.1515.
But price movements yesterday might have been exaggerated because foreign-exchange centers in many countries were closed for national holidays. "We'll see where the dollar really is when trading begins in Tokyo and London tomorrow," said David De Rosa, director of foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
On Friday, Japan introduced a plan to spur its economy that included increases in public works spending and pledges to speed deregulation. In addition, the central bank reduced the discount rate to a modern low of 1 percent from 1.75 percent in an effort to weaken the yen by making deposits denominated in yen less attractive to buyers.
Currency dealers said they were disappointed with the Japanese economic package because it did not specify how soon and how much officials intended to reduce the trade surplus with the United States, which rose to a record $66 billion last year.
"Until they come out with some strong numbers that people can hang their hats on, I don't think anyone is going to stand in the way of this market," said Jim Raphael, a currency dealer at NatWest U.S.A. Bancorp in Jersey City.

HEADLINE: When to Lift the Iraq Embargo

 BODY:
The United States and Iraq are engaged in a cynical tug-of-war over a United Nations Security Council plan to let Baghdad sell $2 billion worth of oil over the next six months to pay for food, medicine and other necessities. Washington calls the plan humanitarian help for the Iraqi people. Baghdad says it is a violation of Iraq's sovereignty.
In truth, the plan is a political maneuver manipulated by both sides in the larger struggle over economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the Security Council at the end of the Persian Gulf war. The sanctions include an embargo on oil sales until Baghdad eliminates all efforts to make weapons of mass destruction. The United States wants to maintain the oil embargo even if Iraq meets that condition. To deflect mounting international criticism that it is being inflexible, Washington proposed sweetening an exception for oil sales for humanitarian purposes. Iraq is resisting the partial easing of the embargo because President Saddam Hussein hopes the Iraqi people will blame the United States, not him, for their hardships. 
 The embargo should not be lifted now because Iraq has yet to comply fully with the requirements on disarming and international monitoring. When Baghdad is in compliance, the United States should allow Iraq to sell its oil. Maneuvering over a partial lifting is a disservice to the Iraqi people because it creates the illusion that the Iraqi dictator might use the oil revenue to help them, something he has shown no interest in doing.
The U.N. arms inspector Rolf Ekeus has just reported that Iraq is still concealing evidence of efforts to make biological weapons. There are signs it may also be hiding parts of its nuclear program.
The U.N. inspectors cannot account for 17 metric tons of material that could be used to breed germ warfare agents like anthrax. They are not sure whether the material was consumed to grow bacteria or is being hidden. Iraq imported the material between 1988 and 1990, but contends it was distributed to hospitals for diagnostic purposes, a contention the inspectors dispute.
Concern about the continuing Iraqi concealment of its nuclear program was recently aroused by the disappearance of one of Iraq's nuclear experts, who reportedly fled to Greece with documents showing that Iraq was still engaged in weapons design and nuclear research. American officials have vouched for the authenticity of some of the documents. The International Atomic Energy Agency is convinced that under its watchful eye Iraq cannot make a warhead, even it could keep parts of its nuclear program going.
There is a clear, simple way for Saddam Hussein to uphold Iraq's sovereignty, end the embargo and actually help his people. He can give the U.N. inspectors the access and information they need.

HEADLINE: The Rich Get Richer Faster

 BODY:
The gap between rich and poor is vast in the United States -- and recent studies show it growing faster here than anywhere else in the West. The trend is largely the result of technological forces at work around the world. But the United States Government has done little to ameliorate the problem. Indeed, if the Republicans get their way on the budget, the Government will make a troubling trend measurably worse.
Some inequality is necessary if society wants to reward investors for taking risks and individuals for working hard and well. But excessive inequality can break the spirit of those trapped in society's cellar -- and exacerbate social tensions. 
 After years of little change, inequality exploded in America starting in the 1970's. According to Prof. Edward Wolff of New York University, three-quarters of the income gains during the 1980's and 100 percent of the increased wealth went to the top 20 percent of families.
The richest 1 percent of households control about 40 percent of the nation's wealth -- twice as much as the figure in Britain, which has the greatest inequality in Western Europe. In Germany, high-wage families earn about 2.5 times as much as low-wage workers; the number has been falling. In America the figure is above 4 times, and rising.
Interpreting these trends requires caution. Inequality rose here in the 1980's in part because the United States created far more jobs -- many low-paid -- than did Western Europe. Low-paying jobs are better than no jobs. Rising inequality in the United States has also been caused in substantial part by middle-class families that moved up the income ladder, opening a gap with those below them.
About half of Americans move a substantial distance up or down the income ladder over a typical five-year period. In a mobile society, where workers rotate among high- and low-earning jobs, earnings gaps are less frightening because any given job would be less entrapping.
But mobility has offset none of the increased inequality in income. Studies at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University show that mobility in America is not higher than in Germany. Nor does mobility here appear to be higher today than it was in the early 1970's.
The best guess about the factor behind burgeoning inequality is technology; the wage gap between high- and low-skilled workers in America doubled during the 1980's. College graduates used to earn about 30 percent more than high school graduates, but now earn 60 percent more. Prof. Sheldon Danziger of the University of Michigan estimates that trends in private pay rates explain about 85 percent of recent increases in inequality; Reagan-Bush tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts for the poor explain much of the other 15 percent.
But even if government is not the main actor, it could be part of the solution. Changes in the Canadian economy during the 1980's also hit hard at low-wage workers. But there the Government stepped in to keep poverty rates on a downward path. In the United States, poverty rose.
House Republicans are now pushing the Federal budget in the wrong direction. At a time when employers are crying out for well-educated workers, the G.O.P. proposes to cut back money for training and educational assistance. America needs better Head Start, primary and secondary education. It needs to train high school dropouts and welfare mothers. The G.O.P. policy would leave the untrained stranded. That would harm the nation's long-term productivity -- and further distort an increasingly tilted economy.

Hooked On Jail

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Whatever the problem, the solution is now obvious: jail.
You have heard the following statistic: The United States now has more people locked up than the country that used to hold the world record but whose name eludes me, probably the late Soviet Union or the South Africa of apartheid days. 
 What about China? It is never listed as a contender, possibly because China does not have jails. It has re-education centers.
The Chinese do not want them called jails, and we humor the Chinese in this. It is good business, and as President Coolidge observed, "The business of America is business."
Presidents Bush and Clinton have both insisted that this Coolidgean wisdom be engraved on the skull of every State Department employee assigned to the China division.
If they referred to re-education centers as "jails," the dirt-cheap garments Americans now buy at the Dirt-Cheap Mart might be denied us by an offended China.
The Chinese, as is well known (as Radio Moscow used to say in the old days before issuing some utterly doubtable fact), are sticklers for good manners. Call a spade anything but a manually operated excavating-technology implement, and China may no longer invite you to share its dirt-cheap threads.
If China is not a contender, the United States seems sure to become the jail champion of the world at any moment. American prisons are bulging. More and better prisons are on drawing boards all over the country.
Prison construction seems to be the last government activity of which Americans still heartily approve despite the monumental costs. Economists constantly point out that keeping someone in prison costs more than a Harvard education.
This may be true, but it ignores Harvard's reluctance, demonstrated just the other day, to grant its blessings to persons with felonious histories. It also ignores the law-abiding taxpayer's temptation to ask why, if the Government is handing out Harvard educations, preference should go to crooks.
The taxpayer is simply not going to sit still for felons being sentenced to Harvard educations. He is ready and even eager, however, to see his famous taxpayer's dollar devoted to the newest thing in cellblocks.
Here is where a little common sense can be applied to cutting the cost of government. As Governor Pataki has finally noticed in New York, top-drawer space needed to warehouse our nastiest customers is being wasted on small fry.
At present a great deal of expensive cell space is occupied by offenders who can't even be described as underworld bush-leaguers. These are the ho-hum drug dealers and users locked up because Governor Rockefeller years ago decided that jail would solve the drug problem.
It would be inviting the Furies to say that history has proved Rockefeller wrong. Embalming fluid is the only cure for people truly wedded to discredited ideas. Believers in supply-side economics will enter Eternity insisting that President Reagan's decision to cut taxes and raise spending had nothing to do with creating his legacy of the trillion-dollar deficit.
In the same way, believers in the jail solution to the drug problem will insist that the iron doors continue to clang.
Very well, but should they be the very best iron doors that the taxpayer's dollar can buy? Is maximum security vital to teach the corner peddler a lesson he won't forget?
Obviously, the answer is to build a small, cheaper, lower-security drug jail. Small, cheap, minimal-security -- those are the specifications for many of the problems we hope to solve with jail.
Soon, obviously, the public is going to insist that people be jailed for smoking. All well and good, but does it make economic sense to waste a magnificently punitive institution like Attica even on the most hardened, incorrigible smoker?
The solution: smoke jail. A few pine shacks and a wire fence. Next problem: people's use of insensitive speech that hurts other people's feelings. Solution: insensitivity jail where offenders can do some low-budget brooding on how bad it would hurt their own feelings to be called "jailbirds."
Next problem: the cruel lampooning of decent earth-loving people just because they want to stamp out fur coats, sugar and fatty foods. Solution: Joke jail. And next --
Well . . . maybe re-education centers.

Stocks Reverse Course On Dollar Drop and Oil Surge
 
The stock market fell in the last hour of trading after rising for much of the day, brought down by rising oil prices and the continued weakness in the dollar. The Dow was up as much as 30 points before closing down 12.80 points at 4,195.38. 
 Traders said the market was pulled down by a surge in oil prices after Iraq's rejection of a United Nations plan for limited oil sales and after the dollar declined against the yen and the mark. It settled in New York at 82.00 yen and 1.3675 marks. Bonds also fell. D12.

HEADLINE: Asia First: A Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By Michael Lind; Michael Lind is a senior editor of Harper's Magazine.

 BODY:
The United States is approaching the year 2000 with a grand strategy designed for 1950. Although America spends almost as much as the rest of the world on defense, neither party is seriously questioning the continuing need for alliances designed for the cold war.
With the illusion of the "last superpower" long shattered, we have to think about American interests in terms of four other great powers: Japan, China, Russia and Germany. And for the next century, we must concentrate on Asia. It contains most of the world's population and much of its industry, and Japan and China are the only powers with the potential to be formidable rivals. 
 An "Asia first" foreign policy would entail maintaining an economic and military balance between Japan and China, ending America's military agreement with Japan, increased cooperation with Russia on Asian affairs, forcing open Japan's and China's markets to U.S. goods, and dismantling NATO.
In the very long run, China may be the greatest threat to our interests. A China with only a quarter of America's per capita income would surpass us as the world's largest economy and, perhaps, as the pre-eminent military power. It has already replaced the Soviet Union as the major military supplier for anti-American regimes, and is insisting on great-power hegemony over the South China Sea.
Seeing Japan's success in exploiting the open U.S. market while placing barriers on foreign investment at home, China is building up a huge bilateral trade surplus. Americans who hope that capitalist development will inspire a democratic and peaceable China will almost certainly be disappointed: after all, it took military defeat and occupation to bring democracy to capitalist Germany and Japan.
History warns us, however, against overestimating China's potential -- and underestimating that of Japan. Japan's economy is superior to ours in many areas of finance and technology. If it chose to, Japan could become a high-tech military superpower overnight.
Ominously, many Japanese politicians and intellectuals are taking the line that the East Asian model of capitalism -- stressing national community and strong government at the expense of individualism -- is superior to "decadent" American liberal democracy. "This is a nation of Asian people with Asian blood," Shintaro Ishihara, one of many Japanese politicians arguing for a "re-Asianization" of Japan, has said. Reversing the 19th century slogan "Datsu-ah, ny-o" ("Leave Asia, enter the West"), many Japanese leaders now recite the trendy slogan "Datsu-o, nyu-ah" ("Leave the West, enter Asia").
 Those who argue that the U.S. can best restrain Japan by continuing to insure its military security must answer an obvious question: what do we get in return? As the Asian market becomes more important than ours for Japan, our leverage with Tokyo in trade talks will continue to diminish, no matter how many troops we have there. Why should U.S. troops serve indefinitely as the security guards of a latter-day Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere from which many American products are effectively excluded?
Besides, in the event of American-Chinese conflict, Japan is more likely to act as an opportunistic intermediary than a local ally, if its recent record of undercutting U.S. positions on human rights and arms proliferation in China and North Korea is any indication.
It is too early to tell whether Japan or China will be a greater challenge. The most prudent policy would be for the U.S. to keep its distance from both, weighing in on the side of the weaker whenever one grows overly strong.
In the interim we should remove most of our troops from Japan and replace the U.S.-Japan security treaty with more flexible agreements. Japan should assume responsibility for its own defense, with the two nations cooperating with others on regional security. (U.S. forces should remain in South Korea, however, until peaceful unification.) Treating Japan as an equal, not a dependent, may also mean pushing for it to be given a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and allowing it to develop a nuclear weapons program if it seeks one.
A new realism in our Asian policy would mean rejecting the counsel of those who would continue to appease Japanese mercantilism on the theories that an overvalued yen or a domestic consumer revolt will soon eliminate its trade surplus. Our deficit with Japan is really worse than it appears, because Japanese subsidiaries in other Asian countries are exporting to the U.S. The problem has festered for so long only because many of America's Asian experts and policymakers are supported by Japanese business interests and U.S. companies with stakes in Asia. (The second largest "soft money" contributor to the Republican party in the first two months of 1995 was the United States Asia Commercial Development Corporation).
The Clinton Administration should follow up its successful tough line in trade talks with China by giving Japan a stark choice between opening its market to the estimated $50 billion in American imports that is lost every year and our setting up equally restrictive barriers. The Administration should also begin negotiations with the European Union to form a trans-Atlantic common market limited to industrial countries that practice liberal capitalism and two-way trade.
Although our foreign policy should focus on Asia, we of course cannot ignore Europe's great powers, Germany and Russia. Fortunately, neither are strong enough to be world-class threats.
Economists predict that by the year 2020, there will be one German pensioner for every German worker. Countries with low birth rates do not engage in conquest, for lack of cannon fodder. The European Union's inability to set a common policy toward the Balkans, though tragic, should reassure Americans worried about the emergence of a German-dominated superstate.
The Russian Republic combines a population only slightly larger than Japan's with a third world economy, an enfeebled Government, an insubordinate military and chaos on its borders. Eventually, no doubt, some regime, more likely authoritarian than democratic, will forge some degree of order and prosperity. A hostile Russia with nuclear weapons would be a threat -- but more like a large Iraq than another Nazi Germany.
Yet it is in America's interest for there to be a moderately strong Russia to act as a military counterweight in Asia to Japan and China. We should continue to support Russia's territorial integrity and give it economic aid.
We cannot expect Russian cooperation in Asia, however, if we antagonize Russia by extending NATO into Eastern Europe. Thus we should replace NATO with a pan-European security organization that includes Russia and the U.S. The Western Europeans as a group, or the Germans independently, would assume separate responsibility for their own defense, permitting the U.S. to pull out most of its troops and end its implausible nuclear guarantee of Europe.
"The commonest error in politics is sticking to the carcasses of dead policies," wrote the Marquess of Salisbury, one of Britain's greatest statesmen, in 1877. "When a mast falls overboard, you do not try to save a rope here and a spar there, in memory of their former utility; you cut away the hamper altogether." The United States-Japan alliance and NATO have been rendered irrelevant by cold war success. The new slogan in Tokyo ought to be adopted in Washington as well: "Leave the West, enter Asia."

HEADLINE: Japanese Issue Threat to Quit Talks on Cars

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 18

 BODY:
Japanese officials said today that they would withdraw from trade talks with the United States on automobiles and parts if the Clinton Administration moved further toward imposing sanctions during the negotiations.
The warning came as Japanese and American officials reported little progress after two days of discussion here. The Administration is pressing Japan to remove barriers to importing American cars. 
 Frustrated by the lack of progress after two years of talks, Mr. Clinton's economic advisers decided last week to threaten Japan with punitive tariffs if the two sides failed to agree within three weeks.
American officials said no overt threats were made at today's talks, but one official said that the Administration "was resolved to address this one way or another if negotiations fail."
Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, was blunter, saying today on a CNBC program that Washington would consider using sanctions against Japan if the talks were unsuccessful.
President Clinton said at his televised news conference tonight that the United States was not at risk of a trade war with Japan, but that some difficulties remained to be resolved. He accused Japan of being protectionist in some areas, but that progress had been made in many others.
Earlier in the day, the Japanese distributed a position paper to reporters that said, "If the U.S. Government should announce retaliation against Japan in an effort to create negotiating leverage, we may be forced to suspend negotiations and proceed immediately" to the World Trade Organization. There, the Japanese say, they would charge that the United States was violating world trade rules by unilaterally seeking to impose sanctions.
Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, the chief American negotiator today, said in an interview that the talks focused on two American demands: that Japan make sure more auto dealers sell American cars and that Japanese auto makers purchase more American components. The United States is seeking to extend an agreement, negotiated by the Bush Administration in 1992, under which Japanese car manufacturers agreed to increase the use of American parts.
After today's talks ended, Yoshihiro Sakamoto, a vice minister of international trade and industry, said that as long as the United States insisted on expanding the voluntary plan, there would be no agreement.
A Japanese official contended that the issue was not one for Government negotiations, but the responsibility of private business.
Mr. Garten said the United States had not set any deadline for reaching agreement. He said lower-level talks would be held next week involving technical experts from the two countries, and added: "We made very little progress today. Large gaps remain in all the major areas."
The two sides continued to put forward very different reasons that American automobiles and parts had captured such small shares of the Japanese market.
The United States contended that Japan maintained many subtle trade barriers, like a heavily regulated system of repair shops with close links to Japanese auto makers.
Washington also argued that the refusal of many Japanese dealers to sell American cars had denied General Motors, Ford and Chrysler "the shelf space" that would enable Japanese consumers to look at their cars.
The Japanese argue that the Big Three have such a small share of their market because they have not tried hard enough to sell their cars in Japan. Mr. Sakamoto noted that 80 percent of the cars sold in Japan had engines under two liters in size, and said that hardly any American cars had engines that small.
"There is a basic difference in perception," Mr. Garten said. "We are saying the Japanese market is closed, especially in relation to other industrial countries. They are saying we aren't trying hard enough."

HEADLINE: Starts of Home Construction Decline for a Third Month

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Construction starts on new homes fell in March for the third consecutive month, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, reinforcing a growing view that the economy is a lot weaker today than it was at the end of last year.
Ground was broken for new homes -- single-family houses, multi-family town houses and apartments -- at an annual rate of 1.2 million buildings, the lowest level in two years. The decline was 8 percent from the February level, or more than double the drop that forecasters had expected. Builders finally pulled back, apparently because of a growing inventory of unsold new homes, among other problems. 
 "At some point, builders had to start realizing that there were more unsold homes out there than there were people to buy them," said David Wyss, director of research at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting service in Cambridge, Mass. "I think that realization has finally come, and they are starting to cut back."
The sharp drop in home construction was the latest bit of unfavorable news about the economy. Industrial production, including auto and truck manufacturing, has fallen from last year's levels. Job creation is less than it was last year, retail sales have weakened, and inventories of unsold merchandise have risen, making corporate America reluctant to churn out more goods until people buy what has already been made.
"The signs of slowdown are almost across the board," Alan S. Blinder, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report in an interview.
Many economists now say the national economy will grow in the current second quarter at an annual rate of 2.5 percent or less, roughly half the pace of last year's booming fourth quarter. "Housing is the sector that really tells you when higher interest rates are biting into the economy," Lawrence H. Meyer, an econoimic consultant in St. Louis, said. "And they are biting; there is no question about that."
As the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in 1994, rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose as high as 9.2 percent last December from a low of 6.9 percent in October 1993. The 30-year mortgage has since eased back to 8.5 percent, but lenders have discouraged home buyers by raising first-year "teaser" rates on variable-rate mortgages to more than 6 percent from 5 percent or so last year. The bargain-basement teaser rates were withdrawn because lenders were losing money on these deals, Lyle Gramley of the Mortgage Bankers Association said.
The biggest drop in housing starts, 20 percent, occurred in the West, probably because of the heavy rain and flooding in California last month, Lewis Alexander, chief economist at the Commerce Department, said. The declines in the rest of the nation were much less; multifamily- home construction took the biggest hit. Building permits for future residential construction also fell, having been issued in March at an annual rate of 1.231 million, a decline of 4.4 percent from February.
Inventories of unsold new homes have risen rapidly since late last year, when less than six months were needed to sell off the stockpile. Home sales have since declined, raising the inventory level to 7.5 months of unsold homes.

HEADLINE: Treasury Chief Goes to India And Is Upstaged by Iranian

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, April 18

 BODY:
Nobody told Robert E. Rubin that his first venture abroad as Treasury Secretary would be as much fun as one of Hillary Rodham Clinton's elephant rides.
But then again, no one told him he would have to stay one limousine behind the state visitor whom India is really out to impress: President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, a country the Clinton Administration calls an "outlaw nation" that must be economically isolated. 
 For the last two days, since their planes touched down at Delhi airport two hours apart, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Rafsanjani have been engaged in a contest of dueling motorcades, one zipping into New Delhi's stately government residences as the other glided out.
This afternoon, they missed each other by three minutes. There was no risk that they would run into each other at dinner. The Indian Finance Minister put on a quiet meal for the Treasury Secretary, while the rest of the Government was across town, listening to Mr. Rafsanjani speak to a special session of Parliament convened in his honor.
At lunch today, after a morning spent passing dozens of banners declaring "Long live India-Iran Friendship," a somewhat chagrined Mr. Rubin acknowledged that the timing of his celebration of India's economic opening could have been better. "Clearly, we would have rescheduled, if we had known in a timely fashion," he said.
In fact, Mr. Rubin said that until last weekend, when he was attending a meeting of finance ministers in Indonesia, he was unaware that Mr. Rafsanjani and his delegation of 100 officials would be fellow travelers.
So, apparently, was Frank G. Wisner, the American Ambassador here. Mr. Wisner said he first heard about Mr. Rafsanjani's trip when he returned from the tiny kingdom of Bhutan over the weekend, and by then it was too late to call things off.
American officials here said they had apparently missed several articles in the Indian press during the last 10 days or so previewing Mr. Rafsanjani's trip and speculating on the meaning of India's sudden embrace of a country with few friends.
Ostensibly, Mr. Rafsanjani and Mr. Rubin have similar agendas, talking commerce. In fact, the Iranian arrived with an accord that will give India much-sought-after access to Central Asian republics.
There is a lot of vague talk about building a pipeline from Iran's oil refineries to India's power-hungry west coast. But since the Iranians are decidedly short of money, and the Indians short of credit, it is unclear who would pay for it.
But there is considerably less than meets the eye to the economic accords, especially when compared with India's deep ties to the United States, its biggest trading partner and supplier of investment capital. So American officials were speculating today that they had been caught in the middle of an effort by India to try to gain an edge over Pakistan by striking up deals with a Muslim country, and to make sure that Iran provides little aid to Muslim militants in Kashmir.
"I don't think this is about us," an American official here said today. "But it would have been nice if someone let us know."
Indian officials did not seem to know much today about the latest rise in tensions between Iran and the United States. In recent weeks Washington has terminated a deal between Conoco Inc. and Iran to develop an untapped part of Iran's oilfields. It has been trying to tighten the economic noose, perhaps even stopping American companies from buying Iranian oil and selling it to third countries. Iranian oil is barred from the United States.
On Monday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who has led the effort to isolate Iran, failed to persuade China to stop supplying nuclear goods to Teheran, which is suspected of building a bomb.
India already has a bomb, perhaps several, but American officials said they doubted that that is what Mr. Rafsanjani meant when he talked about "technology transfers" between the two countries. American officials here say they have seen no intelligence data to suggest India has given any country nuclear aid.
Mr. Rubin, a former Wall Street executive who is still feeling his way in the realm of geopolitics, said today that he had simply said his piece to Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and did not get into the details of Iran's behavior. "These are very sensitive and difficult areas," he said today.
Asked why the Treasury Secretary went ahead with the trip, the fourth American Cabinet mission to India this year, Mr. Rubin's spokesman said the absence of advance warning and "the closeness of our relations with India" led to a decision to go ahead.
But the contrasts have been hard to miss. Prime Minister Rao broke protocol and came out to the airport on Monday, but it was to greet Mr. Rafsanjani, and not the top economic official of India's biggest trading partner and investor.
There is some speculation here that the comparatively cool reception given to Mr. Rubin could carry a political message: After three years of privatization, Mr. Rao has been criticized as moving too fast and pursuing economic growth that has yet to trickle down to the poor.
Now there are signs that he is slowing down. Opposition leaders who won election last month in Maharashtra state are threatening to open an investigation into a major power project won by Enron Corporation, a Houston energy company.
Aware that many in India think that their economic policy is dictated by Washington, Mr. Rubin is carefully avoiding controversy and pressure.
S. L. Rao, the director general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research, said: "If the impression develops, and it is developing, that America is delving deeply into the details of economic policy in India, it will have a backlash. We need a little room, and time."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Houston Post Bought and Closed by Rival

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, April 18

 BODY:
The country's fourth-largest city abruptly became a one-newspaper town today, after the 111-year-old Houston Post was sold to the Hearst Corporation, owner of the larger Houston Chronicle, which immediately shut it down.
The owner of The Post, Consolidated Newspapers Inc., said the rising cost of newsprint had discouraged potential buyers who might have been willing to keep the paper operating. Instead, the best offer came from Hearst, whose chief benefit in the deal is the elimination of The Chronicle's competition. 
 With the death of The Post, Houston becomes the largest city in the country with only one major daily metropolitan newspaper, joining a growing list of communities in which the economics of the newspaper business have led to a death struggle among rival dailies.
While rumors that The Post was up for sale had been circulating here for weeks, the suddenness of the newspaper's collapse left many Post employees stunned that the paper was not even accorded the journalistic equivalent of a decent burial -- publication of a final commemorative issue. This morning's issue, the last ever, said nothing of the sale.
"The thing that bothers me the most is not even being able to say goodbye to our readers," said Steve Sucher, 42, a features editor at The Post. "That's kind of a newspaper tradition. But I guess this shows what's happening to tradition in the newspaper business."
The closing of The Houston Post ends a 94-year rivalry between the city's two dailies. In recent decades, The Chronicle, which was bought by Hearst in 1987, has clearly become the dominant paper in town.
The Chronicle's current reported circulation is 412,337 daily and 606,707 on Sunday, while The Post's is 287,215 daily and 316,852 on Sunday.
Still, The Post had acquired a loyal following and a reputation as a somewhat pluckier, more colorful newspaper, right down to its delivery trucks, emblazoned with the slogan "The Houston Post -- A sign of intelligent life."
The dollar value of the sale to Hearst was not disclosed, though a Justice Department approval of the sale of The Post valued its assets at around $120 million.
Consolidated Newspapers said it had held unsuccessful talks with about four dozen prospective buyers who might have kept the paper running. Among those who had looked at The Post were the Rev. Pat Robertson, the head of the Christian Broadcasting Network, and the A. H. Belo Corporation, which publishes The Dallas Morning News.
In a statement today, officials of Consolidated Newspapers said the rising cost of newsprint had made the price of a sale prohibitive to all prospective buyers except Hearst. Last year, the statement said, the newsprint bill for The Post was about $26 million; this year, the price was expected to be more than $39 million.
"The recent unprecedented rise in the cost of newsprint has made it impossible to see viability for the city's second newspaper," said William Dean Singleton, president of and chief executive of Consolidated Newspapers.
The Post was owned for many years by the Hobby family of Houston, which sold it in 1983 to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company. That company sold the majority of its stake in the newspaper to Consolidated in 1987.
"This had to happen but that doesn't really make it any easier," said Paul Hobby, a grandson of the first Hobby to own The Post. "Economically, this is inevitable."

HEADLINE: Long March Of the Arms Contractors;
They Migrate South For Cheaper Labor in The Lower-Cost States

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: MARIETTA, Ga.

 BODY:
For years, the Lockheed Corporation centered its aircraft manufacturing in Burbank, Calif., where thousands of workers built prosperous lives on wages that reached as high as $20 an hour. That factory is closed now and wildflowers grow through crevices in the concrete that surrounds the shuttered buildings. The new heart of Lockheed's operations beats most strongly today here in Georgia, where the company makes its military planes with lower-cost labor.
The nation's manufacturers of military hardware, an industry that still employs nearly 1.5 million people, are migrating. Like Lockheed, they are transferring operations to Georgia, Colorado, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi and other low-cost states. In doing so, they are joining the rest of corporate America in its itinerant search for cheaper wages, fewer unions, less regulation and easier tax policies. And gradually the South and the Rocky Mountains are becoming the new centers for military spending, edging aside the Northeast and the Pacific Coast. 
 "As we consolidate and become more efficient, we do think of things we never would have thought of in the past, like states where we can be more competitive," said Daniel M. Tellep, chairman of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the recently created amalgam of Lockheed and the Martin Marietta Corporation that forms the nation's largest military contractor. "In many cases that means going to the South and the Rocky Mountain states."
The Pentagon may be spending less to develop and manufacture weapons and equipment -- $70 billion in the 1994 fiscal year versus an inflation-adjusted $137 billion in 1985 -- but the South and the Rocky Mountains are getting an ever bigger share of the declining outlay.
The shift is even more striking compared with 1976, before the Reagan arms buildup, when the outlay for weapons and research was not very different from today, adjusted for inflation. But the shares going to the Southeast and the Rocky Mountain regions have doubled compared with 1976, while the Northeast and the Pacific Coast regions have lost 15 percent or more.
"To be a bigger share of a shrinking pie is not the best position to be in, but it is better than being a shrinking share of a shrinking pie," said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "Because of the shifting, the defense cutback has not been a blow to the economies of the South."
That cannot be said of Long Island, where the Grumman Corporation, now Northrop Grumman, was once the biggest employer. It stopped making any planes at all there last year, shifting what was left to Florida, Georgia and Louisiana. Nor is it true for the vast region in and around Los Angeles. Hughes Electronics, for example, recently transferred missile operations from Southern California to Arizona and Colorado, shifting hundreds of jobs in the process.
In Massachusetts, the Raytheon Company, still the state's largest employer, is threatening to transfer missile work to Tennessee -- if the state does not grant the sort of concessions that Tennessee offers.
"We may end up being forced to go elsewhere, if we can't get $600 million out of our cost base in Massachusetts," said Elizabeth Allen, Raytheon's chief spokeswoman, happy to use the news media to pressure for concessions.
All this represents a striking turnabout. Until the late 1980's, military contractors stayed pretty much in place, serving as a bulwark in high-cost regions that lost other manufacturers. The Pentagon's generous contracts shielded them from the intense competition that drove so many other industries to cost-cutting and migration. But with the cold war's end, the Defense Department urged the contractors to slash costs so that it could buy as much as possible with a shrinking budget.
"Ten years ago, there was a lot of money spread around in defense and you did not have to look for ways to cut costs," said Al Hansen, a Lockheed vice president. "Now we meet weekly to do this."
The corporate response is making the Federal Government an increasingly visible participant in a movement that contributes to wage stagnation in the United States. "The cold war is over and the Pentagon should get the most bang for its declining budget," said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But on the other hand, the President keeps pushing for higher wages, and this strategy works against that."
There are other consequences. The movement exacerbates the already intense bidding war among the states to attract companies and jobs by offering tax concessions and outright gifts. It is a competition that some economists label a giveaway of public goods: schools, roads, municipal airports, public transportation and the like. The huge Lockheed plant here is soon to receive such a gift from the Cobb County government. The county will pay for a multimillion-dollar rail underpass so that traffic will not be held up when trains cross the factory's property on a line now at ground level.
Pentagon officials, however, say this largess serves the needs of national defense. They say they must find ways to buy enough weaponry despite their shrinking budget, and if competition among the states helps, so be it. The Pentagon, in fact, has given Lockheed, Hughes and other contractors tens of millions of dollars to help cover the costs of moving and consolidating.
"It makes economic sense to consider sharing the short-term costs to realize the long-term savings," Joshua Gotbaum, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security, said at a recent Congressional hearing.
Nothing illustrates the post-cold-war migration and its impact more clearly than the decision by Lockheed to shift its principal aeronautic operations from Burbank to Marietta. This Atlanta suburb has boomed in recent years with the construction of federally financed interstate highways -- five and six lanes in either direction -- that tie Cobb County to Atlanta and the rest of Georgia. Lining the interstates are mile after mile of shopping centers, gallerias, hotels, office buildings and one-story factories. Although Sherman fought here en route to Atlanta, the landscape has been so transformed that Cobb County seems to lack almost any history before the 1970's.
"We have roads going everywhere," said Timothy Mescon, dean of the new business school at Kennesaw State College, itself a young and rapidly growing university just off Interstate 75.
The Lockheed plant, a square half-mile of floor space next to Dobbins Air Force Base, dates from the dark ages before interstates. That is typical of the major military contractors, who are not building new plants as much as they are consolidating into what were once satellite operations. Lockheed Martin still has a big presence in California, including a top-secret advance design operation in Palmdale. But the center of its aeronautical operations has shifted to the South and the Mid-Atlantic.
The plant here, which Lockheed acquired in 1955, first to make C-130 propeller-driven transports for the Air Force and then giant C-5 jet transports, took on new life in the 1990's with the arrival of the P-3, a propeller plane designed to hunt submarines. It had been built in Burbank for years. Not long after, Lockheed transferred a host of administrators to Georgia and then its research teams, bringing a thousand engineering jobs here. "We de-staffed California in engineering, and staffed Georgia," said Mr. Hansen, the Lockheed vice president.
The engineers, many of them newly hired Georgians earning on average 10 percent less than the California scale, are now developing Lockheed Martin's next weapon, the F-22, a 21st-century supersonic stealth fighter for the Air Force. If the Pentagon gives the go-ahead, the planes are to be assembled here, rather than Burbank, where the prototypes were made. In anticipation, bright yellow tape sets off an acre of empty floor space reserved for the F-22.
Just having the F-22 in Georgia might persuade Congress and the Pentagon to pay for it. "Southerners have traditionally been more pro-defense than people in other parts of the country," said William B. Bullock, a Lockheed vice president.
Fitting this mold, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who represents Cobb County in Congress, campaigns for the Pentagon to buy Lockheed's planes: the F-22, more P-3's, C-5's and the C-130J, an updated version of the C-130.
Aides to Mr. Gingrich consult regularly with Lockheed officials, according to Allan Lipsett, the Speaker's Georgia press secretary. "I think Mr. Gingrich considers it a good idea for defense contractors to come to the South," he said.
Lockheed's payroll here has remained at 11,000 since 1989, or 3,000 more than would have been the case without the exodus from California, Mr. Bullock estimates. Still, Martha Mossman, who works on the C-130 line, is nervous. In 15 years at the plant, neither she nor her husband, Donald, has ever been laid off from Lockheed. But he recently received a "warning" that this could happen to him in June, costing him a union job that pays $18 an hour, far more than he could earn elsewhere in Georgia.
Without new funds, work is winding down. Only four partly assembled P-3's remain on the line, their unpainted fuselages covered in steel scaffolding, and the C-130 line is also slowing. "We have been doing a lot of traveling," said Mrs. Mossman, ticking off recent tourist excursions to Hawaii and Mexico. "But this year we aren't going anywhere."
Lockheed is Cobb County's largest employer, representing nearly 6 percent of the work force. With so many new companies arriving here, Lockheed's impact on the economy is gradually declining. Still, any cutback would hurt if only because for every Lockheed job, three more exist at subcontractors and suppliers within 100 miles of the plant, Mr. Bullock estimates.
That, too, whittles away at labor costs. The Aidcorp, for example, a machine shop in rural Clayton, Ga., less than two hours away on the new highways, has doubled its employment since 1990 -- to 35 workers -- on the strength of the parts Georgia's military contractors farm out, particularly Lockheed. Its best-paid workers earn only $13 an hour, with nothing for sick days.
For all the growing concentration of military work here, however, the question remains: Will it stay? After all, Lockheed Martin also makes F-16 fighters in Fort Worth, having recently acquired that similarly huge and underused plant from General Dynamics.
"If we don't get orders for the C-130J and the other planes we make here, then we would move to Fort Worth in a wink," Mr. Bullock said. "And if the opposite happens, we could close Fort Worth and move the F-16 here."

HEADLINE: France Threatens to Withdraw Bosnia Force

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 18

 BODY:
France, in the last stages of a presidential election campaign, threatened today to withdraw its 4,530 peacekeeping troops from Bosnia unless its diplomatic partners and the United Nations could insure their safety. The Government also demanded that the belligerents return to the negotiating table and extend a cease-fire set to expire at the end of this month.
A statement issued by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, struggling to stay in the presidential race until the decisive runoff vote on May 7, said that if the safety of the peacekeepers could not be assured, France "would be forced to decide on a withdrawal of the French soldiers in Bosnia." The statement was issued after a special Cabinet session that was called after the killing of two French soldiers in Sarajevo last weekend. 
 Foreign Minister Alain Juppe flew to New York and asked the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, for an emergency session of the Security Council to discuss what French officials said was a deteriorating security situation in Bosnia.
"What we are looking for is action by the international community to avert the necessity of a withdrawal, not an excuse to leave," an aide to Mr. Juppe said.
But with some members of Mr. Balladur's conservative Government supporting him in the elections to succeed President Francois Mitterrand next month and others like Mr. Juppe supporting Jacques Chirac, the Mayor of Paris, politicians of all parties seemed intent on sending a message of reassurance to the voters.
At the United Nations headquarters in New York, Mr. Juppe denied that there was any "linkage between the French position on Bosnia and the electoral campaign," adding that French soldiers were being transformed into "hostages."
In a thinly veiled attack on the Bosnian Government, Mr. Juppe said peacekeeping troops in the Balkans were "assassinated, murdered sometimes by the same people they are trying to protect."
On Saturday, French television showed a brief film clip of one of the two French soldiers, wearing the blue helmet of the United Nations force, dying after being hit by snipers' bullets in Sarajevo. But with millions of people relaxing over the three-day holiday weekend, the incident neither transfixed the country nor transformed the election campaign, which has concentrated on domestic economic issues.
Today, with the United Nations saying the sharpshooters could have been from either the Bosnian Government or the Bosnian Serb side, Mr. Balladur's office said France would protest to both the Bosnian and Serbian authorities.
"The continuing degradation of the conditions in which the forces of the United Nations are currently performing their missions seriously endangers the security of the blue helmets, and could eventually call these missions into question," a statement from the Prime Minister's office said.
France, which has lost 33 soldiers in the former Yugoslavia, has repeatedly raised the possibility of withdrawal, most recently after the United States stopped enforcing the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government in November. NATO and the United Nations later drew up contingency plans for a withdrawal of the entire 23,600-member United Nations force from Bosnia after deciding not to use air strikes to halt a Bosnian Serb offensive against the Muslim enclave of Bihac.
Mr. Chirac, who is expected to emerge from the first round of presidential voting on Sunday as the front-runner in the runoff two weeks later, has said a withdrawal of French troops from Bosnia should be considered only as a last resort. On Monday, he called on the United Nations and the NATO alliance to threaten air strikes if the warring parties in Bosnia did not agree to extend their cease-fire.
The Socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, criticized the Government for talking openly about withdrawal and said it undermined the chances of achieving a negotiated solution.
Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of the right-wing National Front, said France should stop being a martyr and pull its troops out of Bosnia before disaster struck. Philippe de Villiers, another rightist candidate, said, "We cannot go on allowing them to be shot at like rabbits."

HEADLINE: WMS to Get Bally Gaming in Stock Swap

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
WMS Industries said yesterday that it had agreed in principle to acquire Bally Gaming International Inc., a producer of slot machines and video poker equipment, in a deal valued at about $127 million.
Under a stock exchange agreement, Bally Gaming shareholders will receive six-tenths of a share of WMS stock for each share of Bally Gaming, although the exchange ratio could increase if warranted, the companies said. Based on yesterday's closing stock prices, Bally Gaming stock would be worth about $11.85 a share under the plan 
 Shares of Bally Gaming, which is based in Las Vegas, Nev., rose yesterday by $1.75 a share, to $10.50, in Nasdaq trading. Stock of WMS, which is based in Chicago and also makes gambling machines and coin-operated amusement equipment, fell 37.5 cents, to $19.75, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock market's failure to further bid up Bally Gaming stock may reflect a provision in the agreement that gives each company time to conduct a due diligence review before reaching a definitive agreement.
Bruce Turner, a gambling industry analyst with Salomon Brothers, said that he advised clients yesterday to sell their Bally Gaming holdings rather than wait for the deal to be completed.
Mr. Turner said he was concerned about several factors, including declining demand for gambling equipment in North America, licensing issues facing Bally Gaming in Louisiana and WMS's current absence of a license to sell gambling equipment in Nevada.
"It appears that aggregate demand for casino gaming equipment will decline or be flat over the next few years," Mr. Turner said.
The last few months have not been kind to Bally Gaming, which was spun off in 1992 as a free-standing company by the Bally Entertainment Corporation, an operator of casinos and health clubs. Last year, 17 suspected organized crime figures or associates were indicted in New Orleans on Federal racketeering charges that they secretly controlled a Louisiana distributor of video poker machines made by Bally Gaming.
Bally Gaming was described by Federal prosecutors as the "victim" in that scheme. But in January, the president of the Louisiana Economic Development and Gaming Corporation, a regulatory agency, denied Bally Gaming a license to sell gambling equipment to a huge casino in New Orleans, arguing that Bally had allowed itself to become "infiltrated" by organized crime.
That ruling, however, was overturned by the agency's directors, who awarded the company a temporary license. But Bally Gaming officials will still undergo further scrutiny before a final license is issued and gambling regulators in New Jersey and elsewhere have visited Louisiana to collect documents as part of their review of Bally Gaming's activities in that state.
Lou Tavano, a spokesman for Bally Gaming, said that the company believed the Louisiana dispute was resolved and would have no further impact. But Mr. Turner, the analyst, said that if the issue persisted WMS might inherit any problems.
"Those issues just don't disappear if there is any acquisition," he said. "Anytime you have licensing related issues in gaming you need to be careful."

HEADLINE: In Test of School-Voucher Idea, the Sky's Not Falling but Neither Is Manna

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN 

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE

 BODY:
Five years into the nation's only school-voucher program, most parents say they are satisfied with the plan, which sends their children to private school at state expense, and attendance is up slightly. But academic performance remains about the same for these students as for public school students.
Despite the mixed results, the Governor of Wisconsin, Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican, has announced that he wants to expand the program -- now limited to 1.5 percent of the district's students -- and to allow parochial schools to participate. And from New Jersey to California, there are renewed calls for voucher programs as a check on deteriorating urban public schools. 
 The theory behind vouchers is that competition from private schools will put pressure on public schools to improve and give parents the ability to send their children to whatever school they want. Advocates have predicted that academic performance will soar, while opponents warn that the voucher plan will gut public school systems.
In Milwaukee, neither has happened. The program is so small in scale that it is hard to draw conclusions about whether vouchers are the answer for failing school systems. But this city does offer an interesting laboratory because of the racial tension that pervades the system and makes many black parents distrust the public school district.
For years, vouchers have been among the most provocative proposals for giving parents, particularly those living in troubled urban districts, more choice in their children's schooling. Transfers within districts have long been accepted. And many states, including Wisconsin, are experimenting with autonomous public schools, or charter schools, run by teachers and parents.
But vouchers have been rejected in all three states that have put them to a vote. Last year the Puerto Rico Supreme Court struck down a two-year-old voucher program that included parochial schools. Last week, however, the Ohio House of Representatives passed a voucher bill and sent it to the State Senate.
Milwaukee's 97,000 public school students are mostly black or Hispanic and largely poor. The system remains under a 1976 desegregation order that mandated busing. Most of the teachers and their union's leaders are white, a situation that stirs deep resentment in this largely segregated city. In the current academic year, the system has a budget of $735 million.
The superintendent, Dr. Howard Fuller, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is a former hospital labor organizer and was an administrator at Marquette University. He attended Milwaukee schools and holds a doctorate in education, but has never taught in secondary schools.
Although Dr. Fuller once argued for having a separate black school district, he now maintains close ties with the mostly white business leaders of the city. Both he and business officials believe in less bureaucracy and more autonomy for the schools.
Milwaukee's school system long suffered under the the widespread perception of failure. Forty percent of its students drop out between the 9th and 12th grades -- considerably higher than a district like New York City, which last year reported a dropout rate of 18 percent.
But sprinkled throughout the Milwaukee system are dozens of schools, some specialized, that are regarded as successful. And surveys have shown that most parents are happy with their children's education.
The voucher program overcame court challenges in its first two years -- primarily because of its limited size and narrow structure. The vouchers, worth $3,209 this year, are available only to families with incomes below $25,900 for a family of four, a figure that is 1.75 times the Federal poverty level.
The enrollment limitation means that 1,450 children are eligible. But only 830 children are enrolled this year. The program has never reached its maximum enrollment, in part because there is more demand for seats in elementary schools than are available. Last year 23 percent of the participants left for various reasons. Governor Thompson wants to expand the program to allow 3 percent, or 3,500 students, to participate.
Tuition at the private schools ranges from $1,000 to $3,950. Any participating school has to accept the vouchers as full payment, and if the tuition is lower than $3,209 the school keeps the difference.
Only 12 of the city's 23 private, nonsectarian schools participate in the program. Most that do participate have deliberately limited the number of vouchers they accept, usually far below the 65 percent of enrollment allowed.
Highland Community School, a Montessori program operating in a big Victorian house, has kept its voucher enrollment at just under a third of its 75 students. The school sat out the first two years of the program, worried about becoming dependent on voucher money, possible interference from the state and maintaining racial balance.
"It's been our goal all the time to have a balance, to have an integrated school both economically and racially," said the principal, Tim Souers.
The voucher program has siphoned $2.4 million out of $310 million in state aid. That amount is so small that even officials with the teachers' union, the Milwaukee Teachers Education Association, concede that it has not hurt the schools. But the union did oppose the initial voucher plan, and opposes the Governor's expansion plan.
What the union has supported is a quasi-charter school within the district, overseen by a community board that has broad powers to hire and fire personnel.
"Our members understand that public education as a whole is suffering in this country," said Linda Gaston-Mounger, a spokeswoman for the union. "They have been wanting to try innovations in the classroom in an effort to reach these students. And it's a sincere effort."
Academically, the voucher program's results have been mixed, according to a report made public last December whose principal author was Prof. John Witte of the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
Attendance among voucher students was slightly higher, up 2 percent. The report found great fluctuation in standardized test scores over the four years for both groups. Over all, however, the study concluded that voucher students performed about the same as their counterparts in math and reading -- in some cases, the difference was as little as a one-tenth of 1 percent.
The report and Professor Witte have been sharply criticized by those who support the voucher plan.
State Representative Annette Polly Williams, a Milwaukee Democrat who shepherded the voucher plan through the Wisconsin Legislature, said the findings were unduly negative and did not take into account the positive feedback she said she heard from parents.
Ms. Williams and other proponents assert that by using vouchers, private schools are able to educate children for less than the $7,031 that Milwaukee spends on each of its public school students.
And an audit of the voucher program by the state's Legislative Audit Bureau said Professor Witte's conclusions were too harsh, given the limited data available. "In fact, no conclusion can be drawn," the legislative report said.
But if the academic impact on students is debatable, many of their parents are clearly thrilled and are getting involved -- some schools actually require, and get, parents' volunteer efforts.
Bernadette Williams said that without the voucher program, her two children would be in public schools and she would be worried about them. Instead, Deandre, 7, and Kendra, 5, attend Urban Day School, where Ms. Williams volunteers so much time that many students believe she is a member of the staff.
Urban Day is a 28-year-old school for kindergarten through the eighth grade. Its nearly 600 students must wear uniforms.
"This school is like family to me," Ms. Williams said. "We do have input into whatever's going on."
Tony Higgins took his daughter Chronda out of public school two years ago, when she completed the third grade, and enrolled her in Urban Day after he clashed with her teacher about a series of issues, including the depiction of Christopher Columbus as the discoverer of America. "As African-Americans, we have little say in this system," he said. "There is a lot going on in the public schools that I don't agree with."
Mr. Higgins, now a college student, said he likes being able to walk into the school at any time to speak to his daughter's teacher. "I talk to the teacher four or five times a week," he said.
Some students also say they enjoy the private schools.
Johnish Nuell, 13, said that at her former school she had been suspended so often for talking in class and cursing the teacher that she lost count. At Urban Day she still has occasional disagreements with her teachers. But she also makes the "avid achiever" list, a half-step below honor roll.
"In public schools, the way the teachers teach, they don't keep you focused," she said. "The way they teach you here, they make sure you're focused and that you understand."
Vouchers have been a financial boon for most of the private schools that receive them. When the program began, four of the original seven schools were in serious financial difficulty, according to the Witte report. One went bankrupt and closed in the program's first year.
But another school, Bruce Guadalupe, recently moved from its old, cramped headquarters into a new, $3 million building. Money from the 188 voucher students (out of 356) was a help. Urban Day, with 259 voucher students out of 596, expanded its early childhood program. And Highland Community officials may open a second school.
But even Ms. Williams, the state legislator, is leery of opening the program to parochial schools, as Governor Thompson has proposed in his 1996 budget. She said she feared that the parochial schools would endanger the existing voucher program.
And voucher opponents continue to maintain that the use of vouchers can only lead to the destruction of the public school system. Americans should protect the idea of a public system as one that is constant and guaranteed to all, said Prof. Tony Baez of the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, who is a longtime advocate of changing the educational system.
"All this stuff in educational reform can be transitional in nature," he said. "The only thing we have to hang onto, and to hold accountable, are the public schools. But that doesn't mean it has to be a bureaucratic mess."

HEADLINE: City Council Orders Review of 33 Business Improvement Districts

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The City Council has ordered the 33 business improvement districts in New York City to open their books for an investigation that seeks to determine whether they have amassed too much power without adequate oversight.
The review, called for in a letter to the districts' directors from Herbert Berman, chairman of the council's Finance Committee, seems mainly directed at one of the largest districts, the Grand Central Partnership, which has been the subject of growing scrutiny in recent weeks over allegations of financial wrongdoing and assaults on the homeless. 
 Since the first district was set up more than a decade ago as a means for business owners to clean, patrol and upgrade their neighborhoods, some officials and outside critics have grown uneasy about the power they have amassed as self-governing organizations.
They have broad authority to tax property owners, but while city officials sit on their governing boards, they operate largely outside the realm of government regulation.
"These are quasi-governmental entities, and the time has come to look at whether the rules of government ought to apply to B.I.D.'s," Mr. Berman said.
In an April 6 letter to all the B.I.D.'s, he demanded a broad new review of their books, including their incomes, the salaries their executives receive, and the contracts they sign to perform neighborhood services.
Yesterday, at an unusual meeting of the leaders of 27 of the city's 33 districts, several participants proposed the creation of an association to help govern the districts as a way of pre-empting more restrictive moves by the city. The meeting was closed to the public.
According to several leaders who attended, a chief concern of the district officials was that they distance themselves from the problems facing the Grand Central Partnership and its embattled president, Daniel Biederman. Mr. Biederman also heads the 34th Street Partnership, which covers the area around Madison Square Garden, and the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation.
Mr. Biederman's districts have won wide acclaim for completing extensive improvements in midtown, including the restoration of Bryant Park; providing new street signs and lights, and persuading homeless people to leave Grand Central Terminal.
But he, and particularly the Grand Central district, have also been the subject of harsh scrutiny recently. An outside audit conducted in 1994 found that Mr. Biederman and his staff had devoted time -- and had loaned small amounts of the Partnership's money -- to form a new business improvement district in Jersey City.
Last week, several former employees of a homeless outreach program operated by the partnership said they had been part of a "goon squad" that the partnership had to beat up and forcibly remove homeless people from bank automated teller machine vestibules. Partnership officials have labeled the accusations as "fiction."
Yesterday, Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan borough president, said she would soon seek an emergency meeting of the Grand Central Partnership.
"The purpose is to discuss the recent allegations and the proper role of board members of a quasi-public entity that has substantial authority to dispense what are essentially tax dollars," Ms. Messinger said.
Mr. Biederman did not attend the meeting of district executives yesterday, but sent two of his senior managers in his place. Through a spokesman, Bruce Cohen, he declined comment on the meeting or Mr. Berman's City Council review.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Berman said his letter had set in motion a process that may lead to City Council hearings on the accountability of the districts and even to recommendations that changes be made in a 1981 law that established their financial structure.
Once a business improvement district is formed, property owners within its boundaries are assessed money by the city, which in turn passes the proceeds back to the districts' managers to pay for their services. But besides approving their annual budgets, the city exercises little oversight.
"When these things got started we thought it best that the city not be intrusive," Mr. Berman said. "Lately we've had a lot of complaints."
Although he declined to elaborate, the complaints referred to by Mr. Berman, and discussed at length at yesterday's meeting have been directly almost entirely against Mr. Biederman's Grand Central Partnership.
The meeting was presided over by Rudy Washington, the city's Commissioner of Business Services, and Barbara Wolf, the assistant commissioner who is the city's principal monitor of the districts' operations.
Although the meeting had been called weeks earlier, before the allegations involving the Grand Central Partnership emerged, Ms. Wolf said the discussion was dominated by questions of how the districts could create better ways to regulate themselves.
"It was a healthy clearing of the air," she said. If the district officials want to create a new organization, or new set of standards, to regulate themselves "we would heartily endorse the idea," she said.
Several of the executives who attended the meeting said the meeting reflected wide agreement that their efforts to improve their neighborhoods may be hurt because of the allegations against the Grand Central Partnership.
Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, said most of her colleagues at the meeting agreed on the need for greater self-regulation but would resist more extensive controls by the city.
Nonetheless, she said the recent questions about the Grand Central district reflected a need for the city, through the representatives who sit on the districts' boards, to monitor the affairs of the districts more aggressively.
"This could all have been avoided if the mayor's representatives had stepped up to the bar and demanded more accountability," she said.

HEADLINE: Earnings Results Differ Broadly for Several Big Banks

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Volatile trading markets led to strikingly different results among several large banking companies that reported first-quarter earnings yesterday.
Citicorp's profits surged largely because of increased revenue from currency trading, while the Bankers Trust New York Corporation posted a huge loss from its previously disclosed trading problems in emerging markets as well as a charge for a cost-cutting campaign. Chemical Banking had weak trading results, but its cost-cutting efforts helped increase its profits as well. 
 And Banc One, the huge regional banking chain, said earnings were off because of bad bets on interest rates over the last two years.
 Citicorp, the biggest banking company in the country, earned $829 million, or $1.53 a share, in the first quarter, up 50 percent from the quarter a year earlier. In the quarter a year ago, the company took an accounting charge related to retiree benefits. Ignoring the charge, Citicorp's earnings increased 36 percent.
The results surpassed Wall Street expectations of $1.39. Citicorp recorded $85 million in nonrecurring gains from the sale of real estate in emerging markets and restructuring of bank debt in Ecuador.
It also reported unexpectedly strong trading revenue of $344 million, mostly from currency trading, compared with $71 million a year ago. Citicorp is the largest currency dealer in the world and benefited from the increased volume prompted by the slide of the dollar against most leading currencies.
Notably, Citicorp said it broke even on its North American commercial real estate portfolio for the first time since the real estate crisis of the early 1990's. It lost $76 million a year ago.
Citicorp posted a return on equity of 18.8 percent, a relatively high rate of profitability for a commercial bank.
 
 
Chemical Bank
 Profits at Chemical Banking, the country's third-largest banking company, increased 21 percent in the first quarter, to $385 million, or $1.46 a share.The results included an after-tax gain of $51 million from the sale of its interest in a bank in the Philippines. The results exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
 Unlike Citicorp, Chemical said its trading revenue fell sharply to $56 million in the first quarter, compared with $185 million a year go. Chemical said the sharp drop was attributed to price drops in securities from emerging markets and the decline of the dollar against European currencies.
 Chemical's cost-cutting program reduced its overall expenses to $1.25 billion from $1.33 billion in the fourth quarter of 1994.
 
 
Bankers Trust
 Bankers Trust said it lost $157 million in the quarter, mainly because of losses from its derivatives business, compared with earnings of $164 million in the quarter a year earlier.
The loss of $1.22 a share was somewhat better than the $1.67 a share that analysts had expected it to lose.
Bankers Trust said it lost $122 million from selling derivatives to customers, compared with a profit in that area of $114 million in the first quarter last year.
The main source of those losses resulted from the devaluation of the Mexican peso and lack of liquidity for emerging markets securities. Derivatives, specially designed investments linked to the performance of an underlying asset or market, allow customers to speculate on or hedge themselves from the risk of various financial markets. When Bankers Trust sold derivatives based on Mexican pesos, for example, to offset its own risk it would have to trade in the peso every day. When markets are volatile this hedging can be difficult to accomplish.
Bankers Trust also said there had been a decline in demand for the higher-margin derivative products in which it had specialized. As a result of this downturn, the company said it would eliminate 1,000 full-time and 400 part-time jobs -- 10 percent of its total work force -- and would take a $35 million after-tax charge to cover severance costs. This is meant to cut the bank's costs by $200 million in 1995 and $275 million in 1996.
Profits from nearly all of Bankers Trust's other businesses were down sharply.
 
 
Banc One
 Banc One said profits declined 7 percent, to $303 million. The company earned 75 cents a share, about what Wall Street analysts expected.
 Banc One has been suffering because it had locked in low interest rates in 1993 and 1994, largely using derivatives. Because interest rates fell in the first quarter, the bank's unrealized derivative losses declined to $717 million on March 31 from $1.3 billion at the end of 1994. Nonetheless, its interest margin, the rate it earns on loans minus what it pays on deposits fell sharply to 5.33 percent in the first quarter from 6.05 percent a year ago.

HEADLINE: Steinway & Sons Is Sold for $100 Million

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Steinway & Sons, the piano manufacturer that has been a New York institution since its founding by Heinrich E. Steinway in 1853, was sold yesterday for $100 million to the Selmer Company, a maker of musical instruments.
A private company that is probably most famous for its Selmer saxophone, an instrument used by both amateur and professional musicians including President Clinton and Kenny G, Selmer is controlled by two young former Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bankers who purchased their stake in the company in 1993. 
 Under the terms of the transaction, Selmer and Steinway will continue to operate as independent entities, with no changes in management, plant locations, marketing strategy or total employment. Each company employs about 1,000 people.
"We are very excited," said Dana Messina, who along with his partner, Kyle Kirkland, controls Selmer. "We think it is quite an honor to become part of the team with Steinway."
Steinway has been producing concert grand and baby grand pianos for many of the world's most accomplished pianists from its factory in Long Island City, Queens, since shortly after the turn of the century. The sale marks the third time in its illustrious history that Steinway has changed hands.
In 1972, Henry Z. Steinway, the founder's great-grandson, sold the company to CBS for an undisclosed price, ending family control. Then, in 1985, a group of investors led by John P. Birmingham and his brother Robert M. Birmingham, bought Steinway for a price rumored to be in excess of $50 million.
In an interview, John Birmingham said "personal reasons" prompted the group to seek a buyer for Steinway about four months ago.
Without disclosing what his group paid for the company, he said the $100 million sale price "beats inflation by a little bit" over what was paid a decade ago.
Still, people familiar with Steinway and the piano industry's problems, said they were amazed the company fetched that much.
Over the last 10 years, critics have been quick to fault Steinway for what they say is a decline in the quality of its new pianos, which currently sell for as much as $75,800. In addition, the company has had to fight what some contend is a decline in demand, as well as compete with a huge supply of older Steinway pianos
The $100 million price is "an extraordinary number, and does not seem rational," said D. W. Fostle, author of "Steinway Saga," a book about the company to be released by Scribner's on May 1.
According to Mr. Fostle, sales of upright pianos in the United States have fallen since 1988 by more than 40 percent, and show few signs of coming back.
Competing with the huge pool of surviving Steinways is another serious problem.
"It's as if every Ford built since 1903 is still on the road and is as good as a Lincoln Continental," Mr. Fostle said. "There is no way to get rid of those pianos."
In the interview, Mr. Birmingham acknowledged that the piano market in the United States was mature, and that the company's biggest competition was from "our own used pianos." But he said the quality problems had been solved.
In coming years, Mr. Birmingham said the company was likely to find demand from aging baby boomers, as well as foreign markets.
Steinway employs about 500 people in the United States. The company also has a manufacturing plant in Hamburg, Germany. Last year the company had sales of a little more than $100 million.
Selmer, based in Elkhart, Ind., recorded earnings of a little less than $3 million on revenue of $101.1 million last year.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Argentine President Vetoes Patent Measure

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, April 18

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from the United States over the protection of intellectual property, President Carlos Saul Menem vetoed a key piece of drug-patent legislation today.
While Argentina currently has no protection for pharmaceutical patents, United States officials say that the legislation would not have adequately protected the patents of American pharmaceutical companies and that it violated provisions of the new world trade agreement. 
 They warned that approval of the law could have led to trade sanctions against Argentina and a loss of foreign investment capital.
Mr. Menem's veto sends the legislation back to the Argentine Congress, where it is expected to be altered to comply with provisions of the trade agreement.
Without such legal protection, drug companies in Argentina are free to infringe foreign patents. The United States pharmaceutical industry contends that it loses as much as $300 million a year in Argentina because of pirating of patents. Drug sales in Argentina are $4.5 billion a year.
At Washington's urging, Argentina, which has laws that protect copyrights, trademarks and the patents of inventions and processes, has been trying for several years to pass a law that would extend such protection to pharmaceutical products.
But more than a dozen drug patent proposals have been blocked or delayed in Congress by opposition from Argentine drug makers and legislators, who maintain that such patent protection would force the local manufacturers out of the market and cause a rise in drug prices.
The proposed patent law has been a political problem for Mr. Menem, who is seeking re-election in May and has had to choose between upsetting opposition politicians, who warned him not to give in to American protests, or to face the possibility of sanctions from Washington.
In the end, he chose to veto the most objectionable parts of the proposed legislation. Mr. Menem said he had vetoed provisions that conflicted with the trade accord, including a requirement that the patent holder manufacture the products in Argentina and that Argentine companies be granted an eight-year grace period when they would pay no royalties for using other companies' inventions.
"If the United States takes this position and Europe as well, what can we do?" Mr. Menem said in support of the veto.
Government officials said the President also feared the effect of trade sanctions on the financial markets here, which have suffered this year in the wake of the Mexican financial crisis.
Jorge Fraccia, executive director of the Argentine Chamber for Specialized Medicines, representing international drug companies that do business in Argentina, said his group was pleased with Mr. Menem's decision to send the legislation back to Congress. "We want to strike an equilibrium between our interests and those of the national industry," he said, "but overall we need the protection of our inventions."
Some of the top American-owned drug makers involved are Schering-Plough S.A.; Abbott Laboratories Argentina; Johnson & Johnson de Argentina; Dow Quimica Argentina, a unit of the Dow Chemical Company; Pfizer S.A., and Cyanamid de Argentina, part of American Home Products.
Pablo Challu, head of a trade group representing local Argentine companies, said that despite Mr. Menem's veto, his group would continue to push for the proposed law. Several legislators said they were building enough support for the two-thirds margin in Congress needed to override the veto.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Are Mixed As 30-Year Bonds Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
With the exception of some long maturities, prices of Treasury securities rose again yesterday, much as they had on Monday.
A surprising drop in housing starts during March fueled investors' optimism that the economy is slowing and inflation is subdued, but early gains in the credit markets evaporated under mounting concern over the weak dollar and rising commodity prices. 
 Housing starts fell 7.9 percent, to 1.211 million units on an annualized basis, the lowest since March 1993; economists were looking for a rise to 1.36 million units. The report minimized the chance that the Fed will raise interest rates at the next meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in May.
The soft housing number put the bulls in the market back on track in the short- and intermediate-maturity ranges.
The 30-year bond fell 6/32 , to a price of 10226/32 , to yield 7.39 percent, up from 7.37 percent yesterday. But shorter-maturity bills rates were down an average of three basis points, outperforming the long end of the market for the second straight day.
Long bonds were under pressure from a rise in crude oil prices, which was attributed to the continuing weakness of the dollar; oil is priced in dollars. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the spot contract for May delivery climbed above $20 a barrel.
There was some concern that the housing numbers might not hold up, since the March report could easily be revised, said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio, and that concern might have limited yesterday's gains.
Chris Moore, senior fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, a financial markets analysis firm, said that he was surprised that the market did not get more lift from the housing starts data, but added that the afternoon retreat resulted from concern over the dollar and rising commodity prices.
Concern over the dollar, Mr. Moore said, was tied to comments by Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown in an interview with CNBC, suggesting that trade sanctions against the Japanese were possible. "Basically it is more and more of the same type of pushing between the two countries," Mr. Moore said. "The auto issue needs an early resolution. We need to see the two countries more amiable towards each other."
Mr. Moore said today's trade balance numbers for February were more likely to remind the market about trade talks between the two countries and weigh against the dollar.
"Essentially the market is very much in a neutral position, and needs to see compelling evidence about the economy" Mr. Moore said, adding that no such data were expected this week. Until that happens, Mr. Moore expects the yield on the long bond to move between 7.27 percent and 7.50 percent.
Yesterday the Fed's vice chairman, Alan S. Blinder, said in a Dow Jones interview that the housing sector was in "downshift," and was not a "disaster." He said he saw signs of slowing "almost across the board" and believes that a soft landing for the economy was a rather plausible outcome. Analysts say this view supports a steady Fed policy outlook for the present.
Municipal bonds were little chaged as investors took on one of the biggest single-day sales of new debt securities this year. States, cities and municipalities brought about $1.6 billion of new debt to market, with the day's largest sale a $325 million offering of Puerto Rico general obligation bonds priced through Lehman Brothers.
Traders noted that because the bonds were exempt from Federal, state and local taxes for all investors, they usually drew strong demand. That enabled underwriters to reprice the issue and lower yields about five basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
The bonds are priced to yield a maximum 5.85 percent for an issue due in 2024.
Other long maturities are priced to yield 5.823 percent for an issue due in 2022 and 5.65 percent in 2015. Shorter-maturity serial bonds are offered at prices to yield from 4.05 percent in 1996 to 4.70 percent in 2000; 5.15 percent in 2005; 5.45 percent in 2010, and 5.57 percent in 2013.

The Immigration Wave: A Plea to Hold It Back

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:

ALIEN NATION
Common Sense About America's Immigration Disaster
 By Peter Brimelow
 327 pages. Random House. $24.
Three years ago, Peter Brimelow, a writer for Forbes magazine and an immigrant from Britain, wrote a powerful and elegant article, published in National Review, in which he argued that current American immigration policies were leading to disaster. For many conservatives Mr. Brimelow's argument was a kind of heresy, because it contradicted the faith in immigration as an aspect of the free market. Liberals do not generally read National Review, but many of them have tended to view immigration as an enriching process, certainly a humanitarian requirement. 
 "Alien Nation" is Mr. Brimelow's book-length treatment of this subject. He has included more data this time around than he did in his National Review article, and yet some of the force of his original position has been strangely lost in the book. This is in part because Mr. Brimelow has opted for a choppy polemical style, with chapters broken up into brief sub-chapters and almost every page in turn festooned with indented, boldfaced or italicized segments in which Mr. Brimelow highlights certain points. Mr. Brimelow's personality also comes through, and it is entirely engaging. But the essay as a whole reads too much like one of those solicitations you get in the mail urging a contribution to a political cause.
Still, Mr. Brimelow has made a highly cogent presentation of what is going to be the benchmark case against immigration as it is currently taking place. Those who think that the system needs no fixing cannot responsibly hold to that position any longer unless they take Mr. Brimelow's urgent appeal for change into account.
His starting point is the Federal legislation in 1965 that, after a pause of nearly half a century, opened up the gates to the country's third great post-independence wave of immigration, one that is far larger in absolute numbers than its predecessors, and one that is conspicuously non-European and nonwhite in nature. Sometime in the middle of the next century, if current trends continue unchanged, whites will no longer be a majority, and blacks will no longer be the largest minority.
The strong racial element in current immigration has made it more than ever before a delicate subject. It is to Mr. Brimelow's credit that he attacks it head on, unapologetically. Among his most telling points is that a certain sentimental indulgence toward immigration, combined with the fear that to be opposed to it will be seen as racist, has blinded us to its disastrous consequences. Mr. Brimelow demonstrates what he sees as the looming danger with a concept called "the wedge." By 2050, he argues, the total American population will be nearly 400 million, of whom more than one-third ("a staggering 139 million people") will be post-1970 immigrants and their descendants.
To those of us who have seen neighborhoods revitalized by recent arrivals, and who have been heartened by the well-publicized success of some groups, especially the Asians, the obvious question is: what is so threatening about this wedge? Mr. Brimelow demonstrates (and he is well furnished with statistics) that by putting the stress on family reunification, rather than job skills, the country has made immigration a kind of civil right for the inhabitants of a small number of third world countries. And, he says, the new immigrants are disproportionately prone to poverty, crime and welfare dependency. In the great immigrant wave of 1890 to 1920, Mr. Brimelow argues, about one-third returned home. Largely because of the welfare system today, he says, that has changed: "The failures are no longer winnowed out. Instead, they are encouraged to stay -- at the expense of the American taxpayer."
Those most likely to be harmed by the current wave of immigration, moreover, are American-born blacks, Mr. Brimelow says. Citing the economist Simon Kuznets, he argues that a major reason for black progress in this century is that immigration virtually halted between 1920 and 1965. The new wave, it stands to reason, will drive blacks out of jobs. In addition, the emergence of new racial minorities -- especially Asian and Hispanic -- will fundamentally alter the nature of the American nation-state, which has for most of our history been white, with a strong black minority. What Mr. Brimelow calls "the new American Anti-Idea" will produce "a sort of bureaucratically regulated racial spoils system, rather like Lebanon before its ethnic divisions finally erupted."
Mr. Brimelow does very little on-the-scene reporting, which makes his stress on statistics seem not only abstract but also detached from the concrete human and spiritual reality involved in immigration. He is critical of the press, which, he argues, has given us only the bright side of the picture and left out other matters, like the fact that 25 percent of the prisoners in Federal penitentiaries are immigrants. And yet he himself passes rather too quickly over what the press has perhaps overstressed: the genuinely moving spectacle of millions of people making better lives for themselves in this country than they could in the countries they came from. He may also underestimate the force of assimilation, the eagerness of immigrants to adopt American values as their own.
But Mr. Brimelow also shows that America is not so much a country of immigration as it is one of "intermittent immigration." The periods where there was almost no immigration are more characteristic of our history than the briefer periods when the door was open. The lulls provided time to digest and Americanize the masses of strange and different newcomers. Mr. Brimelow's argument that without a lengthy new lull we will be in trouble is too persuasively made to be ignored.

HEADLINE: Settlement Plan for Orange County Gains

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 18

 BODY:
A settlement plan for the investment pool in Orange County, Calif., won the backing of all the investors today. The plan would give the investors about 77 cents on the dollar.
"It's the greatest thing that could have happened," said Jon Schotz, financial adviser to the committee representing pool participants. 
 Mr. Schotz, president of the Saybrook Capital Corporation, said the plan had the support of every city, school district and special district that invested in the Orange County portfolio.
The Anaheim city council and the Orange County Community Facilities Districts, which are controlled by the county Board of Supervisors, approved the plan late today. Earlier, the Yorba Linda Water District, Buena Park Redevelopment Agency and Municipal Water District of Orange County, which initially opposed the settlement, voted to accept the plan as the deadline for participation in the plan approached.
The settlement plan must still be approved by a bankruptcy court judge. A hearing has been set for May 2.
"It's a great first step but we still need to get through the court battle," Mr. Schotz said. "We're not done until the cash is disbursed."
Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 6 after sustaining losses of about $1.7 billion in its highly leveraged investment pool. The pool boasted impressive earnings for many years but its earnings depended on interest rates remaining low. When rates rose sharply last year, the county's investments suffered heavy losses.

HEADLINE: Lab Reports Major Gain in Superconductivity

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

 BODY:
The dream of manufacturing cables capable of conducting huge electrical currents without resistance and at relatively high temperatures has come closer to realization because of a new technology unveiled yesterday by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, scientists there said.
If the technology lives up to its promise, the scientists said, superconducting power lines, magnetically levitated trains, superconducting electricity storage rings and many other imagined marvels will at last become feasible. 
 The claim by Los Alamos is based on a new superconducting tape, invented at the Federal laboratory, that not only loses its resistance to electricity at a much higher temperature than do established superconductors but also can carry more than one million amperes of current per square centimeter of cross section. (By comparison, ordinary copper wire of the same thickness carries less than 800 amperes.)
Moreover, the new tape, unlike other high-temperature superconductor formulations, is flexible. It can be wrapped tightly around objects as thin as a soda straw, the Los Alamos scientists said, speaking at a meeting of the Materials Research Society in San Francisco.
Among possible uses for the new tape in the near future, said Dr. Dean E. Peterson, director of the laboratory's Superconductivity Technology Center, are highly efficient motors, and very small magnetic resonance imaging machines to replace some of the giant M.R.I. scanners used by hospitals.
Further, it may at last be economically feasible to build superconducting power lines that would save enormous amounts of otherwise wasted electrical energy, Dr. Peterson said.
Although Los Alamos has been working on superconducting tape for the last year, Dr. Peterson said, the breakthrough reported yesterday was achieved only during the last month. The laboratory, in New Mexico and operated by the Department of Energy, hopes to attract the interest of manufacturers in cooperative commercial ventures to exploit the extraordinary properties of the tape.
So far, he said, the laboratory has made lengths of the tape no longer than two inches, but scientists believe there is no major impediment to making longer pieces and eventually to manufacturing the tape in continuous lengths.
The phenomenon of superconductivity has been known since the beginning of the 20th century, but until fairly recently it could be achieved only by using liquid helium to chill certain metals to temperatures near absolute zero. (Helium, normally a gas, becomes a liquid at temperatures below minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit.)
Then, a decade ago, scientists discovered that a new class of ceramic materials based on copper oxide lose their resistance to electricity at much higher temperatures, even at the temperature of liquid nitrogen -- at or below minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit.
Keeping a wire or cable at the temperature of liquid helium is difficult and expensive, requiring a costly refrigerator for liquefying helium gas and a complicated insulation system to prevent the liquid from swiftly boiling away. Liquid nitrogen, some 130 degrees warmer, is much easier and cheaper to make, maintain and handle.
Most laboratories and manufacturers in recent years have been working with a "high-temperature" superconductor called yttrium-barium-copper oxide, sometimes shortened to YBCO (pronounced YIB-co).
But while YBCO is an excellent superconductor at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, it has some major disadvantages.
One problem is that YIBCO-based ceramics cannot be bent without breaking; they are about as fragile as chalk.
Another is that YBCO's cannot be fabricated into conventional wire without losing their superconductive properties.
Another difficult problem is a phenomenon called "flux creep," which occurs in high magnetic fields and when the temperature of the superconductor drifts up. When conditions are ideal, the lines of magnetic flux passing through a superconductor are "pinned" in place, permitting superconductive electrical flow. But when the flux lines drift, superconductivity is interrupted.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the News Conference With President Clinton

 BODY:
Following are President Clinton's opening statement at his prime-time news conference last night in Washington and excerpts from the question-and-answer session that followed, as transcribed by The New York Times:
PRESIDENT CLINTON Good evening. 
 Ladies and Gentlemen, before we begin the press conference I want to express on behalf of Hillary and myself our profoundest condolences to the families and to the loved ones of the eight Americans who were killed in the crash of the Air Force plane in Alabama last night.
Tonight, I want to talk about welfare reform, but before I do, I'd like to take just a minute to put welfare reform into the context of what is going on now in the United States Congress.
Before the Easter break, the House of Representatives produced a flurry of ideas and proposals. Some of them were good, some need work, some should be rejected.
My job is to work with people of good faith in both parties and both Houses to do what is best for America. I was not elected to produce a pile of vetoes. And the Congress was not elected to produce a pile of political issues for the next election.
My philosophy is that we have to go beyond this kind of politics as usual, the old debate about whether there should be more government or less government. I think we need a better and different government that helps people who are helping themselves. One that offers opportunity but demands responsibility.
I have some common goals with the new Republican majority in the Congress. They say they want to reduce the deficit and the size of government. I support that.
My Administration has reduced the deficit by $600 billion and is reducing the size of Government by over 250,000 people. In fact, if it were not for the interest we have to pay on the debt run up between 1981 and 1992, our Government's budget would be in balance today.
Let me say that again because I don't think the American people know that: If it were not for the interest we have to pay this year on the debt run up between 1981 and 1992, our Government's budget would be in balance today.
The Republicans say that they want to be tough on crime. Our crime bill is tough on crime, and I want to work with them to build on that. The Republicans are supporting the line-item veto, and so am I. I worked hard to get a version of the line-item veto passed to the Senate, and I look forward to working with them to actually getting agreement in both houses and having a line-item veto come into law.
As we look ahead, the issue is, What are we going to do on the outstanding matters?
I have commented at length on them before the newspaper editors, but let me say again: I want us to show responsibility and common sense and decency.
Do we need to cut regulation, as they say? Of course, we do. But we don't need to undermine our commitment to the safety of our skies or the purity of our water and air or the sanctity of our long-term commitment to the environment.
Do we need to be tough on crime? Of course, we do, but we don't need to repeal the commitment to 100,000 police officers or the assault-weapons ban.
Do we need to cut taxes? I believe we do, but not as much as the House bill provides. I think the tax cuts should be targeted to the middle class and to education, so we raise incomes and growth for America over the long run.
Now, let's talk a little about welfare. That's an issue that the Republicans and I and the Congress of Congressional Democrats should be able to agree on. They say we should end welfare as we know it. That's a commitment I made in 1992, and again in 1993 and 1994. Welfare reform is surely an example where all the people ought to be able to get together in the Congress to have reform.
We all know what we need. We need time limits for welfare recipients. We need strict work requirements. We need very tough child-support enforcement. We need more flexibility for the states. That's what our Administration has been working on for more than two years now.
We already have freed 25 states from cumbersome Federal rules and regulations so they can pursue welfare reform on their own. Tonight, we're cutting red tape for two more states, for Montana and Missouri. One state with a Republican Governor, one state with a Democratic Governor. Both committed---- That require people on welfare to go to work within two years.
That's the same time limit I called for when I ran for President and that I called for last year.
Most people are in agreement on this. The question is, What are we going to do about it in Washington?
In 1994, I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform ever presented to Congress. In 1994, Senator Dole, Senator Gramm, Senator Brown and Senator Packwood co-sponsored a pretty good bill. In 1994, Speaker, then Congressman, Gingrich and 162 of the 175 House Republicans sponsored a bill that was an awful lot like mine.
All of these bills were based on the same idea: the fundamental goal of welfare reform is to move people into the work force and to make them independent.
But the bill that passed the House of Representatives, supported by the House Republicans, in my opinion is too weak on work and too tough on children. It saves a lot of money in the short run but at great damage to our long-run interests: promoting responsible parenting and working to promote independence.
The only way to save money over the long run is to move people from welfare to work and to insure that they have the skills to keep jobs and to stay independent.
And it's wrong to cut children off just because their mothers are minors. After all, a child is a child, a baby is a baby. Whether they're white or black or brown, whether they're born in or out of wedlock, every child deserves a chance to make a good life.
Surely, we should not punish children for the mistakes of their parents. Instead, we ought to give them a chance to become independent, full participating citizens, not part of the welfare population.
Let me say again this does not have to be a partisan issue. I know that there are some here in Washington, for example, who want to fold this whole welfare reform issue into the broader budget debate. If you put it into the budget process as those of you live here know, it can be buried in a pile of other issues and then there will be no need for a bipartisan consensus on welfare reform.
But welfare reform is too important for that kind of Washington game. It should be open, it should be bipartisan and we should get on with it right away. I want to challenge Congress to pass a bipartisan welfare reform bill and put it on my desk by July 4 so that we can celebrate Independence Day by giving Americans on welfare the chance, the opportunity, the responsibility to move to independence.
 
Questions and Answers
 Q. Senator Dole has threatened to block Dr. Foster's nomination as Surgeon General from reaching a vote or going to the Senate floor. I have a two-part question. Are you going to the mat to fight for it? Going to withdraw it? And do you think that abortion, which is still lawful in this country, will be a litmus test in Presidential politics?
A. Yes, I'm going to the mat for the nomination.
Whether abortion is a litmus test in Presidential politics is up to the voters.
Dr. Foster is a good man with a good record as a family doctor, as someone who has helped thousands of mothers to give birth to their children and as an academic. And as someone who supported policies that are pro-family and pro-child. He is qualified; he should be confirmed; he should not be caught up in any kind of politics, Presidential or otherwise.
Q. Mr. President, the two countries with which the United States has important relationships, Russia and China, want to sell nuclear technology to Iran over your objections. Can you explain why Russia, in particular, would want to give this technology to a neighboring country that intelligence agents say is determined to acquire nuclear weapons? And do you think that when you go to Moscow that you'll be able to persuade Mr. Yeltsin to cancel the sale?
A. Well, as you know, I cannot explain why Russia would do it, since I don't believe that it's in their interests to do it. I don't think it's right, and I don't think it's in their interests.
If you ask them, I think they would say that they had a prior contractual obligation to do it and they believed that the level of nuclear technology in the power plants is so low that it won't lead to the development of a nuclear weapon. I believe that's what they would say.
I think that's what the Chinese would say.
But I disagree with them, and we're continuing to work with them. . . .
Q. Mr. President, you've been quoted as saying that you believe that Robert MacNamara's new book, in which he essentially says that the U.S. had no underlying basis for the war in Vietnam vindicates your own opposition to the war.
I wonder if we could hear you talk about that, and also if in this time of reflection you feel vindicated about your handling of your own draft status.
A. On the second matter, I've said all I have to say about it, and on the first, I believed our policy was incorrect.
I think the book supports that conclusion, but I do not believe that the book should be used as yet another opportunity to divide the United States over that. We should learn from what happened, resolve not to repeat our mistakes, honor the service of Americans and go forward together.
That's what we should be doing.
Q. The Japanese are threatening to pull out of auto talks unless U.S. negotiators stop threatening sanctions. Are you willing to do that? Are we at risk of a trade war?
A. Well, we should not be at risk of a trade war, but I would remind you that we have been very patient as a country for a very long time in this area. And our major trade deficit in the world, except for our oil imports, has been with Japan, and, of course, now with China and other countries in Asia combined.
But Japan is a country that is a wealthy country, almost as wealthy as we are when you compare purchasing power parity -- where consumer prices within the country of Japan are much, much higher than they are in the United States and could be maintained at that high level only by a sophisticated system of direct and indirect protectionism which is most manifest in this area.
We have strong differences. We have worked hard to resolve our trade differences with Japan. We have made some significant progress in other areas, and I'm going to let Ambassador Kantor continue to pursue this one in the way that we have agreed upon.
I think that he is proceeding in good faith. Q. I'd like to ask you a philosophical question tonight. A number of the nation's social critics have been saying lately that America is what they call a morally bewildered society. And they cite as evidence the fact that much of the nation's political discourse and its public debate centers on the subject of family values. These critics say that family values is really a fig leaf or a euphemism to cover up the nation's moral relativism.
I'd like to know if you think that the distinction between moral virtue in the ancient Roman or old Victorian sense, the distinction between that and family values is a valid and legitimate one?
And if you do, do you think that you and the other candidates in the '96 Presidential contest should debate the nation's social compact on the basis of instilling moral virtue rather than family values?
A. Well, I think family values require moral virtue. I mean that family values mean to me that people make common sacrifices to stay together, to work together, to put primacy on the family unit and the rearing of children and put the children first.
I think that that has been at the bedrock of our success as a country and as the bedrock of other successful civilizations, and I think when people cease to put the interests of their children and the future ahead of their interest of themselves in the short run, we get in trouble.
I believe that if you look at the successes in this country, both the individual successes and the places where they're a broad success, there are strong support for families, and families were generally successful.
I also believe that America worries so much about moral relativism because we are the least relativistic of all the big countries. We are the most religious; we are the most likely to believe not only in God but in absolute rules of right and wrong here on earth.
And I think the fact that we worry about it shows that we have problems in our country which are inconsistent with our beliefs. And we know that we can't solve our problems purely by some common social action; we also require personal changes to solve those problems.
I think that is a broadly held belief in the United States, and I certainly believe that my experience is consistent with that.
Q. Mr. President, in California recently you urged Democrats who were grappling with the issue of affirmative action to be sensitive to the feelings of angry white males.
And if you were addressing a group of so-called angry white males tonight, how would you convince them that Federal programs that have the goals of giving a certain percentage of contracts or jobs to minorities are good and fair for everyone including white males?
A. Well, first of all, I don't want to prejudge the review of all the Federal programs that I'm going through, so I wouldn't---- I don't want to answer that question.
But I would say first of all to them, I will answer the question when I complete the review, which won't be long.
But I don't want to---- I would say though the earnings of male workers including white male workers have been declining when measured against inflation for years now. So, people are working harder, these male workers are working harder for lower wages, unless they have good education or are in a section of the economy that's growing very rapidly.
I would say to them, Your problem is the problem of what's happening to wages and rising inequality in the United States. And it was caused primarily by foreign competition, technology, the weakening of organized labor, the collapse of the minimum wage and, according to the study which was in the paper today, the tax and budgetary policies of the last 12 years before I became President, which aggravated inequality.
And what I'm trying to do is, No. 1, give you equality again. With better jobs, more jobs, a higher minimum wage, a tax cut for workers with modest incomes and children in the home. About $1,000 a year for incomes under $25,000 this year.
And that on affirmative action, your principles should be, We're all better off if everybody's got an even chance, if there's no discrimination, if people have the opportunity to live up to the fullest of their ability. But the Government should never give someone who's unqualified anything over someone who's qualified.
Q. Congressman Torricelli of New Jersey is embroiled in a controversy over the revelations he made about the C.I.A. and its apparent involvement in murders in Guatemala. You've indicated your concerns about the C.I.A.'s conduct. I want to know what your thoughts are about Congressman Torricelli's conduct. Should he have revealed that information or not? And if he should not have, should he be disciplined?
A. Well, what should happen to him depends on, No. 1, what the facts are, and, No. 2, what the House decides to do with it. And they have to do their investigation, and they have to make their determination.
What I do believe is that the United States owes the American people a thorough investigation of the allegations of what went on. And it may take a little time because these are things which occurred, by and large, before I became President. But I've asked the Intelligence Oversight Board to look into it, I expect them to do a thorough and deep job, and I expect to have the truth, and I expect us to take the appropriate action.
That is exactly what we will do, but it is not for me to judge Congressman Torricelli. . . .
Q. Mr. President, outward appearances would indicate that one of your key foreign policy goals, a comprehensive Middle East peace, is deadlocked, especially on the Israeli-Syrian track. Is there a stalemate, and especially in light of the recent terrorist incidents and word today that Syria wants to get land to the Sea of Galilee?
A. Well, I won't comment on the details of the negotiations between them because that would only complicate matters.
It is difficult. We knew it would be difficult.
I do believe that both Prime Minister Rabin and President Assad want to make a comprehensive peace. I do believe that both of them understand they don't have unlimited time. I do believe that the United States still has the trust of both parties in working to help them reach an agreement, and I, as concerned as I am about it, I am more hopeful today than I was, let's say, 45 days ago. We just have to keep at it. . . .
Q. Sir, there's something funny going on at the C.I.A. I wonder just how many times you have looked into it and had a really good honest briefing on it. But today, we have found out that they are taking the classified documents and sending them by mail to retired or former C.I.A. people. And this gets them out of the records, out of the storehouse out there, and gets them into a private home where nobody could ever find them if they conducted a Congressional investigation of C.I.A. reports. Some of these are classified and some are not, but they have the names on them of the officers who worked on them and they have mailed them back to the officers who worked on them.
Why they're doing this I don't know, but it sounds like they're trying to keep us from getting a chance at the records.
A. Let me make two comments quickly on that. First of all, I had made it clear to the Intelligence Oversight Board that I want a thorough investigation of all these matters and clear to the C.I.A. leadership there, including the Acting Director, that I want the records, the relevant records, secured and accounted for.
Secondly, I think this reinforces the need for the United States Senate to hold quick confirmation hearings and have a prompt vote on John Deutch to be the new Director.
Let's get him out there so we can get on with the business of doing what we need to do.
Q. Sir, I know you've said that you'd like to put politics aside for a certain period, but last week you opened, you formally opened, your campaign office for re-election in town here, and I was wondering if you might take a minute to say, to fill in the blank, and say, I believe I should be re-elected President in 1996 because---- You take it from there.
A. I believe I should be re-elected because I have done what I said I would do, because we have got good results and because the policies that I now advocate, most importantly, will address the outstanding problems of the country.
If you look at this problem of inequality, if you look at the economic problems, what is the response? The response is to invest more in education, to raise the minimum wage, to expand trade in high-wage products in the United States to generate more jobs.
If you look at the problems of the social fabric that you asked about, what is the answer? The answer is to tell people the truth about things they have to do to make things better, to assume more responsibility to do the right things, but to have policies from welfare reform to supporting children, to doing things to make adoptions easier and more preferable to other alternatives -- such as we're working on now -- that build up families and build up communities.
We are moving the country in the right direction. We are doing what we said we would do, we are getting results. This country is in a stronger position today than it was two years ago.
Q. Mr. President, the idea of a flat tax is more and more popular with a lot of people. In your mind, what would be wrong with a flat tax? And more fundamentally, for the lack of a more elegant term, what's wrong with blowing up the present tax structure as it is?
A. Well, I'll tell you what. After I just went over my tax returns last week, that has more appeal than it did a week ago. And I think that a lot of Americans feel that way.
On the flat tax, what we have to do is to put a pencil to a piece of paper and see how it works. All the studies I have seen say that all the proposals out there now will raise taxes for people with incomes under $200,000 and lower taxes for people within incomes over $200,000, like my wife and myself, which would be unfair. And that if they don't do that, they explode the deficit.
So, the question is, We can't explode the deficit, and we can't be unfair. Can we simplify the tax system without being unfair or increasing the deficit?
And if we can do it, then I am open to it.
But the studies are not promising on the proposals that are out there now.
Q. Mr. President, both you and your Treasury Secretary have said repeatedly that a strong dollar is in America's interest. But some people don't believe you because they don't see you taking any specific steps to try to make that happen.
Can you tell the American people why this would be in America's interest, particularly since a weak dollar encourages export sales and since the inflation it might cause seems no where on the horizon?
And if you do want a strong dollar, what can you do or what are you willing to do to achieve it?
A. In the present climate, the ability of governments to affect the strength of their currencies -- or in the case of Japan, as you see, would like a weaker yen, the ability of governments that have strong currencies to get a weaker one in the short run -- may be limited as we have seen in countless examples over the last several years.
So what you have to do is work over the long run.
The United States does want a strong dollar. We believe in the importance of fundamentals in our economy. We believe in getting the deficit down, getting jobs up and pursuing a responsible course.
I have done that for two years. I will continue to do that.
Q. A follow-up: what a strong dollar would do for the economy?
A. The point is that a weak dollar eventually, over a long period of time, will weaken the economy, either by bringing inflation into it or by upsetting the whole complex international fabric of business relationships that are carried on in dollars.
So, we do have an interest over the long run in strong currency. But we have to look at it, for Government actions need to be directed toward long-term fundamentals, sound economic policies, sound growth policies, sound investment policies.
Q. In terms of your upcoming trip to Russia, in spite of what your Administration has said numerous times to Russia about NATO expansion, the Yeltsin Government either does not understand or will not understand that this is not a threat to them, and in fact some people in Russia are now talking about rearming in a nuclear fashion to allay some, any, type of attacks from the West. When you meet with Boris Yeltsin, what will you say to him to convince him that it is not a threat?
A. I will say what I have always said:
That NATO is not an offensive alliance, it is a defensive alliance, a security alliance,
That NATO has worked with Russia in Bosnia,
That NATO has invited Russia to be a part of the partnership for peace and has not excluded anybody from potential NATO membership,
That Russia in terms of its security interest has nothing to fear from a NATO which expands in a gradual open, straightforward way and at the same time is deepening its relationship with Russia.
Q. Yeltsin did not understand that?
A. That's something you'll have to ask them.
I understand they, you know, they have the same sort of domestic political pressures that every country has, and misunderstandings. But I think the United States has shown its good faith in our dealings with Russia. The United States did not move aggressively to help Russia overcome the burden of decades of Communist economics and other problems that were left when the cold war was over and the Soviet Union collapsed. To turn around and make Russia an enemy, that's not why we did all that work to help rebuild their economy, to support their movement to democracy, to support their integration and their work with the G-7 and all these other countries.
We have shown our good faith, but we cannot, and we should not, give any nation a veto over the expansion of NATO when it is otherwise appropriate to do so.
Q. Mr. President, concerning follow-up on the question about the dollar, there is growing concern that there is instability within the international financial system as a whole. There are some proposals like, you know, the Japanese Finance Minister put out a proposal regarding international financial reform, reform of the international system. How do you view this situation, and what would be your primary concerns in such a reform of the international financial system?
A. First, let me say that this is an issue which needs to be addressed. But it needs to be addressed in a very thoughtful way so as not to further aggravate whatever conditions exist there.
It is obvious that the integration of the global financial markets has many advantages, that you can get money to places in a hurry, that places that have been underdeveloped can develop more quickly, that you can develop sophisticated trading relationships more rapidly. And that this is all a positive.
It is also obvious that, as with almost every other element in the modern society that we live in, every force of integration carries within it the seeds of potential disintegration, a rapid unraveling.
So last year, that's why I asked the heads of the other G-7 countries, the other major economies, to devote a discussion this summer when we meet in Canada to this subject. We have been working on it; the Japanese have been working on it; the Canadians have been working on it; the Europeans have been working on it. And we will have a long talk about it this summer. We will do our very best to come up with sensible statements about where we go from here.
Q. Mr. President, follow-up on the answer you gave a moment ago. When you spoke last week about President Truman's decision to drop the atomic bomb, Americans overwhelmingly thought you were right not to apologize. The Japanese overwhelmingly thought you were insensitive. Were you surprised that 50 years after the event there is still that wide divergence? Do you see any chance of that gulf ever being bridged?
A. The way to bridge the gulf is to talk about the friendship that we have now, the respect and regard we have now, the common interest that we have now.
I did not say that to hurt anyone's feelings or to be insensitive to anyone in Japan. I know what a terrible, terrible loss of life there was, how many scarred families there were, how difficult it was.
It was hard in World War II. Twenty million Russians lost their lives in World War II. No one can fail to be sensitive to the loss.
Do I wish none of it had happened? Of course I do.
But that does not mean that President Truman in the moment of decision made the wrong decision. Or that the United States can now apologize for a decision that we did not believe then, and I do not believe now, was the wrong one.
That has nothing to do with my feelings for the Japanese people, my profound sorrow at the suffering and the agony they have, that they went through. But we have recovered from that; we have gone on from that; we have one of the world's most important bilateral relationships.
The thing we need to do now is to join together and look to the future. We're up to our ears in challenges today. Let's get on with dealing with them in mutual respect and support, and that's the way to get this behind us.
Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: China Breaks Ranks With Other Nuclear Nations on Treaty

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 18

 BODY:
China, publicly breaking ranks with the other acknowledged nuclear-weapons powers, said today that it could back an extension of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty for either an indefinite period or a series of fixed periods of no less than 25 years' duration.
The other four nuclear-weapons powers -- the United States, Britain, France and Russia -- are lobbying for an indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which came into force in 1970 and is due for renewal this year. They argue that any other outcome would weaken the treaty. 
 France's Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, told the conference today that the 15-member European Union and six Eastern European countries were all firmly behind an indefinite extension. With the number of treaty signers now up to 178, supporters of an indefinite extension would need at least 90 votes to insure that outcome.
Today, the Campaign for the NPT -- a group of independent arms-control and nuclear monitoring organizations -- said that it counted 82 "yes" votes for indefinite extension and 37 nations leaning in that direction but uncommitted. Under what rules voting will take place has not yet been decided, however.
Mexico indicated today that it could still not support an indefinite extension, a position taken before the conference by Egypt, Indonesia and Venezuela.
Experts said after the speech by China's Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, Qian Qichen, that Beijing is apparently hedging its bets to maintain a position somewhere between the West and leading developing nations that reject an indefinite extension. These developing nations argue that such an extension would perpetuate a permanent division of the world into nuclear weapons haves and have-nots.
In his speech, Mr. Qian made a strong call for the "complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons." He also recalled that only China has made a public commitment to a "no-first-strike" nuclear policy, and he called on all other weapons states to follow China's lead in pledging never to initiate a nuclear attack.
While saying that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty "has its limitations and defects," Mr. Qian said that China supported the treaty's extension. But he ruled out a renewal for one fixed period -- one of three options under Article VI of the accord -- as "not desirable."
"If the option for indefinite extension is chosen," he went on, "it must be made clear that such an extension should in no way be interpreted as perpetuating the nuclear-weapons states' prerogative to possess nuclear weapons.
"And, if the extension for multiple periods is chosen, we hold that each fixed period should not be less than 25 years," he said. In either case, he added, "there should be continued regular reviews of the treaty."
Some experts believe that the United States and its allies on this issue may be maneuvered into a compromise short of an indefinite extension and speculation is centering on a proposal to accept "rolling extensions" of 25 years each that would be more or less automatic.
Britain, also speaking today, announced that it had ceased the production of fissile material for explosive purposes. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in his speech that the British Government had taken this step as part of a series of moves intended to assuage the fears of nonnuclear-weapons nations.
The United States stopped producing weapons-grade nuclear fuel in 1989. Russia has made public statements saying that it would also do so. France and China have been more equivocal, although nuclear-control experts say that all the nuclear-weapons nations agreed to a December 1993 General Assembly resolution calling for talks on a complete cutoff of production of atomic fuel for weapons.
More recently in Geneva, however, an effort to issue a joint declaration promising that all nuclear powers would stop production of fissile material was resisted by the Chinese, experts say. Today Mr. Qian said China preferred a binding convention halting production.
Today, John Holum, driector of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency said that the United States "had conducted its last nuclear test."

HEADLINE: The Pulitzer Prizes: Journalism and the Arts Bestow a Most Prestigious Honor

 BODY:
The Pulitzer Prizes were awarded yesterday by Columbia University in 21 categories for excellence in the arts and journalism.
 
 
PUBLIC SERVICE
The Virgin Islands Daily News
 The Virgin Islands Daily News, a Gannett newspaper in St. Thomas with a circulation of 16,400, was recognized for a 10-part series on crime that initiated many reforms. The series, "Virgin Island Crime: Who's to Blame?" described a police department that seldom catches criminals, prosecutors who rarely win cases, judges who give light sentences and a special narcotics force riddled with corruption. 
 The Daily News, which has just 18 full-time editors and reporters, started its inquiry last June after it decided that the Police Department failed to vigorously investigate the murder of a police officer known for integrity and courage. The executive editor, Penny Feuerzeig, said the objective of the series was to explain why the Virgin Islands was so hospitable to crime. In one story in the series, Melvin L. Claxton, the lead reporter and writer for the series, described a police evidence room that was so disorganized that evidence disappeared routinely.
 
 
GENERAL NONFICTION
JONATHAN WEINER
"The Beak of the Finch:
A Story of Evolution in Our Time"
 In "The Beak of the Finch," Jonathan Weiner, who has written two other books on ecological science, describes the research of biologists who study evolution as it unfolds in nature. His main protagonists are two Princeton University scientists, Peter and Rosemary Grant, who for more than 20 years have measured variations in things like beak size in some 13 varieties of finch that live on a small island in the Galapagos chain, not far from where Darwin himself did his pioneering research. Mr. Weiner's conclusion is that "life is always poised for flight." Evolution, he writes, takes place "daily and hourly, all around us, and we can watch."
 
 
FICTION
CAROL SHIELDS
"The Stone Diaries"
 Carol Shields, an American-born writer who lives in Canada, reveals the shifting moods of the 20th century through the domestic details of a single imaginary life -- that of Daisy Goodwill Flett, a woman born in 1905 who lives into the 1990's in Canada and the United States. The book is composed not only of journals but also of observations and conversations rendered in myriad voices: those of Daisy's friends and relatives, her own and the author's. These different perspectives combine to create a portrait of an ordinary but richly textured existence:
"And almost as heavenly as eating was the making -- how she gloried in it! Every last body on this earth has a particular notion of paradise, and this was hers, standing in the murderously hot back kitchen of her own house, concocting and contriving, leaning forward and squinting at the fine print of the cookery book, a clean wooden spoon in her hand.
"It's something to see, the way she concentrates, her hot, busy face, the way she thrills to see the dish take form as she pours the stewed fruit into the fancy mold, pressing the thickly cut bread down over the oozing juices, feeling it soften and absorb bit by bit a raspberry redness."
 
 
POETRY
PHILIP LEVINE
"Simple Truth"
 The title "Simple Truth" reflects Philip Levine's artistic program -- the use of pared-down language and plain syntax to express the struggles of working-class Americans. The 67-year-old poet, who lives in Fresno, Calif., writes in "The Escape," one of his new poems:
To come to life in Detroit is to be manufactured
without the power of speech. You clasp hands,
as I did, with a brother and step by step
begin the slow descent into hell or Hamtramck
and arrive, designed, numbered and tagged.
It was the year Hoover took office. Since then
I've been recycled seven times and escaped
myself twice.
 
 
BIOGRAPHY JOAN D. HEDRICK
"Harriet Beecher Stowe: A Life"
 Joan D. Hedrick was cited for her biography of Stowe, the first full-scale work in more than half a century devoted to the author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Ms. Hedrick, a professor of history at Trinity College in Hartford, took a comprehensive, analytical approach to Stowe's life and the social and moral circumstances that shaped the writing of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and other works. The result was a compelling portrait not only of Stowe, but of the United States in the critical decades before and after the Civil War.
 
 
HISTORY
DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN
"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and
Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front
in World War II"
 In a meticulously researched history, Doris Kearns Goodwin tells how Franklin Delano Roosevelt coaxed an isolationist, Depression-ridden nation first into supplying arms to England and then into taking up arms itself, and how his command of the home front during World War II transformed the United States into a mighty industrial power. At the same time, she reveals the lives of the Roosevelts themselves, especially the often-thorny interaction between the President and his extraordinary First Lady.
 
 
DRAMA
HORTON FOOTE
"The Young Man From Atlanta"
 Horton Foote is better known for his screenplays, including "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Tender Mercies," than for his stage work. Most of his 50 or so plays are set in Harrison, a once-lively small town on the Texas Gulf Coast, much like Wharton, Tex., where he lives.
The Signature Theater Company in Manhattan devoted its whole season to Mr. Foote's plays this year. "The Young Man From Atlanta" takes place in Houston in 1950, as a grocery chain executive and his deeply religious wife come to terms with the suicide of their 32-year-old son and with the beguiling, money-hungry young man with whom he was having an affair.
"I feel very honored," the 79-year-old Mr. Foote said yesterday, struggling to handle a deluge of telephone calls and flower deliveries. "I thought Terrence McNally was going to get it."
 
 
MUSIC MORTON GOULD
"Stringmusic"
 Morton Gould, an 81-year-old composer who lives in Great Neck, N.Y., won for a 30-minute work that was commissioned by the National Symphony Orchestra and given its premiere by that ensemble, conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, at the Kennedy Center in Washington on March 10, 1994. Composed as a tribute to Mr. Rostropovich, who was in his final season as the orchestra's music director and is also a renowned cellist, the piece explores the wide range of color and texture that an orchestra's string sections can produce. A lyrical piece with rhapsodic, playful and showy sections, the five-movement score includes tango rhythms, jazz figures and other popular elements within an essentially Romantic style.
 
 
EDITORIAL WRITING JEFFREY GOOD
The St. Petersburg Times
 In a series of editorials titled "Final Indignities," Jeffrey Good detailed how loopholes in Florida laws and lax supervision by probate courts had allowed unscrupulous executors to loot estates. The unusual editorials combined investigative reporting with more traditional opinion to explore serious abuses by lawyers entrusted to carry out people's last instructions on how to disburse their estates.
 
 
COMMENTARY
JIM DWYER
New York Newsday
 Jim Dwyer was recognized for "compelling and compassionate" commentaries about New York City, including pieces on Irish-American involvement in the Northern Ireland peace process, on the death penalty, and on an unheralded 19th-century hero, a water main inspector named John H. Rhodes.
In two dozen columns, two submitted to Pulitzer judges, Mr. Dwyer wrote about children dying because state confidentiality laws prohibited doctors from telling parents the results of H.I.V. tests taken at birth.
 
 
CRITICISM
MARGO JEFFERSON
The New York Times
 In her book reviews and other cultural criticism, Margo Jefferson was cited for writing "forcefully and originally without ever muscling out the author in question." Her commentary covered topics as diverse as modeling, home economics, the French and Indian War of the 18th century, and the sayings of Annette Funicello.
This excerpt is from a piece on "Amos 'n' Andy" and black comedy on television.
"Comedy is such a mixture of empathy and superiority, identification and alienation. Belonging to the type of the educated Negro, I found Lightning provocatively unlike me (which let me laugh at him) and yet oddly like me (which let me laugh with him). For one thing, we were both cross-eyed. For another thing, which had precious little to do with race, I was a child, and his was the comedy of regression: broad, slow gestures; grimaces and double takes; sounds that broke language into vowels, syllables and tones. Besides, what child undergoing socialization doesn't know exactly what it feels like to get caught, literally or metaphorically, in a garbage can and to try desperately to get out before the adults find you?"
 
 
BEAT REPORTING
DAVID M. SHRIBMAN
The Boston Globe
 David M. Shribman, the Washington bureau chief of The Boston Globe, was singled out for his coverage of the nation's capital, with an often novel perception of the people and issues that shape national politics. His winning reports ranged from an examination of the spirituality of Presidents to an essay on the burial of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis last year.
 
 
SPOT NEWS REPORTING
The Los Angeles Times Staff
 The staff of The Los Angeles Times was recognized for coverage of the chaos and devastation caused by the earthquake that shook the area on Jan. 17, 1994. The newspaper's San Fernando Valley building was rendered uninhabitable. Staff in downtown Los Angeles used flashlights, manual typewriters and emergency phones to publish a comprehensive package that captured the scope and human drama of the earthquake.
 
 
INTERNATIONAL REPORTING
MARK FRITZ
The Associated Press
 Mark Fritz, who covered West Africa in 1993 and 1994, was cited for his dispatches on the ethnic violence in Rwanda. "We nominated him because he described scenes of hell in such vivid detail," said William E. Ahearn, executive editor of The Associated Press. "So many reporters said it couldn't be described in words. He got across a horror that was so unfathomable."
In one article, Mr. Fritz wrote:
"Nobody lives here anymore. Not the expectant mothers, huddled outside the maternity clinic. Not the families squeezed into the church. Not the man who lies rotting in a schoolroom beneath a chalkboard map of Africa.
"Everybody here is dead."
 
 
NATIONAL REPORTING
TONY HORWITZ
The Wall Street Journal
 Tony Horwitz, a reporter for The Wall Street Journal since 1990 and a former union organizer, won for articles that revealed the degrading and dangerous working conditions of people in low-paying, low-skill jobs. For one article for his "Nine to Nowhere" series, Mr. Horwitz took jobs at poultry slaughterhouses in Mississippi and Arkansas. He also looked at garbage plants in the Midwest, where workers comb through raw trash to sort out recyclable items, and at a white-collar clerical "sweat shop" in Maryland, where the boss checks the pace of his employees' work on a video monitor.
 
 
FEATURE WRITING
RON SUSKIND
The Wall Street Journal
 Ron Suskind, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The Wall Street Journal, spent two months with top students struggling to escape the confines of their crime-ridden school, Frank W. Ballou Senior High. In two articles, he chronicled their lonely ordeals:
"Just during the current school year, one boy was hacked by a student with an ax, a girl was badly wounded in a knife fight with another female student, five fires were set by arsonists, and an unidentified body was dumped next to the parking lot.
"But all is quiet in the echoing hallways at 7:15 A.M., long before classes start on a spring morning. The only sound comes from the computer lab, where 16-year-old Cedric Jennings is already at work on an extra-credit project. . . .The high school junior with the perfect grades has big dreams: He wants to go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."

 Two Newsday reporters uncovered a pattern of abuse in which police officers on Long Island were claiming fake injuries to collect tax-free disability pensions of up to $75,000 a year. As a result of their investigation, the State Comptroller agreed to tighten controls on the pension system and hired a detective agency to screen applicants. A consulting firm was hired to study the entire state pension system.

HEADLINE: Libyan Girds For Defiance Of the West

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES 

DATELINE: TRIPOLI, Libya

 BODY:
Muammar el-Qaddafi, who governs Libya with a love of grandiose state projects and unflinching repression, has reorganized his security forces, purged rivals from his inner circle and set Libya on a course of defiance against the West that will probably endure as long as he remains in power.
The Libyan leader, who two decades ago was the enfant terrible of the Arab world, has exhausted a variety of tactics, short of turning over the two Libyans wanted in connection with the downing of a Pan Am jetliner, as he has sought to obtain the lifting of the three-year-old sanctions against his country. 
 Libyan officials have given the British files on the Irish Republican Army, shut down the camps of radical Palestinian groups and let the United States know that they might turn over the rogue C.I.A. agent Frank E. Terpil.
The Government has hired lawyers to see if it could work out a deal with the families of the victims of the Pan Am bombing. All these measures have failed to shake the resolve of the United Nations, which demands that the two suspects be extradited to Britain or the United States for trial.
Colonel Qaddafi, calling himself a "scapegoat," now says he will live within the confines of the sanctions, defy them when he can and count on the instability in the region to prevent further measures, like an embargo on oil sales.
"The feeling in Europe is that we can't destabilize another country in North Africa," a European ambassador said. "Whatever Qaddafi is, he provides a measure of calm. He helps protect the Algerian and Egyptian regimes by cooperating with their security forces. There is no real successor to Qaddafi. It would be a big and dangerous illusion to think one could back outside forces to take over from him."
United Nations sanctions were imposed on Libya in 1992 after it refused to hand over two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people died. The sanctions include an arms, trade and travel embargo.
Colonel Qaddafi has recently sidelined his regular army units, on which he spent more than $20 billion on mainly Soviet-made armaments over the last 20 years, with new structures he calls "armed people." And longtime associates, like Abdussalam Jalloud, who was his chief lieutenant, have disappeared from public view.
"He appears to have neutralized any opposition that might come from within the army," the ambassador said. "His army has little role now, and most the military hardware he bought is rusting in the desert."
When 26-year-old Captain Qaddafi took power in a bloodless coup in 1969, he and his fellow officers promised an Arab renaissance that called for defiance of the West and the liberation of Palestine. He challenged major Western companies over oil pricing and won, inspiring other Arab states to begin the 1973 oil price explosion.
Libya became a port of call for everyone from the Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal and guerrilla groups in Africa to leaders of the American Indian movement and Marxist revolutionaries from Central America. Hundreds of millions of dollars were doled out by Libya. And Libyan intelligence agents were repeatedly linked to terrorist attacks, including the 1989 bombing of a French DC-10 airliner in which 171 people died.
The oil wealth, which at one point reached $23 billion a year, financed one disastrous scheme after another, from the attempt to create an army of a million people out of a population of five million, to the expenditure of some $20 billion to build a huge irrigation project, still under construction, that few experts expect to work.
But little more than the frequent calls for holy war and Colonel Qaddafi's self-proclaimed desert socialism remains.
With the fall of oil prices, income barely covers the country's imports. The adventurism appears to have ceased.
And both Colonel Qaddafi and the country he governs appear more intent on economic survival.
Wages have been frozen for 15 years, and prices for basic goods have risen by as much as sevenfold over the last two years. Water and electrical service is sporadic, even in the capital. And despair is the dominant emotion expressed by most Libyans on the dirty, potholed streets of the capital.
"Life is getting worse and worse," said a 17-year-old vendor in the central market, "and everyone blames Qaddafi. We want all these schemes and conflicts to end. He got us into this mess, now he better get us out of it."

HEADLINE: Monthly Deficit In U.S. Trade Falls Sharply, Lifting Dollar

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 19

 BODY:
A sharp drop in the United States monthly trade deficit helped lift the dollar today from record lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark. But the increase was not enough to calm foreign exchange markets or stem demands from abroad for action by the United States to bolster its battered currency.
The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit -- the difference between what the United States buys from abroad and sells to other countries -- plunged by 24.6 percent in February. In dollar terms, it was the sharpest drop since December 1993. 
 Eager to help push up the dollar, Clinton Administration officials hailed the report and suggested that it might herald the beginning of a long-term decline in the deficit. The figures showed both a modest rise in exports and a surprising drop in imports.
After the Government announced the $9.01 billion deficit for February, the dollar edged up from post-World War II lows for the end of a trading session, settling at 81.40 yen late in New York, up from 80.57 yen on Tuesday. Earlier today, in Asian trading, the dollar had fallen as low as 79.75 yen. The dollar rose to 1.3720 German marks today, up from 1.3520 on Tuesday.
But many economists said they did not expect the February decline to give the dollar major support, partly because they viewed the trade deficit numbers as a return to normal levels after the deficit soared by two-thirds, to a record $12 billion in January.
"I don't think today's trade numbers have a strong meaning for the yen-dollar rate," said Masato Nakai, senior economist for the Mitsubishi Bank in New York. "The market sentiment is still for a stronger yen."
With many currency traders seemingly intent on pushing the dollar lower, there was a growing chorus of calls today from American allies that the Government do more to bolster the dollar than occasionally intervene in the currency markets. Such pressures are expected to grow as finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial nations prepare to meet this weekend in Washington.
Speaking in unusually blunt terms, Yasuo Matsushita, governor of the Japanese central bank, called on the United States today to put its economy in order by reducing its budget deficit.
On Tuesday, Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, called on the Federal Reserve to raise its interest rates. Such a move would, in theory, help lift the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive to foreign investors.
But with Republicans in Congress intent on cutting taxes, many currency traders and foreign officials are convinced that the budget deficit will balloon rather than decline. And with the American economy starting to slow, neither the Federal Reserve nor the Clinton Administration appears eager to increase interest rates.
Scott Pardee, a former Federal Reserve official who is a senior adviser at Yamaichi America International, said he doubted that the central bank would raise rates to support the dollar. "For the Fed, the dollar is just one of many of the things they look at," he said. "Domestic indicators show that growth is slowing, and inflation has picked up a little, but not enough to create a compelling case for the Fed to tighten."
Speaking about today's report, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, told reporters in a conference call, "We're delighted with all these numbers and we hope it continues, but I should say this is just one month." He was especially encouraged that the trade deficit with Japan had fallen for the fourth consecutive month.
Asserting that the dollar's decline of more than 18 percent against the yen in the last three months had occurred too recently to have a major effect on the deficit with Japan, Mr. Kantor insisted that the monthly deficit with Japan had decreased largely because of the United States' increased competitiveness.
Many economists say it will take 6 to 12 months for the recent drop in the dollar to reduce the trade deficit by making American exports cheaper and foreign goods more costly.
For February, the deficit with Japan slipped 3.2 percent, to $4.71 billion, with exports jumping 13 percent, to a record $5.03 billion. The Clinton Administration was encouraged that imports from Japan rose far more slowly, up 4.7 percent, to $9.74 billion.
"This was a very encouraging trade report," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Lehman Brothers. "Trade improved for all the right reasons. Imports are down across the board, reflecting economic weakness. And exports were up. Trade with the industrialized countries -- Japan and Western Europe -- improved."
Mr. Sinai said that normally such strong improvement in trade figures would have produced a sharp rebound in the dollar. But he said that the dollar had been weighed down by fears that a trade crisis could erupt over Washington's demand that Tokyo increase imports of American cars and parts.
Exports in February, seasonally adjusted, rose to their second-highest level ever, climbing to $62.4 billion, up 2.4 percent from January. Imports slid 2 percent, to $71.43 billion.
The Commerce Department revised downward the trade deficit for January to $11.95 billion, from its original figure of $12.23 billion. That compares with a December deficit of $7.26 billion.
Civilian aircraft, a category that is especially volatile, accounted for the biggest jump in exports in February, rising to $1.19 billion from $525 million a month earlier. Exports also increased in telecommunications, consumer goods and food and beverages.
Probably the worst news in the February report was the soaring trade deficit with Mexico, which was aggravated by Mexico's new austerity budget and the 43 percent drop of the peso against the dollar since devaluation on Dec. 20. The deficit with Mexico jumped to $1.25 billion in February, from $863 million in January. In December, the United States had a $19 million trade surplus with Mexico.
Many economists predict that the trade deficit with Mexico will balloon to $15 billion this year -- a far cry from the positive trade picture depicted by the Clinton Administration when it was campaigned for the North American Free Trade Agreement in the summer and fall of 1993.
On the positive side, the trade deficit with China narrowed to $1.91 billion in February, down from $2.72 billion in January. The deficit with the 15-nation European Union shrank to $122 million, from $1.03 billion in January.
There was strong improvement in the trade balance with other industrial centers of Asia, including Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, with the United States recording a $612 million surplus, compared with a $1.5 billion deficit in January.
Laurence H. Meyer, who runs a St. Louis-based economics consulting firm, said that as a result of the declining trade deficit and jump in exports, economic growth in the first quarter would turn out to be 3.5 percent to 4 percent, substantially stronger than the 2.8 percent rate he had been forecasting.

HEADLINE: Mayor Favors Phasing Out Home Relief

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
A day after touting the success of tough new eligibility rules for New York's welfare program providing benefits to childless, able-bodied adults, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that he actually favors abolishing the program altogether.
The Home Relief program, created in 1931 by Franklin D. Roosevelt when he was the Governor, now provides benefits to about 245,000 childless city residents who are able-bodied or whose disability does not qualify them for benefits under larger Federal programs. The city and the state share the cost of the $1.9 billion program, which provides an average benefit of $325 a month, or $3,900 a year. 
 The Mayor has mentioned his dislike of the welfare program before, but rarely, if ever, as bluntly as he put it yesterday, when he said "yes" when asked whether he believes it should be phased out.
Speaking at a City Hall news conference, the Mayor did acknowledge that the State Constitution may prohibit total elimination of the program. Article XVII of the Constitution says the state and its subdivisions shall provide for the "aid, care and support of the needy" as determined by the State Legislature. Even if that hurdle could be crossed, the Democratic-controlled State Assembly is not likely to agree to scrap the program.
Because of those obstacles, Mr. Giuliani said he wanted to narrow time limits on Home Relief benefits as an interim step toward total elimination. As he proposed last October, employable people on the program would be limited to 90 days of benefits, after which they would be cut off and not allowed to reapply for two years. The Republican Governor, George E. Pataki, and the Republican-led State Senate have agreed to a 60-day time limit, and the disagreement will not be settled until the Legislature passes a budget for the current fiscal year. Thus, those applicants who successfully struggle through the new eligibility requirements hailed by the Republican Mayor on Tuesday and who agree to work for their benefits would be removed from the welfare rolls 60 or 90 days later if the the Republican proposals become law.
For opponents of the Republican plans, the tightly controlled time limits undermine the Mayor's assertions that tough new eligibility rules are restricting welfare to the truly needy. If recipients are truly needy and are working for their benefits, they say, then why put them back on the street after a few weeks?
"The Mayor is congratulating himself for being tough and forcing these able-bodied people to jump through hoops and give something back to the city, and that's fine," said Stephen DiBrienza, head of the City Council's General Welfare Committee. "But what happens on the 61st or the 91st day? They get cut off, and go right back on the street. And then what do you do with them?"
He said those taken off the welfare rolls -- who would also lose their Medicaid benefits -- would eventually become an even bigger drain to the taxpayers if they go to live in city homeless shelters or seek medical assistance at public hospitals.
Anne Erickson, legislative coordinator for the Greater Upstate Law Project, a lobbying group for poor people, said she was counting on the courts to uphold Home Relief against those who would kill it. She is relying on the constitutional provision as legal bedrock. "I don't think they will ever be successful in eliminating Home Relief," she said, "and I hope these attempts to circumvent the Constitution and trash the system with time limits will not be successful either. Where do they think those people are going to go?"
Only New York, New Jersey and Alaska still offer welfare programs for the able-bodied, and New York's is by far the largest and most expensive. Marion Nichols, a researcher at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, said several states that did offer such programs have either eliminated them, as Michigan did in 1991, or have cut them back, as have Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.
Pennsylvania, she said, now offers welfare to able-bodied recipients for 2 out of 24 months. That program is similar to the Mayor's proposal.
Those who support the Mayor's and the Governor's plans say they want to build incentives into the system to push able-bodied recipients back into the work force. Richard Schwartz, a senior aide to the Mayor and a leading architect of his welfare plan, said those recipients who were not employable would not have their benefits cut off by a time limit.
"We're supportive of helping an individual out for a limited period of time while they reorganize their lives and find a job," he said yesterday. "The time limit is a very reasonable, practical step necessary to help these people find a life."
He said a large number of benefit recipients in the city's Home Relief workfare program, which began in January, have found private jobs and left the program, but he said he did not have exact numbers. The city plans to work with the private sector to set up a "job bank" of private jobs for those whose benefits would be cut off after 90 days, he said.
He noted that the proposed cutoff would not apply to those considered unemployable by reason of age or medical condition. According to state figures, just over half of the city residents on Home Relief are considered unemployable.
Asked yesterday what would happen to the truly needy if Home Relief were eliminated, the Mayor said he hoped to learn the answers to that from the city's current experience with workfare. He seemed to leave open the possibility that a part of the program could be saved if it only serves those who do not qualify for any other program, like Aid to Families With Dependent Children, for families, or Supplemental Security Income, for the disabled.
"If in fact there are people that are going to fall through the cracks because either they're disabled or they want to work but just can't, then I think that would offer a lot of political support for continuing the program for just those people," Mr. Giuliani said.

HEADLINE: TERROR IN OKLAHOMA CITY: PARENTS' FEARS;
Re-thinking Day Care At the Job

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
The large number of children killed in the bombing yesterday of a Federal office building in Oklahoma City underscored how day-care centers are increasingly being placed near work sites, leaving them exposed to the same dangers faced by workers in office buildings.
Ninety-eight child care centers are in Federal buildings around the country, and many businesses have set up similar centers near their offices to accommodate working parents. The operators of many of those centers said yesterday that they would not be terrorized into closing. 
 Yesterday, after the explosion, radio talk shows and television interview programs were flooded with calls from parents trying to comprehend the Oklahoma City attack. Some said they could understand why the World Trade Center in New York was a target of terrorists two years ago because of its national economic symbolism. But they said the Oklahoma bombing made them wonder whether anyone was immune to the danger of terrorism.
The day-care center in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, like such centers in many other buildings, was at the greatest risk in a ground-level explosion, officials there said, because child-safety regulations generally require the centers to be in the first three floors of a building.
The explosion, just after 9 A.M., came two hours after the first child was dropped off in the center, which was on the second floor, just above where the police say the car bomb exploded.
As word of the explosion spread, parents in Omaha, Indianapolis, Des Moines and other cities rushed to retrieve their children at day-care centers in Federal buildings.
But academics said the explosion showed that no matter what safeguards were taken to protect children, nothing was foolproof.
"People felt that this country had always taken great pride in protecting its children against all kinds of evil, and now this happens to shake their beliefs," Dr. Pepper Schwartz, a professor of sociology at the University of Washington, said in a telephone interview.
"Before, they felt it could not happen in a place as safe as Oklahoma City," Dr. Schwartz said. "But we are now finding out that no one is safe any more, and they are astoundingly frightened.
"I bet that parents will now think twice about how and where they take and leave their children. Any building of any substance can be dangerous."
As more and more mothers have joined the work force in recent years, employers in business and government have increasingly opened child care centers in their buildings to accommodate these workers' pre-school children.
Kara Gerhardt, a spokeswoman for the General Services Administration, said the 98 child care centers in Federal buildings, including the Jacob K. Javits Federal Office Building in downtown Manhattan, serve 6,000 families.
Ms. Gerhardt said her agency, which operates Federal buildings, had "no plans to close any of the centers."
Faith Wohl, director of the Federal Office of Workplace Initiatives, which overseas the day-care centers, said the centers were governed by some of the strictest rules in the country. "But," she added, "it is impossible to prepare or protect them with all the rules and regulations in the world."
Allen Morrisey, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which has a child care operation at the World Trade Center, said there were no plans to close it.
Mr. Morrisey said the center, which opened after the explosion there in February 1993, was "surrounded by tight security."
"There is no 100 percent guarantee of protection," he said. "we are not going to turn our public buildings into fortresses. We are not going to do that."
The New York City Police Headquarters, at 1 Police Plaza, also has a child care center. The headquarters was the target of a terrorist attack more than 20 years ago when it was further uptown at Centre and Grand Streets, but a Deputy Police Commissioner, John K. Timoney, said there were no plans to close the child care center because of Oklahoma City explosion or the past attack on the police headquarters.
"We can't give in and empty every room, every building and every garage," Mr. Timoney said. "If we do that, we will be giving in to the terrorists."

HEADLINE: Allies Split on How to Deal With Serbia Curbs

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, April 19

 BODY:
Days before the Security Council must decide whether to extend a partial suspension of sanctions against Serbia, a dispute over how to deal with the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, is fracturing the five-nation group guiding peace efforts in the Balkans.
Diplomats involved in informal talks on the issue say that the United States and Germany are arguing with Britain, France and Russia over the conditions under which, and for what length of time, Serbia and Montenegro -- the remains of the former Yugoslavia -- should be granted an extension. 
 Some sanctions against Yugoslavia were suspended last September in return for a Serbian promise to cut off strategic goods for Bosnian and Croatian Serbs. But few United Nations officials or diplomats familiar with the region believe that President Milosevic has sealed the borders entirely. A European official commented today that it was well known that arms were still being supplied to Bosnian and Croatian Serbs. News reports from the area have been confirming this almost daily.
Yet United Nations inspectors continue to report that the Serbian Government is meeting its commitment to halt supplies. In return, Serbia and Montenegro have been allowed since last September to operate a few air and sea links to the outside world and take part in international sports and cultural events -- as long as Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is able to certify every 100 days that President Milosevic is in compliance.
The dispute over the future of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro did not deter the Security Council today from quickly adopting unanimously a resolution introduced on Tuesday by France calling for more protection for United Nations peacekeepers in Bosnia.
But as the next 100-day deadline on the sanctions exemption approaches on Friday, there has been at least one stormy meeting on this issue, said a diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. The United States and Germany want to cut to 45 or even 30 days the length of time between certifications. Britain, France and Russia, a country seen as increasingly more open in support of the Serbs, want to maintain the 100-day period.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Stocks Surge; Broader Market Retreats

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks surged yesterday to within a point of their all-time high, while the broader market ended lower.
Stocks and bonds were bolstered by a recovery in the dollar, which strengthened after a report showed that the United States trade deficit fell 24.6 percent in February. The Commerce Department report, which was better than economists' expectations, helped push the dollar higher against the Japanese yen and the German mark, and the Dow Jones industrial average followed suit. A stronger dollar makes American securities more attractive to foreign investors. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 28.36 points, to 4,207.49, led by a sharp earnings-driven gain in the shares of Eastman Kodak. The record for the Dow was set last Thursday, when it closed at 4,208.18. But the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.45 point, to 504.92.
The Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology issues, fell 9.19 points, to 816.55. Nearly 454 million shares traded hands on the Nasdaq market yesterday, making it the busiest session ever for the market.
"The Dow has not been giving an accurate portrayal of what the broad market has been doing," said John H. Sahughnessy, senior vice president of Advest Inc. "There's been a mild correction in most share prices. Sometimes you sell on the trumpets."
Blue-chip stocks were also helped by the gain in Treasury bonds. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose yesterday as its yield, -- which moves in the opposite direction -- fell to 7.36 percent from 7.39 percent on Tuesday. Lower yields tend to make stocks more attractive to investors than bonds.
While the improvement in the dollar bolstered stocks yesterday, the market has also shrugged off sharp declines in the currency in recent months.
"We've had this confounding pattern all year," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers. "The countries with the strong currencies -- like Switzerland, Japan and Germany -- are having a bad stock market. And we, with the weakest currency among the major countries, are having a good stock market."
Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was relatively heavy yesterday, with 378.1 million shares changing hands, up from 345.2 million shares the previous day. On the Nasdaq, volume was even stronger, reaching a daily trading record of almost 454 million shares, up 9.3 percent from its previous high of 415.4 million shares set on Oct. 13, 1993.
Declining issues on the New York exchange topped advances by 1,227 to 942. The big news on the Big Board was Kodak, which jumped 4 5/8 to a record high of 57 on a first-quarter earnings report showing an increase of 80 percent. Kodak's stock gain was responsible for almost half of the total advance in the Dow.
A handful of oil issues moved into higher ground, as the futures contract for May delivery of crude oil rose 2 cents, to $20.43 a barrel. Exxon was up 1/2, to 68 1/2 and Amerada Hess was up 5/8, to 50 1/8.
Capital-goods stocks were also strong, benefiting from robust capital spending by industrial companies. Ingersoll-Rand closed at 35 3/8, up 3/4; Caterpillar closed at 57 3/8, up 1; and International Paper closed at 73 7/8, up 1 7/8.
On the other hand, many technology stocks were lower, following some disappointing earnings reports. Bay Networks declined 3 13/16 , to 3311/16 , 3Com fell 1 1/8, to 52 3/4 and Cisco Systems slipped 3/4, to 38 5/8.
Drug stocks also slumped in the day's trading. Merck was off 7/8, to 42 1/8 and Pfizer was off 1 3/4, to 86 5/8. Among the health maintenance organizations, which analysts fear will suffer a margin squeeze, U.S. Healthcare led the falloff, sinking 6 1/2, to 33 1/4.
United Healthcare declined 4 1/4, to 39 3/8 and was the third most actively-traded stock. Humana closed at 21 7/8, down 2 3/4; Coventry closed at 24 3/8, down 3 1/8; and Oxford Health closed at 46 5/8, down 7 5/8.

HEADLINE: New Proposal for Coliseum: Use It to Hold Conventions

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
More than a decade after the city put the New York Coliseum in mothballs, setting off an often bitter series of negotiations over selling it to Mortimer B. Zuckerman, city officials now say the best thing to do for the time being is to use it as it was originally intended: a convention center.
Although officials say they still ultimately want the site redeveloped along the lines that Mr. Zuckerman proposed, they say the city and the Coliseum's owner, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, could make the most money in the short term with a convention center that would draw out-of-town visitors and their money. 
 City economists, who have been studying the issue for about six months, estimated that $30 million in taxes and 10,000 jobs would come to the city through a successful convention center at the Coliseum.
John S. Dyson, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said those figures were based on an assumption that at least 50 percent of the shows and events would be tailored for out-of-town visitors who would stay in hotels, eat in restaurants and shop in city stores.
In addition, the economists concluded that 500 to 1,000 jobs would be created for renovating the building, which has been largely vacant for more than a decade.
Since last July, when a plan by Mr. Zuckerman to build an office, retail and residential complex on the site fell through, city officials and members of the M.T.A. board have feuded over what to do with the site.
The board has been pushing to lease the building for 10 years or more in order to raise quick revenue, and has fielded offers for a television studio and retail stores.
But aides to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, hoping to find a developer like Mr. Zuckerman to build a large, new complex, have urged the agency to go slow and not lock itself into a long-term lease.
The convention center idea, Mr. Dyson said, would be the best way to maximize income while awaiting a full-scale development proposal. "When we compared a convention center use for the exhibition hall with use as a television studio, high-end retail and other uses that have been proposed," said Mr. Dyson, "we concluded that it was the best use for the goal of generating jobs and revenue."
Although the transportation agency did not take a formal position, several board members called the proposal a good start and a hopeful sign the impasse could be broken.
"I'm not going to be smart enough to say that a convention center would be better or worse than other proposals," said Peter S. Kalikow, a real estate developer and M.T.A. board member. "But if we can get what we need, a way to generate revenue for the M.T.A., I don't think anyone here would be against it." In recent months Mr. Kalikow criticized the Giuliani administration over the amount of time it was taking to complete the study.
Mr. Dyson said the plan would have to be set up so that it did not drain business from the the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the city's main convention site, whose completion in 1986 allowed the city to close down the smaller Coliseum.
Mr. Dyson said the economic analysis, which was prepared by the Economic Development Corporation, showed that the city needed more convention space and was losing business to other cities, like Chicago and Toronto, that have more convention space than New York City does.
Mr. Dyson conceded that the convention center use would generate only about $1.7 million in annual tax revenue for the M.T.A. but he said emphatically that the city was prepared to negotiate some sort of plan to share tax revenue with the transportation agency that would increase that amount.
But the revenues will not come until the city and M.T.A. spend money to upgrade the Coliseum. The study said the minimum cost would be $33.7 million, while a full-scale overhaul would cost $121 million. The study did not address who would pay for it.
Mr. Dyson, who holds a seat on the M.T.A. board, said that the city still favored a sale or redevelopment project that would include the entire site, but that by making its proposal, the city was living up to its agreement to submit to the M.T.A. its recommendation for some sort of interim use.
Mr. Dyson said yesterday that the convention center plan could include leasing the exhibition hall, and that the city might make the lease contingent on the operator's taking 50 percent of its bookings for events aimed at out-of-town visitors.
According to the economic analysis, out-of-town visitors to a convention or trade show spend, on average, $328 per day, while local visitors spend only $53 per day.
The report also said that while other cities were expanding their convention center space, New York City had been turning away potential convention business.

HEADLINE: Max H. Karl, 85, Pioneer in Mortgage Insurance

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
Max H. Karl, a lawyer who invented the modern form of private mortgage insurance, helping to put home ownership within reach for millions of families, died in his sleep yesterday at the Baptist Hospital in Miami. He was 85 and had retired to Miami.
He died of complications after heart surgery, his family said. 
 In the 1950's, Mr. Karl became frustrated with the time and paperwork required to obtain a home backed by Federal Government insurance, the only kind available at the time. In 1957, using $250,000 raised from friends and other investors in his hometown of Milwaukee, Mr. Karl founded the Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corporation.
Unlike many mortgage insurers who collapsed during the Depression, Mortgage Guarantee would only insure the first 20 percent of loss on a defaulted mortgage, thus limiting its exposure and creating more incentives for savings and loan associations and other lenders to issue loans only to home buyers who could afford them.
The guarantee was enough to encourage lenders across the country to issue mortgage loans to buyers whose down payments were less than 20 percent of the home's price. The availability of credit helped fuel the home building boom of the 1960's and 1970's. Today, more than 12 percent of the nation's nearly $4 trillion in home mortgages have private mortgage insurance.
"Max had faith that young people would pay for their homes, and he was proven right," said Leon T. Kendall, an executive at the company from 1974 through 1990.
The success of Mortgage Guarantee, known as "magic" or M.G.I.C., allowed Mr. Karl to expand into other businesses. In addition to being the chief executive of Mortgage Guarantee, he founded the first municipal bond insurance company, now called Ambac.
Mr. Karl's quest for a special Internal Revenue Service ruling to exempt some company reserves from taxation made him a small figure in the investigation into influence peddling by Robert G. (Bobby) Baker, the former secretary to the Democratic majority in the Senate. Investigations into Mr. Baker's affairs found that in 1963 he bought 6,000 shares of Mortgage Guarantee stock with the help of a Texas banker shortly before the I.R.S. reversed an earlier policy and granted Mr. Karl the ruling he wanted.
Mr. Karl, who was never accused of any wrongdoing, told a Senate committee that Mr. Baker's first purchase of company stock was in 1959, when shares were for sale only to Wisconsin residents.
Growth of the mortgage insurance business accelerated after 1970, when a Federal housing law said that two Federal agencies, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, could buy mortgages not guaranteed by the Government if they were privately insured.
M.G.I.C.'s fortunes took a turn for the worse after 1982 when Mr. Karl agreed to sell the company to Baldwin United, a fast-growing insurance company that failed the next year. In the scramble to find money to pay for Baldwin United's obligations, the M.G.I.C. that Mr. Karl founded was liquidated, and a new company bearing the same name was created in 1985 with start-up money from managers who included Mr. Karl and from the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. Mr. Karl helped rebuild the new company and retired at the end of 1989.
Before founding Mortgage Guarantee, Mr. Karl practiced law in Milwaukee from 1933 to 1957. A native of Milwaukee, he graduated from the University of Wisconsin with degrees in economics and law.
He is survived by his wife, Anita Davis; two sons, Robert and Kenneth; a daughter, Karyn Karl Schwade, and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Caterpillar Profit Jumps 56.3%, Beating the Analysts' Consensus

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., April 19

 BODY:
Extending its string of record earnings into the fifth consecutive quarter, Caterpillar Inc. reported today that net income rose 56.3 percent in the first quarter, lifted by strong demand for its products.
The maker of construction and farm equipment said net income increased to $300 million, or $1.50 a share, in the first quarter, from $192 million, or 94 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. The results were adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split and exceeded the mean earnings estimate of $1.27 a share, based on a survey of 19 analysts by Zacks Investment Research. 
 Revenue rose 19.1 percent, to $3.91 billion from $3.29 billion. The volume of machinery and diesel engine sales rose 15 percent, Caterpillar said.
Caterpillar's shares rose $1, to $57.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Sales and earnings rose even though about 9,000 members of the United Auto Workers union remained on strike at eight of the company's factories in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Colorado. The strike started last June 21, when more then 14,000 members of the United Automobile Workers walked off the job, protesting what they called unfair labor practices. The company contends the walkout is over economic issues such as wages and benefits.
Caterpillar said its outlook for sales and profit for 1995 remained unchanged from the forecast it made in January. The company expects improved growth in Europe, Japan, other parts of Asia and the Middle East to offset a worse-than-expected slump in Mexico and other parts of Latin America. Demand in the United States is expected to be near 1994 levels.
Still, Caterpillar said, the dollar's plunge against such currencies as the Japanese yen and the German mark poses "certain risks" for the economic outlook.

HEADLINE: Preparing Students For the World Of Jobs

BYLINE: By Hedrick Smith; Hedrick Smith is author of a forthcoming book, "Rethinking America: A New Game Plan from the American Innovators -- Schools, Business, People, Work."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The pressures of global competition have spawned a variety of successful experiments in rethinking how to educate the neglected majority of our high school students -- the 70 percent who will not finish four years of college.
Rethinking means new curriculums, new teaching methods, a new joining of academic skills and jobs skills and of classroom learning and work-site learning. 
 It means benchmarking America against the world's best systems and forging more partnerships between schools and business.
With notable successes in hand, the educational challenge today is to capitalize on our best models, to disseminate the best ideas of America's innovators and replicate them nationwide.
That effort was put on track by the last Congress, but it is in danger of being derailed by indiscriminate budget-cutting and block-grant fever in the new Congress.
That would be a major mistake. Reflect on John Torinus, a smart entrepreneur who runs Serigraph Inc., a high-tech graphics and printing business in West Bend, Wis. Mr. Torinus has his eye on markets in Japan, Brazil, the Mexican industrial corridor, on customers such as Toyota and Nippondenso as well as Buick and Black & Decker.
Five years ago, Mr. Torinus was in despair. Like many employers, he could not find qualified workers coming out of local high schools. "We had illiterates," Mr. Torinus says, "people who couldn't read blueprints, people who couldn't do simple decimals."
"If you want to meet the quality standards you need in international competition today," he insists, "you've got to have trained people -- very well trained."
In 1991, after seeing Germany's dual education system, Mr. Torinus was ready to gamble on something new -- bringing the German system to Wisconsin. The experiment would take average high school kids -- those turned off by school and itching to get into the work world. It was not aimed at dropouts or those bound for college.
In tandem with West Bend High School and with a former Wisconsin State School Superintendent, Bert Grover, and others, Mr. Torinus and the national association of printers helped devise a world-standard curriculum, tying together academic skills and job skills -- a system in which teen-agers would study part-time and work part-time, and receive pay for their work.
In 1992, Mr. Torinus's company took 11 high school apprentices into the two-year program, 8 more the next year, 10 more the third year, each at a cost of $3,600 a year.
The results were astounding. Mediocre students started making the dean's list. After they graduated, Mr. Torinus hired every young apprentice he could, but several apprentices, inspired by the combination of work and study, wanted to go to college.
The Wisconsin experiment has spread to other fields: insurance, banking, health, auto technology, electronics, biotechnology, engineering technology, tourism and manufacturing. First, two communities tried this approach; now it's in 30.
But it takes time and money to rewrite curriculums, retrain teachers, involve business, train industry mentors and set high standards.
And it takes seed capital to move from a few successful demonstrations to a nationwide system -- not for all students but for enough to provide the backbone of the future workforce.
So last year, Congress passed the School to Work Act, authorizing $250 million a year for seven years to develop this whole new approach to higher education. States had to compete for this Federal venture capital.
The first grants were awarded to Maine, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Kentucky, Michigan, Wisconsin and Oregon. In addition, 36 local areas -- some middle class, some poor, some rural, some urban -- received startup money.
The amounts were modest, a few million dollars per state. But it was enough to spur communities into action and to attract more funds from states, local governments and businesses.
Another 20 states are due to get similar seed money this year; this will encourage innovative reforms that promise handsome dividends not only for students but for industry, which spends $30 billion a year on remedial education.
But those new grants may never be made. This fragile effort to make American education more globally competitive is threatened by the block-grant, budget-cutting mindset on Capitol Hill.
In its first 100 days, the House knocked $25 million out of the school to work reform plan for 1995 (the Senate cut $5 million and the two chambers must now reconcile the difference).
More serious cutting is threatened for 1996 during the second 100 days. John Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, wants to lump all training into one block grant -- adult, youth, basic literacy and personal rehabilitation.
There is good reason to fear that under block grants, the fledgling school-to-work program will be devoured by larger, entrenched state bureaucracies committed to old programs. Block grants encourage governors to channel money in old ways. The inertia of the old mindset is to stick with old educational methods and to keep education and business separate.
A block grant is a crude instrument of reform. By lumping an intelligent and workable new program in with old programs that have not been effective, block grants risk suffocating a promising initiative in its infancy.
Rethinking education means not only rethinking how schools teach but how Congress legislates. In its zeal to trim the budget and devolve programs to the states, Congress is indiscriminately risking an innovative idea that could bring lasting benefits to America's economy and its children.

HEADLINE: U.S. Wealth Gap Is Also a Vietnam War Legacy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your timely April 17 article on wealth inequality in the United States ("Gap in Wealth in U.S. Called Widest in West," front page), closely following publication of Robert McNamara's book "In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam," prompts me to offer my opinion on the origin of the undesirable trend of extreme wealth inequality in the United States. 
 In all the publicity that has accompanied Mr. McNamara's book, practically the only mention I've noted of the economic consequences of the Vietnam War was in your April 13 book review: "And McNamara faults President Johnson for failing to be more forthright with the American public about the growing expense of the war."
This understates the facts substantially! Lyndon Johnson deliberately lied to Congress and the American people and escalated the war by stealth, ignoring the warning of his advisers that the result of a failure to raise taxes to finance the war would be a dangerous increase in inflation. Prior to the escalation of the war the United States economy of the early 1960's was a practically utopian equilibrium combination of solid growth without inflation.
Johnson's policy set the stage for and began the inflation of the 1970's, which was made worse by the irrational economic policies of President Nixon and the unsound ones of Jimmy Carter. The dollar lost nearly half its purchasing power in the 1970's. This resulted in massive shifts of wealth toward upper-income groups, who are the owners of businesses and property. The real income of the lowest 20 percent income class declined substantially, while before 1967, income distribution among classes had been very stable.
I am of the strong belief that the trend to extreme wealth inequality in the United States has its origin in President Johnson's failure to finance the Vietnam War with a tax increase and that this result is one of the most serious enduring consequences of the ill-conceived Vietnam War.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Brazil's Chief, In U.S., Says He'll Insist on Key Reforms

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

 BODY:
In a speech that points to the growing importance of foreign investment for Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso pledged yesterday that his country would not abandon steps toward legal reform and open markets, and he predicted that initial changes in the Constitution would be approved by the Brazilian Congress in three to four months -- much sooner than expected.
"Our Congress will discuss, change as it should, but our Congress will ultimately approve the measures that our country requires," he said. Mr. Cardoso, who took office in January after winning 54 percent of the votes, said Congress would "reflect public opinion" in approving his initiatives. 
 His proposals are considered crucial in opening Latin America's largest market, a country roughly the area of the continental United States with a population of more than 150 million, to foreign investment. Brazil is expected to spend about $70 billion developing its basic facilities and services in coming years, and is privatizing vast state enterprises and granting concessions to foreign investors in an effort to draw medium- and long-term capital.
Mr. Cardoso appeared at a lunch of the Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce in Manhattan as part of his first state visit to the United States. In his speech, he reaffirmed his country's pledge to privatize the choicest of its national holdings, the telecommunications and oil industries, and, more important, to change laws that give preference to domestic companies in the competition for mining and other rights.
Brazil's newest currency, the real, was introduced by the preceding Government last July to stem rampant inflation. To maintain the real's strength, the Cardoso Government is seeking to make changes in constitutional, tax and social security policies, along with continuing to seek foreign capital.
Mr. Cardoso said yesterday that Brazilian states would be required to provide specific services in return for the federal money they receive. Otherwise, they could lose the revenue.
Bankers and investors said after his speech that they were impressed by his command of the situation in Brazil, though they had heard little that induced them to relax their caution.
"He was prepared to get into details, to say how many companies will be privatized this year, how long it will take," said Geoffrey Dennis, senior managing director for emerging-markets research at Bear, Stearns & Company. "It enabled us to put some markers down in the sand that we can measure him by."
Mr. Dennis said that he did not expect that the Brazilian Congress to enact major legislative changes by September, but that Mr. Cardoso could still make good on his word. "He can begin to make significant progress, and that's all that people will need to see," Mr. Dennis said.
More important than any specific statement the visiting President made, however, was his decision to appear in New York, particularly before continuing on to Washington. Speaking to investors first, and not seeking financial help during the trip from the United States or from international financial institutions, they said, signaled Brazil's determination to be seen as a potentially lucrative market.
"The very fact that you have a Brazilian President getting up and addressing the investment community, that's a major indication of how far Brazil has come," said Francisco Gros, chairman of Morgan Stanley Latin America.
Stephen E. Hluchan, treasurer of Minerals Technologies Inc., said the President's optimism and determination were persuasive, if inconclusive. "I think we're still in the mode of anticipation of what will happen," he said.

HEADLINE: YACHT RACING;
Dellenbaugh Chases a Miracle

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, April 19

 BODY:
What yachtsman with a yen to win wouldn't want to compete on one of the quickest, slickest, most talked-about sailboats in the world? And what if his crew -- an eager but relatively inexperienced group of female athletes -- were in close pursuit of the most sought-after prize in yachting?
Such were his prospects a month ago today when David Dellenbaugh became the tactician on Mighty Mary. The team was being billed as the first all-women's crew to compete in the 144-year history of the America's Cup. But when Dellenbaugh went on board, he changed all that. 
 "I basically went into this saying I wanted to impact this as little as possible," Dellenbaugh said during an interview here. "I told the team to do it the way they've been doing it, and I will fall into the cracks. My job is allowing everybody else to do their job as best they can."
As the only man on the syndicate's 75-foot yacht, Mighty Mary, Dellenbaugh was destined to become either a savior or a misfit. As it turns out, he's looking more each day like a man chasing a miracle.
By winning a race Monday against Stars & Stripes, the now "mostly" women's crew on Mighty Mary upstaged a veteran team led by Dennis Conner. But today, after being in a three-way tie for the lead, Mighty Mary lost to Young America. "I think we have as much chance as anybody to defend the America's Cup," Dellenbaugh said while preparing for today's race.
Anything can happen now. Mighty Mary has three more matches in the 12-race round-robin Citizen Cup finals. Including the semifinals, Dellenbaugh has guided the team through 15 races, 8 of which they have lost.
The team has had its trying times, such as in the semifinals race against Stars & Stripes when a wrong call from the foredeck caused Mighty Mary to go over the start line too early and have to re-round. Dellenbaugh, who steers at the starts, depended on perfect timing.
He is said to be frustrated on occasion by the women's lack of experience. But as their former coach, he knew that most of them are small boat sailors, or in the case of the grinders, not sailors at all. Only one, Dawn Riley, has ever competed in an America's Cup before. Without him on board, it's unlikely the women would have a chance at all.
Dellenbaugh's appointment by Bill Koch, the America<3> syndicate's founder and primary benefactor, came as a surprise to all but four of the 28 women. Unexpected and hastily planned, the change crushed any hope that an all-women's team could break the tradition of male domination over yachting's oldest trophy. While some of the women appeared disillusioned, others embraced the idea.
"The bottom line is, being new to the sport, you've got to see where your assets are," said Stephanie Maxwell-Pierson, a grinder on Mighty Mary who is an Olympic bronze medalist in rowing. "You find the talent and skill you need and take the next step."
Koch said the women proved that handling such a big boat wasn't a strength issue. But they needed more advice on tactics and starting sequences. Dellenbaugh, who had steered Koch's victorious America<3> in the 1992 cup races, seemed like the perfect candidate.
The 41-year-old Dellenbaugh is a homebody, a family man from Easton, Conn., who often races in local regattas on Long Island Sound with his wife, Susan, and increasingly, with his two young children, Rebecca, 6, and Emily, 4, on board.
Dellenbaugh practically grew up on sailboats, but it was a long way from gunkholing around his family home in Fairfield, Conn., to making it into the world-class ranks of sailing. After 1970's detours to Cornell for a degree in economics and night school at Boston State College for a master's in elementary education, his yachting breakthrough came in 1983. He was invited by Dave Perry, a top East Coast match-racer and rules expert, to compete in the Congressional Cup regatta in Long Beach, Calif. By 1986, Dellenbaugh was good enough to skipper his own boat, and finish in the top three.
His entry into America's Cup racing came through Buddy Melges, an Olympic medalist and America's Cup trials skipper in 1986. Through Melges, Dellenbaugh started sailing on Koch's 1992 cup team, which ultimately defended the cup against Italy. "I think Dave is the perfect catalyst to jell the women's team," Melges said recently. "He's probably one of the most tactful guys I know, so calm, so cool. That may be just what the women needed."
Dellenbaugh's association with the team began in August 1993 when the all-female idea was taking shape. Dellenbaugh said he would not have taken the job as tactician unless convinced that women wanted him to do it.
"How I personally feel about the idea is not important," Dellenbaugh said. "In my mind, if they feel it should happen, it's a good idea. And I feel almost all of them wanted it to happen."

HEADLINE: BOXING;
Foreman Setting Sights Beyond Schulz

BYLINE: By TOM FRIEND 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., April 19

 BODY:
He is of the coffee generation. George Foreman skips rope, chops wood, slaps a 100-pound bag and drinks two cups a day, caffeinated. This heavyweight champion of the world is not only old enough to be his next opponent's father, but he also woke up two months ago a grandfather.
"I was in denial," he said. "People were asking me, 'George, you're a grandfather?' and I was like, 'Nope.' " 
 He is considered in the twilight of his career, but, at age 46, it is long past twilight and the street lamps are on. He is expected to fight only three more times before permanently hitting the highway in his brand new Greyhound bus. The question is whether Mike Tyson will land on his itinerary.
"To be honest with you, it'd be wrong for Mike Tyson to get out of jail and fight me right now," Foreman said today. "It'd be taking advantage of him. I'm too old for him. Ha, ha, got you."
In all honesty, Foreman wants Tyson tomorrow for $100 million -- with a straight-up, 50-50 split -- but Tyson is hiding under a rock, according to the Foreman camp.
"The toughest man on the planet is afraid of a guy who's older than dirt," said Foreman, who has starved himself and seems trim. "You can say, 'Yeah, but he's been out three years.' Can say anything you want. But I was out for 10 years and I came back screaming and begging for it. I had a great big old stomach; I'd sit down and couldn't get up."
So, because Tyson's version of a workout has been buying five BMWs and a home -- "I'm hearing good things about him lately; he's been contributing to the economy of Nevada," the champion said -- Foreman was forced to search overseas for an opponent. He reeled one in -- Axel Schulz, a 26-year old German with a crewcut. Schulz is here with a 21-1-1 record (10 knockouts), with an interpreter and with little chance of upsetting Foreman (73-4) on Saturday night at the MGM Grand's Garden Arena.
"A guy asked me, 'George, how can you fight a guy who's not even rated?' " Foreman said. "And I said, 'Tyson isn't rated either.' "
It is expected to be more a pep rally than an International Boxing Federation championship fight. After all, this is Foreman's first title defense since he unplugged Michael Moorer last Nov. 5. So much has happened since: Home Box Office purchased the rights to the Schulz fight for a record $9 million, Foreman turned 46 and the rest of the boxing world -- other than Tyson -- queued up to take his belt.
"Who doesn't want George?" said 40-something James (Bonecrusher) Smith. "Actually, I wish George would forget about fighting Tyson and fight only people over 40. Like golf, we could have a seniors tour. George is the perfect guy to start it; he's already champ."
Foreman, after sucking down a last-minute cup of coffee today, maintained at his news conference that he does not fight for the money -- although his purse Saturday night is $10 million, compared with Schulz's $350,000. He fights, he said, for the people who tug at his sleeve, who pat him on his stomach. Today, alone, he was asked to autograph a 20-year-old Ali-Foreman poster and a ticket from a Sonny Liston fight.
"Believe it or not, I was on the undercard that day," he said.
Each fight is his opportunity to brag about his age, and today he was asked what he wants to be remembered for.
"That I paid out every child support payment," he said, a survivor of four divorces. "The last one is 18 years old; I got no more child support payments. I did it!"
His life as a preacher means much to him, too, and his sermon at a local church was well-received last Sunday. After his last fight next November, he will ride off into the sunset in that bus of his.
"I told my wife as soon as I got the money, I'd buy this big old Greyhound bus and travel around the country preaching," he said. "These buses cost like $700,000. She looked at the account the other day, and she said, 'You know, you have enough money to buy the bus, George.' I said, 'But, but, but,' and she said, 'You've got enough to buy the bus.' So I've got to travel around the country as a preacher. It'll take me another 10 years. Then, I'm going to come back and take on all comers. Don't laugh; I did before."
He can manipulate, too; his slur campaign against Tyson is designed to lure Tyson in the ring. And Foreman laughed at the MGM's idea of building a Tyson statue. "Mike Tyson is a guy worthy of a statue built," he said, "and it should be inside where the pigeons can't get to it."
Nevertheless, Foreman's promotor, Bob Arum, said that Foreman would fight a European next July and then close out against either Moorer, Riddick Bowe or Tyson. "But the chances of Tyson are nil," Arum said. "They know George will kill him. They'd rather put him in with stiff-a-roni's."
If Tyson eludes him, though, Foreman will not lament.
"You realize I've been boxing 30 years?" he said. "I've been boxing, boxing, boxing. The sport's scary, makes you nervous, but I love it. Shame on me."

BANKAMERICA CORP. (BAC,N)

BYLINE: Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation said yesterday that its first-quarter earnings rose about 19 percent, as a stronger economy prompted consumers and companies to borrow more.
BankAmerica, the banking company based in San Francisco, said net income rose to $611 million, or $1.46 a share, compared with $513 million, or $1.27 a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. 
 Earnings exceeded Wall Street's expectations of $1.43 a share, based on a survey of 23 analysts by IBES International Inc.
"BankAmerica is doing better than the average bank in an environment where revenue growth has been relatively hard to come by," said Carole Berger of Salomon Brothers. She said the acquisition of the Continental Bank Corporation of Chicago also contributed to higher earnings.
In the first quarter, net interest income rose to $2.05 billion, from $1.8 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier. Much of the gain reflected an increase in loans outstanding. Loans totaled $144.2 billion, up from $123.5 billion a year earlier.
The provision for credit losses was reduced to $100 million from $125 million. Reducing the provision leaves more money for the bottom line.
The net interest margin -- the spread between the amount a bank earns on its loans and the amount it pays in interest on deposits -- widened, to 4.55 percent, from 4.45 percent a year earlier. (Bloomberg Business News)

Prices for Bonds Are Mixed As the Dollar Steadies Itself

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday as the dollar steadied.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 16/32 , to 1036/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.36 percent, from 7.39 percent on Tuesday. Prices for Treasury bills and notes were mostly lower. 
 While the dollar's firming helped bolster bonds yesterday, there was concern that a sustained recovery in the dollar could dampen demand for Treasury bills and notes.
The recovery of the dollar came after the Commerce Department reported that the United States trade deficit in goods and services narrowed by 24.6 percent, to $9.01 billion in February, which was much lower than expected.
Rosanne M. Cahn, chief economist, equity research department at the CS First Boston Corporation, said that the improvement in the February trade figures might give the dollar a temporary bounce. But she cautioned that the improvement was "largely a result of temporary special factors."
"A drop in imports, especially autos, reflected the cyclical softening of the economy, and a rebound in aircraft exports were major contributors," she said.
The dollar's overnight move to new lows against the Japanese yen was offset by the weaker-than-expected trade number, according to Gary R. Thayer, senior economist with A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. For the dollar to remain strong over the long term, he said, the United States would need to make a clear move to reduce the budget deficit or Japan would have to open its markets.
"As long as the weak dollar is not having an impact on the domestic economy the Fed will be able to maintain its steady policy," Mr. Thayer said. "If down the road the weak dollar leads to higher commodity prices, the Fed may be backed into a corner and raise interest rates again. So long as there is no spike in commodity prices, we may see the yield on the long bond continue in its recent trading range.
"The Fed's been lucky so far that the decline of the dollar has come at a period when other commodity prices have come down because of the soft economy."
Today's survey of regional business activity by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia should have little impact on the market, traders said. A moderate report is expected.
In other trading, municipal bond prices fell as some investors began to balk at some new debt sales, saying they were too expensive when compared with other fixed-income securities.
The average yield to first call of the Bond Buyer's municipal bond index of 40 actively traded issues rose 2 basis points, to 6.22 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the corporate bond market, bank debt offerings were viewed favorably because of good first-quarter earnings reports, as the Nationsbank Corporation and the Chase Manhattan Corporation came to market with $450 million of new bonds.
Another bank, the Old Kent Bank and Trust Company of Grand Rapids, Mich., a unit of the Old Kent Financial Corporation, also sold bonds yesterday. The Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises sold $300 million of notes, in the first deal in four years by the Japanese Government's guaranteed borrower.
According to Merrill Lynch, which managed the issue, the American notes, which carry an interest rate of 7.375 percent and are due in 2005, were priced at 99.95 to yield 7.382 percent, or about 33 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note. The issue is noncallable and rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

Signs of an Economic Slowdown Send Price of Copper Plunging

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices fell sharply yesterday as continuing signs of an economic slowdown weighed down the market.
Recent reports of weakness in housing and industrial production point to reduced demand from manufacturers, deflating expectations of increasing consumption that drove copper prices higher in January. 
 On other commodity markets, crude oil rose to its highest price in more than seven months while wheat prices fell. The Commodity Research Bureau index dropped five-hundredths of a point, to 236.82.
The expected drop in demand for copper from manufacturers comes just as producers are expanding output. Western copper production is expected to grow by 1.12 million tons, or 5.4 percent, this year, led by expansions in Chile, the United States and Canada, according to Resource Strategies, a consultant on metals.
"The robust manufacturing expansion is now clearly in question," said Richard Hirsch, vice president with Deutsche Sharps Pixley Metals Inc. in New York. "The weight of the negative figures is becoming too awesome to ignore."
The Commerce Department reported on Tuesday that new housing starts fell in March to their lowest rate in two years. Building and construction are the largest sources of demand for copper, accounting for about 40 percent of all copper used in the United States. And on Friday, the Federal Reserve said industrial production showed its first decline in six months, as high interest rates weakened demand for autos and home appliances, two other prime sources of copper consumption.
Copper for May delivery fell 5.3 cents, to $1.294 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange of New York, the lowest for an active contract since March 1. Copper reached $1.427 a pound on Jan. 19, the highest level in almost six years.
Crude oil staged a late-day rally as demand increased from refineries that have stepped up production of gasoline.
Last week, gasoline production rose by 357,000 barrels a day, or 4.7 percent, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Refineries are increasing their gasoline output to build stockpiles in anticipation of strong demand this summer and also to capture profit margins that are at their highest in weeks.
The May crude oil contract, which expires today, gained 36 cents, to $20.41 a barrel, the highest price for crude since Aug. 1. Expectations of increased production pushed gasoline prices down, traders said. Unleaded gasoline for May delivery fell 0.54 cent, to 63.15 cents a gallon.
Wheat prices fell amid forecasts for rain in the southern Plains states, where the developing hard red winter wheat crop needs moisture after an unusually dry spring.
At the Kansas City Board of Trade, hard red winter wheat for July delivery, representing the crop now in the ground, fell 3.25 cents, to $3.5375 a bushel.

Russian obstacles: disgruntled farmers and the new cartels.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
IS Russia poised for economic takeoff? After three years of on-again, off-again reforms and with the Pyrrhic military victory in Chechnya still fresh in the news, skepticism comes easily. But little by little, wary analysts are abandoning their caution. "Russia is a real market economy now," says Andrei Shleifer, an economist at Harvard who has advised the Russian Government on privatization.
That doesn't mean the path to affluence is strewn with rose petals. A big test of Moscow's political will to contain inflation looms this summer, when the 30 million Russians who still scratch a living from the soil demand a budget-busting round of subsidies to finance the harvest. The more fundamental challenge -- one the Government will no doubt face for years to come -- is the taming of the private cartels that are replacing public monopolies. "You can't sustain an efficient, continent-wide economy with concentrated economic power," argues Donald W. Green, managing director of Planecon, a Washington-based consulting firm. 
 By most measures the transition from central planning has done more damage to Russia than the Great Depression did to the industrial West. Mr. Green's firm estimates that output has been cut by nearly half since 1989 and will shrink more in 1995. Prices rose tenfold in 1993, fourfold in 1994 and will likely double in 1995.
But much of the lost production consisted of stuff only a commissar could covet: missiles to protect the empire from the capitalist hordes, television sets that spontaneously combusted, steel mills based on the latest 1950's technology. And while the data are murky, living standards certainly have not fallen as much as output: wages, corrected for price changes, have almost held their own since 1992. Extrapolating from World Bank estimates, the average Russian now consumes about twice as much as the average Chinese.
What's more, the pain of the transition has been spread more evenly than, say, the trauma of the 1980's debt crisis in the third world. Formal unemployment remains below 3 percent; urban public services, notably education and mass transit, are still adequate.
So hard times have not been as hard as advertised. But what explains the optimism that softer times are ahead?
For one thing, the Government seems determined to hold the line on inflation. Ruble credits are no longer flowing freely to the former Soviet republics to finance purchases from Russia -- and thus no longer feed price pressures back home. The Russian central bank has been stripped of its power to create money for any purpose other than covering the budget deficit. And reformers, led by the battle-tested Anatoly B. Chubais, have apparently made an austerity pact with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the pragmatic Prime Minister with a reputation for picking winners. The Economist magazine predicted that inflation could recede to a civilized 2 to 3 percent a month by the end of 1995.
Arguably more important, privatization of industry is a fact. Most small shops were sold for a song to their employees. And all but a core of protected state industries have been given away through voucher-based auctions. Today, six out of seven nonfarm workers are privately employed.
Privatization has given the enterprises enormous incentives to find competent managers, to pay attention to consumer demand and to treat capital as a scarce resource. As significant, it has weakened the silver cord linking the enterprises to Moscow, withering the influence of the old apparachiks.
The soft underbelly is agriculture. Still state-owned and still wretchedly inefficient, the farms' claim on the public purse is still hard to resist. Indeed, the rural vote will probably remain the swing vote in national elections for decades to come.
Not surprisingly, each year for the last three the Government has succumbed to pressure for handouts by late summer, when the farms typically run out of cash. This time around, though, Moscow may hold out, if only to meet its obligations to the International Monetary Fund to limit the size of the budget deficit. The deeper threat to a successful economic beginning, Mr. Shleifer suggests, comes from a source that did not exist two years ago: monopoly capitalists.
Big private enterprises (including the natural gas consortium, which has close financial ties to the Prime Minister) are working in tandem with the new private banking sector to build informal cartels and secure preferred access to capital. Indeed, the Government is reportedly entertaining a proposal to borrow directly from the private banks, using its minority shares in enterprise as collateral.
Top-down capitalism works in Japan -- and, for that matter, in France. But those countries have traditions of democracy, legal due process and enlightened bureaucracy, Mr. Shleifer notes. His big worry is that "Russia will turn into Latin America 30 years ago," where wealth was concentrated along with economic power, and growth mattered little to the elite.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee;
Art and Politics: Keeping It All Fresh

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
RUBY DEE had started to yawn when the telephone rang the other night in the Westchester County home she shares with her husband, Ossie Davis. It was one of their three children, instructing Ms. Dee to watch herself on television.
Ms. Dee dutifully clicked on the tube, and there she was, narrating a special on the life of Edgar Allen Poe in her voice of smoke and silk. The word "literary" rolled off her tongue, conjuring images of art with a capital A -- a tad exaggerated, a little campy. 
 "Oh really, Ruby," Mr. Davis joked at her pronunciation, his own voice a bottomless bass. Ms. Dee giggled good-naturedly.
After 46 years of marriage and more than three decades as established stars, Ms. Dee and Mr. Davis remain without peer in an industry not known for nurturing black people, older people or long marriages. Mr. Davis is 77, and although Ms. Dee adamantly refuses to take a number ("not as old as God," she said coyly), an educated guess has her pushing 70.
Curled up on their living room sofa together after a long day of rehearsals for their new show, "Two Hah Hahs and a Homeboy," they did what they like to do on quiet evenings at home: talk.
He speaks deliberately. She is emotional and elliptical, gurgling with opinion, a diva with a homegirl edge.
She tells the photographer, "Don't take these chins of mine." Her husband quietly ambles up the stairs to shave and change shirts. She is elfin, delicate and honey colored. He is a tall, big, dark-chocolate man. They are unlined, unbowed, upbeat.
At this point in their lives, after friendships with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X (Mr. Davis presented his eulogy), after protest marches and award-winning performances, they say their approach to art and social struggle remains the same.
Over the years, Mr. Davis and Ms. Dee have been on perpetual call for benefits and rallies for organizations like the N.A.A.C.P., the Urban League and AIDS groups like Housing Works. Many of their numerous television appearances and productions have focused on human rights struggles. Through their company, Emmalyn Enterprises, for example, they produced the 1986 PBS special "Martin Luther King: The Dream and the Drum."
The couple say they have managed to remain fresh by working with younger artists, doing their own projects and finding work that puts them in the limelight as mature performers. They were introduced to a new generation of movie-goers in the Spike Lee films "Do the Right Thing" (1989) and "Jungle Fever" (1991).
Their current show, "Two Hah Hahs and a Homeboy," a two-act dramatic piece compiled by Ms. Dee, opens Saturday at the Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, N.J. It stars Ms. Dee and Mr. Davis and features the music of their son, Guy Davis. It pays homage to Zora Neale Hurston, the Harlem Renaissance writer, and includes a piece about Guy's first haircut and Ossie Davis's version of the biblical tale of Joshua.
Ms. Dee gave the drama its name and said that she and Mr. Davis each represented a "Hah." They saw it as a way to use humor to deal with the social dissonance of middle-class blacks, whose upwardly mobility is slowed by discrimination.
"We had been talking for a long time about this revue we wanted to do of black America," Ms. Dee said. "It's this box you go in where you hear the histories and the stories and the jokes. Then you can come out and put on your suit and tie and get your briefcase and go on about your business, refreshed for the year."
"Why don't we build a place somewhere, Ruby?" Mr. Davis said, alluding to the need to find a respite.
"It's buying the myth of integration," Ms. Dee continued, ignoring him for the moment. " 'Oh, I'm not a black author, I'm just an author.' If you don't consider race, well, race won't consider you. But you realize you're black. It happens to us. It's like puberty."
Mr. Davis said: "What is being done in 'Two Hah Hahs' is our effort to reinstitute, to put the folk tales back in their place and update their content. Zora Neale Hurston insisted that if black folks lost their folk tales, they'd lose their identity."
If "Two Hah Hahs" reflects the couple's social commitment, their home, with its African art, grand piano and casually strewn pillows, mirrors their unaffected elegance. The sprawling living room is decorated in soothing tan and beige and punctuated with thriving plants. Ms. Dee and Mr. Davis have lived in the four-story house for 32 years. Because they spend so much time working or at various political and social functions, home is a refuge and a treat.
She was born in Cleveland and grew up in Harlem, and he's from Waycross, Ga. They met during rehearsals for the 1946 Broadway play "Jeb."
Mr. Davis starred in such Broadway plays as "The Green Pastures" (1951), "A Raisin in the Sun" (1959), "I'm Not Rappaport" (1986), "Anna Lucasta" (1988) and his own satirical farce, "Purlie Victorious" (1961). He has directed several films, including "Cotton Comes to Harlem" (1970), "Black Girl" (1972) and "Gordon's War" (1973).
Ms. Dee's stage credits include roles in "A Raisin in the Sun" (she later reprised her role as Ruth in the 1961 film), "Purlie Victorious" and "Anna Lucasta." She won an Obie Award in 1971 for "Boesman and Lena" and the Drama Desk Award for the play "Wedding Band" in 1972.
Even with a visitor present, they tend to talk to each other, interrupting with ease or offering commentary on what the other has to say, the equivalent of verbal love bites.
"He casts well," Mr. Davis said of Spike Lee, having appeared in three of the director's films.
"He casts well," Ms. Dee said with a smirk. "Did you get that?"
Both said they grew up believing that any individual achievement or failure reflected on "the race" and that it was imperative to do whatever you could to make things better. They said the goals were clearer and in some ways easier then: voting rights, access to public accommodations, desegregated schools.
"He thinks, and we both think, too, that questions about the economy and the social order is really . . . ," she said, her words coming too fast. "We need to write much more about how those things affect what we see. You cannot talk about the family, for example, without looking at our total economic structure."
Ms. Dee and Mr. Davis say they share the same goals and have the same political sensibilities, which has made them friends.
"We've never had an ideological difference that I know of, and we've gone through some tough situations," Mr. Davis said. "Malcolm X has sat in this house, and Robeson has sat in this house, and Huey Newton, and they were dangerous people."
They worry that the souls of black folks are being sullied by the commercial images of themselves as amoral losers, nasty comics and criminals.
"Ruby was talking to me the other day about the ideas, the images we give our children," Mr. Davis said. "The images our children know come from television and radio, and so the merchants tell us who we are, rather than Mom and Dad.
"We've sort of discarded our sense of history and culture all around. And our young people, black, white and otherwise, suffer from the fact that we no longer have a respectful relationship with our past."
"For one thing, we allow ourselves to accept whatever comes," Ms. Dee said. "We're forgetting how to fight, we're forgetting how to protest."
When their own two daughters, Nora and Hasna, and son were young, they tagged along on protest marches. They were considered exotic among the neighborhood children since their parents did not allow a television in their home; to them, television represented an industry that refused to hire black people in significant numbers or in anything other than stereotypical roles.
It would be a mistake, though, to think that Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis are weighed down with the burdens of human rights and artistic integrity. There is about them the sheer giddiness of survivors and the dignity of winners.
"The life is the fun," she said.
"We walk in the middle of humor every day, and we laugh," he said.
"And we fight, too," Ms. Dee said. "Yeah. I win."
They both laughed.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY DAILY BRIEFING;
A Good Year for Jobs

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
With New Jersey leading the way, the Port Authority said, 1994 was a good year for employment. Jobs were up 67,000 in the New York-New Jersey metropolitan region, the best growth spurt since 1987, said George Marlin, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He attributed part of the growth to recent changes in tax and business regulations in New Jersey and predicted that with similar moves in the city, "New York will be rebounding just the way New Jersey is rebounding."

HEADLINE: Mending Ties, U.S. Praises Brazil Leader

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
President Clinton gave a warm embrace to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil today, signaling that after years of tensions fed by military rule, corruption and hyperinflation, the United States wants to make Brazil an important partner on trade and security.
"With our two nations cooperating as never before, we stand at a moment of unparalleled opportunity," Mr. Clinton said in a Rose Garden news conference with the new Brazilian leader. "In the months and years ahead, I look forward to working with President Cardoso to forge an even stronger partnership between our nations and our peoples." 
 Administration officials said the Cardoso visit, only the second state visit by a Brazilian leader in 24 years, showed that with Mexico in turmoil, the United States was looking increasingly to Brazil to help promote democracy and fight drugs and crime.
With Brazil's economy growing strongly the last three years, investment is an important focus. Mr. Cardoso has given several speeches to encourage American investors, and President Clinton is telling exporters that Brazil could be a bonanza.
"With 160 million consumers, Brazil is one of today's biggest emerging markets, and it offers great opportunity," Mr. Clinton said.
From the Administration's point of view, Mr. Cardoso has done all the right things since coming to power in January: cracking down on inflation, pushing for a trade agreement for the Americas and agreeing to cooperate in combating drugs. Brazil also helped mediate the border war between Peru and Ecuador.
But Administration officials acknowledge that tensions remain.
The United States is disappointed that Brazil has not endorsed an indefinite extension of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, and Mr. Cardoso has not yet persuaded Brazil's Congress to tighten enforcement of pharmaceutical patents held by American companies. One senior Administration official said Mr. Cardoso had provided assurances that he would push through stronger patent legislation soon.
In addition, Brazilian officials have repeatedly criticized the Administration's embargo against Cuba, saying it enables Fidel Castro to blame the United States for his country's woes.
But Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Cardoso's support of democracy, noting that Brazil's military dictators chased him into exile a generation ago. During his exile, Mr. Cardoso spent several semesters teaching at Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley.
The United States and Brazil agreed to set up a committee to encourage American companies to help finance the $70 billion in basic investments Mr. Cardoso says his country needs in coming years.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Cardoso also reaffirmed their commitment to negotiate a trade agreement for the Americas by 2005. Many Latin American officials have voiced the fear that this goal, set at a summit meeting last December in Miami, would be forgotten as a result of Mexico's current economic turmoil.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Weak Dollar And Its Costs

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
"A country which is responsible for the key currency of the world has the responsibility of maintaining reasonable stability of it," Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, complained earlier this week. Translation: Do something -- anything -- to halt the decline of the dollar.
Mr. Camdessus's frayed temper reflects the frustration of Japanese and European officials watching their hopes for vibrant recovery fade away. That is because their exporters are losing competitive edge as their stronger currencies make their goods more expensive to sell in foreign markets. But pleas for action are falling on deaf ears in Washington: American policy makers lack the will and doubt they have the way to buck up the buck. 
 Indeed, despite a doubling of short-term interest rates in 1993 engineered by the Federal Reserve, which tends to make the American currency more attractive to hold, the dollar still fell last year against the Japanese yen and the German mark.
Even more important, the dollar's weakness against the yen and the mark reflects different problems lacking a common solution.
The dollar, rebounding yesterday for a second day from its steady decline, gained in New York against the mark and the yen. [Page D3.]
With the economy performing so well on the domestic front, Washington has little incentive to tinker. Inflation is under control and the economy seems to be on a stable growth path. "Maybe there's room for a move on interest rates, but not much," said Robert Z. Lawrence, an economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.
All politics are local, goes the truism -- and that goes double for the politics of exchange rates. Hence the pressure to stabilize currencies is weaker in America than in Europe or Japan because the United States is less dependent on international trade.
And while Japan is blaming Washington for its currency woes, influential American economists see the current predicament of Japanese industry as rough justice: Only Japan, they say, is feeling much pain from the appreciation of the yen, and only Japan possesses the tools to deal with it decisively.
The same does not apply to Europe, where a show of official determination on both sides of the Atlantic might correct what is seen as a currency misalignment generated by a lemming-like rush to "safer" currencies. But the sort of show that Mr. Camdessus and many of the big names in the world of finance apparently have in mind -- coordinated changes in interest rates along with an effort by central banks to buy dollars in international currency markets -- would not necessarily be successful and could prove costly. Besides, acting without Japan would heighten that nation's sense of second-class status among the economic elite.
All this adds up to a formula for diplomatic stalemate, with markets left to determine the relative value of currencies. Europe may still manage healthy growth. But Japan's already wobbly recovery appears doomed unless the deeply divided Government breaks with tradition to cut interest rates and stimulate spending.
To be sure, a chronically weak currency is a sign of underlying economic stress. If Americans saved more and its Government borrowed less, the United States would not be so dependent on foreign money to support the dollar. And a continuing erosion of the dollar also erodes the ability of Americans to pay their way in the world.
At the heart of the dollar's problem is the fact that the Japanese economy has long been geared to produce more than the Japanese consume and invest at home. This resulting chronic surplus puts upward pressure on the exchange value of the yen. "The only mystery is why the yen didn't rise earlier," said Richard Cooper, a Harvard economics professor.
While eliminating all barriers to imports would help a bit, the only way is to attack the problem at its roots, argues Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. That would require reducing Japanese savings, increasing domestic spending or some combination of the two. Big public works projects -- Tokyo's fix of choice when push comes to shove -- are slow to deliver results. By the same token, lower interest rates take months or years to stimulate private investment.
Cutting taxes, particularly taxes on consumer goods, would stimulate purchases and reduce the surplus that spills abroad. But the Japanese bureaucracy, echoing the austerity that defines traditional Japanese culture and reflecting a fear that an aging population must save even more for retirement, views "consumption as a bad habit," Mr. Hormats said.
Japan's reluctance to stop worrying and start spending is reinforced by the sense that United States profligacy is at fault. However desirable such a shift to thrift here may be, though, it will not change Japan's underlying savings machine -- an economy organized to prosper only when it is exporting far more than it imports. "Fiscal virtue in America wouldn't solve Japan's yen problem," Mr. Hormats said.
Explanations for why the yen is muscle-bound do not apply to the German mark and the other European currencies tied to the mark. Europe is not running chronic trade and "current account" surpluses with the rest of the world. William Brown, chief economist for J. P. Morgan, links the mark's strength to a "flight to quality" from the weaker currencies of Italy and Spain.
Nor does Europe have the painless option to drive down currency exchange values on its own by cutting interest rates and taxes or by increasing government spending. Unlike Japan, Germany and its neighbors are no longer experiencing economic stagnation, which means that government stimulus risks overheating the economy.
Professor Cooper expects the dollar's weakness against the mark to solve itself since there are no fundamental economic forces propping up the German currency. And by that logic, the dollar-mark exchange rate should be a candidate for successful intervention: A flurry of official pronouncements, accompanied by well-timed central bank purchases of dollars and sales of marks, may speed a shift in market psychology much the way the Plaza accord of 1985 initiated a then-desired decline in the exchange value of the dollar.
But a coordinated drive to realign the mark and dollar that leaves the yen to twist slowly in the wind will almost certainly be taken by Tokyo as an attempt to isolate Japan. And, thanks to the current, bizarrely timed threats by the Clinton Administration to punish Japan for its failure to roll out the red carpet for imported auto parts, tensions are already high.
As a result, Japan will probably be left to dig itself out the old-fashioned way, slashing costs and prices at home -- and accepting hundreds of billions of dollars worth of lost output -- to restore its competitive position in world markets. But the route of deflating the economy into prosperity is hardly a sure thing. "The yen could appreciate in tandem," Professor Cooper said, "trapping Japan in slow growth."

Dollar Surges 2.3% Against Yen And Also Advances vs. the Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose solidly for a second consecutive day yesterday, deriving strength from overseas buying and speculation that a meeting of finance ministers from the large industrial nations may act decisively to defend the wobbly currency.
A rally in the United States stock market and technically related purchases of dollars also helped to shore up the dollar, foreign exchange traders said. 
 "Everyone is getting the opinion that really, the market is very short of dollars," said Ivan Sands, manager of foreign exchange and sales at the New York branch of Credit Lyonnais, the large French bank. "Everybody is realizing the extent of the problem."
In New York late yesterday, the dollar surged 2.3 percent against the yen, settling at 83.16 yen from 81.30 yen on Wednesday. It was the sharpest one-day gain by the dollar against the yen since May 10, 1994, when it rose 1.75 yen. The dollar rose to 1.3837 marks from 1.3720 marks.
In Tokyo early yesterday, the dollar climbed against the yen as large Japanese insurance companies and other institutional investors reversed their recent trading and began buying dollars. Some dealers said the buying was prompted by a report on Wednesday showing that the United States trade deficit narrowed sharply in February.
The apparent change of attitude toward the dollar suggested that many Japanese companies, which have been deeply hurt by the dollar's 16.5 percent depreciation against the yen this year, believe the dollar is at or near a bottom for now.
"For those who've been selling the dollar, you've got to ask yourself whether you're doing the right thing," said Hubert Pedroli, foreign exchange manager at the New York office of the Credit Suisse investment firm. "You have to be able to step back and say these are silly levels to keep selling."
Others who had sold the dollar short, or bet the dollar would decline further, then scrambled to buy dollars instead to limit their losses. That buying further lifted the dollar.
Some currency dealers are also betting that the Group of Seven finance ministers, meeting on Tuesday, may take some decisive action to support the dollar.
The seven nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- worked together in 1985 to weaken the dollar and then again in 1987 to halt the dollar's decline.
While some dealers are skeptical that the nations will take concrete steps to help the dollar, they do not want to be caught short if steps are taken.
"When you get these finance ministers together, who knows what can happen?," said Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at the New York branch of the Bank Leumi Trust Company.
Traders said there was no underlying economic news driving the dollar higher yesterday. The dollar dipped briefly on news from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve that local economic activity, a barometer of broader trends, was weakening and inflationary pressure was low. But the dollar quickly recovered.

HEADLINE: Mexican Talks With Rebels Are Delayed

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: SAN ANDRES LARRAINZAR, Mexico, April 20

 BODY:
More than a year after a first round of peace talks failed to end an armed uprising in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, Government representatives delayed resuming the talks today until their safety was guaranteed by the rebels.
Surrounded by hundreds of sympathizers of the Zapatista rebels, representatives of both sides were scheduled to meet in a hastily erected building on top of the town's concrete basketball court to discuss, among other things, proposals for a permanent truce to ease tensions and end the 16-month-old rebellion. 
 But in an indication of how complicated a task it will be, the Government delegates refused to enter the building because of the rebel sympathizers, some of whom wore traditional ribboned hats and carried signs saying, "We are all Zapatistas." The Government said their presence violated the neutrality of the talks, and it refused to allow its delegates to enter San Andres until their safe passage could be guaranteed.
Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, an opposition member of Congress who had come to witness the talks, ridiculed the Government's position. "What did they expect," she said. "If the talks had been held in New York City, there would have been sympathizers."
The standoff is the latest frustration to arise from the uprising, which began with 12 days of armed skirmishes in January 1994 that left more than 145 dead. Since then, there has been practically no violence, but the threat that the two sides might again clash has hung heavily over the state, damaging investor confidence in Mexico and raising political tensions that affected last year's presidential election.
The situation has changed drastically since February, when the Government arrested several people it accused of being rebel leaders, identified the masked spokesman who had been known only as Subcommander Marcos as a radical college professor, and sent a huge force of federal troops into the rebels' highland forest stronghold. The rebels, who are mostly Mayan Indians, have been surrounded since then, while attempts were made to reopen formal peace talks.
Masked representatives of the Zapatista National Liberation Army arrived here to cheers Wednesday night with what their leaders said was a specific proposal for a permanent truce. Government negotiators also said they had come with a plan for lowering tensions and eliminating the lingering military threat.
But Government officials said they were seeking more than a resolution of the military aspect of the rebellion.
"In terms of military force, the Zapatistas no longer have any," said a Government official close to the negotiations. "What we need to do here is resolve the deeper issues in a way that does not leave behind any resentment that can become another problem in the future."
Although they are surrounded by Mexican troops, the Zapatistas still represent a formidable public relations threat with support throughout Mexico. The Government, beset by economic and political problems, feels it must take the rebels seriously, and many Government officials fear that an outburst of violence or a terrorist attack would severely set back Mexico's attempts at recovering from the economic crisis caused by the devaluation of the peso in December.
The current Government plan is for the negotiating sessions with the rebels to continue for several months, perhaps till the end of this year. Each round of talks will deal with specific themes. In later sessions, the Government will take up rebel demands concerning land rights and the brutal poverty in which the Indians of Chiapas live.
This threadbare community, about 15 miles northwest of San Cristobal de las Casas, is a Zapatista stronghold that mirrors the conditions the rebels have said forced them to take up arms. Nearly all the 15,000 residents of the area speak a variety of Indian languages; more than half have never attended school; less than 15 percent of the houses have plumbing, and only 25 percent have electricity.
Government officials have made it clear that they will not expand the talks to include national issues, like democratic reform, that the rebels have tried to place on the agenda. Nor, officials said, will the Government succumb to pressures from conservative parts of society that want to see a quick end to the rebel movement.
"The policy of the Government is not based on pressures but on meeting the goals and objectives of the people of Chiapas," said another Government official close to the talks.
Today's planned talks follow a preliminary session on April 9 between rebels and the Government that was meant to beat a deadline imposed by the Mexican Congress. Arrest orders against rebel leaders had been suspended for a month by a special amnesty law but would have become effective again on April 10 if the rebels had not taken steps to begin the long-stalled process of negotiation. As long as the talks continue, the Government has pledged to keep the arrest orders suspended.
Both the Government and rebel leaders are declaring their openness to discuss all issues and to work for a solution to the conflict that has dragged on for 16 months at great cost to Chiapas and to Mexico.
It is clear that part of the Government's strategy is to differentiate these talks from those that failed in February 1994. Then, the Government was represented by an independent peace commissioner, Manuel Camacho Solis, who personally attracted nearly as much attention as the rebel leader Subcommander Marcos, who has become a national hero.
Those talks were held under wide publicity in the cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas. After several days, delegates emerged with a 32-point preliminary settlement, which eventually was rejected by the rebels.
This time, the Government is represented by officials of the Interior Ministry and a bipartisan Congressional commission. The rebel contingent is not led not by Subcommander Marcos, who did not show up, but by Commander Tacho and other Maya Indians who speak only halting Spanish.
This round of talks is expected to last for two days.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
I.B.M. Profit Up Smartly; Stock Climbs

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Driven by surprisingly high revenue from product sales and its service businesses, I.B.M. posted record first-quarter earnings yesterday, surpassing analysts' expectations by a wide margin.
Net income for the first quarter nearly quadrupled, to about $1.3 billion, or $2.12 a share, compared with $336 million, or 54 cents a share, for the comparable period a year earlier. The highest estimate for the quarter by a Wall Street analyst had been $1.53 a share. 
 The results add luster to the reputation of Louis V. Gerstner, I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive. He was brought in two years ago, following multibillion-dollar losses, to transform the company, then a bloated giant, back into an industry leader. Under Mr. Gerstner's stewardship, the International Business Machines Corporation posted a profit last year for the first time since 1990, and its ailing stock price has nearly doubled.
After yesterday's results were announced, I.B.M.'s share price jumped more than $3 on the New York Stock Exchange and traded as high as $91 during the day, its highest price in more than two years, before closing at $89, up $1.875.
"It's like the glory days are back," said Steve Milunovich, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, who raised his estimate of I.B.M.'s 1995 earnings to $9.80 a share from $8. Several other analysts also raised their targets yesterday.
But executives at I.B.M., which is based in Armonk, N.Y., were careful to play down expectations. Jerome B. York, the company's chief financial officer, told analysts that I.B.M. would be hard pressed to continue its current growth beyond the next quarter, when the present strong demand spurred by robust economic growth in the United States is likely to slow.
"We do not expect the full year to be a record," he said.
The bulk of I.B.M.'s recent gains have resulted from a huge cost-cutting campaign that has reduced the company's expenses by $6.5 billion. The latest results show that the company is registering some revenue growth as well.
Aided by a weak dollar, total revenue in the first three months increased 18 percent, to a record $15.7 billion. Hardware sales increased more than 23 percent, while services grew more than 33 percent as corporate customers sought to link their disparate computers together or to subcontract their entire computer operations. Pretax profit margins were nearly 14 percent, a level last reached in 1990, Mr. York said.
The company also reported that it had $10.5 billion in cash, after spending $1.4 billion to buy back stock during the quarter and an additional $900 million on restructuring.
But behind the impressive numbers, several key problems remain, analysts say. Mr. York said that improvements in I.B.M.'s data storage and personal computer businesses made up 20 percent of the increased profits. That means that I.B.M. is still dependent on sales of its older mainframe systems for a large portion of its revenue and profits. Those machines have been enjoying a surprising revival of late, and I.B.M. has substantially lowered the costs of producing them, but they are still on the way out.
"Mainframe profits are very high but they probably won't get much better," said Stephen Smith, an analyst at Paine Webber. "So other parts of the business will have to pull their weight if we are going to move ahead from here."
Mr. York said that the company had made substantial progress in turning around its ailing personal computer business, which most analysts believe lost $1 billion last year. Mr. York declined to say whether the PC business was making money, but he did say that it grew in "the low double digits" and shipped a record one million units during the quarter.
When one analyst suggested that the PC business had improved from a "D-minus to a D," Mr. York responded that he would rate it more like a C. "We're taking this thing a quarter at a time," he said, adding that the company's top executives were getting daily reports on PC sales and inventory. "We're micromanaging this business right now to get it up and running."
The desktop software business, which includes OS/2 Warp, I.B.M.'s latest attempt to establish a credible competitor to the Microsoft Corporation's ubiquitous Windows software, grew about 66 percent. The company said that OS/2 now had an installed base of nine million, although most analysts believe that I.B.M. is losing millions on the product.
 "They are growing OS/2 rapidly, but they don't seem to be making any money with it," Mr. Smith said.
Asked what the company planned to do with its hoard of cash, Mr. York said that I.B.M. had begun to shop for businesses. "We're starting to look at a lot of small things," he said, but there are "no King Kong acquisitions on the horizon."

HEADLINE: Poor See New Indignity in Welfare Fraud War

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN 

 BODY:
Mildred Williams sat nervously in a room with blue walls early Wednesday, waiting for her name to be called. She had come to the welfare office at 330 Jay Street in Brooklyn seeking public assistance. It was the second time in two months.
Ms. Williams said she came first in mid-February, filled out an application, answered some questions and left. The next day, she said, she went looking for work. 
 "An investigator stopped by the house while I was gone, and because I wasn't there, I have to go through this process again," she said. "They said the people who answered the door were uncooperative. What's uncooperative? Was it because this person was not invited in because I was not home?"
Ms. Williams is among the more than 10,000 childless adults who applied for welfare in New York City in the first three months of this year and were rejected as a tough, new screening process was instituted for the city's Home Relief program for childless, able-bodied adults. Most of them, said Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, tried to cheat the system by giving false addresses or Social Security numbers or failed to disclose other sources of income.
But advocates for the poor as well as many people who were interviewed at welfare offices and soup kitchens criticized the way the new program is being carried out, and they said some applicants were turned down because of inadequacies in the way fraud investigators checked out where the applicants lived.
Too often, investigators made only minimal attempts to verify addresses, said Liz Krueger, associate director of the Community Food Resource Center, who works closely with many Home Relief recipients. She pointed out that many poor people often live doubled up in apartments or shifting between relatives -- undocumented, unstable and unconnected to the anchors of middle-class life.
"They may have been unable to document your residence, but it doesn't mean you lied about it," she said. "It means they couldn't find the house or they rang the doorbell twice and you weren't there, or the manager didn't know you because you weren't on the lease."
Ms. Krueger and other advocates have also complained that the Giuliani administration has created a veritable obstacle course for poor people wanting to apply for benefits by forcing people to go to several offices over a 45-day period to fill out forms and to be interviewed.
Administration officials defend the new crackdown and say that jobless people have enough time on their hands to go through the application and interview process.
And some of the poor and homeless people interviewed in recent days confirm the administration's position that there is plenty of fraud to be found.
Over all, nearly 250,000 New Yorkers receive benefits through Home Relief. Since January all new applicants were required to submit to interviews to determine their identity, assets and living situations. Once accepted, the new recipients have to agree to work for the city. The rules do not apply to the broader Federal welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
Some applicants said they were not told why their applications were rejected. Johnny Howell, who was back in line at the welfare office at 260 West 30th Street in Manhattan yesterday, said he first applied for public assistance on April 4.
With a a black leather jacket and a green Philadelphia Eagles baseball cap turned backward on his head, Mr. Howell said he was sent to the Jay Street office in Brooklyn, where he was interviewed by a welfare worker wearing a badge.
"The dude asked me a lot of personal questions, like how did you become homeless and how do you clean yourself," he said.
Mr. Howell, 34, said he was given a letter to bring back to the welfare office on 30th Street. There, a worker told him that his application was denied, but did not give a reason.
Mr. Howell said he moved to New York from Philadelphia three years ago, one step ahead of drug-dealing enemies he had made in his hometown. He said he quickly began selling drugs in New York, then became addicted and lost his apartment. He said he has been drug-free for six months, and homeless since he left a drug rehabilitation program in March.
"I've got to get some kind of income," he said. "I have urges to go in a store and shoplift, but I'm not trying to end up in jail. I'm trying to do things right for a change. I've got a conscience now, plus I'm tired of living like that."
Mr. Howell said he has been looking for work at the grocery stores and fast-food restaurants in midtown Manhattan. But employers always want to know about the gap between his last job as a maintenance man in 1990 and now.
"I can't say I was selling drugs," he said. "Then too, if I tell them I'm a recovering addict, they might get funny."
Fred Cain said he also was not told why his application was rejected in March. Mr. Cain, who was interviewed while standing in line at the Holy Apostle Church soup kitchen on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan on Tuesday, said the rejection came after he was interviewed in Brooklyn and returned to the welfare office on 30th Street in Manhattan.
"She told me I'm not eligible," he said. "That was it."
In a handful of cases, officials and advocates say, the applicants have successfully appealed the rejections. Ben Wizner, an advocate with the Legal Action Center for the Homeless, said one of his clients, a man in his 50's who has lived at a single-room-occupancy hotel on the Bowery since 1991, was rejected for public assistance in March because fraud investigators could not confirm his address.
Mr. Wizner said his client never found out why the investigators decided he did not live at the hotel. But at a hearing, the man was able to present enough documents and personal testimony from hotel employees and other residents that the decision was overturned.
Richard Schwartz, a senior aide to the Mayor and the main architect of the screening program, strongly defended the home visits, saying investigators make every effort to confirm the addresses of applicants. Investigators visit the listed address within days after the person has made an application, he said. If the person is not at home, investigators interview other people in the building and even neighbors.
If those approaches cannot confirm that the applicant lives there, he said, the investigator leaves a letter telling the person to contact the welfare office. "This program was put together very carefully with a lot of sensitivity and a lot of thought," he said. "It was put together with a great deal of care so it would be fair."
And despite the stories of people saying they were wrongly rejected, Mr. Schwartz said only nine of the rejected cases have been appealed for hearings. "Those numbers speak for themselves," he said.
Mr. Schwartz and the Mayor said that in the first three months of the crackdown, investigators rejected 57 percent of the applications, compared with 20 percent in the same period last year. The rejections included those people who successfully made it through the screening process but failed to report for their work assignment.
Mr. Wizner and other advocates question whether the intensive screening would have long-lasting effects. Many applicants, he said, will reapply and learn from their previous mistakes. "My guess is that the vast majority of these people who were denied reapplied right away and are still in the system," he said.
The city's program was modeled after one in Westchester County, but by combining the intensive screening process with the workfare requirement, the city was able to make bigger reductions faster.
But for people like Ms. Williams, who lives in the Marlboro Houses on Coney Island, the program seems to need a lesson in human dignity and understanding.
"They asked me all kinds of demeaning questions," said Ms. Williams, who was dismissed from her job as a nanny about a year ago. "They asked if I would work, what I've been doing for the last 12 months, how I've been supporting myself, do I have any children, who lives in the house with me and what are their ages," she said. "These are all quesions that I've answered before. They're just repeating themselves."
Yesterday, a woman who answered the telephone at Ms. Williams's residence said Ms. Williams was out looking for work. She said a city investigator had already phoned.


GRAPHIC: New York's tough new screening process, along with requirements that recipients work for benefits, has reduced the number of people on Home Relief, the welfare program serving mainly single, childless adults. Below are the steps applicants must take as well as a reporter's observations about the process.
Chart: "STEP BY STEP: Applying for Welfare"
STEP 1. Applications are filled out at income maintenance centers that serve certain zip codes. Applicants are assigned a counselor and told to return in a week; if in need of emergency assistance, they must also return the next morning.
WHAT TO EXPECT: It takes about five hours to be assigned a counselor. Rooms are poorly ventilated with few chairs. Workers tend to be unresponsive to questions. Frequently the office runs out of either English or Spanish forms, and there is no translator available.
 
STEP 2. If seeking emergency assistance, an applicant returns the next morning. A counselor fills out forms for a photo I.D. At another window, papers are processed for the I.D. The applicant then must go to an office at 109 East 16th Street in Manhattan for the card. The applicant returns to the original center to get the emergency check.
WHAT TO EXPECT: It takes two to three hours to get a card at the I.D. center. Tempers are short, with frequent outbursts by disgruntled applicants. Back at the income center, it takes about an hour to get the check, usually for about $29.

STEP 3. A week later, applicants return to the income maintenance center for an interview. The applicant fills out a form, listing assets, sources of income and providing proof of residency, like a lease or utility bill. If homeless, applicants can give the address of a shelter or the General Post Office in midtown Manhattan. An appointment is made for an eligibility verification review -- the new investigation into eligibility -- at 330 Jay Street in Brooklyn.
WHAT TO EXPECT: Many applicants do not know they need to bring residency documents. If they don't bring them, they must return again.

STEP 4. Applicants go to the Office of Employment Services at 98 Flatbush in Brooklyn for a talk on job hunting. Before the Giuliani administration began intensive screening, applicants attended the seminar only after being approved for welfare. Also new, applicants are given a logbook in which they must record the names of places they look for employment.
 
Step 5. Applicants attend an eligibility verification review. According to the Mayor's office, the review consists of:
 Computer comparisons of wage reporting, unemployment benefits, disability benefits, Social Security number, address, motor vehicle registration.
Credit check to try to turn up information on possible assets.
 Unannounced home visits.
WHAT TO EXPECT: Meetings often last less than an hour. In one recent review, eligibility specialists did not know the applicant was on parole and had listed different addresses on his welfare application and with his parole officer. They also failed in a number of cases to detect that applicants owned property outside New York.
 
STEP 6. Applicants deliver sealed envelopes, given to them by eligibility specialists, to their counselors verifying that they attended the eligibility review.
 
STEP 7. Applicants look for work, recording efforts in the logbook. They must apply for at least 40 jobs before being approved.

STEP 8. At some point, an investigator makes an unannounced visit to verify residency. Applicants can be dropped for giving a false address.
WHAT TO EXPECT: If no one is home to talk to investigators, or if neighbors, roomates or landlords do not cooperate, officials may question whether the applicant lives there.
 
STEP 9. If 45 days after applying, applicants have not found jobs, they return to the income maintenance center to learn whether they have been accepted. If accepted and deemed able to participate, recipients are told to report the next day for part-time workfare assignments, which include cleaning graffiti and picking up trash in public places. If recipients fail to report for work, they are dropped from the rolls.
 
STEP 10. Benefits, from $313 to $352 a month, are distributed through designated check-cashing companies. ESTHER B. FEIN (pg. B3)

Latest Signs of a Slowdown Help to Raise Bond Prices

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
For the first time this week, prices of long- and short-term government securities moved in the same direction yesterday, as fresh evidence of a slowing economy combined with a rebounding dollar to help lift prices.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 6/32 , to 10312/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 7.34 percent, from 7.36 percent on Wednesday. Rates on both the three-month and six-month bills declined 2 basis points. The yield on the two-year note fell 4 basis points as well, to 6.41 percent. 
 A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Bond prices initially moved higher after the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia said its regional manufacturing index fell to a four-year low this month, in a 20-point swing from the previous month. The extreme softness of the number caught many market participants by surprise, as the index fell to minus 16.7 points in April -- its lowest level since February 1991. A Reuters survey had estimated the index would be up 4.1 points from its listing last month of 3.3.
Analysts said the prices-paid component of the Philadelphia Fed survey slid to 31.7 points, from 41.4 the month before, and prices received dropped to 2.8 points, from 16.4 in March.
Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist with the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the Philadelphia Fed survey "gave the market a glimpse forward to next week's National Association of Purchasing Management numbers."
He said that yesterday's data indicated that the purchasing managers' index would also fall, giving the market "the impression that the pause in the manufacturing sector suggested last month by the 4,000 drop in manufacturing employment was not an illusion."
The market was also bolstered yesterday by the weekly report on initial jobless claims. The number of Americans filing for unemployment claims rose to 342,000, much higher than the 335,000 forecast.
Lending support to the soft economic data was a stronger dollar and lower gold prices, traders said.
But Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, noted that "supply, the economy and the dollar -- and all that we now know about them -- appears to be already factored into the market."
Next week, the market will have to deal with additional supplies of new paper, Mr. Roden said, when the Treasury auctions $29.25 billion of new two- and five-year notes, atop the $23.2 billion of new three- and six-month bills being sold at the regular weekly auction on Monday.
The week after, the Treasury will announce its quarterly funding requirements. "Meanwhile, the dealers and traders will prepare for the increase in supply, however they prepare for that," he said.
Looking ahead to the auction next week, the new two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 6.44 percent and the five-year notes at a price to yield 6.76 percent.
In other trading, municipal bond prices were steady as new bond sales slowed from the early pace of the week. In the largest sale yesterday, the City of Philadelphia priced $231 million in revenue bonds. Underwriters initially priced the deal 5 basis points than similarly rated issues to lure investors, but then reduced the yields as much as 8 basis points because of the strong demand for the insured bonds.
Morgan Stanley, the issue's senior manager, said the maximum yield was 5.92 percent for a bond due in 2018, while another long issue due in 2014 was priced to yield 5.87 percent. Shorter-maturity serial bonds were priced to yield from 4.40 percent in 1997 to 4.90 percent in 2000, 5.33 percent in 2005, 5.65 percent in 2010 and 5.72 percent in 2012.
Because the bonds are insured by the MBIA Insurance Corporation, formerly known as the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation, they are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: What Would the Old Boys Say?

 BODY:
The old-boy network of the 1950's and 1960's, when a professor at Harvard called his counterpart at M.I.T. to discuss whether there was a faculty job for his best student, has long since been replaced by an organized, centralized market for new Ph.D.'s, complete with rankings, flyouts, tryouts, signing bonuses and special deals.
Each economics department ranks its students by number, and the leading schools that are hiring ask for the "job paper" of the top few. Some of them are then interviewed at the annual meeting of the American Economics Association in January. And the most promising are flown out to make a presentation. (Susan Athey had 25 flyouts.) 
 The leading schools tend to fight fiercely over just one or two students a year, and often decline to choose anyone if they cannot get the elite few. "Everybody starts chasing them to the exclusion of some people only slightly less promising," said Robert Frank, a labor economist at Cornell.
But all the fuss over just one or two must-have candidates raises some eyebrows. Sherwin Rosen, a labor economist at the University of Chicago, calls the market irrational. He says there's too little information at this age to distinguish between someone who will become a superstar and someone who will be merely very good.

Ending Forgiveness

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
From the moment the bomb went off in Oklahoma City, the message of helplessness went out across the country: We can't stop terrorism. Maybe the Government can catch some of the killers but other terrorists will always be able to strike America when and where they wish.
The message is false. Individuals cannot protect their countries from terrorists -- but governments can. 
 The true message of Oklahoma is that governments have failed -- the very Western governments whose people, institutions and stability are the target of terrorism from home or abroad.
Police do not know for certain whether the bombing is foreign terrorism or domestic. Either way, the fact remains that whatever we are doing to destroy Mideast terrorism, the chief terrorist threat against Americans, has not been working.
The reason is that the West has never committed itself to the struggle against Mideast terrorism. The commitment, and the beginning of the end of terrorism, will take place when two things happen:
First, the West must inform states that have helped terrorists that the era of forgiveness is over.
The way things are, all the leaders of these nations have to do to be shriven is reduce aid to terrorists for awhile and talk of deporting a few.
Western governments clap hands in gratitude, and send a president or foreign minister to beg to know the price for future good behavior.
It is essential that these Mideastern leaders and their public know that their countries will be held directly responsible for all attacks carried out by terrorists whom they help or harbor -- and that this decision has no expiration date, no statute of limitations.
The penalty will be quarantine -- withdrawal of all economic and diplomatic connections, the cutting of all traffic and commerce, except for monitored medical supplies.
And it must be made plain that although the West will not deliberately bomb civilians, it will attack terrorists and their encampments wherever found.
The sentence would end only when terrorist-supporting governments change leadership. This would notify their people that their deprivations will end only with the resignation, death or overthrow of the leaders they now cheer. Successor governments would not be removed from quarantine until they told Western intelligence what they knew, which is almost everything, about terrorist groups, where they are and how they work.
No, the new policy would not automatically end terrorism against America. By now, the terrorist sponsors have supplied terrorism with enough money and training so that some of the killers can rely more on the help they get from supporters in the West, particularly the U.S.
So the second thing that must happen to cripple terrorism is that public rage or common sense, or both, must override the passivity, fatalism and cowardliness of the Westerners who are supposed to be leaders of Western intellectualism, and economic power.
Most of the opinion molders have failed as much in their own roles as have the political leaders in theirs.
Too many intellectuals have failed to use their voices and influence against terrorism -- almost as if it existed in another world. In the U.S, the few who have warned that Saddam Hussein and Hafez al-Assad and the Iranian Government are still in the terrorism business can expect to be mocked or ignored. So are those who ring alarms about the growth of terrorist roots in the U.S.
Congressional and Administration attempts to tighten laws against support of terrorism are too swiftly denounced as violations of civil rights. The new law should be passed -- and the courts allowed to decide constitutionality.
Mighty Western businessmen beg for the chance to enrich and empower the terrorist regimes of Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya. They crawl to the Chinese Communist Government that rules through terrorism at home and in Tibet, and now speeds Iran on the road to nuclear power.
The forgiveness policy, the habitual intellectual playing down or rationalization of terrorism, the groveling of business are a moral monstrosity and an encouragement of terrorism. As long as they continue, pray for America. As we pray we will hear, from the terrorist camps, the sound of laughter.

Faith In Reason

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Thirty years ago, as a reporter in Washington, I could enter almost any Government building without a security check and walk down the halls from office to office. That now seems an almost unimaginable past.
The horror in Oklahoma City reminds us how far we have gone into the land of fear. We live with security measures, and they will inevitably become more burdensome. 
 Has something gone wrong in human society? Are more people feeling discontent so intense that it drives them to acts of terrorism? The Oklahoma City bombing leads one to ask questions of that kind. But we should beware of grand theories.
Terrorism is not something new, after all. A terrorist assassination in Sarajevo led to World War I. The Nazis used terrorism in their march to power in Germany. The world has experienced waves of terrorism, rising and falling, over a century and more.
What is different now is the technological development of devices that can be used by terrorists with dreadful effect in dense modern environments. A relatively small amount of explosive can destroy a building. Easily transportable canisters of poison gas can paralyze a subway system.
It may well be, too, that modern communications are enticing to potential terrorists. They can see their handiwork on television almost instantly -- and no doubt feel a surge of power. So do unbalanced people who after something like the Oklahoma City tragedy make telephone calls warning that bombs have been planted here and there.
Power is at the heart of terrorism. Putting aside the occasional madman who commits murder for revenge against imagined slights or at the order of voices, terrorists are people who want influence. Prof. Philip B. Heymann of the Harvard Law School puts it:
"We live in a world in which relatively few people -- maybe 500 or 1,000 -- make the important decisions. Outsiders who want to play on that stage but have no legitimate power see terrorism as a way to do it. Terrorism can put a few people with an agenda on the international stage."
The truth is that we are vulnerable to even small groups driven by extreme political ideology or religious fervor. There were only about 20 men and women in the Baader-Meinhof group, but it had West Germany in the grip of fear for a decade with its campaign of kidnappings and assassinations.
We cannot prevent terrorism perfectly by physical protection of buildings. Within reasonable economic limitations the Federal Government could have truly effective defenses at perhaps 500 of its buildings, but it has 7,000 around the country. State government and private buildings can also be targets as symbols: the World Trade Center, for example.
Intelligence-gathering is important. But to say that is to see the danger that the Government -- and the public, too -- will pick out some groups as suspect. That can lead to guilt by association: harassment of people with a Middle East background, say.
This country has too many episodes of group suspicion and persecution in its history to brush that concern aside. Red scares repeatedly led to cruel injustices, from mass arrests and deportations in 1920 to the McCarthy fear of the 1950's.
Even before the Oklahoma City outrage, the Clinton Administration had used the fear of terrorism to propose legislation that would violate basic American traditions of due process. Its proposed Omnibus Counterterrorism Act would let the Government deport people without showing them any evidence of wrongdoing. Representative Charles Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who used to care about civil liberties, was quick to say that the Oklahoma bombing required swift passage of the legislation.
The worst thing this country could do after Oklahoma City is to panic into measures that would injure our society, making it less free and less fair. That would be to give terrorism a victory.
For 200 years America has put its faith in constitutional democracy, preferring its reasoned process -- however slow and frustrating -- to this or that claim of absolute revealed truth. We should meet irrationality now by redoubling our commitment to reason.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Decreased Last Week

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 20

 BODY:
New claims for jobless benefits fell last week for the first time in three weeks while remaining at a level that analysts said reflected slower but continued job growth.
The Labor Department report today "indicated that the job picture is rather stable," said Eugene Sherman, an economist at M. A. Shapiro & Company in New York. But, he said, recent demand for workers has dipped below 1994 levels. 
 First-time applications for unemployment insurance fell by 5,000 last week, to a seasonally adjusted 342,000 from a revised 347,000 the preceding week. Claims for the week of April 8 had been estimated at 338,000.
Last week's was the first decline since claims fell by 10,000 during the week ended March 25.
The closely watched four-week moving average of jobless claims has been relatively flat since March 1, when it was 340,000. Last week, it stood at 342,250, down from 343,750 a week earlier. It averaged 326,000 in December. Many analysts prefer to track the less-volatile four-week average because it smooths out the spikes in the weekly reports.

Mass Moca Lives!
The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art is like the cat with nine lives. Starting in 1988, attempts were made to build the world's largest contemporary-art museum. Then, two years ago, the mission was changed: the plan was to create a multi-disciplinary cultural center on 14 acres in North Adams, Mass., in the northwestern corner of the state. Both projects have been resurrected and abandoned many times over.
Now, finally, the future of Mass Moca (as it is called) seems assured. On Tuesday, Lieut. Gov. Paul Celluci, acting on behalf of Gov. William F. Weld, is to sign a formal agreement to certify Mass Moca as a public institution and to release $18.6 million in state money for the first phase of the construction; Mass Moca has raised $8 million in private money. 
 The first phase of the project will include the renovation of 170,000 square feet of interior space at the site -- which was built in the 1870's as a textile mill, and includes 28 buildings -- in addition to the creation of exterior courtyards, and other basic improvements. The renovated facilities are to have 65,000 square feet of gallery space, 25,000 square feet of performing-arts space, 25,000 square feet for fabrication and post-production and sound and video stages, and 25,000 square feet for other arts projects, including film and multimedia.
"If you take seriously the job of making a museum of contemporary art, how do you do that today?" asked Joseph Thompson, the director. "Increasingly, visual arts, performing arts and electronic arts are merging. Where do you go if you are a visual artist and you have read about multimedia systems? Where can you make these things? We are making room available for the process."
Mass Moca is also collaborating with other institutions. "This is a cultural factory for the 21st century," Mr. Thompson said. The core of Mass Moca's programs will be a consortium of cultural institutions, artists and technology companies collaborating on projects. Among what the museum calls its "partners" are Jacob's Pillow, the dance festival in Becket, Mass.; Kleiser-Walezak Construction, a Los Angeles-based computer-generated-imagery and special-effects company; the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center, a Los Angeles-based institution that encourages the nurturing of Japanese heritage in America; 501C3, a New York-based, nonprofit multimedia production and publishing company; the American History Workshop, a Brooklyn-based institution that produces programs to connect Americans with their heritage, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.
That the Guggenheim will be involved with Mass Moca is no surprise. Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director, was the chairman of the original planning group for Mass Moca in 1985 and at one time said the Guggenheim was considering running Mass Moca if the proper resources could be found.
As important as the arts for their own sake are to Massachusetts, Mr. Thompson said, Mass Moca is also "a meaningful economic catalyst." He estimates that several hundred jobs will be created by the project, which is expected to attract 130,000 to 150,000 visitors a year.
 
Renovating New York City's 'Attic'
 When the Museum of the City of New York's major expansion and renovation is completed, it, too, will surely become an important tourist attraction, one geared toward visitors curious about the city's cultural richness. This week, the museum announced that it had hired Ralph Appelbaum Associates, based in Manhattan, to work with the New York architect James Stewart Polshek on a $36 million transformation, scheduled for completion in the year 2000.
The project includes the total renovation and reorganization of the museum's 1932 neo-Georgian building at 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103d Street, as well as the addition of a six-story wing. In addition to doubling exhibition spaces, the project will also create the New York City History Learning Center, a place for the public to explore the city's culture and history.
Mr. Appelbaum's appointment is an interesting one because he has recently been involved in a number of major museum projects, including the permanent exhibition at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington; the fourth-floor fossil halls of the American Museum of Natural History, and the permanent exhibition of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation at Monticello, outside Charlottesville, Va.
"We will spend six months creating our mission statement to revitalize the collection and to design the exhibition spaces," Mr. Appelbaum said of the Museum of the City of New York in a telephone interview this week. "This is New York City's attic: it celebrates the experience of being urban."
Robert P. MacDonald, the director of the museum, said: "Our plan is to open a museum for the new century. As with the Metropolitan Museum, the city owns the building and we are going 50-50. We have to raise $18 million before construction starts in February."
 
Boltanski in Manhattan
 The French Conceptual artist Christian Boltanski has long dealt with the theme of memory, using found objects to suggest the passage of time and the ravages of death. In May, he will be pursuing these themes in different public places around Manhattan thanks to the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit organization that commissions public art around New York City.
Beginning on May 11, a group of Mr. Boltanski's works called "Lost: New York Projects" is to be on view in four locations. In Washington Heights, at the Church of the Intercession, 550 West 155th Street, a ton of clothes will be scattered in heaps on the floor of the nave. For $2, visitors can buy a brown paper bag, fill it with clothes and take them home. At Grand Central Terminal, more than 5,000 personal belongings lost by commuters will be displayed on metal shelves. A show of objects belonging to an anonymous New Yorker will be presented at the New-York Historical Society, Central Park West at 77th Street, which is to reopen on May 11. And "What They Remember," at the Eldridge Street Synagogue, 12 Eldridge Street, the Lower East Side, will consist of personal interviews with children from the synagogue.
Mr. Boltanski likes to recycle not only objects but projects, too. Several of the installations are similar to ones he has done in Europe. "For me it's art," he said recently in a telephone interview. "But art on the edge."

Dollar Up for Second Day On Strong Buying Overseas
 The dollar rose solidly for a second day, gaining strength from overseas buying and speculation that the Group of Seven finance ministers might act at their meeting next week to defend the currency. 
 Traders said they were encouraged by the dollar's strength in Asia, where the currency climbed against the yen on purchases by Japanese insurance companies and other institutional investors. In New York, the dollar settled at 83.11 yen, up 2.2 percent, and at 1.3837 marks, up 1.2 percent. D3.
 The Europeans and Japanese are frustrated by American inaction on the dollar, but the United States lacks the will and doubts it has the way to support it. Economic Analysis. A1.
 Computer-guided buying and strong earnings from I.B.M. helped the Dow rise 23.17 points, to 4,230.66. Treasury bonds were up. D8.
 
G.M.'s Profit Up, But Stock Slips
 General Motors' earnings surged to $2.2 billion, or $2.51 a share, indicating that the auto maker was solving some of the manufacturing problems that depressed its previous results. The earnings exceeded analysts' expectations, but the stock fell 12.5 cents. D2.
 
Allstate Lifts Sears Earnings
 Sears, Roebuck's earnings in the first quarter came in above the estimates of Wall Street analysts, climbing to $559 million, or $1.41 a share, helped by improvements at its Allstate insurance unit. Sears stock rose 87.5 cents, to $53 a share. D3.
 
F.C.C. Plans Mobile Radio Auction
 The F.C.C. will auction 1,000 specialized radio licenses that companies hope to use to offer a variety of new mobile services. D7.
 
Profits Flat at American Express
 American Express said that its first-quarter net income was unchanged, but that earnings from continuing operations rose 11 percent, propelled by the company's travel and mutual fund businesses. D4.
 
Mazda to Cut Production
 Hurt by weak sales in the United States and the strong yen, Mazda said it would halve Japanese production of cars bound for North America during April and May. D3.
 
Drug Concerns Have Good Quarter
 Five drug makers, including Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Home Products, reported strong first-quarter profits, saying they are selling more of their key prescription drugs. The rising value of foreign currencies lifted their overseas sales. D4.
 
Hoffenberg Pleads Guilty to Fraud
 Steven Hoffenberg pleaded guilty in Federal court in Manhattan to criminal conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with a $460 million Ponzi scheme. Although Mr. Hoffenberg faces a potential prison term of 25 years, under Federal sentencing guidelines his sentence is more likely to range from 7 to 10 years. D2.
 A California state court has awarded more than $83 million in damages to 600 investors in a series of collapsed real estate investments, which the judge called "a classic Ponzi scheme."

HEADLINE: The Top Draft Pick in Economics;
A Professor-to-Be Coveted by Two Dozen Universities

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

DATELINE: STANFORD, Calif.

 BODY:
She's only 24, but everybody in the world of economics already knows her. About two dozen universities -- Berkeley, Harvard, M.I.T., Princeton, Stanford and Yale among them -- sought her as a junior member of their faculties. They called her one of the most promising candidates in several years. "We fought really hard to get her," said Bengt Holmstrom at M.I.T., where she ultimately accepted a job. "I've rarely seen somebody about whom there was as much unanimity."
"This," said one of her thesis advisers at Stanford, John Roberts, "is Superwoman." 
 Her name is Susan Athey and she's the hottest prospect among the new Ph.D.'s in economics who are moving on to high-powered research departments as assistant professors this year.
Pro football has its college draft and music has its Van Cliburn competition. In economics, 30 or so leading economics departments and business schools spend the better part of autumn and winter identifying and wooing 50 or so top candidates for research. They are trying to reel in that rare superstar with the ideas important enough to alter a field, inspire other researchers and maybe even win the Nobel Prize. The ideas are the kind that give executives and government regulators new insights, whether for portfolio decisions, takeover strategy or the best way to auction off the air waves.
Susan Athey is smart. No surprise there. But by most accounts she's no smarter than some of the others on the market this year. So a look at her other attributes, and the kinds of decisions she has made to reach this level of success, says a lot about what it takes for a young scholar -- or a fledgling athlete, scientist or entrepreneur, for that matter -- to become the person everyone views as the most likely to succeed.
Susan Athey is also a testament to the bright young people who devote themselves more to building intellectual capital than personal wealth. She will earn roughly $60,000 a year, a lot less than what somebody with her brains and drive could command right out of school on Wall Street or at a consulting firm.
Ms. Athey is a theorist, one of a rare breed who conceptualize about economic behavior using mathematical models. She's also one of a number of economists trying to bring to bear on the internal dynamics of businesses the same rigorous analysis that economists have historically brought to the way markets work. She's done research on the impact of mentors, businesses' investment choices and the delegation of decision making within companies. But what knocked people's socks off was her dissertation. In it, she developed a new technique that may well become standard in the toolkit of many researchers.
Any discussion of Ms. Athey must begin with her brains. One of her early memories is of riding the bus home after school in the sixth grade in Rockville, Md. A boy she liked grabbed her math book and wrote on the back of it: "You're cute. Too bad you're a brain." That was enough, for a while, to prompt her to get bad grades "to try to fit in," her parents said.
Her father, Whit Athey, a physicist for the Food and Drug Administration, loves math and science and shared those passions with Susan and her sister, Jennifer, who is 17 months older. "I'd tell him to take the babies out to say good night to the stars," said Elizabeth Johansen, Ms. Athey's mother, "and Whit would try to teach them the names."
Her mother contributed to Susan an energetic optimism and an English teacher's feeling for language. And having a bright, bossy older sister helped too. "Seeing her sister ahead of her getting kudos made her determined that she could do just as well," Mr. Athey said.
After graduating from high school early, Susan went to Duke University the same year as her sister, who has just finished her medical training at Johns Hopkins. Her first majors were computer science and math. A sorority sister at Chi Omega got her a job on a research project on the impact of regulation on the behavior of government contractors. Susan showed so much flair that her boss, an economist, encouraged her to switch majors and to apply to Ph.D. programs. She received a National Science Foundation fellowship and was snapped up by Stanford's business school, which has a tiny but high-powered Ph.D. program in economics, when she left Duke.
Lots of economists who read Ms. Athey's "job paper" -- the all-important distillation of a candidate's dissertation and the ticket to serious consideration by major schools -- thought it was the best paper on the market. In her dissertation, Ms. Athey came up with an improved method for analyzing risky business decisions, to help economists answer questions like what types of exchange-rate risk would make a firm want to cut back its foreign investments, and how does a manufacturing company uncertain over the direction of technological change adjust its investments and other strategies.
What made her research particularly impressive is that the problem had eluded some senior theorists in the field, including her adviser, Paul Milgrom, a potential candidate for the Nobel Prize for his work in game theory. Ms. Athey's solution was so original and subtle that the scholars who had been thinking about it felt they would not have come up with it themselves.
"On the basis of what she's already done," said Avinash Dixit, a trade theorist at Princeton University, "I'd say she's definitely got the potential to be a real star, in the race for a Clark winner, something like that." The Clark Medal is awarded to the most accomplished economist nearing 40 and is the most distinguished prize short of a Nobel.
But this research is only part of what sold so many top universities on Susan Athey.
She is a great performer, a vital skill in a profession where salesmanship is valued highly. Paul Krugman, now a brilliant speaker and writer and also a likely candidate for a Nobel Prize, talks of his poorly organized thesis and hapless seminar presentations to explain why neither M.I.T. nor Harvard was interested in hiring him when he went on the market. Drew Fudenberg, an economist at Harvard who watched Ms. Athey present her research to a particularly imposing audience, uses the word poise half a dozen times.
Then there's the charm factor. In a field where competition is so intense and arrogance is an occupational hazard, Ms. Athey is the girl next door, the sorority sister, community volunteer and best-buddy. The M.B.A. students, who usually avoid nerdy Ph.D. students, love her. She received a standing ovation after filling in as a lecturer at Stanford Business School. She seems genuinely popular with other Ph.D. students, too, partly because she's eager to help them in their own work.
Finally, Ms. Athey exudes an enormous pleasure in her research. It is a passion that takes her beyond articulating a problem, into the search for an answer. Take her dissertation. Ms. Athey thought she'd solved the problem last August. But there was one loose end: she had not fully described the mathematical structure of her new method, limiting its applicability. Dealing with it involved learning a whole new area of math. One economist told her "there was no way I could learn this stuff before my dissertation was due and that I ought to focus on getting ready for the job market."
Ms. Athey chose not to follow that advice. When she went home for Christmas last year, she said, "I went straight to the library."
"My dad helped me," she continued. "We pulled out articles on functional analysis. He Xeroxed them. Then on Christmas night I saw it. Everybody was sleeping. I said, 'I got it, I got it.' I called one of my advisers. He agreed."
Susan Athey's success can also be attributed to some smart decisions. When she went to Duke, she took a full schedule of hard courses that gave her the grounding she'd need later. And at Stanford she persuaded some of the leading theorists in the field to become her mentors.
And she chose research on an important topic that lots of other economists found interesting. Finally, she chose something she liked so much that she was willing to dedicate herself to it.
"Until you experience that singlemindedness it's very hard to relate to. I couldn't imagine wanting to be like my advisers, spending every weekend working. I was amazed by the feeling. I'd tell everybody about the latest results. I'd be bouncing off the walls."
Ms. Athey and her many fans are quite aware that the No. 1 draft choice does not always go on to become the most valuable player. Like starting a business, research is a highly speculative and demanding endeavor. Ms. Athey might pursue problems that prove to be less interesting and less important than people now suspect. The pressure might get to her. Or she might decide that devoting more time to her family (she's not married) or making a ton of money is more important. But the market that identifies the top economic prospects is betting otherwise.

HEADLINE: Improving the Improvement Districts

 BODY:
New York's City Council, alarmed at allegations that the Grand Central Partnership has engaged in financial wrongdoing and assaults on the homeless, has launched a broad inquiry into the operations of all 33 "business improvement districts" serving commercial and industrial areas throughout the city. The Grand Central Partnership is perhaps the best known of these districts, which are authorized to tax property owners and use the funds to provide security guards, trash cleaners and other services beyond those furnished by the city.
Herbert Berman, chairman of the Council's Finance Committee, has asked the B.I.D.'s for information about their incomes, executive salaries and the contracts they sign to perform neighborhood services. The Council, which authorizes B.I.D.'s to tax and provide services, has an important oversight role to play, as does the city's Department of Business Services, which has responsibility for monitoring B.I.D. operations. The challenge is to hold B.I.D.'s to the highest performance and ethical standards without smothering an innovative movement that contributes to the city's livability and economic vitality. 
 An obvious mechanism for accountability is already in place: each B.I.D.'s board of directors, including the city officials who sit on them. But board members must take their oversight responsibility seriously and stop improper practices. An outside audit conducted last year, for example, found that the executive director of the Grand Central district, Daniel Biederman, and his staff had devoted time and lent money to form a new B.I.D. in Jersey City, a questionable use of the district's funds.
In a healthy development, the allegations against the Grand Central Partnership have now galvanized the directors of the city's B.I.D.'s, including Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, of which this newspaper is a member, to consider improved joint self-regulation.
The problems at the Grand Central B.I.D., however serious they may turn out to be, should not obscure the very real accomplishments of these organizations in making the city more attractive not just for businesses but for all New Yorkers. As B.I.D.'s have proliferated rapidly, growing pains were inevitable. More thoughtful oversight can make them better.

HEADLINE: A Better Welfare Reform Plan

 BODY:
It is too early to make sense of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's report that tougher screening reduced the number of new enrollees in the New York State welfare system by 60 percent for the first three months of the year. Perhaps fraud is that rampant. Perhaps, contrary to the city's assertions, applicants were rejected for petty reasons or discouraged by byzantine procedures. Whatever the explanation, Albany should not use the figure, as Gov. George Pataki has suggested, as reason to back his harsh welfare reform plan over the Democratic alternative.
Indeed, the Democratic plan is plenty harsh itself. Six months ago, only the most adamant conservatives pushed for welfare reform that would permit fingerprinting recipients to fight fraud, force them to work, reduce payments to mothers whose children skip school and require young mothers to live with their parents. It is a measure of how much the political ground shifted in Albany last November that New York State Assembly Democrats embraced these provisions in response to the harsh Republican plan espoused by Governor Pataki and the State Senate. 
 Yet despite the similarities between the two plans, the differences are also clear. Unlike the Republicans, Speaker Sheldon Silver would not kick able-bodied recipients off Home Relief -- the state program mostly for childless adults -- after 60 days, even if they could not find work through no fault of their own.
Mr. Giuliani this week called for eliminating Home Relief for able-bodied adults. The Speaker would instead continue benefits as long as a recipient worked up to 20 hours at community service and looked for a job or enrolled in training. A report from the Vera Institute of Justice suggests that time limits on benefits would not push recipients into jobs, but that job search assistance would work for some.
Mr. Silver also rejects Mr. Pataki's proposal to cut back welfare checks by between 15 and 25 percent and eliminate rent subsidies. Andrew O'Rourke, the Republican executive of Westchester County who has instituted a successful workfare program, has warned the Governor that his cutbacks will drive recipients out of subsidized apartments into expensive public shelters. That would eliminate the saving the Governor is counting on to help balance his budget.
Mr. Pataki says his plan will save taxpayers $345 million this year. Mr. Silver estimates savings from his bill would be $225 million, though Republicans are rightly doubtful that Mr. Silver can require workfare and still save money. In Albany, as in Washington, the debate over welfare reform has unfortunately gotten caught up in the budget-cutting stampede. Whether Mr. Pataki can save the state an extra $100 million or so this year is less important than the gains for welfare families and eventually the state economy if Mr. Silver's plan can put more of those on welfare into useful jobs.

HEADLINE: The Good Earth Looks Better

BYLINE: By Gregg Easterbrook; Gregg Easterbrook is author of "A Moment on the Earth: The Coming Age of Environmental Optimism."

 BODY:
Tomorrow, on the 25th anniversary of Earth Day, I'll be smiling, and so should you. Nearly every ecological trend in the United States is positive. The air and water are getting cleaner and the forests are rebounding: a natural recovery of historic proportions may be at hand. The first Earth Day, in 1970, was a time for demonstrations and expressions of rage. Earth Day 1995 is a moment for celebration.
In fact, Americans could treat the anniversary as marking one of the leading social achievements of our age, were it not for an outbreak of retrograde anti-environmentalism in Washington. 
 The House, under Speaker Newt Gingrich, in February enacted a spectacularly wrong-headed bill designed to make antipollution rules close to unenforceable; now it is moving toward legislation that would dismantle the Endangered Species and Clean Water acts. In the Senate, majority leader Bob Dole has proposed anti-environmental legislation that in some ways is more callous that the House bill.
Strangely, these anti-environmental initiatives have been made possible partly by fashionable environmental doomsaying on the left. If it were commonly understood that most conservation programs are effective and affordable, initiatives to gut those programs would outrage voters. But because the good news about the environment is a well-kept secret, Gingrich, Dole & Company can get away with proposing to clobber programs that voters falsely believe don't work anyway.
What trends are positive in the United States? Since 1970, smog is down by more than 30 percent, even as the number of cars has soared. In 1970, one-third of rivers and lakes were safe for fishing and swimming; today, two-thirds are. Most forested areas have been expanding, not contracting. Municipal wastes going to landfills peaked in 1988 and have been declining since then, as recycling has taken hold. Ocean dumping of sludge has ended; land-filling of untreated chemical wastes has ended; most emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (the chemicals that deplete the ozone layer) have ended; endangered species such as the bald eagle and gray whale have made spectacular recoveries; pesticide use is declining, relative to agricultural production.
Such progress hardly means environmental challenges have been overcome. Numerous ecological emergencies exist in the developing world. In the West, problems such as overfishing and the prospect of global warming have yet to inspire much-needed reforms.
But the main source of environmental trepidation ought not to be the conditions in nature but on Capitol Hill. There Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Dole, Senator Slade Gorton, Representatives Thomas DeLay and Bud Shuster and others are attempting to undermine the very laws that made possible the good news.
Of course many environmental strictures are flawed. They may contain economic disincentives, regulatory overkill and other defects. Initially Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole and others said they wanted to inject clear thinking and free-market mechanisms into regulation of the ecology. These are excellent goals. But instead of seeking constructive revisions, Congressional conservatives, with the help of industry lobbyists and lawyers, are now attacking environmental programs indiscriminately, seeking to undo all programs whether good or bad.
 Among their many faults, regulatory-reform bills passed in the House, and proposed by Mr. Dole in the Senate, suggest that every environmental issue contains a discernible scientific resolution now ignored by bureaucrats intent on red tape. It is true that environmental initiatives would benefit from more scientific inquiry, but the notion that scientists agree about environmental questions is a fantasy.
For instance, the Supreme Court recently reviewed reams of differing scientific opinions about whether the ash from municipal waste incinerators is hazardous, then essentially ruled that the science was irrelevant. And the chemistry of incinerator ash is a simple, straightforward matter compared to complex questions such as the greenhouse effect and preservation of habitats.
As Philip K. Howard points out in his excellent book "The Death of Common Sense," laws demanding a precise scientific answer as a basis for regulation have amounted to geysers of hot air, generating interminable lawsuits but little action. Conservatives know that and have worded the science clauses of anti-environment bills to create gridlock. This is pure cynicism, if only because it gives the valid aspects of rational environmental reform a bad name.
The embrace of the anti-environment bills by business may well threaten the progress of recent years, not to mention business's hard-won environmental credibility. Until the new Congress began, all signs seemed encouraging.
Since 1988, the toxic emissions of American industry have declined more than 35 percent, even as production of petrochemicals has increased. Many major companies have found pollution controls much cheaper than expected, and as a result are doing more than the law requires. As recently as January, Earnest Deavenport, chairman of the Eastman Chemical Company and of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, said the association's members "now accept that strict environmental regulation is necessary" and "do not want to turn back the clock."
Yet within a month association lobbyists were warmly endorsing anti-environmental bills like the one that the House passed in February. Has all the apparent progress in the chemical industry been merely a public-relations ploy? The logging industry, whose recent record in adopting sustainable-forestry practices seems admirable, recently embraced a bill that would make a mockery of the Endangered Species Act. Suddenly, sensing blood on Capitol Hill, much of industry is turning regressive.
With the exception of the mess in Washington, most news regarding the environment conveys hope -- hope for the planet and, possibly, hope for the human prospect itself. Two centuries ago, the thinkers of the European Enlightenment dreamed that one day the study of nature would reveal messages of enduring value to society. The environmental pessimism of the postwar era seemed to give up that promise: a weak, doomed nature could hardly find much worth knowing.
But perhaps if the environment is not doomed, it may be understood as a source of wisdom after all. The initial, halting attempts of Western society to create environment-protection programs suggest that mankind and nature eventually can become allies. That is the brightest and greatest hopes of this, the first happy Earth Day.

HEADLINE: Whatever It Is, It's Drawing Crowds;
For a Number of Reasons, Spring Break in the City Is a Hit

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Counting crowds in Manhattan is an imprecise science at best, like estimating the number of beans in a jar. But to many New Yorkers this week, the borough was feeling unseasonably crammed.
There were foreign tourists swept in by a weak dollar, suburban adolescents set free by spring break, auto-show aficionados, flower-show enthusiasts, Christians and Jews celebrating coinciding holidays. 
 Weekday lines at the Empire State Building spilled into the street. Radio City Music Hall recorded record-breaking turnout on its grand tour. Hotel occupancy was up. Museum attendance was up. Bus tours boomed.
"I don't know where all these people get the money to come here," marveled Bob Giacomino, who works as a doorman at Takashimaya on Fifth Avenue near 55th Street. "I can't afford to leave."
The boom's beneficiaries tended to credit whatever suited their purposes. The New York Convention and Visitors Bureau said the city's image has improved. The Metropolitan Museum of Art cited its 125th anniversary celebrations. Marketers credited their marketing.
But many people, from tourism officials to sunglasses salesmen and coffee bar workers, also pointed to an unusual simultaneity of events: Easter, Passover, school holidays, warm weather, favorable foreign-exchange rates, recent hotel-tax cuts and the psychic boost that many say comes with spring.
For the most part, New Yorkers seemed to welcome the company. They were willing to overlook the annoyances of thickening pedestrian traffic. They seemed to take a proprietary interest in the city's economic health, believing that what's good for New York is good for them.
"It's nice," Gloria Shammas said. "You get the feeling everybody's out there spending money." Ms. Shammas is a saleswoman at Bree, a leather-accessories store in Rockefeller Center.
Detailed statistical proof of Ms. Shammas's premise was not available. But there was plenty of anecdotal evidence. Record weekday attendance at the Empire State Building sent lines snaking through the lobby and out the door for the first time during the week after Easter in the building's history, said Laura Fries, director of observatories there.
"New York is wild," she said.
Some 2,000 to 3,000 more people turned up daily at the Metropolitan Museum of Art than during the same period last year, a museum spokeswoman said. She said there were 4,000 to 5,000 more museumgoers than two weeks ago.
Rose Polidoro-Taylor, senior vice president of marketing and publicity for Radio City Music Hall, said the hall's grand-tour attendance was up 50 percent over this time last year and set a record on Sunday, and that turnout for the hall's Easter show was also up over last year's levels.
The occupancy rate at the 2,041-room New York Hilton and Towers was two percentage points higher than during the week after Easter last year.
David Keys, director of sales and marketing for the hotel, said nearly half of all guests checking in had foreign addresses, more than at this time last year. Because of exchange rates, he said, the hotel was receiving nearly double the usual number of visitors from countries like Germany.
Midtown Manhattan was the epicenter. At times, tourists seemed to outnumber locals -- ambling up Fifth Avenue at half-speed, decked out in windbreakers, athletic shoes still blindingly white, handbags clutched like armor across their chests.
They could be found collapsed on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral, folded over the railing around the skating rink at Rockefeller Center, reconnoitering outside F.A.O. Schwarz, scudding toward Battery Park on the upper deck of double-decker buses.
Among them were Wanda Robinson, choral director for the Northeast Jones High School in Laurel, Miss., visiting Manhattan with 54 students and parents in tow, in town for a choir contest in Rutherford, N.J., today.
Ms. Robinson and several of her charges said they were struck less by the pedestrians than by the seeming anarchy in the streets. "Where are the lines in the road?" Ms. Robinson asked a stranger. "We're used to very structured driving."
Buddy Dinan of Stratford, Conn., said, "We spent about a million dollars, give or take $100,000." He said that he and his two children, Jeffery, 9, and Alyson, 13, sampled two theme restaurants, the Harley-Davidson Cafe and Jekyll and Hyde, and took in two shows.
Luenne Nyema, an assistant manager at the Knot Shop on Fifth Avenue, watched "droves and droves of people" walk past the store window.
"It's not in any specific time period, like lunchtime," she said. "It's the whole time."
Tom Fitzpatrick, a police officer on duty in Times Square, found himself posing for photographs with foreign tourists outside a pizza shop six times in two hours. Haralambos Gialaboukis said he was taking home an extra $15 a day from his West 45th Street hot dog and pretzel stand.
Wide-eyed students from Southeast High in Lincoln, Neb. -- part of a 360-member choir in the city for five days of touring and a concert performance -- took snapshots against the neon backdrop of Times Square. Laura Krenk said: "This is safer than we ever thought. It's nothing like 'NYPD Blue' or those other TV shows."
Shawn Powers, a supervisor at the TKTS booth in Duffy Square, said the line for Wednesday-matinee tickets had been four times as long as usual.
"Is that the Empire State Building?" out-of-towners kept asking John Rivera, a security guard who stands in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza wearing a button that reads, "May I help you?" Mr. Rivera said Easter week 1995 was turning out to be the busiest he had seen in six years on the job.
Few people were complaining. Not only did they like all the getting and spending, and the visitors' rainbow wardrobes on their usually gray streets, but some also seemed to find something sweet and benign in the visitors' presence in a place where those adjectives rarely apply.
"You feel a little bit of a safety net," said Don Werbacher, one of a number of writers and actors who help promote Broadway and off-Broadway shows outside the TKTS booth.
Kevin More, a security guard at Record Explosion on Fifth Avenue near 42d Street, said the tourists compared favorably with New Yorkers. "They don't have any attitude," he said. "And I see beautiful eyes. I've never seen so many beautiful eyes in my life."
Sure, the sidewalks were clogging.
"New Yorkers walk faster than almost anybody else," said Lee Gelberg, a hotel sales representative and guide for Gray Line. "Sometimes I feel somewhat like a running back trying to get through his offensive line."
Though the surge in visitors seemed to be higher this year than before, tourism officials said the phenomenon is familiar. It happens every spring, leading into the peak visiting season, which extends from May into September.
Jeanine Moss, director of communications for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, said tourism in New York had already begun improving last year. The bureau estimates that the city received 600,000 more visitors in 1994 than it did in 1993.
Ms. Moss said the bureau expects 100,000 extra visitors this year and a continued rise in hotel occupancy rates, in part because of the 6 percent reduction in city and state hotel-occupancy taxes that went into effect late last year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Resisting Any Pressures For a Quick Fix To Aid Dollar

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and the Federal Reserve seem determined to resist any pressure that might come next week from other major industrial powers to move promptly to shore up the dollar, arguing that a quick rescue effort could be self-defeating.
"There is nervousness and great concern about the declining dollar, but there is a sense that nothing can be done right now," an Administration official said. "It would not be fair to say the Administration does not care; it would be fair to say we do not have any great ideas." 
 Top finance officials from around the world are already starting to gather in Washington for next week's semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Central bankers and finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial powers will also meet to discuss the international economic situation.
Although the dollar has dropped 20 percent against the Japanese yen and 12 percent against the German mark since the beginning of the year, the American stock and bond markets have held up well. And there has been no major fallout in markets abroad. This absence of a crisis atmosphere relieves some of the pressure on the Administration to act quickly.
The main tool for a quick fix is higher interest rates, a tool the Federal Reserve controls. At a time when people are hurrying to exchange hundreds of billions of dollars for yen and marks, higher interest rates in the United States might halt the dollar selloff. The higher rates would make American bonds and other interest-earning securities more profitable to own, encouraging people to buy them with their dollars rather than exchanging the dollars for yen or marks. But with the economy slowing, any rise in interest rates now could make a recession more likely. Fed officials have said that preserving the economy's health is a higher priority than strengthening the dollar.
"At the present time, the policy is benign neglect, with one constraint: you don't want to allow the situation to accelerate," a senior Administration official said. He was referring to the risk that the falling dollar might result in plunges in stock and bond prices.
In that case, the Federal Reserve would indeed be expected to raise interest rates, Administration officials said. The Fed in effect would step into a market crisis much as it did on the day after the 1987 stock market crash, when interest rates were pushed down sharply to make credit more available in a critical moment.
This week the dollar showed signs of a modest recovery. It rose on Wednesday and Thursday, and fell slightly yesterday, to 82.71 yen and 1.3680 marks. Experts in foreign exchange markets said traders were holding back to await the outcome of the meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents from the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
Although a quick fix has been ruled out, Administration officials, who declined to be quoted by name out of concern that their remarks about dollar policy might roil the markets, speak of the possibility of a rate increase later this year. That might happen if the economy begins to revive again. The weakened dollar may itself be a source of stimulus, by making American exports less expensive and thus more sought after in Europe and Japan.
Imports, however, would become more expensive, raising the danger of a higher inflation rate, after several years of mild inflation in the United States. "At some point, rising import prices bring a rise in the nation's general inflation rate," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant. "I don't know when that point comes, but it will."
Rising inflation would undoubtedly prompt the Federal Reserve to raise rates, helping the dollar in the process.
The dollar's value has been declining gradually against the mark and the yen since the early 1970's, when the Nixon Administration decided that the dollar would no longer have a fixed value and would float against other currencies. Even in the early 1980's, when the dollar was becoming stronger, making American exports less competitive, it never returned to its levels in the mid-70's.
Various administrations have welcomed the decline as inevitable and healthy, since it reflected the rising output and growing economic strength of other nations and America's declining share of the world market. Only twice has an Administration struggled against a sharply falling dollar. The first time was in the late 70's when Jimmy Carter was President and the dollar lost 40 percent of its value against the yen in only two years. The second time is now.
The late 1970's, however, offered a set of circumstances that made reversing the dollar's slide easier than it might be today. Inflation had become a severe problem and that gave the Federal Reserve an opportunity to push up rates far more than might be possible today. In the process, the interest rates on American bonds became much higher than the returns from owning German and Japanese securities.
What's more, foreigners, particularly the Japanese, were far more willing to hold dollars and invest them in the United States than they are today.
Because the dollar has become less attractive to foreigners, an increase in interest rates now, even a substantial one, seems less likely than in the 1970's to reverse the slide in the dollar. Largely for this reason, Administration officials are pushing longer-term policies for strengthening the dollar. They speak, for example, as they have for months, of Commerce Department promotions for American exports, to lower the trade deficit and thus reduce the flow of dollars abroad.
And they talk particularly of the Administration's latest effort -- an effort that has been made for years -- to get the Japanese to spend more of their hoard of accumulated dollars on the purchase of American cars and auto parts, the biggest item in the huge United States trade deficit with Japan.
"Prying open the auto market might not result in an immediate change in the deficit, but it would have a great psychological effect that would help the dollar," an Administration official said.

 BODY:

Strong Company Earnings Lead to Big Stock Rally
The Dow rallied 39 points in some of the heaviest trading of the year, closing at a record 4,270.09, as traders focused on the exceptionally strong earnings being reported for the first quarter. Traders also said the frenzy of a "double witching" session might have contributed to the advance. 
 Some traders were troubled, however, that broader indexes did not share as much in the advance, indicating that portfolio managers were buying a small group of blue-chip stocks as part of a short-term strategy rather than a long-term investment. In currency markets, the dollar closed down slightly at 82.70 yen and 1.369 marks in New York. Page 41
 
Prices of Treasury securities were little changed as investors declined to make sizable purchases going into the weekend without stronger evidence that the economy was indeed slowing. 50.
 
Bank Hires Salomon Executives
Union Bank of Switzerland, under a multimillion dollar two-year contract, hired five former Salomon managing directors. The executives, who start work on Monday, may also bring more junior Salomon staffers with them to the bank. 39.
 
Du Pont to Sell Conoco Assets
Du Pont plans to sell $650 million worth of assets in its Conoco oil subsidiary to help finance the $8.8 billion repurchase of a block of its stock from Seagram. In addition, Du Pont plans to sell $3 billion worth of its stock, rather than the $3.5 billion initially projected, from the 156 million shares purchased from Seagram earlier this month. 39.
 
Euro Disney Narrows Loss
Euro Disney said its net loss narrowed to $49 million in the fiscal first half, aided by increased attendance at its theme park and savings under its refinancing plan. The results were enough to raise Euro Disney's stock 8.7 percent on the Paris stock exchange, closing at $3.07 a share. 51.
Southwest Airlines Profits Down
Southwest Airlines reported a 72 percent decline in first-quarter earnings, to $11.8 million, largely because bigger rivals matched its low fares. But the carrier's stock surged 14 percent to $21.50, on the New York Stock Exchange, after it said the pricing competition had eased and it had corrected problems with its reservation system. 38.
 
The Moving Industry Consolidates
With UniGroup's acquisition of Mayflower and further consolidations likely in the moving industry, consumers face the prospect of higher prices and fewer companies from which to choose. 39.
 
Earnings Rise at Colgate
Colgate-Palmolive said earnings rose 4.6 percent, to $156.5 million, in the first quarter, fueled by improving results in the United States and strong results in Latin America. 38.
Kellogg Net Up 6.6%
 
Kellogg said that its first-quarter earnings rose 6.6 percent, to a record $196 million, or 89 cents a share, saying that strong cereal sales overseas made up for flat business in North America. The company said its cereal sales in the United States declined 2.7 percent during the quarter. 41.
 
Federal Budget Deficit Grows
The Federal Government's budget deficit widened to $49.9 billion in March from $32.3 billion a year earlier. Much of the deficit resulted from a quirk under which transfer payments and tax refunds were moved up to March 31 from April 1, analysts said. 47.
 
Tourists Packing New York
Thanks to the Easter and Passover holidays, the warm weather and favorable foreign-exchange rates, New York City is suddenly having a surge of tourists. The city is packed, and New Yorkers seemed to welcome the company, believing that what's good for the city's economy is good for them. 25.
 
Hiring Program May Be Streamlined
The Clinton Administration is considering loosening rules governing how contractors on Federal projects report how many of their employees are women or members of minorities. The intention is to streamline the complex regulations in an attempt to make the Government's affirmative action program more "user friendly." 7.

HEADLINE: City Hall Agency Will Review The Audits of Business Zones

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In the latest move to bring more public scrutiny to New York City's 33 business improvement districts, a City Hall auditing agency will routinely review outside audits of the districts, city officials said yesterday.
The new review process was approved Wednesday at a meeting of the agency, the Audit Committee, and was announced jointly yesterday by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and Public Advocate Mark Green, who all have representatives on the committee. In the past, the committee has confined its oversight work to such large public institutions as the city's Housing Authority and the Health and Hospitals Corporation. 
 The effort to impose greater oversight on the improvement districts came after a series of questions about one of the largest, the Grand Central Partnership. An outside accountant's analysis showed that the partnership had engaged in unusual bookkeeping last year in its efforts to help create a BID in Jersey City, and several former employees have said in recent weeks that the partnership's outreach program for the homeless had involved a "goon squad" that beat people up. Partnership officials have denied any wrongdoing.
Business improvement districts are nonprofit organizations authorized by the city to collect fees from property owners to provide street cleaning, security and other services.
Mayor Giuliani said the BID's had done "an extraordinary job improving New York City's quality of life," but he said the new financial reviews were necessary because of the huge amount of public money they control.
"Because BID's serve as a public-private partnership and receive monies levied by the public, it is perfectly appropriate that they be subjected to reviews and audits on a regular basis," the Mayor said.
Apparently in an attempt to head off more public scrutiny and red tape, executives of the Grand Central Partnership have asked the audit bureau within the Comptroller's office to review the partnership's books, Mr. Hevesi said. The review would be separate from that of the Audit Committee.
Mr. Hevesi said he had agreed to the partnership's request, and offered similar audits by his staff to any other BID that requests them.
The Audit Committee said it would review audits of the BIDs by outside accounting firms that are required each year. If the outside accountants recommend changes in bookkeeping or financial practices, the Audit Committee said it will assure that the changes are made.
Several changes were recommended by the outside accountants who reviewed the books of the Grand Central Partnership last year, including that it end the practice of using partnership money for such purposes as helping to start the proposed Jersey City BID.
Although the Audit Committee said it would review the finances of all BID's, it said only the seven largest, each of which collects more than $1 million a year in property assessments, would be reviewed annually.

HEADLINE: U.S. Offering to Raise Level Of Talks With North Korea

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 21

 BODY:
In a last-ditch effort to rescue the nuclear freeze agreement with North Korea, Washington offered today to raise negotiations to a senior level.
North Korea confirmed that it had broken off talks with the United States on implementing a $4.5 billion nuclear accord and blamed the failure on the United States. 
 Kim Jong U, the senior North Korean negotiator, told reporters in Berlin before heading back to North Korea that Washington's "inflexible and unreasonable" demands had blocked an agreement.
[But in a statement Saturday in North Korea, the Foreign Ministry left open the possibility that it might resume the talks. The statement said North Korea was studying the proposal by the United States to hold higher-level talks.]
The dispute centers around North Korea's insistence that an American company, rather than a South Korean one, be designated as the primary contractor in building two light-water nuclear reactors. The Americans insist that in deference to the South Koreans, who will be paying for a large portion of the deal, the reactors be South Korean models and that a South Korean company be the primary contractor in the decade-long project.
North Korea repeatedly threatened to resume the operation of some nuclear facilities today, the target date for hammering out the details of the accord reached six months ago. That agreement is to provide North Korea with $4.5 billion in nuclear reactors and other economic assistance in exchange for its freezing and eventually dismantling its nascent nuclear weapons program.
In a briefing for reporters, RobertC. Gallucci, the chief United States negotiator, declined to say whether he considered the situation at an impasse or whether the United States expected North Korea to carry out its threat to restart its nuclear facilities.
Senior Administration officials have said that such a resumption would force the United States to seek economic sanctions on North Korea.
"The talks in Berlin have broken down," Mr. Gallucci said, adding, "I don't know what they're going to do. I just would prefer to say that we will wait and see what they do, and as we have in the past we'll respond to what they do."
A number of Republican lawmakers have called for economic sanctions against North Korea if it resumes its nuclear program. Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who recently visited North Korea, said on Thursday that he would ask President Clinton to urge American allies to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if it does so.
Earlier today, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters that he wanted to raise the level of the talks and proposed to North Korea that Mr. Gallucci represent the American side.
If the higher-level talks can be opened, they would take place in Geneva, senior State Department officials said.
Although the proposal to upgrade the talks suggested a concession by Washington, Mr. Gallucci insisted that the United States was not rewarding North Korea for obstruction by upgrading the talks.
"We're not in the reward-penalty business here," he said. "We're trying to solve a problem that exists between our two Governments in the implementation of an agreement that's very important to our security and those of our allies in the world."

Seoul Accepts Russian Arms
 SEOUL, April 21 (Reuters) -- South Korea said today that it had agreed to take $450 million worth of arms, raw materials and civilian helicopters from Russia by 1998 as repayment of Moscow's debts.
The two countries are to formally sign the agreement early next month in Seoul, a spokesman of South Koreas Finance and Economy Ministry said. He said $171.5 million in raw materials and defense equipment would be shipped this year.
South Korea promised a $3 billion loan in aid to the Soviet Union just before the two countries established diplomatic relations in September, 1990. Only $1.47 billion was handed over before the program was suspended after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Russia assumed responsibility for the loan, but at the end of 1993 Moscow had fallen behind in its repayments, the ministry spokesman said.
The Defense Ministry said Russian weapons to be brought to South Korea would include tanks and military vehicles and small arms. The ministry said the Russian arms would not be deployed militarily but used to work out strategies against North Korea, which uses weaponry that was mostly supplied by the Soviet Union or based on Soviet designs.

A chart in Business Day on Monday with the continuation of an article about growing disparities in wealth and income in the United States misstated the source of data on the concentration of wealth in industrial nations. It was Timothy M. Smeeding of the Luxembourg Income Study Group, not Edward N. Wolff, author of "Top Heavy: A Study of Increasing Inequality of Wealth in America." 
 In addition, the chart misstated France's ranking in an index of wealth concentration. The index's rankings ran from 0 (meaning everyone has the same amount of wealth) to 1 (a theoretical case in which only one person has all the wealth). France's ranking was 0.30, placing it between Italy and Canada; it was not 0.25, which placed it between Germany and Finland.

HEADLINE: A Switch at the M.T.A.

 BODY:
The abrupt resignation of Peter E. Stangl as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority yesterday removes from the scene a dedicated advocate for the New York City region's subway, bus and commuter rail systems. Mr. Stangl has fought hard if unsuccessfully to make the city and state live up to their financing commitments to a five-year, $9.6 billion rebuilding plan enacted in 1993. Commuters can only hope that Gov. George Pataki's choice to succeed him as chairman, E. Virgil Conway, uses his access to demand that the state and city not gut the system.
With the onset of the worst fiscal crisis in two decades, both New York's Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, and Governor Pataki have reduced their contributions to the authority. With Washington's subsidies also shrinking, the cutbacks are jeopardizing transportation services and capital improvements. Now that he has appointed a new chairman loyal to him, Mr. Pataki should disclose his own views of how to insure that recent impressive gains in ridership and quality of service are not jeopardized. 
 Mr. Conway, a banker who has served on the M.T.A. board since 1992, is a friend of Mr. Pataki. He could help the authority by serving as its advocate, not merely as the Governor's point man in exacting further spending cuts. But he needs to learn how to stand up to the Governor and fight for mass transit passengers. Mr. Conway's announced decision to work only part time sends an initial disturbing signal. The chairmanship of the M.T.A. is a job demanding full attention.
Mr. Stangl departs to join the Bombardier Transit Corporation, but he promises to obey ethics laws barring him from doing business with the authority for two years. He leaves with a record of achievement in one of the real government success stories of recent years. The region's transit systems are vital to its economic future and need the Governor's full attention if they are to be maintained.

HEADLINE: THE CAPITALIST;
The Lying Game

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS 

 BODY:
LIKE MOST AMERICANS, I LEARNED early on the importance of honesty from the story of George Washington and the cherry tree. But it was only recently that I discovered the story's provenance, and thus its true significance -- as an illustration of the market economy at work.
It first appeared in Mason Locke Weems's best-selling "The Life of Washington," published in 1800, and reissued many times with fresh material. The author, a man of the cloth, set the story down in the fifth edition of his book as follows (we join the action at its climax): 
 " 'George,' his father said, 'do you know who killed that beautiful little cherry tree yonder in the garden?' This was a tough question, and George staggered under it for a moment; but quickly recovered himself; and looking at his father, with the sweet face of youth brightened with the inexpressible charm of all-triumphant truth he bravely cried out, 'I can't tell a lie, Pa, you know I can't tell a lie, I did cut it with my little hatchet.' "
The whole thing, it turns out, is a charming fraud -- as historians have long known and that you might surmise from its copious quotation of a private conversation that occurred years earlier (or from the parson's claim in the book that the story's "too true to be doubted"). Weems made it up from scratch to achieve his twin aims of enhancing the myth of Washington and attracting buyers to his new-and-improved "Life." Thus the single most powerful American contribution to the notion of honesty illustrates a somewhat different moral: it pays to lie, if you have the knack for it. And if you lie as well as Weems you can make a lot of people happy, simply by telling them what they think they want to hear.
OF COURSE THE OFFICIAL RULE OF THE market is that honesty is the best policy -- or, at least, that any deal mutually beneficial to both buyer and seller requires honesty. And certainly, as every book on salesmanship explains, the appearance of honesty in business is extremely important. Why else the preternatural love of eye contact, firm handshakes and the prefixes "frankly" and "to be honest with you"? (Ever noticed that the people who have trouble looking you in the eye -- nerdy scientists, for example -- are precisely those who are trying their hardest to tell you the truth?)
But as every book on sales technique also implies, a shrewd salesman can manipulate the truth for profit. If he couldn't, there would be no need for books about sales technique. What's less apparent, perhaps, is that many lies in business are good not only for the liar but for the person lied to. Lest you doubt my word:
 
The Lie That Makes Us Feel Better About Ourselves. The most successful car salesman in American history, Joe Girard, mailed cards to his customers every month that read simply: "I Like You." At the end of his career he was mailing out 13,000 cards a month. Obviously this was deceptive; Joe could not possibly have liked all 13,000 tire kickers. Just as obviously, his 13,000 customers enjoyed being deceived, or Joe wouldn't have been so effective. Why they enjoyed being deceived, however, is maybe not so obvious. Perhaps some actually thought Joe liked them. Most probably knew Joe's flattery was false. But even false flattery is flattering in its peculiar way. In lying to his customers Joe was saying: You are important enough to abase myself before.
 
The Enabling Lie. Watching the N.C.A.A. basketball finals this month I was asked to believe that Nike shoes will replace my cynicism with hope; that the Hyatt Hotel chain is my best friend; that Doritos, Michelin tires and the Mazda Miata all delight small babies; that the 1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo awaiting me in the showroom is "all new" (but then why does it have the same name?), and that Donald and Ivana Trump were reconciled over the new cheese-filled crust from Pizza Hut.
What's interesting about these lies -- and the layer upon layer of deception in all advertisements -- is that they are offensive only when they are ineffective. Having swallowed a couple of lies like these myself I know that the better the lie, the happier it makes me. When I wear Air Jordans I actually do feel as if I play better; when I receive a package by Fedex like one of those important execs in the ads I actually do feel ever so slightly more important than when I get one by regular mail. I do not harbor resentment towards those who fooled me. I am grateful. (Thanks for the great lie!)

The Lie That Forces Reality Into Line With Our Expectations. We Americans have a talent for demanding the impossible. Hence, stockbrokers. If there were such a thing as a gift for always picking winning stocks, any person so possessed would be picking them for himself, not for you. Millions of Americans nevertheless expect that there should be someone out there who will tell them how to turn a little money into a lot, effortlessly. This belief sustains a large part of Wall Street, and its myriad petty deceits. In return, the brokerage industry provides those who wish to be lied to with a great deal of hope and an entertaining pastime.

The Lie Whose Ill-Effects Fall Miles Away. Perhaps the job market offers the clearest view of this peculiar phenomenon. We positively delight in the lies we tell to sell ourselves to a potential employer. The classic American success story begins with a long-shot applicant lying about his qualifications for a job he does not deserve. Of course, if the lie is exposed immediately the career in question ends before it starts, and the liar is reviled. But once a lie has worked, and the liar is safely ensconced in his new job, he is widely praised as enterprising, for having lied well. Those to whom he has lied chuckle knowingly -- after all, they got a successful employee. The liar brags about his lie to friends and family, thus insuring that others will learn to lie. Only the honest fool who didn't get the job gets the shaft -- and who cares about him?
COME TO THINK OF IT, MAYBE THAT story about Washington and the cherry tree was never meant to illustrate the virtue of honesty. Maybe it was meant to illustrate the secret of business success. After all, it ends with the young Washington rewarded for telling the truth. He avoids a spanking, receives great dollops of paternal love and admiration, and winds up with his picture on the dollar bill. Shrewd George! It isn't that he told the truth, but that he sized up his customer and told him what he wanted to hear. Instinctively, he knew to tell the truth only when it paid.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
George Wolfe and His Theater of Inclusion

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

 BODY:
FOR YEARS, THE JOSEPH PAPP Public Theater had the rudest box office in town. Among the staff members, it was even a matter of pride. One of the first things George C. Wolfe did when he took over as producer at the Public in March 1993 was to dismiss them.
Ticket sales can still be rushed, as might be expected when clerks at three windows try to handle five theaters for impatient patrons who won't take "sold out" for an answer. But the mood these days is far friendlier. 
 George Wolfe's invisible welcome mats say "inclusion." He wants everyone in New York City in his theater.
As he whirls upstairs and down, directing, teasing, buttonholing, shouting, shadowboxing, lunching, comforting and glad-handing, the Energizer bunny of the Public is reshaping the institution -- and not just the season, but the staff, the lobby, the look of the advertising and the mission. And, as a self-proclaimed "former spoiled child," he has unfailing trust in his own taste and wants things his way.
If this means dismissing some Papp loyalists, he'll do so. Like the Public's founder, he won't back away from a fight. But also like him, Mr. Wolfe has the ability to woo new writers while still going steady with celebrity talent. The result this season has been a list of productions that fairly shouts to be heard.
The 1994-95 program is everywhere, printed in a cockeyed jumble that suggests a nightmare while nose-down in a thesaurus: "Blade/Diva/Prince/Merchant/Silence/Dog/Dancing/Language/Him/Simpatico/People." Morale seems high. The lobby is friendly: staff members step up to patrons asking, "Can I help you?" Audiences of a youth and diversity that other producers would kill for mingle in the large space on Lafayette Street whose new signs, lively cafe tables and general bustle turn it into a playgoer's Grand Central.
The train station notion is Mr. Wolfe's. His two favorite words are "journey" and "collisions." He welcomed a musical, "The Petrified Prince," not so much to have a hit -- which it was not -- as to let the young composer Michael John LaChiusa and the director Harold Prince "go on a journey together." The "collisions" among his advisers -- the associate producers, Kevin Kline and Rosemarie Tichler; the director of play development, Morgan Jenness, and the literary manager, Shelby Jiggetts -- produce the season.
He wants the Public's traditional -- read "uptown white" -- audiences for Sam Shepard's horse-player saga "Simpatico," for example, or Stuart Greenman's "Silence, Cunning, Exile," inspired by events in the life of the photographer Diane Arbus, to collide in the lobby with new audiences drawn in to see the Harlem gangsters in "Dancing on Moonlight," the Hispanic boxers of "Blade to the Heat" or the gay Asian lovers of "A Language of Their Own."
If it works, the chain reactions will convert them to subscribers -- the solid base he must have on which to build his $10 million annual enterprise. To entice these new audiences, Mr. Wolfe says, he and his staff are creating "cultural bread crumbs" for different groups. The purpose? "To have this building vibrate with this city's energy and be inclusive, in a healthy, nontoken way."
To that end, he has hired a director of community affairs and group sales, Donna Walker-Collins, whose major assignment is to make black, Asian and Hispanic audiences feel wanted at the Public: "I use myself as an example," said Ms. Walker-Collins, the former director of marketing for Dance Theater of Harlem. "I've been in the arts for 20 years, and I never wanted to come to the Public until I bought tickets to 'Fires in the Mirror.' It felt cold -- I felt I wasn't welcome here."
Her first act was to arrange tours for 400 representatives of schools, churches and professional associations. She has opened the Public's five theaters to readings by, among others, the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and concerts by Haitian groups. She has had black actors do their favorite Shakespeare monologues at a Harlem theater. She helps organize panel discussions on homophobia in sports (linked to "Blade"), on how neighborhoods deify gangsters (linked to "Dancing on Moonlight"). Then she works to convert visitors to ticket buyers.
"Ultimately," she said, "what George wants is a blur -- that's his word -- of all the people in New York."
Mr. Wolfe finds the figures encouraging. Box-office income is expected to reach $1.5 million by May, up from $759,000 two years ago when his predecessor, JoAnne Akalaitis, was in charge. There are 6,000 Public members now, versus 3,200 subscribers two years ago.
 
Offering a Little Something For Almost Everyone
 This season, the first one that can really be called his, Mr. Wolfe has generated an electricity the Public hasn't felt since the heyday of Joe Papp. There will be 13 productions in all, including two this summer in Central Park: "The Tempest," which Mr. Wolfe is directing, and "Troilus and Cressida." In Oliver Mayer's "Blade to the Heat," the season opener, which Mr. Wolfe also directed, props lunged on stage like pit bulls as Latin boxers beat one another, spewing gouts of blood into the audience. In his play "Simpatico," Sam Shepard directed Beverly D'Angelo, Marcia Gay Harden, Ed Harris and Fred Ward. Christopher Walken starred in "Him," his own play, as Elvis resurrected as a diapered sumo wrestler and a snood-wearing waitress. Ron Leibman played Shylock in a very fey Venice.
"This season reflects George's taste, flair, insight and theatricality," said Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater, who was Mr. Papp's partner in running the Public until 1978. "It's a very successful transition to a new era."
Thus far, however, it has not been very successful with critics. That bothers him "not at all," Mr. Wolfe said. "Not . . . at . . . all," he repeats. "Because when one of them didn't get it, somebody else did. When you're doing adventurous programming, that's one of the risks you take. I could program a 'fabulous, I love it' kind of hit season right now. I'm more interested in breaking boundaries, telling a story, defying a truth that has been accepted."
He targets market segments as smoothly as any cola company. "Dancing on Moonlight," which has social and political references, can reach for a black mainstream audience, Mr. Wolfe said, like "East Texas Hot Links," by Eugene Lee and unlike "The America Play," by Suzan-Lori Parks. That play, he said, appealed to three groups "with blurred boundaries": black and white intellectuals as well as downtown audiences.
He hopes that "A Language of Their Own," about four gay men, two of whom are Chinese, will bring in an Asian audience, a gay audience and some of the "traditional, white, Upper East Side audience because of the artists involved, i.e., B. D. Wong and David Drake."
But every time he concocts a season, he says, someone grumbles, "The Public's going black, or the Public's going gay. . . . " This season, 4 of the 13 works have gay themes. Mr. Wolfe, who is gay, says there is no calculation to "order George up five homosexual plays."
"I pride myself on being available to as many people's stories as I possibly can," Mr. Wolfe said. Last year, "3 of the 11 plays had black artists at their cores, and it was 'the Public's going black.' " (And then, he said, some blacks complained that he was "only doing artsy black things to appeal to white intellectuals.") Next season will be "relatively female," with more plays by and about women.
"As a person of color," Mr. Wolfe said, "I was trained from very early on to see 'Leave It to Beaver,' 'Gilligan's Island' or 'Hamlet,' and look beyond the specifics of it -- whether it be silly white people on an island, or a family living in Nowheres, or a Danish person -- to leap past the specifics and find the human truths that have to do with me. I'm interested: Is the reverse possible? Can people who are not of color leap past the specifics of who these people are and get inside the dynamic of who they are as individuals?"
Now, he added, he is hunting for a play that "taps into a certain rage that I think white people are feeling right now."
"When England began going through cultural and social upheaval" under a conservative government, he said, "the writing -- by Caryl Churchill and David Hare, among others -- seemed to spring from that experience. A similar upheaval is happening now in this country and I haven't yet found plays from a white perspective reflecting how white Americans are feeling as they are being 'assaulted' by these changes.
"I want to have the kind of plays in the Public where the whole building becomes a giant snapshot of where America is. So in the pursuit of trying to tell very different stories -- to present these colliding points of view -- I am intrigued by the 'silent majority' in America, which all of a sudden has become incredibly vocal. Where are the plays that dissect or celebrate that rage? I would be very curious to see them."
 
Making New Friends And Maybe Even Money
 Mr. Wolfe has given the Public's image a new look too. For 20 years, Paul Davis's posters were its signature; clean close-ups of faces with as few words as possible: Sam Waterston agape as Hamlet, the "Streamers" parachutist. The new look, by Paula Scher of Pentagram, is mostly words, a wall of graffiti that cries: "Yo! Read me if you can!"
"We were trying to cleanse the visual palate," Mr. Wolfe said, "and also have a very contemporary, very 90's edge. I was looking for something that had a certain attitude, that said, 'Yeah, I'm here. Deal with this. Hop on board.' "
But even as people do hop on, the Public is not getting rich. The paradox of its economics is that because of its relatively small theaters, short runs, $15 to $35 ticket prices and Shakespeare in the Park giveaway, putting on more plays means losing money faster. There are exceptions: a sellout one-man show like Danny Hoch's can turn a profit; the expensive musical "The Petrified Prince" was underwritten by the Canadian producer Garth Drabinsky to see whether it was Broadway material.
A big season, though, can have other rewards. Three-quarters of the Public's income comes from foundations, corporations and private donors, and they would rather underwrite a hot theater than pay the debt service on a failing one. Donations and grants, $4.8 million two years ago, are projected to reach $7.3 million this year.
And a big season increases the chances of another "Chorus Line." The musical made the Public $40 million but that stream has dried up. The theater's endowment and cash reserve fund now total $10 million; annual interest of $600,000 goes into the operating budget.
The audience isn't the only body becoming more diverse, larger and, as a result, producing more money. Under Mr. Wolfe, the board has grown to 25 members, from 20. Nine are women; five are black; all are being pressed to raise funds more vigorously. And members say things are looking up: "In the worst year under Joe," said Larry E. Condon, the vice chairman, "we drew down $3 million from the reserve fund to pay for the season. Last year, we drew down $1 million. This year, if we're really lucky and find a sponsor for summer Shakespeare, we might break even."
 
The Not-So-Long Road From Kentucky to Broadway
 George Wolfe gets comfortable, popping off his shoes and sprawling on his leather office couch. As the cataract of words pours out, his hands pantomime them as elegantly as a signer for the deaf.
He can be combative and provoking. He can tease about race -- using humor with an edge to unsettle. The touchiness under the teasing is understandable. Here is a man who could flag down just about any job he wants on Broadway, but often he can't get a cab in front of his own theater.
He doesn't feel like going over what he calls "that 'Negro on parade' stuff" again: Born 40 years ago in small, pretty Frankfort, Ky., where his father was a clerk for the state department of corrections and his mother the principal of a private black grade school, and where he missed "101 Dalmatians" because blacks couldn't go into the Capitol Theater. He had good grades, good manners and "good hair"; high school theater conquered his stutter and brought him celebrity. After a year at a black university, Kentucky State, he moved to Pomona College in California.
It was after he arrived in New York and wrote "The Colored Museum," his 1986 skewering of black stereotypes, and "Spunk," a 1990 dramatization of three Zora Neale Hurston short stories -- two productions that impressed critics and audiences -- that he became well known. He wrote "Jelly's Last Jam," the life of Jelly Roll Morton in all its brilliance and self-hatred, and directed it on Broadway. That led to directing Tony Kushner's "Angels in America," for which he won a Tony Award. Next came Anna Deavere Smith's one-woman show "Twilight: Los Angeles 1992," which Mr. Wolfe also directed even as he began to put his stamp on the Public.
Raucous laughs break up his conversation, and he doesn't so much tell stories as do impressions of everyone in them. He describes panicky rehearsals for Mr. Kushner's "Angels": "Every day, someone in the cast would cry. [The actor, sobbing] 'I don't know what you want of me.' [Himself, consoling] I'd be patting him -- 'It's O.K., it's O.K.' [Turning to the nervous playwright hovering nearby] 'Tony, it's fine, it's wonderful, it's brilliant.' [Aside, to audience] 'You're killing me with these rewrites, Kushner.' "
Robin Wagner, the "Angels" and "Jelly's" set designer, who is on the Public's board, describes Mr. Wolfe rushing into his office many times saying, " 'I only have an hour.' And 8 or 10 hours later, everyone would have gone home, and we'd be there, with the lights on, still going over details."
 
As the Third Year Begins, A Relaxing of the Shoulders
 As Mr. Wolfe reshapes the Public, people have been let go. The cutbacks began out of necessity under Mr. Papp, who died in 1991, but there were long tenures and high salaries. On Jan. 1, time was up for Jason Steven Cohen, the managing director, who started as a stage manager 22 years ago, had risen to be Mr. Papp's right hand after Mr. Gersten left and shared leadership with Ms. Akalaitas during her tenure. He left gracefully but disappointed.
No dismissal has been painless. Mr. Wolfe calls them "serious, grown-up stuff" that he hadn't had to do before. "I try to do it respectfully. But my larger agenda is to transform this institution into the most effective, taut, muscular machine that I possibly can."
Joe Mantello, whom he directed in "Angels" and who went on to direct "Love! Valour! Compassion!" on Broadway, assessed Mr. Wolfe's management style this way: "George is a patient tyrant. He's going to get his way, but he's nurturing, and he gives you all the room in the world. He sees very clearly what he wants, and you end up there -- but feeling that you've done it all on your own."
What he has lost to the job, Mr. Wolfe said, is time for novels, movies and "this fantasy George who cooks." One victim is his New Year's gumbo blowout that started in 1982 with 20 friends, no money and three frozen shrimp and expired last year with 400 in a rented loft and lobster and crab in the pot.
Mr. Wolfe, who lives in SoHo, hangs out with friends. He visits a spiritualist in the Bronx named Candy because he's "fascinated by societies that honor their ancestors and have connections to something invisible." That's where his writing comes from, he says. "It's like a checkup. I don't ask, 'Should I do "The Petrified Prince" this season?' "
Recently, he said, a sense of clarity has set in. He has made it through the winter and into his contract's third year. "And now, I have completely made it mine -- things are in place so it can finally be my vision. Systems are in place. The board is in place. So there's a kind of relaxing of the shoulders.
"Last year, the signal was 'We're not dead.' This year, the signal was 'Energy is emanating out of this building -- this is where you come to see new work.' That's been accomplished."

HEADLINE: Shanghai's Fields of Green

BYLINE: By MARTHA WEINMAN LEAR; MARTHA WEINMAN LEAR, the author of "Heartsounds," is working on a memoir.

 BODY:
WE wanted a day in the country. No problem, our guide said. Everyone in Shanghai knows the same two English phrases: "joint venture" and "no problem."
We had been there a week and had overdosed on the city. Reflecting an entrepreneurial zeal possibly unmatched anywhere on earth, Shanghai today almost out-New Yorks New York: There is that kind of energy in the streets. The suits are glued to cellular telephones. The city is one big construction site -- bamboo scaffoldings rising like defoliated forests all over town, and whatever isn't a new shopping plaza elbowing all the mom-and-pops off the block is a high-rise bank or office building or glitzy hotel, and in these hotels the joint venturists sit, genially talking billions over breakfast. 
 It all makes the adrenaline flow. But after a few days, that loud hum of life and money starts getting to you, and you think it might be nice to relax in the countryside.
So: "No problem," the guide says, and at 7 A.M. on a Wednesday, we head out of the city.
The plan is to drive 60 miles west, through what has been described by Shanghainese as typical farmland, to the village of Zhou Zhoung, which dates to 1086 and is said to be one of the best-preserved ancient villages in China. An hour and a half each way, two hours to explore, and we're back easily in time for lunch. That's the plan.
An hour later, we have clocked three miles. Despite the economic explosion, most salaries are still extremely low -- our guide, who writes copy for a radio station, earns 1,000 yuan (about $110) a month -- and most people still travel by bicycle.
There are 13 million people in Shanghai. There are also 3.5 million bicycles, and at 8 on a workday morning every one of them seems to be out there playing chicken with the cars (350,000) and buses and pedestrians, and nobody blinks. The gridlock is like nothing I have ever seen.
We inch onward between rows of tenement housing with laundry-laden bamboo poles hanging out the windows. At 8:30 we have gone 12 miles. The guide announces that we now are in countryside. I look around. Walls of billboard. Real estate, mostly: "Shang-Min Garden," "Shanghai Elite Villas" "Investment in the Land -- Che Dun Town." Overhead, bilingual banners of exhortation arch across the road: "Be a Good Host to Our Distinguished Guests"; "Develop Highway and Vigorously Develop Shanghai." Behind the billboards, buildings newly risen and rising by the dozens: Yangtze New World Hotel, Rainbow Hotel (with its Gold Coast Club), People's Construction Bank of China, China World Trade Center . . . This is countryside?
"Used to be," our guide says. She explains that if we had gone looking for countryside in the old days, meaning before 1992, when China's hot market economy turned torrid, this is where we would have found it. Today it is an industrial development zone called Hong Qiao, one of three such zones ringing the city.
Who is doing all this building? we ask.
"Chinese Government. Foreigners. Many joint ventures, yes, yes. Here was all farms, very pretty," she says, gesturing toward the Galaxy Shanghai, the Shanghai Plaza, the Beverly Hills Bar, the Shanghai International Convention Hotel, the billboards for Shang Ling (appliances) and Zero Italy (sneakers).
Still, we are hopeful. Traffic has thinned a bit, we're zooming along now at 20 m.p.h. I see, between cars, glimpses of green. I see a field with incipiently growing things. A few haystacks. Two narrow canals, one with a sampan sweetly afloat. And up ahead is . . . what is it, a barn? A big shed? But no, it is the Shanghai Dong Fashion Company, followed by another field, followed by another factory.
So it goes for an hour more: promises, promises, wee teasers of green, countryside always just around the bend. By midmorning it hits me, quick study that I am, that we will not find the Shanghai countryside because there is no Shanghai countryside. There are only industrial development zones stretching on to the Himalayas.
Now the guide says that we are approaching the ancient town of Zhou Zhoung, and I think, well, if we can't have bucolic, we will at least have historic. Thus heartened, we arrive, and are greeted by a huge banner stretched across the road. It says:
"Welcome! Ancient Town Zhou Zhoung Worthy Paradise for Investors."
Four hours to get through Joint Venture Heaven, and now this. I feel cranky. But the village is a charmer, even though clogged with tourists (mainly Chinese; I saw no other Westerners). Ancient bridges arching over miniature canals, tiny squares full of vendors. One plies me with trinkets and I shake my head No. "No problem," he says.
WE wander through a maze of back alleys lined with little row houses made of stone. At almost every door is a wooden chamber pot. (You see these in midtown Shanghai too, in front of all the old houses on the side streets, in the shadow of the skyscrapers.) Who lives here, tradespeople? I ask. Tradespeople! The guide snorts delicately. These are privileged people. These houses have been in their families for centuries. (How ownership was maintained through the Mao years, I didn't ask and she didn't tell.)
I peer through a doorway and see a tiny, dismal room containing a coal grill, some pots, a plastic table, a shabby sofa, a stuffed Mickey Mouse on a shelf, and a woman sporting a terrific hair-do and wearing a suit that is, I would swear, an Armani. She beckons us in.
Our guide tells her that we are Americans. She smiles. She knows. I apologize for the intrusion. "No problem," she says, and then, in Chinese, cuts to the chase: "How much salary do you earn?"
Even in a Worthy Paradise for investors, this is a stopper. I stutter that a writer's income is deeply erratic.
She tsks. "It is better to be rich than to be a writer," she says, and I know absolutely that Confucius has spoken through this woman's mouth. Soon we thank her and depart. The guide is chagrined. "I know that in your country, it is not polite to talk about money," she says as we start back to Shanghai. "Chinese people never talked so much about money. Now they are always talking about salaries and stocks and joint ventures. Please do not be insulted."
No problem, I tell her.
Suddenly she points out the car window. "Look," she says, "countryside."
We are driving by a field, and in this field is a man wearing what used to be called a coolie hat, and he is bent beneath the weight of a bamboo shoulder pole, with buckets balanced at both ends. It is a freeze frame, a sliver of culture shock caught between Shanghai Aluminum Unison Products and Joint Venture Comfort Leather Products, and then it is gone.
"I am sorry there has not been more countryside," she says.
Listen, no problem.
Of course, we get back to Shanghai hours too late for lunch. We call our lunch date to apologize and he says, "Mei you wen ti," which means -- ah, but you know what it means.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
Easing Well-to-Do Renters From Regulation's Tent

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
AT 215 East 68th Street, there have been 24 decontrol orders so far in high-rent apartments occupied by high-income tenants. At 265 East 66th there have been 28. At 800 Fifth Avenue, at 61st Street, the figure is also 28, and at 1385 York Avenue, at 73d Street, the figure is 33.
The champion recipient of decontrol orders seems to be 500 East 77th Street, which has 850 apartments. It received 68. 
 The ownerships of these five large rental buildings probably also filed the most applications with the state rent office in the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, asking the agency to pursue income verifications for over-$2,000-a-month apartments. Accordingly, they probably led in the number of decontrol orders denied, or dismissals, as well.
But all are illustrative of the consequences of peculiarly designed legislation that went into effect last year and is working to decontrol, ever so gradually, regulated apartments occupied by some of the city's wealthiest residents. It is now coming to the close of its first full year of operation, and a new cycle of owner applications is about to begin, with direct notices to tenants from owners inviting them to concede that they are overincome for their apartments. Those who don't reply or who reply with a denial will in time get the same inquiry from the state.
What makes the law peculiar is that it does not apply to apartments renting for under $2,000 a month, no matter how high the tenant's income. The $1,500-a-month apartment rented by a millionaire is unaffected. But if the rent is over $2,000 and the tenant's household income exceeded $250,000 in each of the two preceding years, the owner is entitled to a deregulated apartment. The income used is adjusted Federal gross income as reported on Line 19 of the New York State tax return.
"Many tenants thought they had to report what their income is, not a line on their tax return," said Bruce H. Wiener, a lawyer with the firm of Fischbein Badillo Wagner Itzler, in discussing what he said was a glitch that led to erroneous decontrol orders. "Many filled out the state form without reference to their tax return, or else that hadn't yet filed for one of those years," he said.
Glitches notwithstanding, the decontrol program has been in effect long enough to give a fairly clear picture of how many apartments it will affect in one year of operation. Its indirect effects, in inducing co-op purchases or custom-tailored lease renewals by wealthy people, may be even greater than its direct effects.
As of late March, the state agency had acted on 1,539 cases -- 69 percent of the 2,227 received in the first year's cycle of cases. It granted 853 decontrol applications and dismissed 686 cases. A total of 688 cases are still pending.
THE number of decontrol orders granted -- 853 -- is 13 percent of all the 6,500 regulated apartments renting for more than $2,000 and receiving no tax abatements under the Section 421a program. (Adding those apartments in produces 11,500 over-$2,000 regulated units.) While buildings are still getting tax abatements the apartments are not eligible for deregulation.
The great majority of the 853 decontrol orders went for apartments whose tenants failed to fill out and return the state income form, officials said.
Owners or tenants may file for an administrative review of the agency's action. There have been 220 such appeals, 97 from tenants and the rest from owners. One owner filed 92 appeals, all involving dismissals based on a failure to file on time.
In the state's "pending" category are the cases for which it has not been possible so far to match financial data submitted by tenants with tax data from the Department of Taxation and Finance. One major reason was that tenants with minors in the household listed them as required on the state form, even though minors don't pay a state income tax. That produced a problem in obtaining a "match." Without a match, the owner's application is to be dismissed.
The rent agency submitted 1,081 cases to the Department of Taxation and Finance for matching. Successful matching so far has produced dismissal notices of 422 deregulation applications, and decontrol orders in only 21 cases, suggesting that tenants who know they are overincome are likely not to return the state's form at all.
The problem concerning minors accounts for about two-thirds of the 688 cases that have so far produced no match, state officials said. But they expect to succeed ultimately in making these matches. In most of the remaining unmatched cases it appears that no state income tax was filed, perhaps because the tenant works for the United Nations, or because the tenant's primary residence is in another state. In the latter case, the information may be useful to owners in pursuing a nonprimary residence action. Tenants are not entitled to a regulated apartment unless it is their primary residence.
A subject of much discussion and skepticism when the law was passed was how successfully the tenant-supplied information could be matched with income tax data. Owners were dubious. However, it appears that a match will eventually be made in 77 percent of the cases. It is a better ratio than many had predicted, but perhaps still a sign of a flawed method.
WHAT is striking in the entire procedure is that it has worked mainly to decontrol apartments indirectly. Most of those who were decontrolled didn't respond to the state notice at all. They thereby won themselves more time as regulated tenants, while the bureaucratic wheels ground, than they would have had by conceding as much on earlier inquiry forms from owners. But eventually they received decontrol orders. Some will say, perhaps in court, that they never received the state notice.
Many of those who are under-income complied with the system and successfully protected their occupancy rights. Decontrol was denied. But to protect their occupancy they probably will have to be ready to submit to the procedure annually. Many tenants have already received landlord notices for the second cycle, involving income earned in 1993 and 1994.
The decontrol provision expires with the rent-stabilization law itself in 1997. In the 1996-97 legislative session all rent regulatory law will be up for renewal or reconsideration.
In pure-rental buildings, many tenants receiving decontrol orders will negotiate a new nonregulated rent before their lease expires. "Most of the cases haven't come up yet because the leases are still running, but in the few that have, settlements are being reached in a third to a half the cases, and the tenants are staying on on a deregulated basis," said Jeffrey Turkel, a lawyer with the firm of Rosenberg & Estis. Owners have given two- , three- or in some cases five-year leases to advance rents to market levels.
But rents may be so far from market levels that a tenant may decide to move. At the Pavilion, the 850-unit 1963 building that occupies the full block from 76th to 77th Street between York Avenue and John Jay Park, roughly 5 percent of the over-$2,000 apartments are renting at about 60 percent of market value, said Gary Jacobs, executive vice president of Glenwood Management, the owner. The tenants are paying somewhat more than $2,000 a month for units that could be rented for about $3,200.
"A number of tenants have moved out," Mr. Jacobs said. "To me it proves the theory that any regulation creates gridlock." In many other cases the tenant's rent is already at or close to the rent obtainable for a vacancy, so the law has little impact.
IN co-ops, long-term renters are more inclined to buy their apartments if they know sponsors will not be obliged to renew their rental leases.
"As leases expire we are asking people either to buy or move so we can sell the vacancy," said Arnold Goldstein, whose company, Samson Management, converted the 74-unit co-op at 1150 Fifth Avenue, at 96th Street, four years ago. The 1929 building has 44 preconversion renters, 17 of them living there so long that they are rent-controlled.
Four decontrol orders have already been received, though two are being contested. In seven other cases, eight- and nine-room apartments are renting at close to $2,000 a month, and will be above it in a year or so. They have an as-is sale value of about $600 a square foot, Mr. Goldstein says, or $1.2 million for eight rooms and $1.8 million for nine. Co-op owners pay about $2,900 a month in maintenance for the eight-room units and $3,300 a month for nine rooms.
Tenant lawyers say that an undetermined issue is how high a sponsor can raise the rent of a deregulated rental in a co-op. They maintain that these apartments are covered by a provision of the General Business Law that says in buildings accepted by the Attorney General for conversion, renters shall not be subjected to "unconscionable rent increases beyond ordinary rentals for comparable apartments during the period of their occupancy."

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
'Trapped' In a Co-op

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
IN 1989, when Emily Nomer and her husband, Daniel Manzanares, bought their first home -- a one-bedroom co-op in a building near Union Square in Manhattan -- their intention was to upgrade to a larger apartment as their family grew.
Six years and two children later, they are still living in their one-bedroom apartment; they have partitioned off part of the living room to create the second bedroom they so desperately need. They would like to buy a larger apartment but cannot because to do so they would have to sell the one unit in which they now live. And they have discovered -- along with nearly every other unit owner in the building -- that their apartment is virtually unmarketable. 
 "We didn't know the rules would change," Ms. Nomer said, explaining that the sponsor, instead of making efforts to sell apartments in the building, is now renting them. "As soon as realtors find out that the sponsor still owns 80 percent of the building, they back off. They know that the banks just won't lend."
Indeed, real estate experts say, Ms. Nomer and her neighbors are not alone. Thousands of unit owners are literally "trapped" in co-op apartments they cannot sell because buyers cannot get financing when the sponsor owns a majority of the units. "I've seen it over and over and over again," said James Samson, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in co-op and condominium law.
The problem, Mr. Samson said, affects a significant number of buildings that were converted to co-ops at the end of the conversion boom in the late 1980's. In many cases, he said, the recession that followed the boom made it difficult for sponsors to sell all the units in their buildings. As a result, he said, they rented units they could not sell.
Under ordinary circumstances, Mr. Samson said, that strategy would be a temporary one. But since, according to the state's rent-regulation codes, unsold apartments in converted buildings become exempt from rent stabilization or rent control when the existing tenant moves out, sponsors soon discovered that if they waited long enough, they could rent vacated apartments at market rents. In the last few years, as the rental market improved, it became more profitable for sponsors to rent their unsold units than to sell them. "The result can be catastrophic," Mr. Samson said.
Victor Miller, board president of the co-op association at 200 East 16th Street, couldn't agree more. "I bought into a promise that this was going to be a housing corporation set up for the benefit of potential owners," Mr. Miller said. "Instead, it's run more like a tenancy than a housing corporation."
The building at 200 East 16th Street, Mr. Miller said, was converted to a co-op in 1989 when the sponsor sold 40 of the 194 apartments. "He has not sold one additional unit since," Mr. Miller said. "We've had a tremendous amount of tenant turnover in the building, but all the sponsor does is mark the rent up and rent the apartments out. There's no incentive for him to sell. We're viewing this as a false conversion."
In August 1994, Mr. Miller said, the co-op association filed suit against the sponsor seeking a court order compelling him to sell the units he owns in the building.
Jonathan M. Landsman, the lawyer who filed the suit, said that it is the first of its kind in New York. "One of the causes of action is that the sponsor breached the contract with the co-op corporation when he intentionally stopped selling units," Mr. Landsman said.
Jack Feldman, an owner of Sigfeld Realty, the sponsor of the building, is contesting the suit and denied that the building was a "false conversion."
"That's a lot of baloney," Mr. Feldman said. "We've been constantly trying to sell units, but the market was weak. The renting is only a temporary situation. I'm renting because I've got to cover my expenses. I'm stuck here, too."
Marc Luxemburg, president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, said that there is usually no time limit by which a sponsor must sell his units specified in offering plans. Moreover, there is nothing in the law that prohibits the sponsor from renting unsold units.
But Mr. Luxemburg also said that sponsors have a contractual obligation to purchasers to complete the offering according to the offering plan, provided the sponsors do not suffer unreasonable economic harm. And whether the actions of the sponsor are intentional or not, the result is usually the same: apartments in the building become essentially unmarketable.
"It's impossible to get a mortgage," said Margaret S. Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services in Manhattan. For a prospective purchaser to obtain a co-op mortgage that meets the requirements of the Federal National Mortgage Association, Ms. Scott said, the building usually must be 80 percent owned by tenant-shareholders. But in some cases, she said, Fannie Mae, which purchases mortgages from lending institutions, will, like most banks, accept 51 percent. Some mortgage companies will provide financing in buildings that have as few as 35 percent of units sold. Those, however, are rare.
"If you have one person -- the sponsor -- owning most of the building, lenders are afraid that the sponsor could go bankrupt," Ms. Scott said. "They'd be relying too much on one person."
The result of those fears, experts say, can be devastating.
"The fact is, there are people who are trapped in their apartments in New York," said Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer and vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives. And, he said, it is necessary that prospective purchasers be made aware of the potential problem they may have reselling units in buildings where sponsors own a majority of the units, even though that may serve to exacerbate the plight of unit-owners, including the one trying to sell to the prospective purchaser.
Mr. Luxemburg said there are potential problems in nearly 1,500 buildings in New York State that still have unsold units. "It's a significant problem," he said. "And unfortunately, the sponsors don't think they're doing anything wrong. It needs to be pointed out to them that they have promised to convert their building to a co-op at some time in the reasonable future and not keep it as a rental from now until kingdom come."
Mr. Samson, who represents several co-op corporations in buildings where sponsors have stopped selling apartments, said the only way to persuade a sponsor to sell is to provide him with an economic incentive. "You've got to stop him from renting," Mr. Samson said, adding that it is often easier and more effective to get a court order prohibiting a sponsor from renting apartments than it is to get an order compelling the sale of the units. "You've got to make the economics of selling more attractive than the economics of not selling," he said.
Another way to do so, at least prospectively, would be to eliminate the ability of the owner to collect market rents on what were formerly rent-stabilized apartments.
"The easy way to solve the problem," Mr. Samson said, "is to close the loophole." But that would require legislation. "And that may be impractical," he said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Atlantic City;
A 74,000-Square-Foot Shopping Center Passes Go

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
IN large and economically vibrant cities, it might not be all that big a deal: A 74,000-square-foot shopping center with a Thriftway supermarket, a CVS drug store, a variety store, a low-priced apparel store and maybe a Taco Bell.
But in Atlantic City, the April 6 groundbreaking for Renaissance Plaza, a few blocks inland from the Boardwalk and bounded by Atlantic, Arctic, New York and Kentucky Avenues, was a big deal indeed. Caterers served mahi-mahi and other fancy foods under a big tent. Mayor James Whelan showed up, as did the chairman of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, Fredrick P. Nickles, New Jersey State Senator William Gormley and assorted businessmen and community leaders. 
 "This is the kind of project where everybody wins," Mayor Whelan said.
The hoopla and the Mayor's ebullience were both understandable. Renaissance Plaza is a visible symbol that, after shooting snake-eyes for years, Atlantic City is finally on a construction roll. A $270 million convention center is scheduled to open in late 1996. New hotel rooms are going up. Developers are talking about movie theaters, shopping malls, even a factory outlet.
"Yes, everything has been slow, but things are moving now," Mr. Nickles said.
For Atlantic City residents, Renaissance Plaza is more than a symbol of growth. Indeed, Harold Friedland's 43,000 square foot Thriftway will be the first supermarket to operate in Atlantic City in 25 years.
"Most chain stores avoid the inner city," said Mr. Friedland, who operates six Thriftways in low-income areas of Philadelphia and of Wilmington, Del. "But there's no competition, so you do great sales volume even at fair prices."
Still, until recently the shopping center had been stymied by low funds and high bureaucracy. Indeed, Atlantic City officials have been talking about shopping centers, new hotels and a rebuilt boulevard off the Atlantic City Expressway for nearly 10 years. Nearly every project has died, or been mired in the courts, or fallen victim to political infighting and red tape.
"You just can't keep debating if you want a shrub on the left or right side of a street," said a frustrated Arthur M. Goldberg, chairman of Bally Entertainment, which owns two Boardwalk casinos. Kenneth B. Platt, the city's planning director, acknowledges the criticism. "There have been dry runs, dead ends, false starts," he conceded.
Apparently, the stalemate is over, in part due to the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority (CRDA, and pronounced CREE-da). CRDA, which expects to collect some $1.4 billion over the next 20 years from a 1.25 percent levy on gaming revenues, provided some $5.5 million of Renaissance Plaza's $13 million cost. Mr. Nickles predicts that, through direct subsidies to hotels, CRDA will spend some $100 million to generate some 2,000 new hotel rooms.
Several hotels have already signed on for subsidies. TropWorld is building 628 new rooms, using the air rights over its stand-alone garage. Donald Trump's Taj Mahal and Bally's Grand and Park Place hotels are building new rooms, too.
CONSIDERING that every study of Atlantic City's visitors shows that they are primarily day-trippers, the emphasis on hotel expansion might seem curious. It is not. The budding hope throughout Altantic City is that over the next few years the tiny town -- just 48 blocks long and about 4 blocks wide -- will again be a haven for family vacations and business meetings.
"Decades ago Atlantic City was a real family resort, and we want to reclaim that heritage," Mr. Platt said.
The push comes just in time. As long as Atlantic City was the only gaming game in town -- Las Vegas, after all, is not within easy driving distance -- there was little real pressure to change the status quo. But then the mammoth Foxwoods Casino opened in Ledyard, Conn. Riverboat gambling grabbed hold in some southern cities. And New York State and Pennsylvania began talking of installing gaming as well.
"Atlantic City needs a new competitive edge," said Robert Minutoli, a senior vice president of the Rouse Company, the Maryland developer that wants to build an entertainment complex on the Boardwalk.
The casino hotels already are scrambling to offer enjoyments beyond gaming. Several of the hotels are replacing their Boardwalk delis with far more upscale fare. Resorts International has plans for a California Pizza Kitchen, a Starbucks coffee house and a TCBY frozen yogurt shop. Planet Hollywood just opened in Caesars Atlantic City. And a Warner Brothers store is already thriving in Trump Plaza.
The city is relaxing rules that prevented the hotels from setting up Boardwalk cafes. And it is allowing the casinos to expand into hotel retail space, something that was strictly forbidden before. The hope is that some of the good shops in the hotels will supplant the fast food and souvenir shops in the Boardwalk's stand-alone retail space.
Off-Boardwalk development remains more problematic. Atlantic City has many trash-strewn vacant lots, but they are scattered around, making it hard to assemble sites for large developments. And the always-present prospect of unfettered casino expansion has resulted in skyrocketing land prices, making many projects unprofitable.
Now CRDA and other city agencies are buying land and leasing it to developers at palatable rates. "Without the CRDA intervention, this project would not have worked," said Louis P. Meshon Sr., president of Montgomery Group Affiliates, the Plymouth Meeting, Pa., developer that is building Renaissance Plaza.
Other out-of-state developers are spotting profit opportunities now, too. The Rouse Company wants to build a Boardwalk center with a Monopoly theme that would capitalize on the well-known link between the properties on the Monopoly game board and Atlantic City's streets. Forest City Rattner, which owns Brooklyn's Metrotech as well as a couple of Brooklyn shopping centers, wants to build an Italian-themed center on about 30 acres adjacent to the Showboat Hotel. Forest City's project would include a factory outlet mall, as well as two movie theaters, exhibition spaces, restaurants, a children's entertainment area and more.
Unfortunately for Atlantic City, many potential projects physically overlap. Showboat, which wants to expand onto the adjacent land itself, has sued to stop the Forest City project. And last December, while Rouse, CRDA and various city officials argued over where Rouse's entertainment complex should be, Bally's Mr. Goldberg quietly spent $7.5 million for a four-acre piece of land near his Park Place casino that Rouse considered vital to its project.
"Everything was taking so long, and the land was a junk-filled eyesore," said Mr. Goldberg, who plans to have exhibitions, stores and another casino on the land by the end of 1996. Most of the developers expect that compromises will be found. "There are options being explored that don't involve Goldberg's land," Mr. Minutoli said. A senior executive at Forest City, although he would not talk for attribution, said, "We are pretty sure there's a way to work things out so that Showboat can expand too."
IN the meantime, city officials are pursuing business visitors. They recently signed up a trade show from India, to be held in Atlantic City's old convention center this June. "We sent three people to India for two-and-a-half weeks to get that show," Mr. Platt said. "We are hoping it will establish a precedent for international shows."
Before that can happen, Atlantic City will have to fix itself up. Although Mr. Platt insists that the city is relatively safe and has huge pockets of neatly kept, middle-class housing, he concedes that its image remains that of an underclass town whose visitors had best stick to the Boardwalk.
"Our infrastructure has been neglected, and the dingy atmosphere gives visitors a feeling of discomfort," he said.
The city and CRDA together have pumped nearly $50 million into housing, roads and landscaping, and the city is building a $12 million baseball stadium.
And the city finally is spiffing up its front door. The Atlantic City Expressway, by far the most used entry to town, lets off onto a street bounded by a bus terminal and a little-used park, with some oversized promotional signage straight ahead.
Over the last five years several architects and developers submitted plans, many of which suffered the local equivalent of a pocket veto. A $2 parking fee that the city expected would raise $200 million for redevelopment only raised $100 million.
For a time the city thought Rouse would build its entertainment project along the entranceway, but the developer was far more interested in the Boardwalk.
Now CRDA has allocated some $35 million to move the bus terminal and create a boulevard-like, tree-lined street from the Expressway to the Boardwalk. And most officials insist that, this time, plans will result in progress.
"Now that the convention center is under construction, we no longer have the luxury of planning forever," Mr. Platt said.

A Widow Takes Charge at a Real Estate Business

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: BRONXVILLE

 BODY:
LAST Monday marked the one-year anniversary of a tragic day at Houlihan/ Lawrence, the largest residential real estate company in Westchester County. The company's headquarters in a white clapboard building is where Peter Bailey Seaman spent most of his time while he was chairman and chief executive from May 1990 until April 1994, when he died of a brain tumor at age 42.
During her husband's illness, Nancy M. Seaman said, it was just assumed that in the event of his death she would take control of the company. "We never talked about it because we always assumed that Peter was going to recover," Ms. Seaman said. "Up until the time he died, we still hoped and believed he would make it." 
 After his death, Ms. Seaman stepped in and the change of leadership has been remarkably smooth, according to staff members and executives in the industry. "Had we not been informed, we might not have known there had been a personnel change," said P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. He attributes that, in part, to the way Mr. Seaman restructured the company, giving more power to branch managers. "And from an organizational standpoint, they have a very high quality staff," he said.
Throughout Mr. Seaman's stewardship, his wife, who was a 50 percent ownership partner, was involved in many of his major decisions.
"It wasn't a matter of Nancy starting with the company after Peter died, she was always there," said Ebie Wood, regional manager for the central region, which has seven branch offices.
Ms. Seaman, 41, holds a master's degree in business administration from Indiana University, and was most recently the United States marketing representative of Beiersdorf, the German manufacturer of Nivea skin care products. "After my daughter was born six years ago, I decided not to work for a while," she said. "I had waited so long to have her, I wanted to be with her."
In an interview, it's clear that Ms. Seaman considers herself to be carrying out her husband's legacy, although she seems equally determined to do it in her own way. A picture of Mr. Seaman, wearing a Houlihan/Lawrence cap, adorns her desk. In another part of the office are several photographs of the couple's two children, a 6-year-old daughter, Callie, and 3-year-old son, Jamie.
"My children are my life now," she said. "I'm torn about being away from them. When I'm not working, all my activities are centered around them."
She said it seemed ironic that in a year that was so personally wrenching, the company posted its most successful sales figures.
Volume increased from $400 million in 1993 to $900 million in 1994, Ms. Seaman said. She attributes that almost entirely to her husband's groundwork. "Peter had a three-year plan that had been completed," she said. "He restructured the company and turned it into a profit center. So when the economy improved we had all our ducks in a row and could take advantage of it."
Houlihan/Lawrence is the largest residential real estate company in the county in terms of employees. "They have 330 licensees, either brokers or sales agents, which is about 10 percent of our total membership," Mr. Mercurio said. The national chain Coldwell Banker is next with just over 300, Mr. Mercurio said. "After that, the numbers drop off dramatically," he added.
ALTHOUGH the realtors board has no company-by-company comparison of sales volume, Mr. Mercurio said, "it wouldn't surprise me if Houlihan/Lawrence had the No. 1 position."
Houlihan/Lawrence is a home-grown company that holds a dominant position in an industry that has increasingly been taken over by national affiliations, Mr. Mercurio said. "I don't know of any neighboring company in the same position," he said.
Before the Seamans bought Houlihan/ Lawrence, Mr. Seaman was the owner and chief executive of Harbor Fuel, an oil company on Nantucket. Before that he was director of marketing at Chesebrough-Ponds. When the Seamans bought Houlihan/ Lawrence in 1990 it had a blue-chip reputation but was losing money. Mr. Seaman reduced staff by 50 percent and created three regional centers, each with its own manager. "The offices were decentralized, and each had greater autonomy," Ms. Seaman said.
One of her first moves was to create a chief operating officer position, and hire Scott Rogers, a family friend who had his own sporting goods company in California. Mr. Rogers has just completed a national study looking at areas of opportunity for Houlihan/Lawrence. While Ms. Seaman was not prepared to disclose specifics, she did say that she saw growth for the company. "There's a lot of opportunity in new construction," she said. "We'll be making some announcements in two or three weeks."
She also just hired an outside marketing team to buttress the work of the staff. "This will be the year of marketing," she said, "After last year, we'll be riding the crest of the wave."
Ms. Seaman proudly noted that during her husband's illness and after his death the company did not lose any major performers to the competition. "Instead of jumping ship, people were jumping on," she said. One of them was Pat Bentley, the manager of the Katonah office, who left the same position with Coldwell Banker in September. "I think it's possible to make a difference here," Ms. Bentley said, "to make your voice heard."
TO many people in the company, Ms. Seaman's management style has brought some subtle changes. "She relates to people and their families because that's so important to her," said Debra Dalton, vice president of corporate administration.
Since over 90 percent of the agents are women, working for a woman chief executive has a special significance, according to Vera Blendermann, manager of the Bronxville office. "They like her approach," she said. "She writes notes of appreciation. And she's started sending out letters to everyone who buys something with us, asking if they were pleased with our service."
She also increased the number of agents who were eligible for incentive bonuses. "It tells people how committed she is to performance," Ms. Dalton said, "and gives them incentive."
On the inside cover of the corporate directory there is a full-page tribute to Peter Seaman, thanking him for setting the company's course. "Because of you we sail on in strength," it says.
To Ms. Seaman, the same could be said of her. "Peter made me feel like I could do anything," she said. "Three weeks after his terrible diagnosis, we were in Florida. It was a beautiful night, and he said 'we are so lucky.'
"I didn't understand it then, but one and half years later, he had conveyed to me how fortunate I was to have had what I did with him. And I was left with so much, my children, this company. I do feel lucky."

HEADLINE: ART;
Among a Judge's Choices, Some Extremes Between Extremes

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR 

 BODY:
EVERY year for the last 25, the Stamford Museum and Nature Center has cast its net in the art pool and invited a judge to sift through the catch.
The results, exhibited under the title "Connecticut Art," have been surprisingly varied considering the limitations imposed by geography and the predictable recurrance of a few regulars. Still, the shows are generally more interesting for what they reveal of the judges' personalities than for the news they bring of the scene. 
 This time the judge was Eugenie Tsai, who has been making her mark as director of the Whitney Museum's branch in Stamford and as a curator of its shows. (Her most noteworthy achievement last year was the show of the electronic art of Nam June Paik and the walls of tiny paintings by Ik-Joong Kong.) Of the 174 contenders converging on the Nature Center, Ms. Tsai took 74, awarding 4 the customary group show.
At one end of the esthetic spectrum is Janet Baldi's study of cupboard shelves loaded with crockery, glass and kitchen utensils. The still life, painted in browns and creams and illuminated from below, is one of the few examples of photographic realism.
At the spectrum's other end is Mary Dwyer with small naive images that pertain to Chinese immigration at the end of the last century. "Laying the Railroad 1872" depicts a Wyatt Earp-type gunman and a row of laborers wearing white clothes and black caps and waving tiny American flags.
Between the two extremes are other extremes, like Rick Shaefer's imaginary landscape versus the drawing of hummocky grassland by Virginia Zimmermann. Mr. Shaefer's scene has the look of a chiaroscuro engraving but is actually a drawing in what appears to be black ink and watercolor. The foreground is filled with flowers and insects worthy of a botanical illustrator while, behind, sits a romantically rocky landscape fading into infinity. The sense of recession is also present in Ms. Zimmermann's "Country Road 14" but the image measures about three feet by four feet, the medium is charcoal and the technique illusionist.
Weak drawing and a timid way with paint would seem to be handicaps. But for Morton Hollinger's purpose they are almost prerequisites. Representing this painter is a nightclub interior occupied by women in pastel chiffon dresses and men in tuxedoes, all of whom seem to be performers. Though the period is the 1930's, as celebrated by P. G. Wodehouse, the listless atmosphere bespeaks the W. P. A. rather than the jolly world of Bertie Wooster and his gentleman's gentleman, Jeeves.
Ann Chernow's woman partly illuminated by a table lamp, a blue-toned etching with aquatint, catches the eye; so does Elisa Khachian's watercolor of a fish in water that can also be read as a paisley-like pattern. But for sheer magnetism there is nothing to equal "Caroly Koffler, M. D., Ph. D," a portrait by Arthur Koffler. Although the drawing, particularly the eyes and mouth, is first-rate, it is the almost fauve color applied in small dabs that holds the viewer enthralled. Just as remarkable is the artist's response to a model who is far from young. Where some would turn her into a picturesque senior citizen, Mr. Koffler portrays her as a dynamic personality first and an elderly woman second.
The sculpture tends to be rather fanciful. Joseph Fucigna is represented by a large metal piece involving a polygonal shape suspended like an exhaust over a polygonal base. Between the two is a pair of metal strips curving outward and a stubby form covered like a gear shift with black leather or plastic. This construction, which hovers between art and craft, stands adjacent to Janet Lage's tall box, which contains twigs visible through a pane of glass on the top and around which snakes a long branch dabbed at each end with red paint.
Rather more memorable are the efforts of Eleanor White and Doug Morrill. Having filled several small cages with mildewed sandwiches, Ms. White lashes them together and suspends them on a wall. Mr. Morrill's "Birds in Cage" consists of wood forms trapped in a structure filled with crisscrossing wires. In a companion work, the birds, now serpentine in shape and cleft at one end, ripple up and out of the cage, parallel to each other.
The line dividing imagination from mere imaginativeness is fine and too often is crossed by the sculpture and assemblages. But relief is provided by the black and white photographs of Joanna Nichols and Robert Zott. Ms. Nichols depicts a pair of Brahman bovines who stand close, protecting the calf between them.
Mr. Zott fills half a wall with six pictures of tombstones, each inscribed with a name that is also a color, beginning with white and ending with black. In deadpan confirmation of the sequence, the prints range from very light to very dark in tone.
This "Connecticut Art" reflects many moods, none of them too serious, fortunately. It remains on view through next Sunday.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The annual "Connecticut Art" show at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, running through next Sunday, includes the artist Robert Zott's series "The Death of Color" -- black and white photographs of tombstones, keyed to the names of the deceased.

HEADLINE: Big Demand And Short Supply Lift Rents In Manhattan

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
RENTING a place to live in New York hasn't been easy or inexpensive in recent years. Yes, rents fell somewhat in the early 1990's, thanks to the recession and a decline in the quality of life in the city. Since then, however, rents, particularly in Manhattan, have crept back up to -- and in some cases moved beyond -- the highs that occurred in the real estate boom of the mid- and late 1980's.
"Rents have been rising and are continuing to rise for most apartments," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a rental agency in Manhattan. "The only exception has probably been large three-bedroom apartments on the Upper East Side. And that's only because there's a small market for them, and people are buying them now rather than renting them." 
 As it did a decade ago, the lack of available units combined with the city's unusually high percentage of renters (New York City has one of the lowest home ownership rates in the nation) hinders many apartment hunters.
The process is particularly arduous for young newcomers to the city, who can't afford four-figure monthly rents, much less the $2,000 to $3,000 needed to pay a broker to find such apartments.
"When I saw how much it would cost for a broker, I said, 'No way,' " said Matt Hoffberg, a 24-year-old software writer from Greenwich, Conn., who is looking for a studio in Manhattan, preferably in the East Village, or to a share a larger apartment for about $500 a month.
For households with six-figure incomes, finding a rental in the city -- Manhattan is usually the desired location -- is much easier, especially if an employer is paying for relocation costs and a broker's fee.
Even so, sticker shock strikes many.
"In Munich, this would be worth about $1,000 a month -- at most," said Andrea Bochmann as she surveyed a $3,000-a-month furnished apartment in a doorman building in the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan earlier this month.
And even with a broker setting up appointments and guiding the way, the apartment-hunting process can be exasperating and exhausting. In New York, bedrooms are often too small, natural light almost nonexistent and neighborhoods bleak if not decrepit.
"I hate it," said Ms. Bochmann, a journalist who has looked at about 10 apartments in Manhattan in search for a one-year rental. She is moving to Manhattan with her husband, Fritz, a psychologist, and their 9-year-old daughter, Laura, because her husband has a fellowship at a local hospital.
As with the co-op market, it is difficult to ascertain average rents in the city. No government agency or private group collects such data on a citywide or even Manhattan-wide basis. Brokers have their own surveys, but they tend to focus on high-end properties, such as doorman buildings in Manhattan, and ignore the tens of thousands of new New Yorkers who take leases on walkups and other apartments elsewhere in the city or in New Jersey.
Furthermore, no reliable data exist on what percentage of prospective tenants use brokers or rely on newspaper ads, bulletin-board postings and word of mouth.
"Generally, people don't use a broker if they are looking for an apartment under $1,200 a month," Ms. Packes said. "Most people under that level will go directly to the landlord because they don't have the cash flow to pay a broker and make a security deposit. People in the higher price range are willing to pay for the service of having someone screen the properties for them."
People who use brokers also appear to be much more likely to be relocating to the city from elsewhere. A survey by Feathered Nest last year showed that 57 percent of the company's clients were looking for an apartment in Manhattan as part of a new job relocation.
Changes in marital status or a personal relationship, along with moving closer to their workplace and needing more space were the next most popular reasons for renting an apartment. Those reasons were chosen by only six percent of the survey's respondents, however.
Ms. Packes said the rising demand for rentals has made apartment hunters are less fussy. She said that fewer tenants were moving just because they wanted to live in a different neighborhood and more were moving because they wanted a better deal or more space.
"The importance of a view has diminished to the vanishing point," she said.
Ms. Packes also noted that the percentage of people renting because they have sold their apartments has almost doubled in the past year from 3 percent to 5 percent.
"Clearly, the experience of people waiting for the market to come back from the late 1980's gave some people trepidation about buying again and made them question the theory that real estate only goes up in value," Ms. Packes said.
The Feathered Nest survey covered about 1,800 apartment rentals in 1994. More than a third of them, 40 percent, came relocated in New York from another part of the United States. Twenty-five percent came from another country. (Ten percent came from the New York suburbs, 25 percent from elsewhere in Manhattan and 2 percent from Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island or the Bronx.)
The favorable currency exchange rate is a big plus for corporate transfers from places like Germany and Japan, where the dollar has declined in value substantially over the past year.
"Usually people that come over here wind up being able to rent nicer places than they have at home," said Kelly Miller-Taylor, a broker with Feathered Nest. "That's particularly true with the germans and Japanese, not so much with the Italians, because their currency has been having problems, too."
Though the prices vary widely depending on the neighborhood and amenities offered, rents, according to a recent survey by the Halstead Property Company, a Manhattan real estate broker, showed that the average monthly rent for a studio apartment is $965, for a one-bedroom unit, $1,800; for a small two-bedroom, $2,650, for a large $3,340 and more than two bedrooms, $4,600. The survey, according to the company, is based on 6,781 properties.
"It is as tight as '89," said Brian Edwards, director of leasing for the Halstead Property Company. "The middle of the market, apartments renting for, say, $1,500 to $3,000 a month is even tighter."
He noted that at The Orleans, a former hotel and Columbia University dormitory, at 100 West 80th Street at Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, a two-bedroom, 1,050-square-foot apartment that rented for $2,500 18 months ago recently rerented at $3,400.
A one-bedroom, 875-square-foot apartment in the doorman, pre-war building that rented for $1,800 18 months ago now rents for $2,200. And a 900-square-foot one-bedroom apartment that rented for $2,500 now goes for $2,900.
"Can you imagine that?," Mr. Edwards asked. "Two thousand, nine hundred dollars for 900-square-foot one-bedroom apartment?"
He added that most of the tenants in the building were singles and two-income couples with no children. "I don't think we have put anyone in that building who has less than $200,000 a year in income," Mr. Edwards said.
He also said that the rising rents are making some tenants consider buying, particularly those paying rents of more than $3,000 a month for large luxury apartments in prime areas of Manhattan. "But when they go out to buy, they see that purchases are getting tight, too," Mr. Edwards said.
"Then they get into bidding wars, and they get angry, when they can get the kind of apartment they want," he added.
"The biggest demand is for two bedrooms," Mr. Edwards said. "Then for three bedrooms."
Turnover is also thought by brokers who track the market to be low nowadays. (About one-third of all market-rent apartments are in co-op's, where many sub-tenants can usually live no longer than two years. The other third are in condos, where the landlord may want to move back in. The other third are in rental buildings.)
"When prices are rising, no one moves," Ms. Packes said. "When prices are falling, everyone moves."
Outside of Manhattan, in places like Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Park Slope, and Hoboken, N.J., rents can be as much 30 percent cheaper for comparable apartments, according to brokers.
Elsewhere, rents can fall even lower. "Rentals are pretty strong," said Jim Hayden, a independent broker in Flushing, Queens. "One bedrooms are going for $700 to $800 a month, two bedrooms for $850 to $1,000, depending on size and location."
Arnold Goldstein, president of Samson Management Corp.,Substantial numbers of rentals exist throughout New York City, not just in Manhattan. The market . I fyur talking n the bronmx, for insatnce and below reverdale not includingr everdale, and that pelhama parkeay, grand coucnsrse and pojt southe., ther is a rel amrket there becuse there whas been so much redevelopment around.

Why are rental apartments so expensive in New York? Supply and demand, basically. Though their numbers may be declining, there is still a steady stream of new arrivals to the city, many of them seeking rentals because they have no intention of staying more than a few years before moving elsewhere for career opportunities or to the suburbs to raise a family. The number of desirable apartments, however, is small, as there is little new construction going on these days, though there are a few buildings being built.
"There is a lot of talk going on but lot much is getting funding," Ms. Packes said. "A great deal of planning for new construction took place based upon the rent increases of 1993 and 1994, but the planning process still takes a good deal of time and only a few projects have begun construction."
The co-op conversions in the 1980's also diminished the size of rent-stabilized market and increased the demand for market-rent apartments. (It also, however, added a new supply of market-rent co-op apartments sub-leased by unit owners.)
More important, though, about 500,000 apartments in New York, about one-third of the city's total, have also been effectively removed from the market because of rent-regulation, which grants families the right to live in relatively inexpensive apartments.
Thus, many struggling New Yorkers arrive in Manhattan to learn that a 700-square-foot one-bedroom apartment will cost them $1,500 to $2,000 a month, but there are millionaires living in rentals three times larger in prime locations and paying about the same or even less. (Rent-controlled apartments are those built before 1947 that have been continuously occupied by a tenant, or a legal successor, since 1971. When rent-controlled apartments are vacated their rents rise to market level and they become rent stabilized. Apartments built between 1947 and 1974 are also rent-stabilized, which means that the rents are adjusted annually by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, which determines the permissable levels or rent increases for one and two-year leases, as well as any other adjustments, such as vacancy allowances, the increase in rent that's allowed when an apartment becomes vacant.)
The rent-regulation system, which remains in place largely because of the political clout of those who live in the apartments, was reformed slightly last year when the state deregulated apartments occupied by households earning $250,000 or more for two consecutive years in units with an authorized rent of at least $2,000 a month as of Oct. 1, 1993.
Even so, rent-regulation remains one of the biggest barriers to finding an decent rental in New York. Indeed, an article in The Economist recently noted that a poll of the members of the American Economic Association in 1992 found that 93.5 percent agreed that a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing. And economists rarely agree on anything.
"It's a factor, no doubt," Ms. Packes said. "There is no doubt that rent-regulation benefits a small number of people and makes the costs higher for a similar number of people."

HEADLINE: 2 Years After Windfall, a School Secures Its Role

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: HIGHTSTOWN

 BODY:
The ink wasn't quite dry on his diploma from the Peddie School in 1927 when Walter H. Annenberg, then a graduating senior, gave the prep school $17,000 to build a new track.
It wasn't his biggest gift to his alma mater -- not by a long shot -- but it was the earliest. Since then Mr. Annenberg, the publishing executive and former United States Ambassador to Britain, has given Peddie $140 million more, most notably a check for $100 million in 1993, the largest single donation ever to an independent secondary school. 
 Now, two years later, the fruits of Mr. Annenberg's philanthropy are taking shape at this five-year boarding and day school, which has shot from the back benches of private education to the front rows of the well-endowed elite like Andover, St. Paul's and Hotchkiss.
For starters, there has been a fivefold increase in applications since the Annenberg gift was announced 21 months ago -- many. school officials readily acknowledge, from families who in the past would have regarded Peddie as a virtuous but slightly shopworn entry in the private education sweepstakes.
But the intent behind the gift was not to turn Peddie into a school for bluebloods, said the headmaster, Thomas DeGray.
Rather, he said, a major part of the proceeds from the school's $117 million endowment will be used to subsidize talented students from families who could not otherwise afford the $20,750 annual cost of attending the 131-year-old school in central New Jersey.
As he spoke, students changing classes walked outside his corner office in Annenberg Hall to cross a broad green quadrangle toward the old library building, just a stroll from gleaming athletic and multimedia art centers and other structures built with previous Annenberg gifts.
"One of the huge challenges Peddie faces is to not be like so many private schools that pride themselves on being exclusive," said Mr. DeGray, who became headmaster six years ago.
Instead of family pedigree or even superior test scores, the school looks for "curiosity, excitement and willingness to learn" in its applicants, he added.
It is a policy subscribed to by other private schools. But harsh economic truths force most to accept the inane but wealthy student, along with the inspired one, to help pay the bills.
The difference today is that Peddie, thanks to the gift from Mr. Annenberg, can put his money where its principles are.
The only condition Mr. Annenberg placed on the gift was that $5 million a year was to be used to assist students and faculty members and not to put up new buildings. But his generosity frees up other funds that can be used for that purpose.
About $3 million a year from the endowment goes directly to scholarships, said Peter Quinn, admissions director. Forty-eight percent of some 300 boys and 200 girls (40 percent are day students) now receive financial aid that averages $13,000 a student per year, he noted. In the next school year 85 students will receive full academic scholarships, Mr. Quinn said.
Before the gift, 27 percent of the students were given annual scholarship grants averaging less than $10,000, he said.
Another $2 million a year is earmarked for other projects, including faculty raises that will lift average salaries of $28,000 by 8 to 12 percent over three years.
But most of this money is directed into an ambitious program to make the school one of the most technically advanced campuses in the nation. Thanks to earlier Annenberg gifts, the school was already moving in innovative ways to integrate computers and studies. The $100 million just speeded up the process.
Peddie, Mr. DeGray said with the smile of a lottery winner, has the best of both worlds: the appetite for innovation and the means to feed it.

HEADLINE: SCHOOLS;
2 Years After Windfall From Annenberg, School Secures Its Goals

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

DATELINE: HIGHTSTOWN

 BODY:
The ink wasn't quite dry on his diploma from the Peddie School in 1927 when Walter H. Annenberg, then a graduating senior, gave the prep school $17,000 to build a new track.
It wasn't his biggest gift to his alma mater -- not by a long shot -- but it was the earliest. Since then Mr. Annenberg, the publishing executive and former United States Ambassador to Britain, has given Peddie $140 million more, most notably a check for $100 million in 1993, the largest single donation ever given to an independent secondary school. 
 Now, two years later, the fruits of Mr. Annenberg's philanthropy are taking shape at this five-year boarding and day school, which has shot from the back benches of private education to the front rows of the well-endowed elite like Andover, St. Paul's and Hotchkiss.
For starters, there has been a fivefold increase in applications since the Annenberg gift was announced 21 months ago -- many, school officials readily acknowledge, from families who in the past would have regarded Peddie as a virtuous but slightly shopworn entry in the private-school sweepstakes.
But the intent behind the gift was not to change Peddie from a mix of students from different backgrounds into a school for bluebloods, said the headmaster, Thomas DeGray.
Rather, he said, a major part of the proceeds from the school's $117 million endowment will be used to subsidize talented students from families who could not otherwise afford the $20,750 annual cost of attending the 131-year-old school in central New Jersey.
As he spoke, students changing classes walked outside his corner office in Annenberg Hall to cross a broad green quadrangle toward the old library building, just a stroll from other structures built with previous Annenberg gifts.
"It is almost easier to identify what buildings on campus were not given by the ambassador," Mr. DeGray commented before returning to the subject of insuring that the school uses the money to invest in human resources and not more brick and mortar.
"One of the huge challenges Peddie faces is to not be like so many private schools that pride themselves on being exclusive," said Mr. DeGray, who became headmaster six years ago.
Instead of family pedigree or even superior test scores, the school looks for "curiosity, excitement and willingness to learn" in its applicants, he added.
It is a policy subscribed to by other private schools. But harsh economic truths force most to accept the inane but wealthy student, along with the inspired one, to help pay the bills.
The difference today is that Peddie, thanks to the gift from Mr. Annenberg, can put his money where its principles are.
The only condition Mr. Annenberg placed on the gift was that $5 million a year was to be used to assist students and faculty members and not to put up new buildings. But his generosity frees up other funds that can be used for that purpose, and the school has opened a campaign to raise more than $15 million from other alumni for capital improvements, including a $9 million student center, school officials said.
About $3 million a year from the endowment goes directly to scholarships, said Peter Quinn, admissions director. Forty-eight percent of some 300 boys and 200 girls (40 percent are day students) now receive financial aid that averages $13,000 a student per year, he noted. In the next school year 85 students will receive full academic scholarships, Mr. Quinn said.
Before the gift, some 27 percent of the students were given annual scholarship grants averaging less than $10,000, he said.
Another $2 million a year is earmarked for other projects, including faculty raises that will lift average salaries of $28,000 by 8 to 12 percent over three years.
But most of this money is directed into an ambitious program to make the school one of the most technically advanced campuses in the nation. Thanks to earlier Annenberg gifts, the school was already moving in innovative ways to integrate computers and studies. The $100 million just speeded up the process.
Peddie, Mr. DeGray said with the smile of a lottery winner, has the best of both worlds: the appetite for innovation and the means to feed it.
Unless the financial markets have another bad year. Peddie's endowment fund lost $500,000 in its portfolio of investments in 1994, he said, the smile chased by a sigh. "But fortunately," he said, "things have picked up, as have interest rates, and we expect a return of 8 to 10 percent for the foreseeable future."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
In This Fight for Schools, Tax Anger Took 2d Place

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON; Iver Peterson is the Trenton bureau chief of The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Why do we live here?
Some of us do because this is where our parents lived. Some of us were moved here by our employers. An awful lot of us moved here when the kids started coming and we had assembled the downpayment for a house in Bergenfield or Passaic or West Windsor. But dig deep enough into all the reasons people live where they do in New Jersey and you will find a common thread: We live here for the schools. 
 Tuesday's astonishing victory for local school budgets in 72 percent of the elections -- a year after barely half won approval -- will echo through the coming months of state budget votes, teacher contract negotiations and Assembly elections, because it gives us a pause from the notion that New Jersey is in revolt against taxes. The vote reminded everyone that when it comes to schools, New Jerseyans, angry or not, are still willing to pay.
People are used to thinking of New Jersey mostly as a vast, undifferentiated suburban landscape, but you could also say it is a vast school system. No other state can match New Jersey's ranking: top 10 nationally both on standardized tests and on the amount of money spent per pupil.
No doubt Governor Whitman and a lot of others wish our schools could act a little more like, say, North Dakota's, which keep costs low and scores high. Call them wasteful, call them unresponsive, but as Tuesday's large approval rate for local school budgets showed, an awful lot of people here are willing to pay the second-highest property taxes in the country to support their schools. (The highest? New Hampshire, but they don't have an income tax.)
As a result, the post-vote political debate now turns on what the approval rate means for Mrs. Whitman and her administration's war on school waste.
For Mrs. Whitman's adversaries on the issue of cutbacks in aid to education, the vote was a vindication. Voters, they reasoned, sent a clear signal to Trenton that while tax cuts are important, education is more important, perhaps even at the risk of higher local levies.
The school boards and teacher unions, who tend to be surprisingly like-minded considering they represent opposite sides of the bargaining table, agreed that the vote was proof of a shift away from the Governor's fiscal stringency. After all, they point out, last year's widespread rejection of school budgets -- only 51 percent were adopted -- was taken by the Governor herself as a warning to school boards that her message of fiscal frugality was getting through.
"Most voters were not misled by the administration's attempt to undermine public confidence on school operations," said Dennis Testa, president of the New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers union. A big victory for children, Mr. Testa added, although, as the Governor likes to remind us, less than half the money will ever reach the classrooms.
Across the state, superintendents who are barely on speaking terms with the Governor also called the vote a victory, while the School Boards Association called the vote a reminder to Mrs. Whitman to send them enough money to keep local property taxes from rising further.
How does the Whitman team take it? In stride. The Governor can easily say the high approval rate proves only that voters made their choices based on local concerns, which is what she has said she wanted all along. Had more budgets been defeated, however, the administration could have taken pride in spreading the notion of fiscal austerity. It's a wash.
It would be unfair to say that the Education Commissioner, Leo F. Klagholz, and the rest of the Whitman school team were disappointed in the voting, although a larger 'no' vote would have made their job of wringing the fluff out of the school system a little easier. And it would have thrown more rejected budgets into his office for final judgment.
Indeed, Dr. Klagholz is right to call the school vote a partial vindication of his policies. All school budgets operate under a state-imposed cap that limits the annual increase to a fixed percentage. Last year, that permissible increase was around 3.5 percent, and this year, the cap was lowered statewide by 1.5 percent. By definition, therefore, budget increases this year were smaller than last year's. And anyway, politics works best when both sides come away with something to cheer about.
But the school vote won't change the long-term direction of New Jersey fiscal policies, if only because the Governor cannot stray from the course she has set. Next year at this time, with her full 30 percent income tax cut in place and her national ambitions more sharply illuminated, the fight will be over her promise to limit the growth of state spending to the rate of inflation, which means tax cuts by another name.
With more cuts, it is likely that next year schools will get no more state aid, and probably less, than they did this year. And we will all get another chance to prove how much we love our schools.

HEADLINE: Big Risks, Big Losses, Big Fight

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va.

 BODY:
IT'S a long way from Wall Street to the narrow mountain roads leading here. But Morgan Stanley & Company knows the route all too well. The fanciest firm in finance, Morgan Stanley is embroiled in a messy lawsuit that boils down to one simple question: Who is to blame when state investment funds embrace risk and lose big -- the brokers who became rich on the state business or the state itself. The case, to be decided shortly by the State Supreme Court, has implications for Orange County, Calif., and other municipal finance calamities.
The case here began in 1983, when Kathryn M. Lester, a young secretary-turned-trader, was put in charge of West Virginia's $2.2 billion municipal investment fund. Supervising her were a flock of politically connected bosses, several of whom ended up discredited or in jail. Her formal training was in home economics, but with a mind for numbers and a stomach for aggressive trades, Ms. Lester quickly turned the sleepy fund into the most successful in the nation. She made billion-dollar bets and earned millions for her state, displaying a "Working Girl" savvy in her wheelings and dealings. 
 Her magic made West Virginia one of Morgan Stanley's prime accounts and turned the salesman who called on her, Michael G. Maher, into a rich man. The trading was active -- in one three-month period the volume of trades came to nearly $20 billion. In just one year Mr. Maher, then 32, took home $1 million, almost all from his dealings with Ms. Lester.
But this cozy relationship came to a crashing end in 1987. Interest rates shifted against Ms. Lester and pressure increased from her bosses to make continued high returns. As a result, she undertook bigger and dicier bets and Morgan Stanley helped by arranging a laundry list of highly risky, highly leveraged, highly complicated trades -- even lending the state millions so it could bet with money it did not have.
What was once a winning streak now turned sour and, when the losses were toted up, they came to $280 million -- a financial disaster that forced the state to raise new taxes, including a food tax that hit the poor the hardest.
"You've got the stupidity of a state agency versus the greed of Morgan Stanley," said Rudolph L. DiTrapano, a lawyer representing the state. But numerous interviews and an examination of thousands of pages of court documents show that there was greed on both sides and plenty of stupidity to go around. Some of the discredited political bosses were people Morgan Stanley relied upon for assurances that everything in West Virginia was on the up and up.
For the last six years, the two sides have battled in court, with Morgan Stanley flying platoons of executives and lawyers into the white-knuckle airport on a mountaintop near here. Court documents now number more than 6,000 pages and there have been more than 120 depositions.
Morgan Stanley lost the first round when a lower court ordered it to pay $56 million to the state. Next month, in an action being cheered on by the rest of Wall Street, the firm will ask the State Supreme Court here to overturn that ruling.
The dollars in the case are small by Orange County standards -- Merrill Lynch is being sued for $2 billion in that matter, a debacle that sent the California county into bankruptcy last December after losing about $1.7 billion in its highly leveraged investment pool. But the issues are so similar that West Virginia is being watched closely as a trial run.
What's more, the case here is coming to a head as hundreds of similar lawsuits are just being filed -- cases in which low-paid and, often, poorly trained state employees say greedy brokers led them astray with securities they did not understand.
"We're beginning to see the tip of the iceberg in these cases," said Dale Wainwright, a Houston lawyer who represents brokerage firms in these cases. "It's a question of who is responsible. Can a public fund shift the responsibility to someone else?"
West Virginia says yes. It claims that Morgan Stanley sold naive state officials speculative securities, knowing full well that West Virginia law barred them.
"Morgan Stanley is just like used car salesmen," said H. Craig Slaughter, the state's director of investments. "They don't think about truth and justice, just the American way of making money at any cost. Don't they have any reponsibility to their clients?"
Morgan Stanley says it did no wrong. It never acted as a financial adviser to the state, it maintains, serving instead simply as a middleman executing the state's trades. If any speculation took place, the firm argues in its court papers, it is the state that is liable.
Still, six other Wall Street firms that did business with the state, including Salomon Brothers and Goldman, Sachs, have paid $28 million to settle their involvement in the losses. And Morgan Stanley and the state also discussed a settlement. It was only when they couldn't agree on an amount that the dispute wound up in court.
Now, Morgan Stanley says it is standing on principle -- if it loses, it claims that Wall Street could be turned into a giant insurance policy. "This is our line in the sand," said Peter F. Karches, a Morgan managing director. "It's outrageous. It's like if people lose money, they can come and try to pick our pockets."
 
The Politicians
Financial Wizardry Or Ignorance?
Supervising Ms. Lester was a rogue's gallery of politicians. Her immediate boss, Brooklyn-born Arnold Margolin, was hailed as a financial whiz, but never worked as a trader. He went to prison in 1990 for lying about the losses and covering them up.
Next up the chain-of-command was the state's treasurer, A. James Manchin. A political fixture best known for judging beauty contests and leading parades, Mr. Manchin later testified that he did not even know that when a number was in parenthesis it was a loss. Others remember him referring to visits from "Stanley Morgan" and "the Salomon Brothers."
Mr. Manchin resigned from office in 1989 under threat of impeachment. He promoted the investment fund in a cascade of news releases and on a weekly radio show. Later, a state investigation found, he was siphoning from the fund for his own political operations. Today, Mr. Manchin admits, "math is not my long suit" and he travels the West Virginia countryside giving lectures on patriotism at local schools.
At the top of the political heap was former Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr., who headed the state's Board of Investments. He is now in prison for extortion, unrelated to this case.
In fact, this sordid tale of West Virginia politics has hurt the state in the court of public opinion. "We have an inferiority complex here," said Mr. DiTrapano, the state's lawyer. "We've always been victimized by corrupt and incompetent government officials, more so than by outsiders. We look back and see how fast we lost money in the fund. It was shocking and embarrassing. So a lot of people thought that we deserved it because we were dumb."
While the case pits the state against Morgan Stanley, both sides have focused on Ms. Lester, a plain-spoken native Midwesterner, in their arguments. The state has built its case by portraying Ms. Lester, now 42, as a naif. Morgan Stanley has argued that Ms. Lester was a sophisticated investor whose success was derailed by inept politicians.
Evidence introduced in court showed that Ms. Lester, who graduated from Michigan State University, was sometimes a keen trader, other times confused. Now a divorced mother of two, she was forced to resign from her $40,000-a-year job in November 1987 and has supported her family by managing a day care center and working as a paralegal.
Ms. Lester fell into finance almost by accident. While she and her former husband were living in Washington in 1981, Ms. Lester was hired as a secretary at the National Bank of Abu Dhabi there. The bank's computers were not programmed to carry trading positions, so she calculated them by hand. Soon, she was asked to be an assistant government bond trader.
"I've always loved math and I just took to it," said Ms. Lester in a recent interview. "I knew what they were talking about. It just made sense."
When her husband moved to Charleston in 1983 to work as a lawyer, she took a job in the state treasurer's office, in part because the regular hours allowed her to be home early with her infant son. Ms. Lester, then 30, thought she had landed her dream job. Since the director of investments knew nothing about bonds, she started to educate him and persuaded him to try to make money by trading small amounts, $5 million to $10 million. By the end of the year, the investment director resigned and she was appointed to succeed him to run the state's investment fund.
In quick order, she overhauled the department. She set up a trading desk with video stock quotes and direct telephone lines to brokerage houses. She encouraged salesmen from Wall Street to visit -- but only if they provided educational seminars for her staff. She swapped market information with traders at different firms and she talked on the speaker phone with top Wall Street economists like Henry Kaufman, Edward Yardeni and Allen Sinai.
In addition to buying and holding bonds, Ms. Lester actively traded part of the state's portfolio -- taking advantage of market volatility, or small daily price fluctations, to make money. But she did this with discipline: if a trade lost money, she would sell immediately and take the loss rather than hoping for a recovery. If a trade made money, she took profits and put some in a rainy day fund to cover future losses.
Mr. Lester's counterpart at Morgan was the young salesman, Mr. Maher, who was just about her age. A Georgetown University finance major, Mr. Maher is the son of a Manhattan textile executive and the grandson of a member of the New York Stock Exchange. While in college, he took a year off to work at Merrill Lynch.
In 1983, the same year Ms. Lester followed her husband to West Virginia, Mr. Maher started working as a bond salesman at Morgan Stanley. Eager for new clients, Mr. Maher started calling on Ms. Lester in 1985 and she began sending business his way. The two clicked, talking daily about their children and long bonds on a direct telephone line that linked her desk with his.
Given Ms. Lester's active hand, Mr. Maher had struck pay dirt. Soon, West Virginia became his No. 1 client, accounting for more than 90 percent of his business.
The account was so active that Morgan Stanley's volume of trades in Treasury notes with West Virginia was more than 10 times greater than with all other Government entities combined -- "it was a relatively big account for us," admits Mr. Karches, now head of the fixed-income division at the firm. (Mr. Maher did not respond to requests for an interview. Still at Morgan Stanley, he is now on a leave of absence that the firm says has nothing to do with the case.)
"We were earning incredible amounts of money," Ms. Lester said. "And I made Wall Street work hard. They wouldn't get our business unless they called us and gave us information. When volatility was high, we would be trading $100 million to $150 million a day and we were getting 4 to 5 percent more for our investors than banks. And as we increased the business, the guys got bigger that came down."
Today, the state's lawyers take swipes at Ms. Lester's close relationship with Wall Street. "All the women in the Treasurer's office loved it when these fancy guys came down and went to lunch with them," said Debra Hamilton, a lawyer for the state. "They did a lot to feed the ego of Kathy Lester and Arnie Margolin on what a great job they were doing."
West Virginia's fund became the top performing municipal investment fund in the nation -- a fact that Mr. Manchin, the state treasurer, trumpeted widely. Mr. Manchin also commanded an army of "field officers" who drove around the state convincing local muncipalities to invest, and promising more double-digit returns.
But by 1986 the markets weren't cooperating. Volatility was decreasing, which meant that to get the same returns, Ms. Lester had to trade in increasingly large amounts -- something she now says she was ordered to do by Mr. Margolin. In addition, Mr. Manchin started making low-interest loans to West Virginia businesses from the fund -- which put a drag on potential returns.
"I was told to trade in more size, more size," said Ms. Lester. "But I said that would be more risk. I was told that as long as I stuck to my discpline, everything would be fine. I was encouraged to take bigger and bigger positions. I didn't feel comfortable, but I felt that there was enough liquidity in the market to get out if we had to."
 
The Concerns
Executive in Firm Drops In for Visit
As trading in West Virginia increased, so did the concerns of some Morgan Stanley executives, primarily John J. Mack, then head of the fixed-income division and now the firm's president. The firm was in nasty litigation involving securities it had sold to Johns Hopkins University that the school later said it did not understand. Fearing a similar situation in West Virginia, Mr. Mack wanted a ground report. He ordered Mr. Karches, then Mr. Maher's boss, to fly down and meet with Mr. Margolin and Mr. Manchin.
Mr. Mack, fearing Ms. Lester might be trading without proper authorization, even cut off trades with the state for a few days in November 1986, until Mr. Karches could investigate. When he came back, Mr. Karches was impressed. "They told me they were big boys in West Virginia and had newspaper articles plastered on the wall to prove it," Mr. Karches said.
Mr. Karches was also warned that if Morgan Stanley didn't want to trade with the state, plenty of other Wall Street firms were eager to take up the slack. Mr. Karches now claims the threat "didn't hold much water with me."
Morgan Stanley says this trip was proper "due diligence." The state claims it was a whitewash. "It was really a cover-your-rear trip," said Mr. DiTrapano, the state's lawyer. "They came here wanting to be told that everything was O.K. so that they could continue trading. They were predisposed to see and hear what they wanted to hear. These guys weren't standing on principle when there was so much money to be made."
Based on Mr. Karches's glowing report, Morgan Stanley resumed business -- and in even bigger amounts. By the end of March, Ms. Lester made an extremely risky bet: She obligated the state to buy $1.5 billion in seven-year Treasury notes a few days before the notes were actually issued. The catch was that the state did not have the money to pay Morgan Stanley and other dealers. She was gambling that bond prices would rise by the time these securities were issued, and that the state could flip them for a quick profit.
But disaster struck. With the state on the hook for $1.5 billion, President Ronald Reagan announced trade sanctions against Japan on March 27, 1987. Japan responded by dumping seven-year notes on the market -- the exact ones the state was obligated to buy -- causing them to plummet in value.
Ms. Lester argued with Mr. Margolin and said the state should continue its trading discipline -- sell the $1.5 billion position and get out. This strategy would have cost the state about $22 million, which could easily be covered by the rainy day fund. But Mr. Lester said she was overruled by Mr. Margolin -- a point Mr. Margolin confirmed in a deposition. Mr. Margolin, believing bond prices would rebound, allowed her to sell only a third of her position. This left the state on the hook to buy $1 billion of the seven-year Treasuries -- with money it did not have.
So the state decided to borrow $550 million from Morgan Stanley using the Treasury securities as collateral. Ms. Lester had approached Salomon Brothers with the same deal, but it refused to touch it. Even though this information was relayed to Morgan Stanley -- which the state contends was a red flag -- Morgan Stanley still agreed to make the loan, which took the state far beyond its borrowing limitations.
In addition, Ms. Lester began in 1987 to dabble in the futures and options market with Morgan Stanley. In a celebrated audio tape played many times in the fraud trial, Ms. Lester appeared confused as to whether she was buying or selling an option -- Ms. Lester says today that she was just asking for a confirmation. These options, too, turned into money losers.
By April 1987, Morgan Stanley, seeing that the state's trading had become more erratic and undisciplined, cut off all business. This came after the company tried to get an exculpatory letter from the state's Attorney General saying that the trades it had made with the state were not speculative -- and the Attorney General refused. The following November, Ms. Lester was forced to resign.
"I have made skads of money for the salesmen at Morgan, I have made skads of money for the state," said Ms. Lester. "I feel that all I've done in life has been to make skads of money for other people."
 
The Liability
Challenging Award Of $32.6 Million
Morgan Stanley's appeal to the State Supreme Court asks for reversal of an unusual 1992 decision by Judge A. Andrew MacQueen of Kanawha County Circuit Court, who dismissed Morgan Stanley's case and ruled in favor of the state without holding a trial. He found Morgan liable to the tune of $32.6 million which, with statutory interest at 10 percent a year, brings Morgan's obligation to $56 million. Oral arguments are scheduled for May 10 before the State Supreme Court -- in West Virginia, there are no appeals courts between the circuit and the supreme courts.
"My decisions didn't have much to do with whether Kathy Lester was a successful investor or whether Morgan Stanley was trying to take advantage of her," Judge MacQueen said in an interview. "The state and Morgan Stanley together engaged in transactions prohibited by the law. You didn't have to find that Morgan Stanley did this for a bad purpose. Those transactions were prohibited and the beneficiaries of the fund, the citizens, are entitled to protection."
Morgan Stanley does take heart from another legal decision here, which it claims as a victory. One of the charges against Morgan Stanley -- that it committed fraud -- was split off from the main case and heard before a Charleston jury in 1992. After a 10-day trial, the jury found the firm guilty of "constructive fraud," which is essentially fraud without premeditation. But it levied minimal damages -- $4.9 million and not the $35 million sought by the state.
The state calls the verdict a "fluke," and Morgan Stanley is appealing it, too. Judge MacQueen presided over this case as well and remembers the costly razzle dazzle of Morgan Stanley: his courtroom was filled with a battery of television screens that carried a rolling text of taped audio conversations between Ms. Lester and the firm so the jury could easily follow them. "Oh, Lord, it was fancy," Judge MacQueen recalled.
Morgan Stanley's big challenge is to gain sympathy before a hometown crowd. Even Judge MacQueen commented from the bench that the money lost in the debacle belonged to him, too. So, in court, Morgan Stanley's lawyers made sure to point out that John W. Davis, the founder of Davis Polk & Wardwell, their New York law firm, was a West Virginian and the only one ever to have run for President. (He lost to Calvin Coolidge in 1924). And they exhorted the jury not to turn the state's motto, "Mountaineers will always be free" into "Mountaineers will always be freeloaders."
Still, the local peculiarities intruded. In midtrial, one juror, a religious fundamentalist, was dismissed after he told other jurors that Morgan Stanley was the embodiment of Satan since one of its documents had the number 666 on it -- in some minds, the number of the Devil.
The West Virginia Supreme Court is expected to decide the case this summer. In the first round of oral arguments, held last January, Morgan Stanley received a blistering attack from Chief Justice Richard Neely. A Yale law graduate, Justice Neely is a product liability expert and has long argued, ironically, that out-of-state defendants with deep pockets have an unfair disadvantage before hostile local courts. Justice Neely retired from the court on April 15, but may be recalled for this case.
Justice Neely, who called Mr. Manchin a "simpleton" from the bench, turned on Morgan Stanley and referred to audio tapes of Morgan employees talking about "getting caught." He said it was clear the investments Morgan Stanley sold the state were speculative.
"There is nothing you can say to convince me that this was not speculation," Justice Neely said from the bench. "This stuff is just for blow-dried Harvard Business School types who think they can beat the market.
"If you look at all of these telephone conversations," he told Morgan Stanley's lawyers, "you see that your people knew that these folks here were behaving like jackasses. They didn't understand when they would sell $100 million. They didn't know if they had sold a put or a call." The Morgan Stanley people, he added "went away shaking their heads." The brokerage firm, he concluded, "Sent guys down here to stroke these folks and blow smoke."
In New York, Morgan Stanley's in-house lawyer, Monroe Sonnenborn, is still optimistic. "We didn't do anything wrong," he said.

HEADLINE: For Sale: Corporate America's Big Blue Period

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
IN the glory days of I.B.M., when shirts were white and the ink was always black, there was the art collection. The founder, Thomas J. Watson Sr., gathered thousands of the finest paintings and hung them in offices worldwide, a sign of the company's lofty pedigree.
Now, I.B.M. has come down a peg or two, squeezing $6.5 billion out of its cost structure in the last three years alone and cutting staff by half in the last decade. And it is selling much of its art collection. 
 In a series of auctions scheduled to begin in May, Sotheby's will sell about 300 paintings, drawings and prints valued at about $25 million -- a token nod toward belt-tightening for a company that spends about $500 million a year on advertising alone. The collection goes on view at Sotheby's in Manhattan on Friday.
The most valuable I.B.M. holdings are in late 19th century and early 20th century American paintings and drawings, and some rare Latin American paintings, drawings and prints. Less significant is its small collection of contemporary art. There are blockbusters like Frank Weston Benson's "The Sisters," which Sotheby's expects to sell for $1.5 million to $2 million; Frida Kahlo's "Self-Portrait with Money and Parrot," expected to bring $2.5 million to $3 million, and Diego Rivera's "Dance in Tehuantepec," estimated to sell for $3 million to $4 million. These paintings are the sort that rarely come onto the market.
Only a handful of works are in this category. A surprising number of paintings, prints and drawings have prices of $100 and up. "There is also a lot available to the young collector in the $800 to $1,500 price range," said August Uribe, head of Sotheby's Latin American department in New York.
That the works come with the cachet conferred by I.B.M. and have been off the market for 50 years or so, experts say, adds to the appeal. While many of the best works have been lent to exhibitions, most of the art has been in storage for 30 years.
Not everything is a masterpiece. Some of the works have lower price tags for good reason: they may not represent an artist's best period, subject or medium.
Watson, who bought his first painting for $40 in 1902, was given to grand proclamations on art. "Art breaks the monotony of life, which is one thing the human mind cannot endure," he declared in 1936.
But Watson, who died in 1956, became a large figure in the art world. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him Commissioner General for the American section of the International Art Exposition in Paris. And by 1946, his company had acquired 30,000 pieces of American folk art, textiles, ceramics, prints, paintings and sculpture.
Big Blue had a sophisticated eye, paying $6,500 in 1943 for George Bellows's "Easter Snow (Easter Sunday)," which Sotheby's expects to auction for $1.5 million to $2 million. In 1945 it paid $3,000 for James A. McNeill Whistler's "The Shop," a watercolor expected to sell for $80,000 to $120,000. And for $4,000, the company snapped up John Singer Sargent's "A Waterfall," which now carries a price of $200,000 to $300,000.
"In any auction this large there will certainly be some buys," said Vance Jordan, a New York-based dealer of American art. "There are many things that are so rare you can't get them today."
American art -- paintings, watercolors, drawings and prints -- is the collection's biggest category and one of the most affordable. But many works have been in storage for decades and may be damaged.
Among the American watercolors, experts say, are significant works whose prices in the auction catalogue make them potential bargains. They include John Marin's "Near Taos, New Mexico," a 1930 work that Sotheby's has priced at $30,000 to $40,000. Experts say it may be overlooked in the auction, because collectors of Marin tend to prefer his New York subjects.
Enthusiastic bidders may want to go higher than the upper estimate, but beyond $50,000, experts say, they will not be getting a bargain. Whistler's "The Shop" is considered rare because it is larger and more elaborate than many of Whistler's watercolors of shopfronts. The Sotheby's estimate of $80,000 to $120,000 is low, art experts say, and the watercolor could bring $250,000 or more, if the work has not faded.
Everett Shinn's "The Bar at McSorley's" has a low estimate of $25,000 to $35,000. Painted in 1908, the subject of the watercolor is so popular that the selling price may exceed its high estimate, but paying more than $50,000 would be too much, experts say.
International Busoness Machines' American prints are also reasonably priced. Two of the rarest are Childe Hassam's "The White Kimono," estimated to sell for $10,000 to $15,000, and Marin's "Brooklyn Bridge and Lower Manhattan," expected to bring $10,000 to $12,000. Nancy Bialler of Sotheby's print department in New York said the estimates were reasonable and made sense for collectors who were starting out.
Other good buys include Thomas Hart Benton's "Fire in the Barnyard," which is expected to sell for $800 to $1,200. It is considered a rare image, so an auction price of less than $3,000 would be considered a real bargain. Edward Hopper's "Night Shadows," is an early impression of a famous image. Its auction estimate of $8,000 to $10,000 is considered sound. And a group consisting of three woodcuts and three etchings by Leonard Baskin, priced at $800 to $1,500, is something to consider.
Among the biggest bargains are probably the Latin American works, partly because many of the Latin American collectors who often dominate the bidding for the art from their region may be distracted by the political and economic turmoil there.
"In the area of Mexican prints, we have some icons priced around $1,000," Mr. Uribe of Sotheby's said. "And drawings by top-flight artists can be had for under $20,000. That's something you can't do in other fields." The reason, Mr. Uribe said, is that Latin American collectors often favor paintings over drawings, because many of them live in tropical climates in which works on paper do not survive well.
Mr. Uribe cited several important prints that were candidates for bargain sales, based on the estimated prices in the auction catalogue. Jose Chavez Morado's "Dance of Death," which depicts the day of the dead, a subject with a long history in Mexican art, is well priced at $800 to $1,200, though anything more would be too much, experts say.
But Jose Clemente Orozco's, "The Rear Guard," priced at $4,000 to $5,000, is considered by experts to be such a magnificent image that even at a price significantly higher than the upper estimate it would be a steal. The same is true for two prints by Jose Guadalupe Posada, "Calavera of the Zapatistas," a revolutionary image expected to sell for $2,000 to $3,000, and "The Female Dandy," priced at $1,000 to $1,500.
Buyers who know the market will probably be willing to pay far more than the high estimates. They will do the same for two prints by Rivera, each estimated to fetch $10,000 to $15,000. Both considered masterpieces, "Open Air School" is based on an 1926 mural from the Ministry of Public Education in Mexico City, and "Fruits of Labor" is a scene of children and peasants. Even a price as high as $25,000 would be considered good. And Rivera's "Zapata," will likely go for twice its estimate of $18,000 because experts consider the image so important.
Far less significant are I.B.M.'s contemporary prints. A group of works by Robert Rauschenberg, from his "Stoned Moon Series: Horn," is conservatively estimated at $2,500 to $3,500. More unusual is Ellsworth Kelly's "Nine Squares," which is expected to bring $6,000 to $8,000.

Bronx Firm's Winning Bid Travels Electronically
The HSM Software and Computer Company, a small minority-owned business in the northeast Bronx, recently won a $52,000 contract to provide New Jersey Transit with security designs for a new light rail transit system. The company bid on the contract electronically, after getting help from the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit agency known as Sobro. Two months ago Sobro started a program, Defense Diversification Using Electronic Commerce, in which experts go into small businesses in the Bronx to show employees how to bid electronically for Government contracts. By 1997, the Federal Government will require all government contractors to bid electronically.

HEADLINE: If Only There Was a Warren Buffett for Mutual Funds

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
YOU need more than $22,000 to buy a single share of Berkshire Hathaway, run by Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor. But a mere $1,000 will buy a stake in a copycat fund managed by one of Mr. Buffett's biggest fans.
Robert G. Hagstrom Jr., author of the best-seller "The Warren Buffet Way" (Wiley, 1994), plans to duplicate Mr. Buffett's investment strategy in Focus Trust, a mutual fund that came to market on Monday. 
 Make no mistake, though, fund investors will be betting on the ability of Mr. Hagstrom, not Mr. Buffett. The fund will not duplicate Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. Although he has never met Mr. Buffett -- only talked with him on the telephone -- Mr. Hagstrom seems anything but daunted by investors' great expectations and his own modest experience.
Mr. Hagstrom, 38, has been managing money only since 1989. He joined Lloyd, Leith & Sawin, which handles $105 million in assets for 90 Philadelphia families, in 1991, after working as a portfolio manager for First Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia. Before that, he was a stock broker.
Now, he speaks as though he has found the holy grail of investing. Reduced to its simplest terms, the Buffett way is to value a business that you understand, pay a sensible price for the stock and then hold on to it.
"Most mutual fund managers go outside their circle of competence," Mr. Hagstrom said, meaning they invest in businesses they do not understand. By sticking to a few companies he knows well, Mr. Hagstrom expects to avoid what he calls mediocre performance in most of the fund industry.
Copying great investors is hardly a new idea. A venture called Wealth Monitors tried the approach in the mid-1980's, buying stocks owned by famous managers like Mr. Buffett and the Bass brothers. But Wealth Monitors "didn't buy all of them, just some, and it turned out that they picked the wrong ones," said John Rekenthaler, editor of The Five-Star Investor, an investment newsletter from Morningstar Inc., the fund research company in Chicago. The fund folded after five years.
More successful has been the Sequoia fund, created from a Buffett partnership in 1970. Sequoia has returned 18.6 percent annually to investors for the 15 years ended in March, compared with 13.77 percent for all equity funds, Morningstar said. Dazzled investors will have to look elsewhere, though, since the fund closed in 1982.
"In an industry that prides itself on mimicking, I don't know why no one came out with a Sequoia II," Mr. Hagstrom said.
Sequoia's success is no mystery. Berkshire Hathaway is its largest holding, accounting for just over 27 percent of its $1.7 billion in assets.
Will Focus Trust consider buying Berkshire Hathaway stock? "At the right price, yes," Mr. Hagstrom said, declining to be more specific. The problem is that the stock price has run up about 10 percent this year -- far more than the company's components -- in a feat attributed largely to the popularity of, you guessed it, Mr. Hagstrom's book.
Not all the companies owned by Berkshire Hathaway are good values either, he said. The prospects for Geico, the insurance concern, are not as dynamic as they were when Mr. Buffett bought the stock, Mr. Hagstrom explained. Nor does he care for commercial banks, like Wells Fargo.
Focus Trust has no sales charge, but expenses are quite high. Initially, the expense ratio is pegged at 1.75 percent of assets. That estimate is based on a $25 million fund, but the ever-optimistic Mr. Hagstrom figures it should fall to roughly 1 percent if the fund reaches $100 million -- quite a leap from its initial $120,000.
The seven guiding tenets of the fund are outlined in a page of its prospectus labeled "Investment Adviser -- Shareholder Principles." Three are of particular significance:
* Management considers that they are partners with the shareholders and will invest in the fund.
Mr. Hagstrom says that all the principals in his Philadelphia firm own shares, and some have substantial amounts. As the manager of the fund, Mr. Hagstrom said that he would invest all his equity in it.
* The fund will invest in a few outstanding businesses that have favorable long-term prospects, and are available at sensible prices.
Like Mr. Buffett, Mr. Hagstrom plans to create a concentrated portfolio and to hold his stocks for long periods.
"There are a lot of bright stock pickers, but they're reverting to the mean by owning so many stocks," he said. "Can you understand and value 100 companies annually? If you can, I tip my hat to you."
Mr. Hagstrom expects to own 12 to 15 stocks. Few mutual funds make such bold bets. Among the 1,509 funds tracked by Morningstar, only 24 own fewer than 20 securities. Mr. Hagstrom admits that the failure of one stock would have a bigger impact on Focus Trust than on a more diversified portfolio, but he emphasizes that he will buy strong companies.
* The fund is not interested in constantly buying and selling mediocre businesses where economic gain depends more on profiting from short-term price swings.
Mr. Hagstrom estimates the fund's turnover at 25 percent a year, adding that the figure was a compromise with his lawyers, who would not let him go lower. "If I make mistakes with 2 or 3 out of 12 holdings each year, that's the turnover you get," he said. "I can't imagine that I'd make that many bad calls."
He wants shareholders to buy for the long term. "I'd rather have a smaller fund with more responsible, long-term shareholders than a larger group of shareholders that are constantly buying and selling based on short-term performance," he said.
Focus Trust will levy a redemption fee, equal to 2 percent for people who sell their shares within one year of purchase and 1 percent for sales in the second year.
Simple as Mr. Buffet's investing strategy may sound, there is no guarantee Focus Trust will prove to be a Sequoia II.

HEADLINE: Even Now, There's Money to Be Made in Japan

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
MUTUAL fund investors would be hard pressed to find a more contrarian bet than Japan. The Japanese economy is in serious trouble, in part because the soaring yen makes its goods so expensive in falling dollars.
But after a devastating first quarter, a number of portfolio managers and investors have started creeping back into Japanese equities. And so far, the wager has paid off. 
 The bellwether Nikkei 225 index, which fell more than 18 percent in the first three months of 1995, has risen 5.1 percent this month. To some, that looks like a classic example of what the trade calls a "dead cat bounce" -- a reaction to the fall, not a sign of life. But other signs point to renewed interest in Japan as well.
Three weeks ago -- for the first time this year -- investors put in more money than they withdrew from the five largest Japan stock funds, according to AMG Data Services, a fund research company in Arcata, Calif. Last week, a four-week moving average showed $2.7 million in new cash, double the amount a week earlier, for those funds.
Some managers are also encouraged by technical analysis, which uses charts of previous performance to predict future stock prices. Several times in the last three years, the Nikkei average has fallen close to 15,000, as it did in late March, and then rebounded sharply, gaining 20 to 30 percent over the next two quarters.
"The Japanese market offers the opportunity for a very profitable move over the next six to nine months," said Charles E. Cain, president of Cain Asset Management, a New York money manager who specializes in picking mutual funds for clients.
One mutual fund that's been buying in Japan is Merrill Lynch Pacific. "As the Japanese stock market has dropped, we've been adding to our position all year," said Steve Silverman, manager of the fund, which carries a 5.25 percent sales charge. It now has 65 percent of its $1.5 billion in assets in Japan, up from 56 percent at the start of the year. The fund, up 0.9 percent this year, doesn't try to predict the market's overall direction. However, Mr. Silverman said, "We're finding a lot of individual companies that look like great values."
Japanese funds have moved higher this month in large part because of the falling dollar. The Japan Fund, which is the largest of the group specializing in Japan with $487 million in assets, has risen 3.9 percent, to $9.39 a share. To the extent that mutual funds investing in Japan don't hedge their currency risk, American investors benefit from a stronger yen and a weaker dollar.
The opposite, of course, is also true, which explains the vast difference in performance among the nine Japanese funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services, a funds research company. For the year through Thursday, the tiny Wright Equifund-Japanese, whose $9.7 million in assets aren't hedged against currency effects, gained 0.7 percent. Warburg Pincus Japan did hedge its $24.5 million in assets -- and declined 21.3 percent through Thursday. (Both funds are too small to appear in this newspaper's daily mutual fund listings.)
If the currency trend reverses, as it showed signs of doing last week, the top and bottom performers could switch places, because the funds that hedge would benefit. The stock market also stands to benefit from a weaker yen, since the Japanese economy is dependent on sales of its products abroad.
"What's caused the Japanese funds to rise so far this month -- the strength of the yen -- is negative for the stock market," Mr. Cain said. "If the yen stabilizes or comes down, in the long run that will be good for Japanese stocks. I'm inclined to believe that will happen."
The technical signs are promising for the Nikkei index, Mr. Cain said. The Nikkei average's weekly closing prices have ranged from about 15,000 to 21,000 for nearly three years. Each time the index has fallen sharply and hit the lower level, it has rebounded, reaching the upper limit within several months.
The recent strength could be setting the stage for an upward move in the Nikkei average of 20 percent to 30 percent by the end of the year.
To take advantage of that possibility, Mr. Cain said he is considering buying some Japanese specialty funds. "A well diversified position within a portfolio would measure about 15 to 25 percent" of assets, he said.
Of course, the yen might continue to strengthen, the Japanese economy might slump further and the Nikkei average could fall below 14,500, the level it last visited in August 1992.
Some international specialists consider that more than a mere possibility. David Herro, portfolio manager of the $877 million Oakmark International fund, has no assets in Japan, and doesn't plan to start investing there anytime soon.
"If anything, the fundamentals in Japan are getting worse instead of better," Mr. Herro said. While interest rates might appear to be almost as low as they can go -- the Bank of Japan lowered its discount rate to 1 percent recently -- Mr. Herro said that because Japan is in a deflationary cycle, real interest rates are two to three percentage points higher. "That's not as low as one might expect for this economy," he said.
Mr. Herro predicted that the Japanese economy must go through much more fundamental restructuring before it can strengthen significantly. "The stock market is off 50 percent from its highs, but that was an inflated high," he said. "It's still overvalued by 20 percent to 40 percent."
Clearly, Japan has serious economic problems that aren't likely to be solved in a few months. But with pessimism about Japan so widespread and the Nikkei average down so far this year, some money managers see immediate promise in a few sectors of the Japanese economy.
About 27 percent of Franklin Pacific Growth fund's $51 million in assets is invested in Japan. William Howard, the portfolio manager, owns companies that should hold up relatively well in a slow or declining economy and that he expects to do well in the next five years. He likes East Japan Railway, a passenger rail company; Mitsubishi Oil, a refiner that's exploring for oil off the coast of Vietnam, and Nippon Telephone and Telegraph.
Mr. Silverman, manager of the Merrill Pacific fund, favors Ito-Yokado, a big retailer. While many economists cite a reluctance by Japanese consumers to spend as a reason for the faltering economy, Mr. Silverman said, "If people are going to shop, they're going to shop at Ito-Yokado."
He also disputes the notion that Japanese companies can't change, noting that Ito-Yokado owns Southland Corporation, the United States parent of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain. "Everybody says the Japanese can't restructure," Mr. Silverman said, "but they've done a great job of restructuring Southland."

Late Late Show, Low Low Price, Big Big Guards

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
Sure, the city that never sleeps. But can you go see a first-run movie at 2 A.M.?
Well, yes, actually. A 42d Street theater has been offering a "super late show." 
 Wedged between a video sex shop and the shuttered Empire theater at 244 West 42d Street, the Movieplex 42 has managed in the last year to build a regular following for its late late show on Friday and Saturday nights, sometimes selling out first-run flicks that have begun as late as 3 A.M.
"They're coming from all over, hanging, chilling out after from the club," said Steve Oden, 26, a security guard at the theater. "Friday night you get a lot of teens out clubbing, but Saturday is more laid back, with lots of couples."
Scott Wexler, controller for the six-screen Movieplex 42, which in previous incarnations had run kung fu and adult films, said the theater fills a void. "We felt there was a need for it," Mr. Wexler said. "People in New York stay up late."
In addition to its insomnia-friendly hours, the Movieplex attracts customers with low prices ($6 compared with the usual $8) and, once they are inside, lets them slip from one theater to the next, a kind of do-it-yourself double feature.
"I appreciate the hours," said Aaron Garrett, 33, of Harlem, who has been going to the theater for about three months, generally after working 12- to 15-hour shifts at the Harlem Music Hut. "But it's also a painful economic situation. It's only a little difference, but I can use the money."
The late late show resonates for old New York movie buffs like Andrew Sarris, the film critic, who recalls the glory days of 42d Street movie palaces during the 1940's and 50's. "Times Square was always an all-night place," Mr. Sarris said. He said he once watched 11 straight movies in a Times Square all-night movie house.
Industry trend-watchers don't see the super late show becoming a national phenomenon. They say the appeal is special to Times Square.
Pete Gotthold, district manager of United Artists Theater Circuit Inc., the 2d largest theater chain in the country, is impressed by the crowds at Movieplex's late late show. "But I don't see it catching on," he said. "If it'll work anywhere, it's Times Square."
Stephen Farber, film critic for Movieline magazine, based in Los Angeles, and author of several books on the movie industry, said he knew of no 2 A.M. movies in L.A. "It's an interesting idea that some theaters might try to tap into that underground audience," he said, though he said he doubted theaters in Los Angeles would follow the lead. "You can't even find something to eat here after 10 P.M."
Security is tight at the Movieplex, though the most serious problems usually involve cigarettes. "If you got 'em, don't smoke 'em" is a running reminder from the five-man security force, which roams the theater. "Show some respect," announces Samson Supreme Ware, a towering security guard who got his job after attending the late late show so steadily that he got to know the theater's staff. "There's kids in the audience."
That may be a reach considering the hour (you can catch the audience yawning and stretching a lot) but the crowd is young enough to engage in the traditional movie rites of spring. Ty Abbensetts, 25, and his two pals, Ralph (Polo) Harrell, 28, of Washington Heights and Billy Mimms, 24, of Brooklyn, have been going to the late late movie for about three months to meet girls.
"The later the movie, the better," said Mr. Abbensetts, eyeing the crowd by the popcorn stand. "Everything else is closed, and dull, and you can hang at home, but it's better around here. People like to hang.
"Sometimes," he added, laughing, "you come solo and you leave with company." JESSE McKINLEY

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ferrari 456GT and F355 Berlinetta;
Ever Exotic, but Less Eccentric

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

DATELINE: SANTA BARBARA, Calif.

 BODY:
IT can't be all fun and games managing Automobili Ferrari these days. Sure, you still get to drive fast cars where nobody worries about speed limits. And, no doubt, you can still work in a few long lunches to discuss the merits of Nicasil-coated cylinder liners and ZF Servotronic variable-assist steering over fresh porcini and aged Barolo. But no longer is every Ferrari the factory makes sold before it reaches the showroom floor.
Too many Italians, it seems, now regard expensive sports cars as symbols of political scandal. And too many Americans with money to burn would rather be seen in Range Rovers. 
 Yet more devastating, car collectors have been singed by the hot winds of deflation. While rare models from the 1950's and 1960's still fetch millions of dollars, newly minted exotic cars are just as likely to depreciate under their dust covers.
Ferrari, which is now owned by Fiat, has responded with a flexibility that would make the business school gurus proud. To compete more effectively with other sports cars -- notably the high-end Porsches -- it is aiming at a variety of niche markets and it is promoting amateur racing in Europe. And to keep the faith with collectors without restricting total sales, it is putting out more models in shorter production runs.
Most important, Ferrari is embracing up-to-date technology -- anti-lock brakes, air bags and computerized suspensions -- to make cars that are almost as easy and safe to drive as they are nice to eyeball. Indeed two Ferraris introduced in the American market in the last year are probably the best-handling and best-mannered road cars Ferrari has ever built.
Start with the $225,000 456GT, the first Ferrari with a back seat -- albeit one best suited for the vertically challenged -- since 1985.
The 456GT looks like more a luxury coupe than a sports car, stretching as long as an E-Class Mercedes sedan and weighing considerably more. The luxury feel is reinforced by the interior, with its wide, electrically adjustable front seats and comfort features that might have been borrowed from the 7-series BMW.
Wait, there's more unusual news: this Ferrari behaves in traffic. You probably wouldn't think of driving the 456GT to the supermarket, but you could. The 5.5-liter, 12-cylinder engine, which produces 436 horsepower and offers adequate torque at very low r.p.m., is built to run in third gear without complaint at 40 miles an hour. And thanks to a conservative layout with the engine up front, the 456GT runs quietly enough to hear the compact disk player.
But the real appeal -- what makes it a Ferrari rather than a BMW dressed by Armani -- is the 456GT's explosive acceleration and extraordinary handling at high speed. Tromp on the throttle from a standstill, shift cleanly into second at around 6,000 r.p.m. and you'll reach 60 in about 5 seconds. Better yet, get behind a Sunday driver on a steep uphill grade, downshift to second, floor it, and feel the 456GT respond like an Indy car.
The sheer mass of the 456GT ought to make it a pain to maneuver on curves. It ought to, but doesn't: the sophisticated steering, oversized Pirelli P Zero tires and computer-controlled hydraulic shock absorbers provide an uncanny sense that this car could take 30- mile-an-hour hairpin turns at 70.
While the front-engine 456GT is positioned as the ultimate "grand touring" car, the F355 is aimed at those yearning for the experience of racing without setting wheel to track. This gorgeous little sports car is pure testosterone -- a guided missile that proves Ferrari can match the technology of Porsche and Acura in an "entry level" vehicle costing $130,000.
The V8 engine, positioned in front of the huge 18-inch rear wheels, displaces just 3.5 liters and weighs only 370 pounds. But the high-compression, five-valve-per-cylinder design, along with the use of titanium in highly stressed parts, permits it to shove enough air and gasoline through the combustion chambers to develop 375 horsepower without benefit of a turbocharger.
With a computerized suspension similar to the 456GT's and a half-ton less weight to lug around, the F355 performs like a pair of wings. It is a bit faster than the 456GT below triple-digit speeds, and it feels much faster because the driver sits just a few inches from the ground.
The F355 is also inviting to those with little experience driving exotic cars. Like all Ferraris, it has a stiff clutch, close-set pedals and a steel-gated gearbox to remind owners of Ferrari's racing heritage. But this is a forgiving version of the venerable six-speed transmission, one that can be moved crisply between gears after just a few minutes' practice.
Those who care to find fault with these cars, particularly with the 456GT, won't have far to look. The interior fit and finish of the big Ferrari are not up to the standards of Mercedes or Lexus. The controls are clunky compared with a Porsche's. And while both Ferraris are magnificent road machines, no straightforward comparison of price to performance would put either in the "best buy" class.
But there is nothing straightforward about the appeal of Ferraris. These two models look great and sound better. And unlike many of their predecessors, they have been designed to provide extraordinary thrills to ordinary drivers.
 
INSIDE TRACK: Ferraris aren't getting cheaper, but they're sure getting better.

HEADLINE: How I Got My Child Into Nursery School

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
ONE evening last December, I found myself sitting on the floor of the West Side Montessori School gymnasium with 50 other mothers and fathers, gathering survival tips for one of the most notorious passages of Manhattan parenthood.
We were deep into the annual nursery-school hunting season (September through March). The school's director was offering advice on getting through the preschool admissions process with our self-respect intact. 
"You are the consumers," she insisted, as we sat there like 3-year-olds, twitching and squirming and rearranging our legs. "I know you probably don't feel like it, but you are in charge of making the match."
Yes, indeed -- in charge was not exactly what we were feeling. Nor is "consumer" the first word that comes to mind when one contemplates the role of parent in the arcane process of landing a child in certain Manhattan nursery schools.
The very mention of the exercise evokes exaggerated shudders. People roll their eyes in hyperbolic disgust and launch into the kind of horror stories normally inspired by terms like "co-op board," "jury duty" and "D.M.V."
In the popular imagination, the preschool sweepstakes has come to embody almost everything uptight and irritating about Manhattan: snobbery, competition, money, pathological ambition, misplaced notions of status.
For here you can find hundreds of families scrambling for scarce spots in schools where their children may spend no more than 15 hours a week but that charge as much as $9,600, a figure that will go up the next year.
The standard advice is to apply to a half-dozen schools. But finding those schools may require investigating 8 or 10. That takes time and money: some schools want an application fee of as much as $50 before you set foot in the door.
And in the end, it is the schools that do the bulk of the choosing. Their decisions arrive in the mail on the same fateful March day. The drill is sickeningly familiar: fat envelope, good; skinny envelope, bad.
The entire business is all the more painful because children are involved. They are being judged -- or are being judged through their parents. Parents stumble through, wondering, "If we fall short, will our child pay the price?"
"It's the most humiliating part of living in Manhattan," a friend assured me matter-of-factly as I embarked upon the search last fall. I'd been in New York long enough to know that she was saying a lot.
Now that it's over, I have learned a few things. Some would have been nice to know in advance. Maybe then I would have felt a little more like a smart shopper. (In charge? Dream on.)
I have learned that nursery schools differ in distinct ways. They come in all shapes, sizes and philosophical stripes. Some left me dazzled, some depressed. The longer I looked, the clearer the differences became.
I believe it can matter where a child goes. Not all schools are equally suited to all children. Maybe some children flourish anywhere, but others may be happier and more stimulated in one environment than in another.
But I've also learned it may be impossible to make well-informed decisions. Reliable, unbiased information is scarce. You get only a glimpse of most schools. You rarely meet the person who would teach your child.
And of course, the decision will probably not be yours. "Have you chosen a school?" people kept asking me. But I wasn't the chooser, I kept thinking. I was just vying to become one of the chosen.
I did find the process less appalling than people had said. It seemed more rational, less of a free-for-all. The hysteria seemed to emanate less from school administrators than from parents plotting to win them over.
I also know that the nursery-school frenzy is not exclusive to New York. In Los Angeles, some people sign their children up at birth. Here, there are many good schools to consider; some cities have two or three. But in the end, I am left feeling that the outcomes are unfathomable. After six months of applications, interviews and comparing notes, I remain mystified about how New York City preschools really decide whom they're going to admit.
Administrators say they look for a balance of sexes, ages, skills and backgrounds -- in short, a sympathetic mix of pupils and families. But how do they measure skills and compatibility with so little exposure to parent or child?
Skeptics say the schools go by the parents -- where they went to college, whom they know, what they do, how much they make. But few of the many schools that I looked at ever tried to explore most of those things.
When it was over, I heard of children being rejected by schools that their parents had considered fallbacks, welcomed by ones assumed impossible to get into, turned down where their families had pull and accepted where they had none.
So why go through it?
 
A Toe in the Water: The Initial Briefing
 In my case, my daughter will soon turn 3. She seemed, to my husband and me, to be ready to graduate from her current routine -- classes and play dates with nanny in tow -- to something more challenging. Like, say, school.
We didn't want to be negligent parents. In two more years, she would be kindergarten bound. Within limits, it seemed smart to help prepare her to make the leap -- preferably into the school of our choice.
But having decided that, we knew nothing about nursery schools. In Manhattan alone, there are at least 175 privately run preschool programs, dozens of them within walking distance of our apartment on the Upper West Side.
An added problem was that we were planning to move -- to somewhere else in Manhattan, but we didn't know where. To cover our bases, we decided to look at schools on both sides of Central Park, in case we ended up moving across town.
So my first foray into the field was to a forum on preschool admissions held by the Parents League of New York at which four preschool administrators patiently gave some 100 tightly wound parents a preview of what was in store.
We convened in the auditorium of an East Side private school at 9:30 A.M. The audience was dressed for work and left the fearsome impression that they were intending to confront this problem as they would any other corporate merger.
The speakers hashed out the question of what age to send a child, how to start looking in your neighborhood and work your way farther afield, when to contact schools, what to look for on a tour.
Start applying a full year before your child is to begin school, they said. Call each school the day or week after Labor Day. Ask about age-cutoff dates, application fees, tuition. Then ask to have application materials sent.
When touring a school, ask how it handles "separation" problems, they suggested. Ask about teachers' credentials, drop-in visits by parents, toilet training, religious holidays, the length of the school day.
Under cross-examination from parents, the administrators flatly denied the "feeder-school theory": that certain nursery schools feed into certain exclusive kindergartens and grade schools. They insisted that grade-school classes were made up of graduates of dozens of preschools.
"Beware of advice from friends," a Parents League organizer warned. Seek out "neutral, appropriate information." Shun "park-bench rumor" skewed by other people's limited experiences and preconceptions.
Armed with that advice, off we went.
 
The Continuing Search For 'Neutral Sources'
 Unfortunately, neutral sources turned out to be hard to come by. Gossip is a hot commodity among fretful parents. All parents have biases based in part on their own upbringings, and school administrators are advocates for their own schools.
The Independent Schools Admissions Association of Greater New York publishes a directory that describes all of its member schools, but the information offered comes from each school itself.
Another book, "The Manhattan Directory of Private Nursery Schools," by Linda Faulhaber (Soho Press, 1995; $20) goes only slightly further. And "The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools," by Catherine Hausman and Victoria Goldman (Soho Press, 1994; $22), while more opinionated, concentrates on grade schools.
So after reading the books and talking to friends and friends of friends, I went to one other seminar, this one conducted by Barbara Katz, the assistant director of the Parenting Center at the 92d Street Y.
Though the 92d Street Y has its own nursery school, Ms. Katz was as close as I came to a source of "neutral, appropriate information." She led the audience through the preschool maze. But she also said more.
She offered a number of remarkable observations and pieces of advice -- remarkable not only for what they revealed about schools but also for what they revealed about parents.
* Don't be rude to the secretary. It won't be forgotten.
* Don't send your nanny on the interview with your child. "That happens all the time," she said. "They're not impressed."
* It's wrong to contribute to a school in hopes of getting in.
* Don't let the process change your opinion of your child.
* Remember whom all this effort is for. (Wrong answer: Your ego.)
* If you love one school, it might help to write and tell them. But never send those letters to multiple schools. "Word gets around these schools," Ms. Katz warned cryptically. "They talk."
Were we to conclude that we were up against some sort of nursery-school cartel? Was she suggesting that schools conspired? It was a weird feeling, the dawning of the sensation that I would never understand the rules of the game.
 
 
At the Battle Station: The Countdown Begins
 Labor Day loomed. At the top of the page marked Tuesday, Sept. 6 in my calendar was scrawled the injunction "CALL SCHOOLS!" At 9:01 A.M., I started dialing the dozen or so schools on my tentative list.
Some answered immediately and said they would send their materials. Other lines were perpetually busy. Some had messages saying to call on Thursday. At one school, a woman's voice barked: "Call back in October. You're too early."
By late morning, I was feeling a little like an unemployed actor trying to drum up a theatrical agent over the phone, making cold calls to beg them to consider my 8-by-10 glossies and my curriculum vitae.
But within a week or two, application packets started arriving. They ranged from a glossy magazine with the look of a corporation's annual report to a one-page brochure decorated with a student's stick-figure portrait of herself.
The Bank Street School for Children, near Columbia University, sent a 20-page booklet, a four-page application, an invitation to one of five open houses, the tuition schedule and an explanation of the $1,000 interest-free loan required of every new family.
The package from the Horace Mann School for Nursery Years was dominated by a spiffy color brochure for its main school that noted, "Our distinguished alumni consistently excel, often reaching the pinnacles of their professions and sometimes making history."
What to think? Did a glossy magazine mean a school was well run -- or squandering money on self-promotion? Was I supposed to have been thinking about positioning my 2 1/2-year-old to make history?
The content, in some cases, was even more baffling.
Some brochures talked vaguely about a "child-oriented curriculum" and "learning through experience." Some alluded to the "balance between freedom and structure" or a "structured yet flexible setting."
It was a new language, dense with buzzwords that seem to have meaning to those steeped in early-childhood education but that would come to be significant to a rube like me only after repeat exposure.
In other areas, however, the differences were stark. For a 3-year-old child attending school five half-days a week, tuitions ranged from about $5,000 to nearly $10,000. Application fees ranged from $30 to $50.
One school would require attendance at a weekly chapel service. Others celebrated Christmas and Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. Most were nonprofit, some profit-making. Some would give preference to members of their affiliated churches.
Quite a few required that I file an application and send in my check before I could make an appointment to tour the school. Others would let me see the school first, then decide whether I still wanted to apply. Some offered to waive the fee for financial-aid applicants.
The applications were mostly one-page questionnaires: child's name, date of birth, health status, parents' address, employers. Only one of more than a dozen asked where my husband and I had gone to college.
A few were more elaborate. A school called the Ark, on East 79th Street, wanted a short essay describing our child's personality, strengths and weaknesses, "what you like best about your child" and what we expected from a preschool.
Christ Church Day School, on Park Avenue, had distributed its quota of applications by the time I got through. So it sent a "wait-list application." It might or might not be "activated," depending on how many people applied. In the upper left-hand corner were the words: "Family Photo: Please Attach."
 
 
Stage Two: Embarking On the Grand Tour
 In early October, I began touring. In most cases, the tours lasted about an hour. I was usually part of a group of a half-dozen to a dozen parents who were shown around by an administrator and given a chance to talk to the director.
At a few schools, the tours were one-on-one. One school had a large open house, complete with wine and cheese. About 100 parents heard presentations, then toured the building. No children were in view.
At another open house, the director warned us about sibling preference. So many siblings of students had applied in the previous year they had filled the entire morning program. Only afternoon slots were left.
In some ways, the schools seemed to have a lot in common. Class sizes and student-teacher ratios are set by the city. The classrooms were well stocked with art supplies, blocks, dress-up clothes, Legos and other toys of that ilk.
But upon examination, philosophical and other differences emerged. Some were quite traditional and structured. Some used Montessori methods. A few looked like giant playrooms presided over by their idiosyncratic directors.
One school had a spectacular gym that a very active child might love. Some had pets, others didn't. One school with no outdoor play area escorted the children to Central Park -- but not to the park's playgrounds (too chaotic).
Some had big libraries. Some expected parents to be actively involved in raising money -- which, in one case, went to support an impressive financial-aid program that had made the school one of the few that was truly diverse.
At one school, we were shown a class of 3-year-olds seated in tiny chairs as the teacher called on them one by one. We passed by again 15 minutes later. The children appeared not to have moved.
How did that school handle separation? Simple, the director explained: parents said goodbye at the front door. If a child balked? The crying stopped, she assured us, by the time the child got to class.
One administrator estimated that 95 percent of the students came from two-career homes. At another school, the ratio was about 50-50.
The mothers in evidence at one school seemed to be in uniform: velvet headbands, patent-leather flats. I left that school in a cold sweat from the horror of being trapped in a world from which I like to believe I have escaped. If my daughter were to go there, would she end up in velvet headbands, too?
 
 
The Cold Season Comes, And With It, Audition Time
 Winter arrived. All but one of the seven schools that we had decided to apply to required an "interview" with my daughter. In most cases, she was to come play at the school for a half-hour with a few other children.
At the first interview, the director led three children and three mothers into a small classroom full of toys, then appeared to barely notice the children while she engaged the mothers in conversation.
At the next interview, the six to eight parents were corralled along the wall, where they crouched on a row of small chairs and were ignored by two rather formidable teachers who led the children through various puzzles, art projects and games. The atmosphere there seemed stern.
At other places, it was cheerful. At one school, eight applicants charged around the room while a gaggle of youthful teachers tagged along, occasionally stopping to scribble notes.
"Look, she signed her name," one marveled, showing me a piece of paper my daughter had covered in swirling crayon. I giggled foolishly. In the lower right-hand corner were a few scratchy lines that I might otherwise have mistaken for a few scratchy lines.
At another school, our first choice, the interview coincided with toddler nap time. When we arrived, my daughter was wired. On the elevator ride up, another applicant imploded. He and his mother were not seen again.
But inside the classroom, my daughter seemed to rise to the occasion. She chatted with the guinea pig and served plastic broccoli to a teacher. From the sidelines, I struggled with the confused feelings of a classic stage mother.
I wanted her to do well -- and, of course, I thought she would. I wanted the teachers to be dazzled -- why shouldn't they be? But what if they weren't? She was clearly being sized up -- which seemed to mean I was, too.
 
 
Nothing to Do but Sit Back And Endure the Suspense
 By mid-February, all that was left to do was wait.
Our first response came from a school that, because it was not a nonprofit one, did not belong to the Independent Schools Admissions Association of Greater New York. For that reason, it did not abide by the standard notification dates.
My daughter was in, if we wanted the spot. The school had enclosed a contract to sign and return with a $1,215 deposit. The deadline for responding was March 3 -- four days before we were to hear from the rest of the schools.
I called the director. Yes, it did mean we would have to sign up before knowing if we had choices. And yes, if we signed and reneged, we would not only lose our deposit but also be liable for the unpaid $4,860 tuition balance.
It seemed like a lot to pay to preserve an option. The director sounded a little apologetic. But it was the one thing the school had over the other schools in the association to which it couldn't belong, she explained.
We decided to pass. The next response came from one of the association schools. The letter was dated March 7, the official notification date, but arrived on March 2. It was postmarked March 1.
This time, the letter said they were putting my daughter on the waiting list. It said some additional acceptances were likely to be made in several weeks. We were to contact the school in writing if we wanted to stay on the list.
I admit it, I was shaken. For the first time in six months, I couldn't help but wonder: What if we're shut out? I had prided myself on not letting the process get to me. That night, I barely slept.
I recovered my composure and got through the next week. Then on March 9, I returned home from work, put the key in the mailbox and knew the moment had arrived. There were five white envelopes lurking inside.
Thin, fat, fat, thin, thin. She had been offered a morning spot at the school that was our first choice and an afternoon spot at another. She was wait-listed at the other three. We were given until March 16 to make up our minds.
But the most striking thing about the outcome was that she had been offered a place at every school on the West Side to which we had applied. On the East Side, in every case, she had been put on the waiting list.
Luckily, we had found another apartment on the side of town that matched. But I am left wondering: Was it something we said? Do schools simply assume that outlander applicants won't accept their offers? Or was it something else?
Go figure.
 
Does Nursery School Really Matter?
 Any parents who have ever embarked upon the private nursery-school rat race have probably allowed themselves occasionally to wonder: Does it really matter where a 3-year-old child goes to preschool?
The answer appears to be yes and no. Experts in early childhood education say that poor schooling can harm very young children but that private preschools in New York City do not appear to fit that description.
Furthermore, several researchers said they knew of no evidence that differences between nursery schools' philosophy and approach leave any mark that lasts through first or second grade.
Nevertheless, they said those differences can affect a child's happiness in school. And that can affect self-esteem and motivation. They said certain children in certain environments can be turned off of learning.
For example, a shy or cautious child might not thrive in a large class with a lot of activities going on simultaneously, some said. Similarly, an active child might become frustrated in a highly structured setting.
"Are you meshing your child with the kind of program where he or she will flourish?" asked Alice Sterling Honig, a professor of child development at Syracuse University.
Professor Honig and other researchers cited several critical determinants of the quality of a nursery school: the ratio of children to adults, the size of the classes and the extent of the teachers' training.
In New York City, they said teacher-student ratios and class sizes in private preschools tend to be more than acceptable since they have been set by city and state agencies that license and charter schools.
As for teachers, several said at least one in every class should have training in early childhood education. They said some schools do more than others to encourage their teachers to further their education.
In research, Professor Honig has found that over 60 percent of the variation in the quality of teachers' interactions with children can be traced to the extent of their training in child development and early childhood education.
Beyond those factors, several researchers said there was little proof that differences between, say, "academic" and "progressive" preschools were likely to affect a child's prospects in elementary school.
But they said some children would be happier in one place over another. Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, a professor of child development at Teachers College at Columbia University, said it would have been "a disaster" to have placed her very active son in a school that stressed sitting still and doing drills.
"Not a disaster in terms of his educational attainment when he hit first or second grade," she said. "But I think it wouldn't have matched his temperament. He wouldn't have been as happy."
Ellen Galinsky, co-president of the Families and Work Institute in New York City, said a result of a poor fit between school or teacher and child could be that the child begins to develop a poor self-image.
In Ms. Galinsky's view, the most important aspect of a child's preschool experience is the quality of their relationship with their teacher -- the warmth of that relationship and the teacher's responsiveness.
"It's that teaching connection between the adult and child in which the teacher encourages the child to think or see something in a new way, to see the world as a place worth learning about," she said. "That isn't automatic in a good school."
When it is absent, a child may begin to lose interest and begin to feel badly about him- or herself. At that point, she said, a parent could consider asking that her child have a new teacher or changing schools.
As for the materials used in the classroom, several experts said the types of materials matter less than how they are used.
"The issue is that there be a lot of them and that they be challenging for children and designed to help them learn," said Barbara Willer, public affairs director for the National Association for the Education of Young Children.
"The research suggests that as long as the approach is an active-learning approach that focuses on hands-on experiences, the specifics are less important," she said. "It's more an issue of how they're being used."
Similarly, Ms. Willer said, it is hard to generalize about whether it is good if a school mixes, or does not mix, children of different ages in the same class. According to Ms. Willer, it depends on how it is done.
A parent's role, she said, continues long after admission.
"I don't know that it's possible for anybody to get all the information that they need in the pre-admission visit," she said. "I think probably more important for your child's success is the ongoing relationship you have with the school." JANNY SCOTT

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Sizing Up a School Questions to Ask"
 Some questions reveal more than others about a school's personality. Here are a few that might be useful:
 -- How does the school handle the separation process for new students leaving their parent or caregiver for the first time? Is the process gradual or quick? (The answer may offer insight into a school's overall approach -- progressive or traditional -- and may help parents decide if they or their child would feel comfortable there.)
 -- How much, and in what ways, do teachers intervene if a child refuses to share? What if one child hits or bites another?
 -- How and what will the children learn?
 -- What is the school's policy on drop-in visits by parents? What other opportunities or requirements are there for parental involvement?
 -- What percentage of the children come from two-career families? (Some schools may be more accustomed than others to accommodating the schedules of working mothers.)
 -- What are the teachers' qualifications? How much staff turnover is there?
 -- How diverse is the student body?
 -- Does the school celebrate any religious or secular holidays? If so, how?
 -- How does the school help families applying to ongoing schools?
 -- How many places are really available to new families? How many applications does the school expect for those spots? (pg. 16)

CURRENCY
Big Bird to the Rescue?
While the American dollar plunged last week to post-World War II lows against the yen, frustrations grew in Japan as hopes for a bright recovery there faced away. In Tokyo, Japanese protesters -- some in animal suits -- blamed the United States for pushing up the yen.
 
HEALTH CARE
It's Raining Mergers
The way health care companies are pairing two by two, you'd think the Flood were coming tomorrow. Last week -- in the second billion-dollar consolidation of home health care companies in 60 days -- Coram Healthcare agreed to buy Lincare Holdings for about $1.38 billion. On March 2, Abbey Healthcare Group and Homedco Group had announced plans for a $1 billion merger, themselves. The Coram half of soon-to-be Coram-Lincare was itself born of a four-way merger just last year. One analyst indicated the home health care business would, indeed, flood Coram-Lincare and Abbey-Homedco -- with money. She estimated that they would each command about 17 percent of the industry's $7 billion market next year.
 
COPING
Japanese Companies on Guard
Fearing a relapse into recession, several Japanese companies -- Mazda Motor, Mitsubishi Materials and Sumitomo Metal Industries are included -- have announced austerity plans. Big companies, at least, seem highly capable of coping with the export-threatening rise of the yen. But the Japanese economy might not fare as well. Indeed, analysts indicated last week, the country's lifetime employment system may be in jeopardy.
 
ARMS CONTRACTORS
A Moveable, Affordable Feast
Georgia's in. Washington's out. Where costs are low, military hardware manufacturing plants are bustling. Where costs are higher, wildflowers are growing around shuttered plants of the same sort. It's as if military contractors are collectively moving the party -- albeit a smaller, post-Reagan affair -- to any location where the tab will be most easily digested. Also on the in list: Colorado, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi. In some cases, the companies are even seeking what economists say are gifts of public goods like roads, schools and municipal airports -- and getting them. Georgia's Cobb County, for example, is about to pay for a multimillion-dollar rail underpass to give a warm welcome to Lockheed Martin, the nation's largest arms contractor.
 
WEALTH
The Divided States of America
Picture a classroom of third-graders herded into two groups. Less than a quarter of them are sporting Hanna Andersson all-cotton separates. The rest are draped in itchy, ill-sized hand-me-downs. Hands on hearts, they chant, "I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands: one nation, under God, economically divisible . . . ." This amendment to the egalitarian pledge seems fitting: New studies were shown to establish last week that America has become the most economically stratified of industrial nations. A very few possess much of the wealth. And, as a Brookings Institution fellow pointed out, because political campaigns in America are ruled by money, the financial extremes could well intensify. (In what could become a kind of reverse-Robin Hood legend, Republicans today are seeking cuts in Federal welfare programs and taxes.) And the country as a whole may end up suffering right along with those poorly dressed third-graders: One economics expert asserted that America, with a child poverty rate four times the average of its principal industrial competitors', could find itself at a big competitive disadvantage by the time today's children join the work force.
 
AUTOS
Mini-van Monday?
If the audacious billionaire Kirk Kerkorian succeeds in buying Chrysler -- mind you, this is a big if -- and the auto maker is left heavily in debt as a result, analysts believe the bottom lines of shareholders, along with mini-van buyers, would be affected. The analysts point to Philip Morris scrambling to cut Marlboro cigarette prices two years ago in an effort to stem the loss of sales to lower-priced competitors. Chrysler, it follows, would be forced to cut prices because with the debt on its books, "Ford and G.M. would have a field day" going after its product lines, said the automotive stock analyst Nicholas Lobaccaro. After Philip Morris announced its cut, the company suffered a sharp selloff that left its shareholders $13 billion poorer. With Chrysler, Mr. Lobaccaro predicted, instead of a Marlboro Friday, "you would have a mini-van Monday."
 
WALL STREET
Salomon Is Still Bleeding
Somebody get Salomon Brothers a tourniquet! Since a pay plan cutting the compensation of its managing directors was announced late last year, the investment bank has lost 10 percent of those directors. Three were added to the list last week -- even as the firm, which reported 1994 after-tax losses of almost $400 million, announced an easing of the restrictive pay plan. Analysts were skeptical about how effective the new plan would be. If it is shunned, management will probably have to pay still more to keep valued workers.
 
LENDING
Sure, It's Less Red Tape, but ...
Banks that make loans to small businesses are no doubt sighing in relief. Thanks to an overhaul of regulations aimed at encouraging banks and savings and loan associations to make more loans in moderate- and low-income areas, they face a lot less paperwork. But the relaxed reporting requirements, adopted last week, are more relaxed than some minority-rights activists believe is healthy. Under the new rules, banks do not have to collect and report information on the race and sex of their small-business borrowers -- as they have to do for home mortgages under the Community Reinvestment Act. The collection of those details was sought by community and consumer groups as a method of uncovering lending bias. But Federal regulators sided with bankers and Republicans in control of Congress and dropped the proposal. The Federal Reserve will, however, let banks, insurance companies and investment houses gather and publish data on business loans by sex and race -- on a voluntary basis.
 
MEDIA
The Last Word in Houston
What to read in Houston? Why, the Chronicle, of course. The choice between it and the Houston Post was eliminated last week when Hearst, the owner of the 94-year-old Chronicle, bought the 111-year-old Post from Consolidated Newspapers -- and shut it down. At a loss for words, printed or spoken, Post staff members embraced to comfort each other. Now, as the country's fourth-largest city, Houston is the largest city in the country with a single major daily metropolitan newspaper. It has plenty of company across the nation. In Milwaukee, the Sentinel merged with the Journal on April 2, and Providence, R.I., the Evening Bulletin is set to merge with the Journal on June 5.
 
SWINDLES
'I'm Not Entirely to Blame'
No doubt, this is the headline Steven Hoffenberg would like to have dictated about his guilty plea last week to criminal conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with a $460 million Ponzi-scheme that he ran through his flagship company, Towers Financial. After the Securities and Exchange Commission had accused him of being a swindler, Mr. Hoffenberg had directed the coverage of his own regulatory troubles in what was then his New York Post. (The Post is now owned by the News Corporation.) In his court appearance last week, Mr. Hoffenberg made accusations against Towers accountants. He did the same thing earlier with one of his lawyers. But no criminal charges against these people have materialized.

HEADLINE: Earth Days Have Become Earth Years

BYLINE: By Al Gore; Al Gore is Vice President of the United States and author of "Earth in the Balance."

 BODY:
Yesterday, even as our thoughts and prayers were focused on the tragedy in Oklahoma City, we took time to remember that 25 years ago, a simple idea for a teach-in exploded into a national event involving 20 million people that changed the course of history. Following the first Earth Day, our nation built from scratch the most advanced health and environmental safeguards in the world. It is a great American success story that proves the old-fashioned idea that individuals can make a difference, that when the people speak, their leaders can listen and do something about it. It ought to be a source of inspiration.
After all, in the past 25 years, we've cut air pollution by a third, even though we drive twice as many cars twice as many miles as we did then. We've cut emissions of lead by 98 percent, and countless children are the better for it. Twice as many rivers and lakes are safe for swimming. And where 25 years ago boxes and beer cans lined the roadways, today people of all ages are recycling in 6,000 community programs. 
 What now? Where do we go from here and how do we get there?
On the day after the first Earth Day, The New York Times wrote: "Conservatives were for it. Liberals were for it. Democrats, Republicans, and independents were for it. So were the ins, the outs, the executive and legislative branches of Government." Today, that support is still there. Recent polls show that 53 percent of the people think government action to protect the environment does not go far enough, while another 23 percent think we are on the right track. Only 16 percent think Government regulation on the environment has gone too far.
But this time, bipartisanship is hanging by a thread. The Republican Congress is pushing an extreme anti-environmental agenda. It would freeze all health and environmental protection, effectively repeal 25 years of health protection through a "risk assessment" bill and allow industry to hold up environmental safeguards through endless lawsuits. It would even require taxpayers to pay polluters not to pollute.
The Republicans have turned over the legislative process to lobbyists. The freeze on new health, safety and environmental standards was written by a coalition of wealthy special- interest lobbyists, who were even given a room off the House floor to write amendments and furnish talking points for lawmakers. The Senate committee used lobbyists to explain the legislation to staff. And the committee worked side by side with lobbyists to write loopholes into the Clean Water Act.
So this time, the future will bring two struggles: the first, to prevent the rollback of the gains we have made, and the second, to reinvent environmental protection in order to make further gains. On the first, we will fight. On the second, we will join with those who want to build on the lessons learned since 1970.
What have we learned? First, collaborative processes work better than adversarial ones. Second, flexibility works better than one-size-fits-all dictates. Third, Washington doesn't have all the answers, and we should shift some responsibilities from central bureaucracies to local communities. Fourth, pollution is often a sign of economic inefficiency, and you can make money by preventing it.
Here is an example of things to come. Recently, President Clinton announced 25 reforms to make environmental protection work better and cost less. Through Project "XL" -- our project in excellence in leadership -- we will move from a one-size-fits-all system to a system based on real results and common sense. It's the first program in the next generation of environmental protection -- cleaner for the environment, cheaper for business and taxpayers and smarter and safer for our children's future. And just last week, we unveiled our new national environmental strategy to promote development and export of a new generation of technologies to improve both environmental and economic performance. This strategy is one of the best examples of "reinventing government" -- where the Federal Government acts as a partner with industry and local governments.
We are also making use of the Government's purchasing power, with executive orders to cut the use of toxic substances by 50 percent by 1999 and to improve energy and water efficiency -- a move estimated to cut the Government's utility bills by $1 billion annually by the year 2005. Similarly, to boost recycling and to reduce the burden on landfills, the President signed an executive order directing Federal agencies to purchase recycled and environmentally preferable products. The Government is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world, so it makes sense to put that purchasing power to work.
There have been other actions taken in this spirit. The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles between Government and industry will develop a new generation of vehicles up to three times more fuel efficient than today's -- and strengthen our competitiveness. A new incineration policy will result in a 95 percent reduction in emissions of dangerous pollutants. The proposed reform of the Superfund program will make life safer for the one in four Americans who still live near a toxic dump site, 14 years after Love Canal. Too much money that should have gone to clean up toxic dumps was spent on lawyers.
We are also pursuing new approaches on the international front. At the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, in Cairo, the U.S. helped forge a historic consensus on a global program to stabilize population growth through increased availability of family planning services, a commitment to improving women's health, the empowerment of women and a reduction in infant and child mortality.
We are implementing a comprehensive national strategy to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels in the year 2000 -- a commitment renewed last month in Berlin. Already, more than 800 of the nation's electric utility companies have signed voluntary pledges to limit greenhouse- gas emissions
Similarly, in London, the U.S. took the lead among the world's nuclear powers and achieved a global ban on ocean dumping of radioactive waste. The U.S. was the first of the nuclear powers to advocate the ban. We have also succeeded in creating a whale sanctuary in the southern ocean around Antarctica. Commercial whaling will now be prohibited in an enormous area of the ocean that is home to three-quarters of the world's whales.
So while others may conclude that the future of our environment is unclear, I am optimistic. And so is the President, who has made it clear that he will fight hard to prevent a return to the days before that first Earth Day 25 years and one day ago. As he said in Dallas on March 16: "I cannot and will not compromise any clean water, any clean air, any protection against toxic waste. The environment cannot protect itself. And if it requires a Presidential veto to protect it, then that's what I'll provide."

HEADLINE: When Republicans Don Democratic Masks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your April 14 front-page picture of Representative Robert K. Dornan and the caption "The Happy Warrior" (some editions) typifies Republican exploitation of heroic 20th-century Democratic statesmen. From Newt Gingrich's claiming bipartisanship in the name of Franklin D. Roosevelt to Senator Jesse Helms's using Hubert H. Humphrey's name to promote his civil rights restoration bill, which would abolish opportunities for thousands of minorities and women, these flawed comparisons have demeaned these leaders and their causes. 
 The real Happy Warriors, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, were true to the "high endeavors" character of William Wordsworth's poetic hero. They showed they could lead their people beyond hardship, out of the shadows of discrimination and over the mountain of economic depression. They showed that by empowering people and creating opportunity, our nation would indeed be indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
In sharp contrast, the Republican leaders of today stand for division and partisanship, liberty for the few at the top of the economic ladder and justice for those who can afford it.

HEADLINE: Yale Case Illustrates Swindle of Grade Inflation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It is worrisome that a transfer applicant to Yale University could deceive an admissions officer about his record at a state college in California (Week in Review, April 16). But the most significant fact in this episode is that the student, whose grade point average at his state college was just 2.1 (out of a possible 4.0), had a record of 3.0 at Yale. 
 This is the problem that the country's private colleges and universities would prefer to ignore: grade inflation is now so widespread at our best colleges that a high grade point average has ceased to be at all unusual. Twenty-five years ago, private colleges and universities could expect to bestow outstanding honors to the top 3 or 4 percent of the senior class. Today, at the University of Pennsylvania, and typical of the situation nationally, fully 20 percent of graduating students qualify for highest graduation honors.
Grade inflation trivializes a strong college record and adulterates the value of the bachelor's degree. The phenomenon is accelerating rather than declining. A correspondent (letter, April 11) complained that graduate schools are relying too much on the Graduate Record Examination and other standardized tests. Indeed we are, for admissions committees are aware that high grades at a good college are no longer an adequate index of a student's knowledge or ability.
The real fraud is not that one student managed to swindle Yale, but that many, perhaps most, selective colleges routinely award stellar grades to students of average ability without regard to what this process has done to the quality of higher education.

HEADLINE: Doctors Go Jobless, Patients Do Without

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your April 15 front-page article featuring an unemployed eye surgeon confirms the decline in American health care. When I was growing up in the 1940's and 50's, my family saw an eye doctor every year; so did my own children in the 70's and 80's. Now, my family and I never see one. 
 On rare occasions I have visited a private eye doctor, whose fees are not covered by my health maintenance organization. A recent article told me that under some health plans if I develop cataracts, I may have them removed only in one eye. Meanwhile, eye surgeons cannot find work. Surely, health maintenance organizations are not matching the skills of doctors to our needs nearly as well as a single-payer system could.

When Good Republicans Make Bad Moves

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"POLITICS is just like show business," Ronald Reagan once observed. "You have a hell of an opening, you coast for a while, you have a hell of a closing."
Well, the curtain has gone up on eight contenders for the Republican Presidential nomination. While their openings were hardly worthy of Hollywood (or of Ronald Reagan, for that matter), the debut announcement speeches do tell people something about the candidates. And some moments, and some passages, stood out:
 
Most Baffling Site Selection
 At a time when the Capitol dome is a backdrop only for attack commercials, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania defied conventional wisdom (and anti-Washington sentiment) by staging his announcement smack in the middle of what one rival, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, calls the "arrogant empire." He delivered his speech in the shadow of the Washington Monument, with the Lincoln Memorial right behind him. 
 Considering that Mr. Specter picked a popular tourist site, it was all the more surprising that he couldn't assemble more than 200 to stand around and watch him. His aides scrambled to stock the audience with unknowing passersby. They had little luck.
 
Most Venue Problems
 To drive home his message about restoring power to the states, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas planned an elaborate announcement at the steps of the Capitol in Topeka. But this was Kansas. And while no tornado materialized, foul weather forced the event inside, to a nondescript arena.
Mr. Dole tried again later in the week, in Raleigh, N.C., with another version of the speech. It was a beautiful spring day. The event was set for the Capitol. But local officials would not allow a political event at a Government building. So Mr. Dole moved into a hotel ballroom. At least, unlike the commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, Mr. Dole got to open his speech without interruption by protesters jumping on stage.
 
Most Dubious Opening
 Rather than cancel, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana went ahead with his announcement on Wednesday, only hours after the explosion in Oklahoma City. He opened with a moment of silence for the victims. But few will know what he said.
"It's going to go down in history as the speech that shouldn't have been given the day it was given," said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. "He should have made a statement that it was inappropriate to announce on a day of national mourning. And he could not compete for press or psychological attention from the public."
 
Most Misspent Oratory
 Alan Keyes, a radio talk show host, brought the crowd to its feet as he vowed not to abandon the fight against abortion. His speech had the intensity, the fervor, of an old-time oration. But some in the audience -- at a conservative convention in San Diego -- wore buttons for other candidates. For much as they liked the show, many did not think Mr. Keyes has a chance.
 
Most Incongruous Theme
 Given that Senator Phil Gramm of Texas got several military deferments during the Vietnam War, it was surprising that he choreographed an announcement that looked like a show of military force.
There were uniformed cadets everywhere at Texas A & M University, where Mr. Gramm taught economics. The Senator arrived on stage by walking through cadets' raised sabers. And the event closed with the roar of cannons.
The police-state imagery delighted advisers to Senator Dole, a wounded hero of World War II. One critic said Mr. Gramm may as well have put a sign over his head proclaiming, "I never served."
 
Most Snickers
 Lamar Alexander, a millionaire, was skewered by the inside-the-Beltway commentators for taking to the stage as a populist in a plaid work shirt.
But Mr. Alexander, who is registering nowhere in the polls, at least got a little attention. "Every pundit in Washington, D.C., hated the plaid shirt," said Mark Merritt, Mr. Alexander's spokesman. "So we knew we were doing something right."
 
Lamest Portrait of a Nice Guy
 This, from Representative Robert K. Dornan of California, explaining why he has the temperament to be President: "Well, ladies and gentlemen, here's one Congressman that has never yelled at his staff; tried to motivate my children by example, not by harshness; that has never in subcommittee or committee or at a press conference ever showed anything but passion."
 
Most Memorable Line
 Mr. Gramm gets the honors. Not from his actual announcement speech, but from a speech in Dallas the night before, at the kick-off of his announcement tour. Surrounded by friends and supporters who raised millions for his campaign, he had offered these less-than-heartwarming words: "I have the most reliable friend that you can have in American politics, and that is ready money."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Energy-Hungry, Asia Embraces Nuclear Power

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam

 BODY:
IT'S difficult to imagine the hulking towers of a nuclear power plant rising up from the emerald-green rice paddies of Vietnam, a nation so poor that most people still depend on cooking over an open fire and lighting their homes with oil lamps. But this month, the Vietnamese Government announced that it was considering a proposal from South Korea to build two nuclear reactors here at a cost of $3 billion.
Vietnam is one of the few Asian nations blessed by large deposits of fossil fuel -- it has huge tracts of offshore oil -- but its leaders are eager not to be left behind in the nuclear-power binge sweeping Asia. 
 Nuclear power is an industry in crisis in the West, the result both of the panic produced by the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl and of the multi-billion-dollar cost overruns that have plagued nuclear-energy projects throughout Europe and the United States. No new nuclear plants have been ordered in the United States since 1979.
But if the nuclear-energy genie is dying in the West, he is being reborn in Asia. The booming, fuel-hungry nations across the region are ordering and building nuclear plants at a rate not seen in decades.
 
Fail-Safe?
 There are already 115 commercial and research reactors in operation in East Asia, most in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. In the next decade, dozens of new reactors are expected to built across the continent at a cost of more than $100 billion.
Asian leaders say they have no choice but to develop nuclear power given the explosive rate at which the demand for energy is growing. The International Atomic Energy Agency has predicted that power demands in Asia will triple by 2015.
But while reactors may power Asia's thriving economies into the next century, they also pose problems of safety and cost that the West has been tangling with unsuccessfully throughout the atomic age.
It is a subject now under scrutiny at the United Nations, where diplomats opened talks last week on extending the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The 25-year-old treaty, which is about to expire, was designed to limit the spread of nuclear arms in part by allowing inspection of power plants to verify that atomic material is not diverted to weapons use. But evidence from North Korea has shown that a determined government could use civil nuclear programs as a cover for weapons development, and the spread of nuclear power in Asia has raised new concerns about proliferation.
Anti-nuclear advocates are dismayed. "It's the first world dumping old, dangerous technology on the developing world," said Jean McSorley, who directs anti-nuclear campaigns in Asia for Greenpeace. "We're encouraging them to repeat the same mistakes that we made."
Environmental groups say they take little solace from the fact that most of the plants now being built in Asia are of Western design, and that they incorporate hard-earned lessons about safety. They have called on Asian nations to shun atomic energy in favor of conservation and the use of safer energy sources. Solar energy, they say, would be a natural choice in much of sun-baked Southeast Asia.
No Asian nation has embraced nuclear energy more enthusiastically than China, which opened its first commercial complex only last year but has plans for 30 more reactors. Last month, it announced a shifting in national energy policy to encourage the development of nuclear power over hydropower and thermal energy, the priorities until now. "We are energetically developing nuclear power," said Yao Qiming, a government energy official. "It is our future."
Western companies are rushing in with proposals to build reactors. In January, China awarded three French firms a $3 billion contract to build two nuclear plants in Guangdong Province. Few in the industry were surprised when the chairmen of Westinghouse and General Electric, both of which design or build nuclear plants, showed up in Beijing last year for talks.
"The energy growth in Asia is just astonishing, and their move to nuclear energy shows that the nations of Asia understand the value of having a mix of energy resources -- and the value of nuclear energy," said Angie McBrien of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying group.
But if the Clinton Administration is eager to see American companies benefit from the development of atomic power in China, it has been dismayed by what has gone on in North Korea, the nation that more than any in Asia had proved the dangers of the unrestrained nuclear development.
 
Temptations
 Until last year, North Korea appeared bent on using spent fuel from a reactor to make weapons-grade plutonium. Under an agreement with the United States, the plant is to be shut down in return for safer reactors designed to limit the risk of diversion.
Negotiations to implement that agreement have been on-again, off-again. At the same time, some critics fear that other Asian countries that until now have disavowed ambitions for nuclear arms may be tempted to reconsider.
"My worst-case scenario is that every country in the region would get a couple of reactors with the idea that they want to keep their military options open," said Ms. McSorley of Greenpeace. The options are wide open in India and Pakistan, both of which have diverted nuclear material from power plants to the making of weapons that they might use against one another. Unlike most Asian nations, neither India nor Pakistan has signed the non-proliferation pact.
In Southeast Asia, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are all in varying stages of nuclear development. Indonesia is about to take bids for its first nuclear plant.
The governments of South Korea, Japan and Taiwan already support some of the world's most sophisticated nuclear-power programs. In South Korea, nuclear power provides more than 40 percent of all the electricity generated in the country; in Japan and Taiwan, the figure is about 30 percent. The Japanese Government has proposed the construction of at least 15 new nuclear reactors by 2010, and it is now pursuing the commercial use of fast-breeder reactors, which use plutonium for fuel.
The rush to nuclear power would not be so worrying if Asian leaders could guarantee that they would remain at peace. Since the Vietnam War, Asians have enjoyed a remarkable neighborliness. One reason for the region's economic success is that most governments have not been forced to spend a crippling portion of their budget on arms.
But military historians say it is only a matter of time before the collegiality of the region breaks down. In just the last few weeks, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have all raised the threat of military action over the potentially oil-rich Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, after China built a military-style platform atop a tiny reef. Asian diplomats have been alarmed by the recent dispute between two old strategic allies, the Philippines and Singapore, which came close to a diplomatic split over the execution in Singapore of a Filipino maid.
 
Tension
 Worried, Japanese scholars and nuclear experts have proposed a pan-Asian agreement to police recycling of nuclear material and prevent military diversions. Diplomats in the region have embraced the idea.
Proponents say an accord may be essential as Asian nations are forced to cooperate in waste disposal. Some land-starved countries are already having trouble disposing of spent fuel -- South Korea expects to fill all its storage sites in a decade.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Some Indians Buck a Stereotype

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
WHEN he is not happy with the powers that be in the New Mexico state government, Jacob Viarrial, the governor of Pojoaque Pueblo, has a foolproof way of turning up the heat. In a maneuver sure to stir up the environmentalists down in Santa Fe, he threatens to use the reservation, just a few miles from Santa Fe, as the site for a low-level nuclear waste dump.
That is what he told former Gov. Bruce King a couple years ago when the state tried to interfere with the pueblo's plans to open a gambling hall. And that is what he threatened earlier this year, when it looked as though the legislature might allow racetracks to compete with the state's proliferating supply of Indian-owned casinos. "With different people wanting to force us out of Indian gaming, we need to look at other areas," Mr. Viarrial said in an interview last week. "Right now we're looking at low-level, but if it looks lucrative enough we might go with high-level waste." 
 Since the first Earth Day, 25 years ago yesterday, America's natives have been romanticized as the original environmentalists. Millions of television viewers remember being struck (or bludgeoned) by what now is a parody of poignant public service advertising: a solemn warrior gazes tearfully at a pile of litter. How could the white man have done this to the land? When it comes to public relations, Indians have been considered good for the environment.
Environmentalists and Indians sometimes find themselves on the same side, but from the beginning, their relationship has been uneasy and fraught with ambiguity. Environmentalists like to play on the image of the Indian as protector of mother earth, yet they sometimes get nervous when they see tribes making environmental decisions on their own.
 
The Paternal Trap
 "Environmentalists quite often fall into the trap of a paternalistic or romanticized approach to dealing with Indians," said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee lawyer whose Albuquerque firm represents Indians in environmental disputes. "They say, 'The poor Indians don't understand the impact, so we have to protect them.' I've actually had environmentalists tell me, 'Well, that's not the Indian thing to do.' "
Several years ago Mr. Gover represented the Campo Band of Mission Indians in Southern California, who had received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency to open and manage a commercial landfill -- one of the few ways they could find to make a living from their less than hospitable land. Local environmentalists tried to block it with a bill in the California legislature that would have banned shipment of waste to the site.
"Every government balances economic interests with environmental values," Mr. Gover said. And that includes Indian tribes. But many environmentalists believe the tribes, like all communities, need expert help. Native Americans are among the most unfortunate victims of environmental degradation, and their shaky economic status makes them an easy target for those who see the beautiful but often barren Indian lands as a natural dumping ground for waste that no one else will take.
Though Mr. Viarrial insists he's serious about nuclear waste, many environmentalists think he's just playing a game of high-stakes political poker. For now they are more worried about the Mescalero Apaches in southern New Mexico, who last month voted for a potentially lucrative plan to store the highly radioactive wastes produced by nuclear power plants.
After the vote, environmentalists denounced the Mescalero government for strong-arming the tribe into reversing an earlier referendum rejecting the repository. The tribal government blamed outside agitators for misleading the people into opposing their own best interests. Fred Peso, the vice president of the tribe, said at the time that he considered opposition to the plan racist -- the assumption, he argued, was that only white people were competent to handle radioactive materials.
The tensions between environmentalists and Indians go back at least as far as the late 1960's and early 1970's when the battle over Blue Lake in northern New Mexico became a national cause celebre. Taos Pueblo got the National Forest Service to return the lake, which the tribe considered sacred, but only after fighting off bands of environmentalists. For all their talk about Indians as keepers of the earth, environmentalists thought the Federal government would do a better job of managing the land.
"Some environmentalists have had the feeling that Indians are not good stewards," said Stewart Udall, a former Secretary of the Interior whose law firm represents Navajo uranium miners with respiratory diseases. "I've always been critical of that."
Recently, Mr. Udall noted, tribes have been sending people to school to learn to be foresters. And in the last few years, environmental movements have been springing up within Indian reservations. A group of Navajos has been fighting their tribal government's logging operations in the Chuska mountains. And the opposition to the Mescalero dump was waged not only by outsiders but by a small group of environmentally inclined Mescaleros. In many of these cases, pro-business tribal leaders find the strongest resistance in an alliance of older, more traditional members and younger Indians who were introduced to the environmental movement in college.
"The Indians may have in their religion and culture a reverence for the land," Mr. Udall said. "But then they get into the pressures created by modern society. Unless they are reasonably well educated, they can't deal with them. "Now," he said, "many or them are just as sophisticated as the rest of us."
 
The Anasazi Way
 Throughout history both Indians and their conquerors have found that the struggle for day-to-day survival leaves little room for long-term environmental concerns. Archeological records show that the Anasazi, ancestors to many Southwestern tribes, stayed in one place for no more than a generation. When all the firewood had been burned, the soil depleted and the game eaten or frightened away, they would move to a new place and start the cycle over again. They had no choice. There were no trucks to move timber, no farm animals to fertilize the fields.
"That Indians treasured the earth and would never do anything to hurt it is not an accurate stereotype," said Jonathan Haas, the MacArthur Curator of North American Anthropology at the Field Museum in Chicago. "They were in tune with the earth in that they were totally dependent on it."
"Indians are people," he said. "Just like the rest of us, they do not always make the best decisions on the use of their land."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Prime Time Snubs Mr. Clinton for Reruns

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
TWO years ago, fresh from a series of appearances on "Larry King Live," President Clinton announced that he had been "liberated" by talk shows. Now that he could go "to the American people directly," he told broadcast journalists, he planned to "stiff" them on news conferences. Last week, the broadcast networks returned the favor.
On Tuesday, when Mr. Clinton gave the fourth prime-time news conference of his career, ostensibly to talk about welfare reform, only CBS interrupted its schedule to cover it. ABC and NBC decided to carry instead a repeat of "Home Improvement" ("Tim charms Jill's friends") and "Frasier" ("Frasier joins Niles and Martin on an ice-fishing trip"). 
 The two recalcitrant networks attributed their decision to the short notice the White House had given, and to a determination they had made that this particular news conference wasn't likely to produce any, well, news. But the fig leaf wasn't remotely big enough. The networks' decision was made on the basis of economics and was clearly revelatory of Mr. Clinton's sagging authority.
"You can look at news coverage of speeches and press conferences as a fairly good index of power in a society," said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian. "The networks are voting with their feet. They're saying the Presidency is not as powerful as it was, especially under this President."
Presidential news conferences are relatively new, dating from only as far as Woodrow Wilson. (Teddy Roosevelt, for example, used to chat with reporters one-on-one while being shaved by the White House barber.) Wilson's idea to hold a question-and-answer session, according to Martha Joynt Kumar, a professor of political science at Towson State University in Maryland, was less about disseminating information than solving a problem: "He didn't like dealing with reporters," she said.
 
Slip-Sliding Away
 The live, televised news conference originated with John F. Kennedy, and since then every president has held them. Until the end of George Bush's tenure, the broadcast networks preempted programming for the President almost without question. In June 1992, however, all three major networks refused to run one of Mr. Bush's news conferences on the grounds that it seemed more of a campaign event than anything else.
Under Mr. Clinton the networks have become increasingly emboldened. During his two years in office, Mr. Clinton has held only four prime-time news conferences; of those, only two have been carried by all three major networks. In June 1993 when Mr. Clinton held his first prime-time news conference to press his economic plan, only NBC carried it, and only in part. All have been carried on the cable networks CNN and C-SPAN.
Last week's rejection of Mr. Clinton in favor of "Frasier" and "Home Improvement" was all the more telling because it came just 10 days after House Speaker Newt Gingrich's proto-presidential address. The networks treated Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich exactly alike; CBS, which has this season's weakest prime-time schedule, broadcast both, preempting a made-for-television movie on Tuesday, while NBC and ABC broadcast neither. By skipping Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gingrich, NBC and ABC held on to millions of dollars of advertising revenues.
While there is general agreement among political scientists and politicians that the coverage of Mr. Clinton's news conference is an inauspicious development for him, there is some debate over how much responsibility the President bears for his predicament, and how much is due to forces beyond his control.
Michael Deaver, who directed communications for President Reagan, is part of the group that blames Mr. Clinton.
"My own feeling is if the President is leading and has something to say, the media is going to give him all the access he wants," he said. "I really don't think it has anything to do with the office; I think it has to do with the man."
Mr. Deaver was also critical Mr. Clinton's communications staff, saying it had failed to orchestrate the President's appearances in a way that would encourage press coverage. He said that he and his staff used to spend weeks planning a news conference -- conferring with the networks, choosing a propitious time and generally withholding comments from the President to increase the sense of suspense. The point, Mr. Deaver said, was "to build the drama so that people were anticipating it."
 
Always Time for O.J.
 Mr. Beschloss, on the other hand, argued that Mr. Clinton's difficulty breaking into prime time was part of a broader decline in Presidential power.
"The Presidency is constitutionally a very weak office," he said. From the 1930's until the early 1990's, the demands of the Cold War and a national taste for activist government allowed Presidents to transcend that weakness.
But now that the Cold War is over and activist government is in retreat, Mr. Beschloss said, the limitations of the office are reasserting themselves. Mr. Clinton's lack of network appeal, he said, "is just another symptom of the decline of the imperial presidency."
Whatever the underlying reason for their decision not to carry Mr. Clinton last week, Thomas Patterson, a professor of political science at Syracuse University who has written extensively on the press and politics, maintained that the networks should be faulted for it.
"They don't have too much trouble giving us O.J. Simpson," Mr. Patterson said. "And if Robert Shapiro is more important that the President, we're in trouble."

HEADLINE: New Auction Gems: Common Folks;
Venerable Houses Woo Unstuffy Buyers With Unstuffy Stuff

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

 BODY:
On most Saturdays, Judith Weisman can be found prospecting at Christie's on Park Avenue, sifting through Fine, Important, Highly Important and Magnificent objets looking for a bargain.
On one chilly afternoon recently, Mrs. Weisman wore gold lame sandals that matched the Empire Style Ormolu Mantel Clock Surmounted by A Classically Clad Maiden Playing A Harp. Mrs. Weisman was surmounted herself by a fluorescent orange hairdo. 
 "You're buying wholesale," Mrs. Weisman explained as she inspected the sumptuous trifles that Donald J. Trump was auctioning from Mar-a-Lago, the Palm Beach estate variously called "Leg-o-Mar" and "Mal-a-Gro" by some in the crowd. "It's the hunt."
For Mrs. Weisman, who calls auctiongoing "the ultimate consumer recreation," venerable auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's have become rarefied versions of Loehmann's: the ultimate places to find or try to find a deal. And there are an increasing number of new auctiongoers like her, the kind who covet A Set of Fourteen Sevres Style Porcelain Armorial Apple Green-Ground Plates or A Cylindrical Chinese Celadon-Glazed Ceramic Vase With Incised Bamboo Branches Beneath a Collar of Fretwork.
For Christie's and Sotheby's, whose centuries-old heritages are steeped in the stately homes of the British aristocracy, the presence of shoppers like Mrs. Weisman reflects an increasingly aggressive attempt since the 1980's to become user-friendly and broaden their upper-class image by appealing directly to private buyers. They call their new clients "privates" and sometimes, less charitably, "the street people."
"Now we have all walks of life," Phillips Hathaway, a vice president and director of European furniture at Sotheby's, said one recent afternoon as he strolled past a larger-than-life-sized cloisonne peacock with a price tag in its beak. "We kill ourselves to make it all look as accessible as we possibly can."
The look is accessible, all right. There is now a place to buy sandwiches at Sotheby's (albeit $5.00 ones filled with prosciutto and Camembert). And today's auctiongoers sit in front of automated currency conversion display boards that possess all the hauteur of the Keno lounge at Caesars Palace.
The courtship of the commoners -- the people who "might sit in Row 38 rather than first class," in the words of the chairman of Christie's, Christopher J. Burge -- has been intensifying. This weekend, for instance, Christie's East, the warehouse-like venue on East 67th Street for lower-priced Christie's merchandise, is having a benefit block party, complete with flying monkeys, in an attempt to "reach out" to potential buyers in their neighborhood.
The nature of what is being auctioned at the city's two most elite houses has also changed, reflecting the boom of interest in collecting practically anything, even old golf equipment. This spring in New York, you can certainly find the traditional fare, outstanding examples of work by Modigliani, Renoir, Matisse and Vuillard. But you can also buy John Travolta's White Suit from "Saturday Night Fever" (estimate: $30,000 to $50,000), or peruse the new category of Gumpiana (the Park Bench from "Forrest Gump," estimate: $6,000 to $8,000). You can even pick up the Original Tablets from the movie "The Ten Commandments" -- estimated at $30,000 to $50,000 and described by Christie's as "made of richly hewn fiberglass."
On a recent evening at Sotheby's -- where 256 animation cels from "The Lion King" fetched $1.99 million, a record for animation art -- over 200 neophytes paid $25 to learn the rudiments of bidding at auction in the house's latest marketing foray, called "Auction Adventures." First, they heard about "Easy Art" -- lower-priced categories like prints and photographs that are the artistic collecting equivalent of "easy listening." Then, armed with Sotheby's funny money, they attended a fake auction that tried to demystify the intricacies of paddle waving. Paddles bear the auctiongoer's assigned number.
"Get it up in the air so everyone can see it!" coaxed Hugh Hildesley, an auctioneer and the emcee.
The event was hardly plebeian: the room was filled with the kind of manicured crowd one might expect at a place where high cheekbones have always seemed requisite for admission. "What is the overriding emotion that links us all together?" asked David Redden, an auctioneer. He was referring, it turned out, to the "sense of discovery" to be had by bidding in new fields like moon rocks, or, as it is known at Sotheby's, "lunar material."
"It was sort of silly," Diana Howe, a mother of four from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, said later. "But it was better than doing laundry."
Reaching people like Mrs. Howe, who had never been to an auction before and said she received a flier about "Auction Adventures" with her American Express bill, has become something of a mission, reflecting a broadening of the target audience. "There has been a subtle shift over a generation," said Matthew Weigman, a Sotheby's spokesman. In the 1980's, 70 percent of the people who bid at auction were dealers. Today, he said, 70 percent of the bidders are private buyers.
"The privates" often have more ready cash and are generally willing to pay higher prices than the dealers, who must mark up what they buy. And the quest to lure them reflects the economic realities of the auction business, which has been struggling to come back after the well-publicized slump in the art market of the early 1990's, said Laura Suffield, editor in chief of The Art Newspaper in London. "The simple fact is, times are still hard," she said. "So they are literally casting around the globe, trying to reach people who aren't part of the traditional auction culture."
Between them, Christie's and Sotheby's have recently opened offices in Shanghai, Bombay, India, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, an attempt not only to lure new buyers but to find art and objects to be sold. Objects and works of art now travel the globe seeking buyers, the way young upper-class Englishmen once took the Grand Tour. Chris Feiss, a vice president of Alex Brown & Sons of Baltimore, an investment banking firm, said private buyers have traditionally been underrepresented in the United States and "are clearly the fastest-rising segment" of the business.
The preferred privates are people like Bill Gates, the chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, who bought the Leonardo da Vinci "Codex Hammer," a set of illustrated scientific manuscripts, last fall for $30.8 million. But despite every "Codex" or "Portrait of Dr. Gachet," the Van Gogh that was bought in 1990 for $82.5 million by a Japanese businessman, Mr. Feiss pointed out, "the bulk of artworks and objects sold day in and day out are at much lower price levels." Of the 200,000 to 300,000 lots sold by Christie's worldwide every year, Mr. Burge said, approximately half go for under $5,000, and a quarter for under $1,000 -- a fact he called "terrifying."
Although the major profit makers continue to be Impressionist paintings and contemporary art, Diana D. Brooks, president and chief executive of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., said that "the most stable markets in this cyclical business are those that have the broadest participants: jewelry, porcelain, English and American furniture, American folk art, American paintings and collectibles." Although 85 percent of the lots sold at Sotheby's represent only 15 to 20 percent of the company's dollar volume, she said, "there aren't that many Impressionist pictures, so every year you have to sell a lot of other stuff.
"The more traffic you get, the assumption is, the more business you get," Mrs. Brooks said. "Traffic is as important to us as any store in the world."
The glitch has been image, particularly in the United States. "To most people, particularly those not from New York, going into an auction house is a terrifying experience," Mr. Burge said. "Most don't dare walk through the front door."
In London, the traditional center of the trade, where auctioneering has been considered a gentleman's profession for centuries, the housecleaning of the country estates of "gentlemen who had removed to the continent," as bankruptcy was euphemistically called, is a longstanding national ritual. Even among the general public, Mr. Burge points out, there are hundred-year accumulations of stuff. "Everyone in England inherited Granny's Staffordshire sheep and knows they're worth 25 quid," he said. But Americans have taken a dim view of auctioneering, Mr. Burge said, associating it with rough, fast-talking country auctioneers of the tobacco school.
Sotheby's and Christie's also suffered from a reputation of being stuffy and elitist, at best -- a notion, until recently, they did little to dispel.
Thus, the proliferation of "Easy Art" and accessible objects like a Highly Important Pez Dispenser -- a Figural Donald Duck Prototype that sold at Christie's two summers ago for $1,100, the record for a single Pez dispenser. "We've returned to our roots in a curious way," said Mr. Burge. "In 1766, when Christie's was founded, we sold everything, top to bottom, from warming pans and kitchen supplies to livestock."
"We can't ignore popular culture," he added, calling Pez collectors "a small but viable market."
"But let's not confuse it in our minds with high culture," he said. "We want to be accessible. But we don't want Christie's to be the greatest flea market in the world."
Nevertheless, a bit of the flea market pervaded Christie's East last week, where Margaret Hedberg was inspecting five "falling apart Victorian things to put your feet on," as she described a tattered collection of ottomans.
Tomorrow evening, there will be a "twilight talk" by Christie's jazz specialist, Richard Chapman, in preparation for Tuesday's sale of Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet and Jimi Hendrix's Stratocaster guitar.
Such artifacts, particularly those that encompass "Baby Boomerabilia," in the words of Christie's East president, Kathleen Guzman, can hook new young collectors, or so the theory goes. "Today it might be Pez," she said. "Tomorrow Hollywood posters. Fifteen years from now, Lalique glass. Who knows?"
Still, all the user-friendliness in the world cannot fuel the acquisition fever the way celebrity artifacts can, which is why celebrity sales like those of Rudolph Nureyev, Barbra Streisand, Andy Warhol and Elton John have brought record numbers of visitors and "Eyewitness News" teams to once-hallowed doors, further raising the profile of auctions as spectator sport.
But one icon in particular, whose apartment's contents are expected to be auctioned soon, is likely to reduce all others to footnotes.
"Have they announced Jackie yet?" asked Amy Page, editor in chief of Art and Auction magazine, speaking by telephone from Ireland recently. "I know otherwise sane people who have said they'd pay anything for an ashtray Jackie once owned."

HEADLINE: From the Bronx to the Budget Office

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
June E. O'Neill is now one of the nation's most influential economists in no small part because she stopped playing piano.
Ms. O'Neill recently completed her first month as director of the Congressional Budget Office, the aseptic agency that crunches Federal fiscal numbers for the House and the Senate. It is not a job she seemed destined to have. 
 As a child growing up in the Bronx, and as a student at the Bronx High School of Science, she dreamed of being a concert pianist. She studied music at Sarah Lawrence College and then spent four years at Juilliard, the customary last step toward the big stage. But when a divorce left her alone and with a child to support, she asked a college professor she knew for some practical career advice. Postgraduate work, he said.
"He said, 'How about starting out in the economics department?' " Ms. O'Neill recalled. "That seemed like a good idea, and I finally enrolled in the Columbia University department of economics. And I really got hooked on it."
Three decades and a doctorate later, Ms. O'Neill, now 60, holds one of the hottest economic analysis seats in Washington. (By coincidence, the truly flame-broiled seat, the chairmanship of the Federal Reserve Board, belongs to another former Juilliard student, the clarinet-and-sax artist Alan Greenspan.)
Ms. O'Neill comes to the budget office from the City University of New York, where she headed Baruch College's Center for the Study of Business and Government. She was also an adjunct scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization in Washington.
She commands a staff of about 220 analysts and managers, most of them career employees who perform much the same work no matter who is in charge.
Yet when Republicans decided in January to replace the incumbent director, Robert D. Reischauer, with someone to their liking, Democrats fretted openly that the new Congressional majority would politicize a customarily nonpartisan research agency. Ms. O'Neill scoffs at that, saying that to an outsider, any differences between her management of the budget office and that of predecessors will be tiny.
"We're not asked our views on policy, we're asked how much things cost," she said during a recent chat in her Spartan office, in an even more Spartan building at the least impressive foot of Capitol Hill. "I feel obliged to decline if someone asks me my opinion."
Which is not to say that she has no effect on policy. The conclusions of the C.B.O., as the budget office is universally known, carry enormous weight with Congress and the press, largely because the agency has an almost hallowed reputation for presenting the straight economic dope, whatever the political fallout.
"It's a terrific resource for Congress, and even more for the general public," said Gary Burtless, a social sciences scholar at the Brookings Institution. "Whenever they've reported on something that I know something about, they've been outstanding."
Maintaining that reputation means ignoring the prevailing winds. Although Mr. Reischauer was hired and paid by a Democratic-run Congress, only last year his budget office dealt a severe blow to the keystone of President Clinton's legislative program -- an overhaul of the health care system -- by concluding that it would cost the Government far more than the White House had estimated.
Similarly Ms. O'Neill, on the job barely seven weeks, has already nettled the Congress that hired her. Late last month the budget office concluded that welfare legislation backed by House Republicans would neither reduce the rate of out-of-wedlock births nor move as many of the poor into paying jobs as legislators were predicting.
Ms. O'Neill calls herself a free-market theorist, inclined in most cases against government tinkering with matters economic, and her writings tend to confirm it. Asked to describe how closely she swims to mainstream economic thought, she replied drily: "I don't know. I haven't seen any polls."
It is nevertheless clear why she caught the eye of Congress's Republicans. Her monographs on economic issues have appeared not just in the usual scholarly journals but in the conservative general-circulation National Review. In 1990, five years before the debate over affirmative action began to boil, she concluded in one article that the wage gap between young blacks and young whites stemmed mostly from differences in educational achievement and work experience, not from discrimination.
Earlier, she suggested in another monograph that reforms that Michael S. Dukakis had introduced as Governor of Massachusetts had failed to reduce the welfare rolls there.
And as Mr. Reischauer was forecasting last year that the White House's health care proposal would be very costly, Ms. O'Neill and her husband, David O'Neill, also an economist, were predicting that it would raise unemployment. And not by a little bit: their much-quoted research estimated that the plan would cause employers to shed 800,000 to 2.1 million workers, mostly in low-wage positions.
A stung White House, which pegged the loss at closer to 150,000 jobs, described the O'Neill study, sponsored by opponents of the Clinton plan, as "sloppy." But while the O'Neill estimate was higher than others, some independent labor economists said it was on the mark.
If Ms. O'Neill's conclusions often please the political right, associates say they are also rooted in solid research. And in the academic world from which she springs, her reputation is excellent.
Some economists make the world their oyster, but Ms. O'Neill has focused for decades on a single subject: how economic forces shape the labor market. When she attended Columbia, "it was really a new slant on economics -- the study of human capital," she said.
"The notion of applying economics to everything under the sun struck me as particularly intriguing," she said.
Ms. O'Neill was fortunate: her mentor was Gary S. Becker, the pioneering labor economist who first applied economic theory to issues like racial discrimination in the late 1950's. Mr. Becker was awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in 1992.
After a stint as a research associate at the Brookings Institution, Ms. O'Neill obtained her economics doctorate from Columbia in 1970 and moved to the White House to join the Council of Economic Advisers. Not much later, President Richard M. Nixon, horrified by an inflation rate of about 4 percent, imposed wage and price controls on much of the economy.
The experience underscored Ms. O'Neill's belief that generally, the less Federal intervention the better. "It was a regular control system -- they were setting prices, or boundaries of prices," she said, recalling that one day at the White House, "someone was running through the halls, shouting, 'There's no chlorine for the swimming pools!' "
"And there was a shortage," she said, "because they'd set the price too low."
After the Democrats took the White House in 1976, Ms. O'Neill moved to the Congressional Budget Office for three years, heading a unit that analyzed Federal spending on human resources programs, then went on to the Urban Institute, a private Washington research center.
She went to Baruch College in 1987, after a brief stint in the Reagan Administration heading the research unit of the United States Commission on Civil Rights.

HEADLINE: North Korea Threat Seen on Halt of Atom Talks

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 22

 BODY:
In what could be a threat to reactivate its nuclear program, North Korea said today that it would take a "necessary decisive measure" following the breakdown of its negotiations with the United States.
But its vaguely worded statement did not say what the action would be and seemed to leave the door open for renewed negotiations with the United States, as the Clinton Administration has proposed. 
 Talks in Berlin over how to carry out the October agreement to curtail North Korea's nuclear program broke down Friday. Under the agreement, North Korea would forgo any nuclear weapons program in exchange for two nuclear power plants and other economic aid.
The United States has insisted that South Korea play a central role in providing the two new reactors since South Korea is expected to pay most of their estimated $4 billion cost. But North Korea refused to accept reactors supplied by South Korea, its archenemy, contending that its models are unsafe.
North Korea had threatened to begin refueling its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor if an agreement with the United States had not been reached by Friday. The Clinton Administration, which believes the reactor is designed to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, has said it would press for sanctions on North Korea if refueling starts.
The Administration on Friday proposed new talks between the two nations in Geneva, using higher-level diplomats than in Berlin.
North Korea's statement, issued today by the Government-controlled Korea Central News Agency, was open to conflicting interpretations.
After mentioning the proposal for the Geneva talks, the statement, issued in English, said "we will take a necessary decisive measure after getting a detailed report" of the Berlin negotiations and "sounding on the real intention of the U.S. side on the government level." That seemed to suggest that North Korea would consider Washington's proposal.
But the statement continued, "The measure which we will take in the future will be an entirely just and reasonable one for defending our sovereignty."
That wording and the Korean-language version convinced Naewoe Press, a South Korean Government news agency that monitors North Korea, that the North was moving toward confrontation. "The North seems to have decided on their next step," Naewoe Press said, according to the Associated Press in Seoul. "It sounded like it's going to be taking a pretty hard-line measure soon."
Yang Sung Chul, professor of political science at Kyunghee University in Seoul, said he did not think that North Korea would rush to begin refueling because it did not want to "burn its bridges." In a rare move, North Korea has invited thousands of foreigners to an international sports festival in Pyongyang starting next Friday. "I don't think they want to create tension and spoil the festival," Professor Yang said.
Renewed nuclear tensions would also be likely to stop the foreign investment that seems to be on the verge of starting in North Korea. It would also halt its progress toward normalizing relations with the United States and Japan.

HEADLINE: In India, U.S. Diplomacy Is Sounding a Lot Like Economics

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: BOMBAY, India, April 20

 BODY:
Just hours before Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his entourage landed amid the chaos and crushing poverty of this historic trading center, the power grid for much of the area failed, plunging the homes that have electric power into darkness.
Such failures are fairly common here. But for Mr. Rubin, the fourth American Cabinet member to visit India since the start of the year, the timing was exquisite. Each official came to persuade India's leaders that it was not in their interest to allow a slowing in the broad movement to open their economy. 
 Each of the Americans has gone on to add that one early test would be to assure the completion of an American-built power plant near Bombay, one of the country's first privately constructed plants, which would help to relieve an overburdened, aging power system. But the contract, completed less than two months ago, has already run into trouble from politicians who charge that by letting American companies into a once-sealed market, India is submitting to a new form of imperialism.
In his first trip abroad, a round-the-world tour that took him from Indonesia to Dublin, Mr. Rubin constantly found himself walking a fine line between persuading countries like India to embrace deeper reforms beloved of international investors, and not appearing to be a visiting trade negotiator demanding instant change.
This is the kind of tough balancing act that marks the new era of American foreign policy. Now, the looming issues between the United States and India are not New Delhi's role in the nonaligned movement or its nuclear-weapons program, but the liberalization of its shallow and corrupt financial markets, its reluctance to allow private competition in the insurance business and its slowness in sweeping away choking regulations that date to the British Raj.
To travel with Mr. Rubin, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company and a man with an uncanny ability to cut through economic obfuscation, is to witness how much the age of economic diplomacy thrusts the United States into the heart of other nations' domestic economic policies.
In four days here, he dug into the guts of the country's changing economic structure at an extraordinary level of detail.
Meeting with American executives in New Delhi, he debated whether the United States should push India to create a Securities and Exchange Commission. He urged Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, who has slowed the economic reform movement after a series of political setbacks, to finally allow foreign insurance companies to enter the Indian market, which has been controlled by Government-run firms. He grappled with the question of what to do about ancient taxes levied against every truckful of products that passes a state border -- both slowing the process of moving goods and increasing their cost.
"This is a long-term effort," Mr. Rubin said midway through his trip. "We have to help build a successful society in order to build markets for American goods 10 or 15 years down the line. But we also have to be extremely respectful of what they have done, and make it clear we're certainly not meddling."
Mr. Rubin repeatedly edited his speeches to remove wording that seemed to lecture India about the need for change, and when answering questions often offered what he called "a perspective on what the markets will require."
If that was the message, then it often did not translate. News accounts in Indian newspapers of Mr. Rubin's visit frequently sounded the theme of American pressure, and suggested that the demands of "the market" were really the demands of the United States.
Just as Mr. Rubin arrived here, the opposition parties blocked approval of legislation in Parliament that would strengthen patent and copyright protection as required under a new world trade agreement; it was a provision Washington had pressed for vigorously. But the reality is that it would help put out of business companies here that copy American software or make knockoffs of Kellogg's corn flakes. Opponents of Mr. Rao have seized on it as evidence that he is bowing to the United States.
When Mr. Rubin announced midway through his trip that he would have postponed his visit if he had known that Iran's President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, would be there at the same time on a state visit, the Treasury Secretary was described in the Indian press as "displaying a petulance beyond his brief."
"Does the U.S. consider India as a banana republic?" an Indian paper, The Hindustan Times, asked. It suggested that even though the United States is by far India's largest trading partner and source of investment, New Delhi should keep its distance, rather than follow "America's shifting allergies and preferences, which make yesterday's friends today's foes, and vice-versa."
The incident underscored the mixed emotions that the new, economically driven foreign policy has evoked. On the one hand, Indian officials say they welcome the sudden high-level attention from Washington, including two visits by Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary, focusing on the country's tremendous needs for electric power, and one by Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who traveled with a small army of chief executives and used the moment to seal about $6 billion in deals. But now the pressure has come to seem a bit overwhelming.
"If the impression develops, and it has, that America is delving deeply into the details of India's economic policy, it will have a backlash," said S. L. Rao, director general of the National Council for Applied Economic Research in New Delhi. "There has not been enough effort to show that these kinds of linkages solve the problem of health or education or poverty, and that makes them easy political targets."
Mr. Rubin made that effort repeatedly, even spending a day at a World Bank site in a remote mountain area where deeply impoverished villagers are being taught how to work the land so that it retains more monsoon rainfall, increasing the harvest. But in a country only beginning to learn about international capital markets, it is far harder to make the case that reforming the workings of the Bombay stock exchange will soon help the poor.
Even when the benefit seems obvious -- such as the power plant in Maharshita State near Bombay under construction by the Enron Corporation, Bechtel and General Electric -- political problems abound. Mr. Rao's Congress Party lost the state election last month, and in a battle that seems to have more to do with politics than electric power, the new state government has vowed to review the awarding of the contract to the American companies.
India is hardly the only country, of course, where the United States has thrust itself into the innermost plumbing of the domestic economy. It has done so for years in Japan, seeking to sweep away hidden trade barriers. In recent months it has mandated broad, highly specific rules for Mexico -- down to what its trade balances should look like and what its interest-rate policy should be -- as the price that country must pay for a $20 billion bailout.
But both those cases involve large trading partners, in which the United States holds a tremendous economic stake. India, in comparison, is tiny, attracting a scant $1.6 billion of American investment in 1992 and 1993, the last years for which there are reliable figures. Over the same period, American companies invested seven times more in China, and six times more in Thailand, a country of only 20 million, compared with 900 million in India.
Mr. Rubin and other American officials say they are being motivated by the experience in China, where the United States waited too long, let too many competitors enter the market first, and then engaged too late in long battles with the Chinese to end market practices that discriminated against foreign companies.

HEADLINE: Earth Day at 25: Promoting a Cleaner Environment and a More Effective Bureaucracy

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 22

 BODY:
Celebrating a quarter-century of modern environmentalism, hundreds of volunteers performed an Earth Day ritual along the Anacostia River today, hauling debris out of one of the nation's most poisoned waterways.
The crowd had gathered at the bowers of the National Arboretum to enjoy a sunny day on the tainted river that runs across the nation's capital, joining the much cleaner Potomac not far from the waterfront towers of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 "I have always maintained that if E.P.A. and the Corps of Engineers cannot restore this river, where on the planet can they do it?" said Robert E. Boone, the head of the Anacostia Watershed Society, a local voluntary group.
On a day when environmentalists all over the country were torn between celebrating the undeniable achievements of the last 25 years and fretting over the demise of their political clout when they see much left to be done, they could at least find in organizations like the small Anacostia River group a continuing source of strength. Just as all politics is local, environmentalism is, too.
This drawing power at the grass roots could prove increasingly important as powerful business groups vie with large national conservation groups to influence public opinion and win lawmakers' loyalty at a time when the basic tenets of environmental laws are being reconsidered. The eventual winner may be the side that argues most persuasively at the local level.
For just this reason, Greenpeace, one of the more militant of the large groups, deliberately avoided the crowded gala on Washington's grassy downtown mall celebrating the 25th Earth Day. Instead, it sent canoes and speedboats to the smaller Anacostia River event, just as it joined small neighborhood activities across the country, said Rick Hind, a spokesman for the group. "Our theme around the country is to honor and promote small local efforts," he said.
The same attitude is showing up in the Government's environmental bureaucracy, which is trying to capture some of the energy that exists in the Anacostia Watershed Society and its cousins all over the country.
Increasingly, Federal officials say they believe that local actions like trying to restore the Anacostia may be more effective than new national programs.
At the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, senior managers have been trying to come up with a style of management that is rooted in places, not in programs or permits or even politics.
In this new way of thinking, the agency's work would be driven by the environmental needs of communities and ecosystems. Decisions would be based on detailed understanding of the economic and social as well as ecological concerns of specific places.
So far, the bureaucrats can't seem to decide whether to call it "place-driven" or "community-based" protection.
"I don't think it is just a new buzzword," said Dana Minerva, a water quality official at the agency. "It is an important way of changing how we do our thing. Of course, E.P.A.'s role as a national standards-setter is very important, and the people who do the work on how many parts per billion of a chemical cause cancer is very important. But the work that needs to be done in communities is the most satisfying."
In true bureaucratic style, the agency's first step was to publish a 357-page "Phase 1 Inventory of Current E.P.A. Efforts to Protect Ecosystems," a kind of guide to hundreds of local activities like those along the Anacostia.
In the case of the Anacostia, the agency's involvement has come slowly, in part because the river runs through poor urban neighborhoods without even a vote in Congress. Federal aid has only trickled in. But the Clinton Administration considers the river a model for how to manage the problems of polluted watersheds, and a place to redress environmental racism, the term used to describe what some say is the tendency to ignore serious pollution in poor areas with high minority populations.
All the good intentions of laws and bureaucracies have not yet made the Anacostia River safe for fish or swimmers.
The raw sewage of Washington still spills into the stream when heavy rains overwhelm the treatment plant, and pollutants from runoff from poor city neighborhoods and wealthier suburbs settle in the riverbed. In a survey last year, the Smithsonian Institution found that 15 of 20 catfish netted in the stream had cancerous livers. In clean water, no catfish is likely to have liver cancer.
But none of that discouraged the youthful crowd that took to the water today, arriving in school buses and in station wagons and on bicycles in a reaffirmation of that chestnut of environmental sloganeering, the commandment to think globally and act locally.
Their activities were typical of those going on in hundreds of towns and cities across the country -- planting trees, sprucing up parks, teaching about recycling -- as grass-roots organizations celebrated Earth Day.
Dozens of organizations sought to make the 25th Earth Day a time to increase political pressure on Washington not to roll back Federal environmental regulations. On campuses, students circulated petitions and urged one other to call and write their representatives in Congress.
In big cities, there were outdoor concerts and rallies likely to draw hundreds of thousands of people, and the speeches dripped with denunciations of the Republican Contract With America and what it would do to environmental laws.
But along the Anacostia River, the children, the students and even many of the adults who came to clean up did not seem terribly concerned about the changes being contemplated in Congress, including proposed changes to the Clean Water Act that many conservationists say would only slow down the cleanup of the Anacostia.
Even those who were well informed seemed to be saying they intended to achieve a cleaner environment regardless of what happened on Capitol Hill.
"Things we expected Government to do, Government can no longer do, so it falls on people to act as stewards of the areas that they themselves have dominion over," said Ulysses Garner, who brought a group of children to the scene.
One girl, 10-year-old Kathleen Crosby of Chelham, Md., said she believed the Government was doing its part and she was doing hers. "They have spent some money, so we thank them by helping to clean up the environment, to pay them back," she said.

HEADLINE: India Presses U.S. to Pass Biotic Treaty

BYLINE: By SANJOY HAZARIKA 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, April 22

 BODY:
India says it will seek to block American access to medicinal plants and other biological material from the third world unless the United States ratifies the international Biodiversity Convention by this summer.
The material -- herbs, medicinal plants, leaves, shrubs, roots, seeds and flowers -- is used in the drug, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, which are dominated by American and European companies. 
 "We cannot wait forever, and we do not want to be pushed into any corner," Environment Minister Kamal Nath said in making the announcement on Thursday. "But if the ratification does not take place in the next three months, then obviously we must prevent other countries from taking advantage of the benefits accruing from our genetic material."
The United States is the only major developed nation that has not ratified the treaty. It has been signed by 171 nations and ratified by 120. The figure includes the European Union as a unit, though, as well as each of its member countries.
Last year, the ratification process was killed in the Senate, largely because of Republican opposition, and the chances of passage are even slimmer now that Republicans control Congress.
In an interview, Mr. Nath said international drug and pharmaceutical corporations generated $30 billion in business every year on the basis of biological material imported from poor countries.
"The mega-biodiverse countries of Latin America, South and Southeast Asia are waiting for India to take the lead," Mr. Nath said. "If we do not have progress this summer then we will meet to map out a joint strategy on the transfer of genetic material."
The central purpose of the biodiversity treaty is to help prevent the extinction of flora and fauna around the world. But this has been overshadowed by contention over the use of developing countries' biotic resources by American companies and arrangements for transferring the fruits of the resulting research back to the third world.
The Indian position -- which has support from major countries with diverse biological resources like Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia -- was first made public Tuesday after Mr. Nath and Timothy E. Wirth, the American Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, signed an agreement for closer cooperation between the two countries on scientific and technological research.
Mr. Wirth pointed out at the time that although the Bush Administration had declined to sign the Biodiversity Convention at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the Clinton Administration had done so soon after assuming office.
"The President proposes, but Congress disposes," Mr. Wirth said, adding that the Administration would resume the process and push strongly for swift ratification.
He later acknowledged the difficulties in moving ahead in a Republican-dominated Congress.
Western diplomats and Indian commentators have also said the problem of ratification in Washington was similar to the Indian Government's difficulties in getting Parliament to clear a crucial clause in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs that relates to intellectual property rights.
India had long resisted the clause, while American electronics, drug and pharmaceutical manufacturers have pressed for it, accusing Indian companies of patent piracy.
India finally agreed to fall into line with American policy on the issue after opening its economy to foreign investment. The change was denounced by opposition groups.
The Government is in a minority in the upper house of Parliament, and the opposition has declared that it will not allow the process to go through, thus stalling ratification.
"This is not a trade-off for the other side's ratifying the Biodiversity Convention, but clearly this is not a one-way street" said a senior Indian official.

HEADLINE: In School Bus Dispute, Focus Shifts From the Drivers to the Companies

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
In pressuring for savings in the $316 million the city spends each year on school bus service, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his aides had harsh words for bus company owners, most of whom have been able to renew their contracts with the Board of Education without fear of competition since 1979.
The Mayor described the bus companies as profiteers, combining brinkmanship with the threat of competition, as he did in showdowns last year with Legal Aid lawyers and school custodians. His chief labor official, Randy L. Levine, accused the operators of "sucking the blood out of the Board of Education." 
 But company owners protest that theirs is not a lucrative business. They contend that the same system that has guaranteed them continued work has also guaranteed shrinking profits. Yet they also warn that the more open competition proposed by the Mayor may force some companies out of business and leave workers unemployed, while paradoxically failing to save the city money.
The Mayor, who had earlier focused his attacks on the bus workers' unions, calling for an end to lifetime job security for drivers, toned down his attacks last week, after bus drivers agreed to call off a strike planned for tomorrow, when the spring recess ends.
Labor negotiations are continuing over the weekend, and while the Mayor appears to have softened his stance against the job security provision, he seems intent on bringing competitive bidding to the busing operation.
Several company owners say that their profit margins are thin, and that the city could lose more than it gains unless there are significant wage concessions by the union. Their arguments have largely been supported by Board of Education officials and by a report by KPMG Peat Marwick, consultants hired by the board to look for savings in the busing operation.
"I think the profits being earned are fairly slim," said Barry F. Sullivan, the board's chief operations officer and a former banker. "We can't be sure how much of a savings we'll get, but we've got to try everything to save money in this climate."
Several company owners, as well as Peat Marwick, point to the experience of Varsity Transit, which once held 80 percent of the city school bus contracts, to illustrate the problems with competitive bidding.
In 1979, to save money, city and school officials decided to divide Varsity's routes into more than 100 separate contracts and ask for competitive bids. Bus drivers, escorts and mechanics struck because they stood to lose jobs. After three months of disruption, the city settled by agreeing to require that companies taking over routes hire existing workers without pay cuts.
This effectively precluded cheaper competitors from emerging, so except for a few times since then, the Board of Education has given companies three-year extensions, rather than seek bids.
Though it lost much of its business in 1979, Varsity remained the largest bus company, with more than 600 routes. But in 1986, it refused to renew 453 contracts, which were put to competitive bidding.
"We gave them up because we were losing money," Burton Cooper, Varsity's president, said in an interview last week.
Annual increases in the amount the Board of Education paid the bus companies were limited to the consumer price index, the increase in the carrier's labor costs, or a fixed figure of 4 to 7 percent, whichever of the three was least.
With those controls, Mr. Cooper said, "It's better to take your chances with competition and maybe not get the business than to be guaranteed a slow but steady disaster."
Varsity bid on its former contracts, but lost most of them. The Board of Education ended up paying 12 percent more, or $17 million over five years, than it would have under a contract extension. "They paid a high price for competition," Mr. Cooper said.
The city's formula for payments to bus companies squeezes owners, said Dominic F. Gatto Jr., president of Atlantic Express, the city's largest school-bus franchise holder with about $60 million a year in city business.
"If the labor costs go up faster than the cost of living, we get the cost of living and our profits drop," he said. "If the cost of living goes up faster than our labor costs, we get our labor costs and again, our profits drop. It's a formula for falling farther behind every year."
Mr. Gatto said his company's yearly profits were 3 to 4 percent, or between $1.8 million and $2.4 million. "If we have to compete, we'll compete," he said. "But at the end of the day, I don't think they can save any money."
Peat Marwick concluded that even if contracts are put out to bid and job security provisions are eliminated, "there is the strong potential that prices will ultimately be as high or substantially higher than current prices."
Most of the bus companies are privately held and family owned, and most started small, when Varsity controlled all but the margins of the market. Mr. Gatto, a disabled Vietnam veteran, said he took a job as a driver for a small, 21-van fleet in 1972 because he needed work that would allow him to stay off his feet.
Two years later, he bought the company with borrowed money. Over two decades, through bidding on contracts as they became available and buying small competitors, he built a 750-route company, with two subsidiaries, Staten Island Bus Company and Amboy Bus Company.
Mr. Gatto's operation resembles others in New York in that it encompasses subsidiaries. While the Board of Education lists 78 separate companies with busing contracts, the market is still concentrated among a handful of firms. When companies with overlapping or identical ownership and shared garages and offices are considered as one, there are actually fewer than 40 separate concerns.
Eight companies or groups of related companies, including Atlantic, dominate the market, with 73.5 percent of the 3,805 routes and well over $200 million a year in city business.
In 1989 and 1990, law enforcement officials said that several of the bus companies had ties to organized crime. Board of Education officials say that as a result, 10 companies and several individuals were banned from the business, and law enforcement officials say that mob influence has declined.
The contracts at issue in the current negotiations, expiring June 30, are for 620 routes but are held by five of the eight major companies. Any concessions they make are expected to set the pattern for the future.
The companies have two large incentives to try to retain their city business. One is the capital they have invested, mostly in buses, maintenance equipment and garages. Some of the companies have borrowed heavily for this; Mr. Gatto said his debt totaled a relatively heavy $51 million, with annual revenues that total, for all operations, about $100 million.
Moreover, the owners face stiff immediate liabilities for pension plans if they lose their contracts. Under state law, bus companies are permitted to set aside only a fraction of the pension benefits earned by their employees, but a company that loses its contracts becomes immediately liable for the entire amount. For larger companies, that figure would be several million dollars.
Because of these factors, owners warn, many carriers would be bankrupted by a significant loss of business.

HEADLINE: A Lull in Battle Over the Pinelands, as All Wait for Whitman to Take Sides

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: CHATSWORTH, N.J. April 16

 BODY:
This is the New Jersey Pinelands, a million acres of scrub pine and sand roads in the heart of the most densely populated state in the nation, a place so sparsely inhabited that a fire earlier this month burned an area larger than Manhattan without touching a single house.
To conservationists, the fact that a fire of such magnitude caused no damage to people or property testifies to the success of development controls in the Pinelands, which are sometimes popularly called the Pine Barrens. And conservationists are asking, increasingly insistently, whether environmental regulations that took decades to put in place, here and across the state, will survive the administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman as easily as the piney woods have bounced back from the spring fire season. 
 Until now, Mrs. Whitman's environmental record has been more form than substance. Environmentalists complain about her promises to make it easier for industry to obtain permits from the Department of Environmental Protection, for example, but no one has yet cited a case of a polluter who got away with it. They criticize her cuts in the department's workweek, but favor her plan to wean the department from dependence on fees and fines from regulated industries.
Mrs. Whitman has been outspoken in her support of the State Plan, an anti-sprawl blueprint to encourage growth in already built-up areas. On the other hand, she has proposed uniform statewide rules for new construction -- rules that environmentalists fear would undermine more stringent local ones.
The equivocal reaction to the Governor in the green movement was neatly illustrated last month, when a coalition of environmental and conservation groups called a news conference promising to issue a report card on her first year in office. Reporters who came hoping for fireworks went away disappointed when all of the Governor's grades turned out to be incompletes.
Members of the groups that called the news conference explained that they were trying to alert the public to issues facing the Governor, not pass judgment on her policies. Indeed, some of them acknowledged that in certain ways Mrs. Whitman has made a good start.
"I think Governor Whitman has said a lot of things that are encouraging to environmentalists," said Sally Dudley, head of the Association of New Jersey Environmnental Commissions, one of the groups participating in the conference. But then she cited what she found discouraging: the Governor's budget cuts and proposed statewide construction rules.
Environmentalists are especially vigilant when it comes to the board that regulates the Pinelands, where large-scale development is restricted to the perimeter of the 1,700-square-mile preserve and where even the use of private property is tightly controlled.
The Pinelands Commission came into being in the late 1970's. Its 15-member board has seven gubernatorial appointees, seven from counties touched by the preservation district, and one appointed by the United States Secretary of the Interior. They serve three-year terms and can be reappointed indefinitely.
In the past, governors' appointees have tended to advocate controls, and have held sway over the more development-minded county appointees. As a result, thousands of privately held acres in the no-growth area have been rendered all but worthless because they cannot be significantly developed. Many owners have ended up giving their land to conservation groups in exchange for tax breaks.
Governor Whitman says she believes that there is room for diversity of opinion on the board. Her director of communications, Carl Golden, suggested as much when he said her approach would be to provide it with "balance."
But to Sally Price, head of the Pinelands Preservation Alliance, there is nothing to balance. "The charter says to preserve the values of the Pinelands," she said recently, "so I don't know where balance comes into that. I question if you can have votes that represent group interests and still carry out the charter to preserve, protect, and enhance. The word 'enhance' we never get to -- we barely protect."
Two of Mrs. Whitman's three appointees so far have tilted distinctly toward the development side, Ms. Price said. Daniel Galetta of Hammonton, an appraiser and engineer, was a candidate backed by farm interests, and Jay Edward Mounier of Franklinville is a farmer.
Farmers generally support the protection of open space afforded by the Pinelands rules, but they also in some cases favor development rights because development increases property values.
The third Whitman appointee, Daniel Kelleher of Medford, a water utility president, is regarded as a supporter of existing Pinelands rules.
Gov. Brendan T. Byrne's seven original appointees in the late 70's were "tree-hugging environmentalists," Ms. Price said, adding that today only one of them, Candace McKee Ashmun, a physicist, remains on the board.
Steven Lee, a board member who is a third-generation cranberry farmer in Chatsworth, argues for balance between property rights and preservation.
"I agree that conservation is important," Mr. Lee said, noting that his family farms only a fraction of its property, having kept more than a thousand acres in woodland. "But I don't agree that conservation is so important that it overrides the economic rights of inhabitants."
Mr. Lee, who was appointed by Gov. Thomas H. Kean in the mid-80's, approves of Governor Whitman's appointments to the board. He has upset preservationists by pushing the commission to respond more quickly to requests for development permits, and to delegate the granting of permits for driveways and other minor construction to local municipal authorities.
"The commission doesn't have to be involved in every single regulatory decision," he said.
While Ms. Price and others worry that speeding up the permit process may cut back on protection, Ida Anderson thinks things cannot change fast enough. Ms. Anderson, a Shamong Township businesswoman, heads an 800-member Pinelands property owners group, Aspire.
"If they want to have a Pinelands Commission," Ms. Anderson said, "it should be advisory only. The one we have is driving us off our land."
John Battistini, Mayor of Estell Manor in the heart of the no-growth area, agrees.
"When the Pinelands came in," he said, "we didn't think it would affect us." Instead, in the last five years, land with an assessed value of $11 million has been given to the town or to nonprofit, untaxed conservation groups, as owners discovered it was undevelopable and therefore unsellable.
"Our taxes are going up and people are leaving," Mayor Battistini said. "We're literally being preserved to death."

HEADLINE: Slaying Inquiry in Wales Tests DNA of 150 People

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: CARDIFF, Wales, April 18

 BODY:
Having had an occasional run-in with the law over his 30-odd years, John Jones, a resident of the St. Mellons housing project in northeast Cardiff, is not a big fan of the police.
But he went along when the police came knocking on his door recently, saying they would like a wee bit of his blood so as to analyze his DNA. Not that he was suspected of anything, mind you, but they wanted to rule him out in their investigation into the rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl. 
 "I wasn't arrested or anything," Mr. Jones said as he quaffed a midday pint of beer in the local pub. "I went in of my own accord. It was the right thing to do."
Saying they did not even consider the question of whether their strategy might raise concerns about coercion or civil liberties, the police have so far made the same request of 150 men and teen-agers in St. Mellons, some as young as 14. The police are using the blood samples to try to find a match to the DNA in the semen left behind in the body of the victim, a local girl named Claire Denise Hood. She was killed, apparently by strangulation, in the woods behind a shopping center as she played hookey from school.
The police have combed the woods for clues, and have gone door to door interviewing thousands of residents, but they have found no good clues to the identity of the girl's killer. Detective Superintendent Colin Jones of the South Wales Police, who is heading the St. Mellons investigation, said the fact that no one noticed any strangers entering or leaving the woods the day of the attack suggests that the killer was probably from the neighborhood.
If they do not turn up a genetic match from among those tested so far, the police said, they will eventually seek blood samples from every male over age 13 in the neighborhood -- more than 2,000 of them. It takes the police about two weeks to get the results back from the lab, and the first results are dribbling in now, showing no matches so far.
The use of DNA samples to try to establish guilt in criminal investigations in the United States and elsewhere is increasingly common, if still hotly debated on scientific and civil liberties grounds. But as the St. Mellons case suggests, no nation has been as aggressive in employing genetic "fingerprinting" as Britain.
Earlier this month, the British Government announced that it was starting the world's first DNA database of criminals, a computerized list that will eventually contain the genetic identification of 5 million Britons who have been convicted of serious crimes. Under new criminal justice laws that took effect this month, the police were also given the right to take hair roots, mouth swabs or other "non-intimate" samples for DNA testing from anyone they arrest on suspicion of a crime that carries a potential jail sentence, even if the suspect objects.
"This is a vital area in the fight against crime where Britain is leading the world," said Michael Howard, Britain's Home Secretary, who oversees law enforcement. "It's the biggest breakthrough since fingerprints."
Britain has tried semi-voluntary mass screenings like the one in St. Mellons before, with mixed results. Four years ago, the South Wales Police undertook the biggest effort to date when they screened 5,000 men in an unsuccessful attempt to find the killer of a 27-year-old woman.
Superintendent Jones said the police were not coercing anyone into giving a blood sample.
But he acknowledged that the screening, by forcing potential suspects to decide whether to cooperate, is an effective way of flushing out anyone who might have something to hide. And with more than three months having passed since the girl was killed, the police appear to have few other hopes for generating a break in the case.
The superintendent said "there is no disguising the fact that the individual would become of interest to us" if he failed to cooperate in the testing. Should a suspect be arrested, the DNA sample could be taken involuntarily under the new law.
So far, no one in St. Mellons has refused to be be "blooded," as the police say in referring to the procedure. A hematologist takes the samples at the local police station by drawing a vial of blood through a syringe.
"There are pockets of people who probably wouldn't give us the time of day in a less serious case who are happy to help us here," Superintendent Jones said. "I would like to think there is a genuine desire on their part to help us catch the killer of Claire Hood."
There have been few if any objections to the police tactics in the St. Mellons case, which is perhaps not surprising in a country where the political mood has swung distinctly toward tougher law enforcement. Britain has little tradition of civil liberties activism in the American mold.
Indeed, many people seem to favor the DNA sweep in St. Mellons, whose tidy townhouses and almost rural setting belie its relatively high rates of crime and unemployment. In an attempt to build support for the testing, the police held a news conference this month at which Steve Robinson -- the world featherweight boxing champion and the neighborhood's most famous resident -- urged local men "who have nothing to fear" to come forward to give a blood sample.
"The feeling around here is the sooner this guy is caught the better," said Malcolm Williams, a 45-year-old St. Mellons resident who has not yet been asked for a blood sample. "There are people who say we shouldn't have go through this testing. I think that's rather selfish myself. People should be suspect until proven innocent."
Leighton Smith, a 27-year-old resident who said he was scheduled for a test in a few days, said trying to match the DNA by urging local men to cooperate in the process would probably be the only way to solve the crime.
"Around here this kind of crime doesn't happen often," Mr. Smith said. "When it does, everyone helps out."
Among those being tested are the victim's male friends from school and other teen-agers in the area. So far, Superintendent Jones said, neither the youths nor their parents have objected to taking part in the screening.
While he declined to discuss his strategy in depth, local residents said it was clear that he was concentrating first on men with criminal records and on men and boys who either live close to the woods where the body was found or who were known to spend a good deal of time in the woods.
As a crime-fighting technique, mass DNA screenings do not come cheap. Superintendent Jones said it cost $72 to test each blood sample, or $144,000 if he eventually tests 2,000 men. He said that the South Wales police force had budget problems, but that he had received approval to spend about that amount if necessary.
"I'd still like to think we can solve this case through traditional police methods and good detective work," said the superintendent, who has a team of 50 officers working to find the killer. "But I'm quite prepared for the lab to call and say sample number whatever is the person responsible for the attack on Claire."

HEADLINE: April 16-22: A Great Divide;
The United States is the New Bastion of Inequality

BYLINE: By SARAH BOXER 

 BODY:
Of all the industrialized Western nations, not one has as great a gulf between rich and poor as the United States. While Congress argues about who must scrimp and who can save, new studies, based on figures from the 1980's, show that 40 percent of the nation's wealth is concentrated in only 1 percent of American households. Even Britain, a nation with a history of severe economic stratification, doesn't come close; the richest 1 percent of families there hold 18 percent of the country's wealth.
The United States is not only the most unequal nation in the West, but it is also "growing more unequal faster than the other industrialized countries," said Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University. One hundred percent of the increased wealth during the 1980's went to the top 20 percent of American families. Why? Possible explanations include: falling wages for unskilled labor, the decline of trade unions, low minimum wages and low tax rates on the wealthy. 
 Not everyone is alarmed by the trend. Murray L. Weidenbaum, a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan, said the gap may look wider than it is because food stamps and Medicaid were not counted as part of the wealth of the poor.

HEADLINE: For the Weary, a Day for Feeling Good About a Battered Planet

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
The sun shone, the breeze was soft and it was an altogether swell day to feel good about this battered old planet. So thousands of New Yorkers put on smiles and T-shirts to celebrate the 25th Earth Day with a parade up the Avenue of the Americas.
In most places, the sidewalks were not much more crowded than they would be on a weekday lunch hour. But the onlookers cheered enthusiastically for a succession of marchers dressed as garbage cans, smokestacks spewing cotton and endangered tropical bird species. 
 Other New Yorkers observed ecological themes -- and enjoyed a stunningly beautiful spring morning -- closer to home, cleaning parks and doing other environmental chores.
At the parade, there were marchers carrying tombstones with the names of endangered species and a styrofoam polar bear skeleton. Chinese lion dancers were covered with recyclable cans. A group of 20 unidentifiable forms slunk along under a menacing black tarp, imitating an oil spill. Maniacs with chainsaws, dollar bills in their eyes, chased terrified trees.
The marchers were interspersed with bands playing music ranging from samba to steel drums to plumbers' plastic pipes.
Because police insisted that the parade start promptly at 11 A.M., there was no time for a series of planned opening speeches. But there was time to read parts of a proclamation from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who declared that the air, the harbor and the city's drinking water have all greatly improved since the first Earth Day in 1970.
"Let us dedicate ourselves to make New York City by the year 2000 the best and cleanest city it can be," the proclamation said.
But others muttered to one another about the threat to environmental laws passed after the first Earth Day, as some politicians in Washington have questioned their economic cost. A man wearing a Newt Gingrich mask and wielding a pair of giant shears threatened to lop off the head of a fleeing daisy.
"If we don't take care of the earth, it won't take care of us," said Rick Carrier, a Manhattan writer wearing his World War II Army uniform for the occasion. "People do not have a focus."
Robert Marvin, an insurance salesman in Westchester County, was so bedraped with plastic bottles that he appeared to have no head. "I just decided it was time to get off my behind and do something," he said.
One group of demonstrators were dressed in black, carrying signs with the names of such major corporations as Sony and Exxon. "We're the world corporations," said Rob Youngblood, a 16-year-old from the Bronx. "We destroy the environment."
A group of women paraded about in garbage containers -- half of them metal and overflowing with discarded metal, plastic and paper, the other half blue plastic ones full of properly sorted recyclables. One in a metal can, Noelle Gracy, a graduate student in neuroscience at Cornell Medical Center, said, "We're the leftovers, the trash of the trash."
A colleague also clad in metal, Faith Schwartz, a community development worker, added lightly, "The leftovers of the left."
The mood was as light as the ubiquitous bottles of spring water. A group of demonstrators wore long coats made of growing grass. One of grass patches said that they were the ecologically responsible replacement for fur. Another, laughing, suggested that dogs could pose a bit of a problem.
The designer of the grass outfits is an artist who said he had adopted the name Gene Pool to make people think. "These coats are the only chance to be completely enclosed in a living thing beside the womb," he said.
Some of the more heartfelt celebrations were far removed from the parade. In Central Park, more than 70 volunteers showed up at Turtle Pond to clean the leaves and tidy up the surrounding area. "It brings an element of nature to a concrete world," said one volunteer, Jess Sogelman.
In Manhattan Valley, at La Perla Garden on 105th Street, the aroma of fresh flowers wiped away memories of the smells of urine and marijuana nearby. Sue Schmidt surveyed the garden she created three years ago between two brick buildings in a drug-plagued neighborhood.
"We celebrate Earth Day through work," she said, as she waited for friends to arrive to help repair a retaining wall.
"We celebrate by creating something beautiful and enjoying it," she said. "Knowing what this used to be -- a dumping ground -- and seeing a beautiful garden today makes me optimistic that this can be done everywhere. There's no reason New York City can't have these pockets of hope."

Wine, Roses, Then and Now

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

 BODY:
When a couple hundred veterans of New York City's last fiscal crisis gathered last week to honor former Gov. Hugh Carey, they were eager to trade war stories about the heroic effort to keep the city out of bankruptcy. There were not many emissaries from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki, perhaps because they felt they had little to learn from such ancient history. But the lessons for today were clear.
First was the need for cooperation and shared sacrifice across ideological and even class lines. For example, there was Mr. Carey, the combative Democrat from Brooklyn, embracing Warren Anderson, a Republican from Binghamton, N.Y., who as the State Senate majority leader was his indispensable partner for saving the city. There were Victor Gotbaum, then the city's most powerful labor leader, and Walter Wriston, then chairman of Citicorp, the city's most powerful bank, another set of onetime enemies who found common purpose in avoiding municipal bankruptcy. 
 Another critical part of the bailout that many people forget was cited by Peter Goldmark, now president of the Rockefeller Foundation but then state budget director, who noted that a temporary tax increase helped serve as a bridge to solvency. Only after the state and city met their budget goals were taxes cut again. Today such a step would be unthinkable, with both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki compounding already grievous budget cuts by pushing for bigger tax cuts. Their approach is not simply fiscally unsound; it undermines the essential idea that everyone, even taxpayers, should be prepared to forgo something to get out of the current crisis.
The fiscal crisis of 1975 was more dire and dramatic than anything the Mayor and Governor face today. Each month, the city had to scramble to borrow huge sums to meet payments falling due and avoid Chapter 11. But those monthly crises at least focused the minds of New Yorkers in a way that the problems of today do not.
Once the financing needs of the city were met with help from Albany and Washington, and by declaring a moratorium on paying off debt that was later thrown out in court, the city bounced back because of underlying strengths that are also not available at present.
Back then, the city and state were heading into an economic recovery that swelled tax revenues and forestalled even deeper cuts. A Democratic governor and (after 1976) a Democratic President channeled aid to the city. Today, no such recovery is in sight, and neither is any help from Albany or Washington.
For next year, the city has a $3 billion budget deficit, and the state's deficit after Mr. Pataki's proposed tax cut is projected to be $5 billion. To the veterans of 1975 like Felix Rohatyn, architect and later chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, cuts of that size cannot possibly be carried out in one year without wrecking the social fabric of the city and state.
He called for a broad bipartisan agreement, involving labor unions and the private sector, to reform health care, the welfare system and other parts of government, bringing the deficits down over a period of years, not months. That would take a credible plan and long-term financing because in the short term it would mean more debts. But he observed ruefully and correctly that no one around today is providing the leadership or vision for such a strategy.
Mr. Rohatyn was hardly alone in declaring that Mr. Carey's brand of leadership does not exist today. Without the former Governor's vision and even his sense of humor, the city might not have been rescued from the brink. Like Mr. Pataki, Mr. Carey took office seemingly unaware of the depth of the crisis he faced. He proclaimed immediately that "the days of wine and roses are over," but then went on to tap the strength of diverse forces to build a tradition of cooperation that towers over what exists today. He made the impossible seem inevitable. That is not a bad legacy for anyone to build on. STEVEN R. WEISMAN

Why Is This Bowl of Noodles So Cheap?

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
To Vincent Mangano, 50, a supervisor at a cable company, Chinatown has always meant good food at cheap prices. So while he was on jury duty downtown one recent Tuesday, Mr. Mangano chose a Chinese noodle shop on Canal Street for lunch and ordered a heaping bowl of rice noodle soup with roast duck.
"It's a very balanced meal," Mr. Mangano said, pointing to the pieces of golden-colored duck crammed on top of the noodles and Chinese broccoli. "You've got carbohydrate, protein and vegetables in one bowl." 
 Nutrition aside, Mr. Mangano said what made his lunch enjoyable was the price: $3, which included a cup of tea.
But what Mr. Mangano did not see was that the waiter serving him was making around $15 a day, not including tips, averaging barely over $1 an hour for an 11-hour day, and no benefits. The minimum wage for waiters in New York State is $2.90 an hour. Nontipped kitchen staff should be paid the minimum wage, but few here are.
The mid-size restaurant where Mr. Mangano dined is just one of more than 500 restaurants in Chinatown that offer good foods at relatively inexpensive prices. Cheap labor, fierce competition between restaurants and the need to remain accessible to working-class Chinese, as well as tourists, keeps the prices low in all but a handful of banquet halls, despite high rents and increasing food and supply costs.
Oversupply of labor in Chinatown has kept wages at the low end of the industry pay scale. Workers are stuck here because they do not speak enough English to work in mainstream establishments. Adding to the glut are the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from Fujian, China, who are causing wages to drop even more.
"When the supply exceeds the demand by this much, the wage will not go up," said Emanuel Tobier, professor of economics and planning at the Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University. "It's the owners' market."
Even for $15 a day plus tips, jobs in Chinatown restaurants are hard to come by. Applicants flock to Chinatown employment agencies each morning. This puts pressure on those already employed. Although the mostly Cantonese-speaking Chinatown restaurant owners actually hire few of the Fujianese-speaking immigrants, employees still see these immigrants as threats.
"Of course, it's better to have health insurance, overtime pay and benefits," said Ai Young, a waiter who spoke on the condition that his last name not be used. "But if I leave today, there will be 10 people ready to take my job for less money."
Ai Young said, helped by tips, he averages $450 to $500 a week, although it takes him about 60 hours to make that much.
Like Ai Young, most workers often do not accept that long hours and low pay are forms of exploitation, believing instead that hard work is a necessary step to success. They look closely at those who came before them. Before becoming president of Chinatown's largest restaurant, Jing Fong, Chung Ko Cheng washed dishes for years in a Chinese takeout restaurant in Harlem.
Cultural constraints also make it difficult for workers to demand better treatment. Most Chinatown restaurants operate in a patriarchal way. Bosses are often viewed as father figures who watch out for workers and solve their problems.
Competition between businesses have also kept the prices low. When Chinatown was the only place to get authentic Chinese food and the only place where restaurants were open seven days a week, business bustled. But in recent years, many customers have stopped coming, as most mainstream restaurants began to stay open all week and added Chinese influence. At the same time, Chinese restaurants and noodle shops have cropped up all over, especially in Flushing, Queens, and Sunset Park, Brooklyn, where Chinese enclaves are growing.
"There is more pressure on owners to keep the price low to make their restaurants more attractive," said Clark Wolf, a food and restaurant consultant.
These days, although restaurants are still packed on weekends, Chinatown looks like a ghost town on weekdays. A walk through Chinatown on a Monday and a Tuesday evening, also traditionally busy nights for Chinatown restaurants, found most of the high- and middle-end restaurants with no more than seven tables in use per evening. In one, two waiters hovered over a table of four -- the only customer for the evening -- while the rest sat reading newspapers.
Although areas with many restaurants draw crowds and bring in profit, industry experts say Chinatown is so saturated that it has exceeded the maximum profit-making point and actually has diminishing profits.
Since February, a union, Local 318 Independent Restaurant Workers Union, which represents about 100 workers in two restaurants in Chinatown and Flushing, has been picketing Jing Fong and calling for better working conditions for all restaurant workers in Chinatown. But their efforts have been rebuffed by local business leaders, workers and community leaders, who showed their support for Jing Fong by raising $20,000 for it last month.
Owners say they are squeezed. While business is down, they must pay high rents, up to 12 percent of their total costs. (Mr. Wolf said the industry average is 4 to 8 percent).
"Chinatown rent is disproportionally high compared to the rest of the city," said Dean Lui, general manager of the New Golden Age Realty, a Chinatown real estate brokerage firm. "The real estate bust in the rest of the city a few years ago never affected prices here, because the demand to buy in Chinatown came from Asia."
Meanwhile, the cost of supplies has gone up. Gray sole, for example, has gone from $2.85 a pound three years ago to nearly $5 a pound.
"I would love to charge more than $3 for the noodles," said a manager, who insisted on anonymity. "But the fact is people just won't come here. There are so many other places they can go."
Prompted by the union's protest, restaurant owners are now working with the State Department of Labor to change their ways. The Chinese Restaurant Association has proposed raising prices to cover workers' benefits. Non-Chinese customers like Mr. Mangano say they would gladly pay more for the cause.
But some Chinatown residents say they are concerned that such an increase would crowd out the Chinese working class, for whom dining out has been a tradition. While Mr. Mangano is willing to pay more than $3 for noodles, Xing Guo, a street sock vendor, said he could not afford to.
"Three dollars is already too much for me," he said. "I only splurge like that once a week."

HEADLINE: Doctors Go Jobless, Patients Do Without;
Too Many Specialists

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Blaming health maintenance organizations for physician-specialist unemployment is like blaming the thermometer for the fever (front page, April 15). The United States has been producing an excess number of specialists for years. Medical schools and teaching hospitals have found training programs for specialists a source of low-cost labor, and the high-tech culture of most academic centers has provided students with specialists as role models. 
 By contracting only with physicians they need, health maintenance organizations have brought the oversupply issue to the surface by limiting the ability of specialists to "induce" demand by performing marginally useful procedures and tests.
The United States is headed toward a physician glut. Right-sizing of training programs and the flow of international medical graduates can match the supply of physicians to needs.

For Richer, for Poorer: Leyland and Alou Are Keeping the Faith

BYLINE: By CLAIRE SMITH 

 BODY:
You cannot blame Jim Leyland and Felipe Alou these days if they feel like straight men in an Abbott and Costello routine gone wrong.
Not only do these two managers stand a good chance of having to ask who's on first and what's on second when their respective teams -- the Pirates and Expos -- open each new season. They also know there is one other question they always have to ask about their players: Can we afford to keep them? 
 In baseball's new economic reality, the answer to that final question is often "no," a cold, hard response that the have-not teams say is increasingly necessary for survival.
The 234-day work stoppage that began last August and gobbled up the post-season is estimated to have cost the 28 clubs $700 million. One team -- the Kansas City Royals -- responded by paring over $11 million from its payroll, jettisoning David Cone, the 1994 American League Cy Young winner, and Brian McRae, one of the game's up-and-coming center fielders.
The Pirates, more experienced at shedding salaries, saw the free-agent center fielder Andy Van Slyke become the latest player to join an exodus that had previously carried away Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla and Doug Drabek from a team that, in the early 90's, was one of the best in baseball.
"Supposing we had the revenue to keep guys like that," Leyland said wistfully. "We would have had a pretty good team for quite a while."
And then there are the Expos. Before Alou could have his long-awaited spring training reunion with the club that made him the winningest manager in baseball in 1994, the heart of his team was all but ripped out.
John Wetteland, a talented reliever, was traded to the Yankees for $2 million, a minor leaguer and a player to be named later. Ken Hill, the Expos' No. 1 starter, was traded to the Cardinals. Larry Walker, an All-Star right fielder and free agent, found riches with the Colorado Rockies after Montreal concluded it could not re-sign him.
And, in the unkindest cut of all, the Expos' high-octane center fielder, Marquis Grissom, was traded to the already talent-laden Atlanta Braves, a division rival the Expos were besting when the 1994 season ended early.
"First the strike, then replacement players, then to lose those guys," Alou said, shaking his head. "It's just been weird. But I knew we were going to lose them. We had been told that if we didn't have a new kind of basic agreement with the players, our market wasn't going to be able to stay in that pay stream."
Alou makes such statements rather matter of factly. After all, his club had already parted with Delino DeShields, Dennis Martinez and Tim Wallach the previous two years, moves that lowered the team's payroll to $18 million, the second lowest in baseball in 1994.
"This just seems so bad, now, because it happened to be that we lost four guys this year," said Alou, whose team's payroll is now expected to dip under $10 million. "But we've been losing a number of people every year. If we turned around and picked up the people we've lost the last three years we probably have the best team in baseball."
It's a lament similar to Pittsburgh's.
"There will be times it's going to be difficult for him, as it was for me, not to wear it on his sleeve," Leyland said of Alou. "Sometimes you're going to get down. But Felipe Alou is one of the proudest human beings I've met in baseball. He's going to handle this and do good."
Thus far, the 58-year-old Alou has shown no signs of getting down as he prepares for his fourth year as the Expos' manager.
"I know we lost Grissom and Walker, but I have Tony Tarasco, Moises Alou, Roberto Kelly and Rondell White -- and I wish I could play all four in the outfield," Alou said. "We have the same infield that we had last year, even better, because of better backups. The catching is the same. So really, we are short two arms, because the loss of a stopper and an ace is tough."
So, warns a confident Alou, "we're going to give some people some bad nights. We're going to have fun."
Still, to sit and watch top players depart, for monetary rather than baseball reasons, goes against everything managers were taught to believe about molding winners.
"If you feel like it's going to be worth it in the end, then you don't mind working overtime, day after day after day," said the 50-year-old Leyland. "But if you feel that your work is going to be fruitless, that it's going to be for nothing, then that bothers you."
Leyland, in his 10th season as the Pirate manager, has had to deal with the frustration of losing in the National League playoffs three consecutive seasons -- 1990, 1991 and 1992 -- and never making it to the World Series. In 1993, the Pirates fell to 75-87; last year they were 53-61. If the game remains structured along class lines, it seems doubtful Leyland will get another shot at the post-season with Pittsburgh.
"What bothers me most, when they talk about Pittsburgh, is a lot of people just see us as some poor sister that doesn't have any money, that can't compete, that it's a horrible place to play, where the fans aren't any good," said Leyland. "That's the farthest thing from the truth.
"Pittsburgh is a great baseball city. We just don't get up-front money that other organizations get from their cable deals that gives them the luxury of getting players and keeping them."
In the past decade and a half, the Montreals and Minnesotas, the Pittsburghs and Kansas Citys did manage to keep enough talent to compete; in fact, only five of the last 15 World Series were won by teams from Los Angeles, New York and Toronto.
Still, the financial gulf is widening. And the question is whether teams like the Expos and Pirates will ever be able again to use their baseball instincts to overcome the deep-pocketed clubs.
"More power to them; I don't begrudge anybody anything," Leyland said of the big-market teams. "There's a difference between spending and spending wisely. What the small markets have to hope is that they don't spend it wisely, giving you a better chance to compete."
Still, there are concerns -- about future raids, future heartbreaks if the salary-arbitration eligibles and free agents can't be kept. "If you can retain them, there's some hope," Leyland said. "If you can't, then it looks pretty grim."
The battler in Leyland hasn't allowed him or his team to quit. The first workout after the strike ended included a fiery speech that made its way to national television.
"I was not trying to give a pep rally," Leyland said. "This is not a Saturday football game. But I just don't want these guys feeling sorry for ourselves like everybody else is. I won't have that.
"We were a small market when we won three straight years. We're still a small market. That doesn't change. So you get good players, again, develop them, win and hope you can retain them. Before, we did everything but retain them. I hope we learned some lessons since then. We know we have less leeway for mistakes right now; when we make an acquisition, we have to make sure it makes sense. I don't have any problem with that. In fact, that's not a bad little challenge."
Baseball already knows what Jim Leyland and Felipe Alou can do with a challenge in a somewhat fair fight. Only time will tell what they can do now that baseball guile, instead of baseball billions, is the only weapon left to them.

Expanding On-Line Services

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
MORE mutual funds are offering on-line investor services for everything from education to account information to interviews with fund managers.
Vanguard Online, available through America Online (keyword: Vanguard), offers a four-step course on creating a diversified portfolio. Investors can also retrieve prospectuses, get account information or share ideas with other investors on message boards. 
 The Montgomery funds joined the Internet's Networth investor service (http://www.xperts.montgomery.com/ 1) with a "Meet the Experts" program, a weekly commentary by fund managers based on investors' questions with the broadest appeal.
The Fidelity Investments on-line service can be found on the Internet's World Wide Web (http://www.fid-inv.com). Among other things, investors can use an asset allocation worksheet, review fund performance and other data, order prospectuses or retrieve a demonstration copy of Fidelity Online Xpress, which can be used to place orders for stocks, options and mutual funds, get price quotes and account balances.
 
Recovery Expected In Real Estate Funds
Real estate funds have fallen more than 3 percent so far this year, while domestic stock funds have risen nearly 9 percent. But coming off an incredible December, the moves do not necessarily indicate a long-term trend.
"We expected some retracing early in the year because of December," said Susan Belden, senior editor of the No-Load Fund Analyst, a San Francisco newsletter.
The outlook for the real estate funds is good, she said. The improvement in the real estate market merits higher valuations for the funds' investments, and cash flow and dividend yields are strong.
While only five funds specialized in real estate in 1990, with a total of $80 million in assets, there are now 22 funds with more than $1.5 billion under management, said A. Jason Windawi, an analyst with Morningstar, the mutual funds tracking service in Chicago.
Unlike health care, environmental and Latin American funds, which are fads based on industries or regions peripheral to the world economy, funds devoted to real estate allow investors to participate in one of the world's biggest classes of assets, commercial real estate, he said. For the most part, the funds buy real estate investment trusts, which trade like stocks and own a stake in properties.
Ms. Belden's favorites include Cohen & Steers Realty Shares in New York; CGM Realty and Fidelity Real Estate in Boston, and PRA Real Estate Securities in Chicago.
 
Emerging Markets
Despite the drubbing that the emerging markets have taken lately, many fund groups say the long-term outlook is strong for people willing to take the bumps along the way.
Warburg Pincus Emerging Markets, which carries no sales charge, will be co-managed by Richard H. King, manager of the top-performing Warburg Pincus International Equity, and Nicholas P. W. Horsley, the associate manager.
Calvert New Africa, with a sales charge of 2.5 percent and a redemption fee of 2 percent for shares held for less than two years, will be managed by New Africa Advisers and will seek opportunities on the Johannesburg stock exchange and other African markets.
Smith Barney Emerging Markets Portfolio, with a sales charge of 5 percent, can invest in equities in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America.

HEADLINE: Scientists and Engineers Need Broader Training, Report Says

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
The United States' system of doctoral education in science and engineering, while long a world model, should be reshaped to produce more "versatile scientists," rather than narrowly specialized researchers, according to a report by three of the nation's leading scientific advisory groups.
Many doctoral students are channeled into such specialization that they are not flexible enough for jobs involving new technologies and industries, a global marketplace, intensified economic competition, public health needs and environmental deterioration, the report said. 
 With openings for Ph.D.'s in decline at research universities, scientists and engineers "must be trained to broaden themselves," said Phillip A. Griffiths, director of the Institute for Advanced Research at Princeton University and head of the panel of academicians that issued the report.
The 19 panelists are members of the Committee on Science, Engineering and Public Policy, a standing committee drawn from members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine.
Titled "Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers," the report said that from 1977 to 1991, the proportion of all scientists and engineers with doctorates employed in colleges and universities declined to 43 percent from 51 percent. Only 31 percent of those awarded Ph.D.'s from 1983 to 1986 were in tenure-track positions or had gained tenure by 1991. More than half of new Ph.D. graduates work in nonacademic businesses or industry.
"You tell a graduate student he has a 60 percent chance of not working in academe and that comes as a major surprise," Dr. Griffiths said.
The report cites the end of the cold war, with declining defense-research grants, and the rapid growth of international competition in high-tech industries as causes of the shifting demand.
Most students spend eight or nine years getting a Ph.D., Dr. Griffiths said, and should get better guidance about whether to pursue the degree. A mathematics major, he said, might "instead go for a master's degree in business administration or add engineering to his mathematics so he can learn how to design bridges."
"When they get their Ph.D.'s," Dr. Griffiths said, "many people decide they aren't interested in a teaching career and they wind up at Goldman, Sachs, the brokerage firm. We'd like to see them make that decision earlier."
Despite "worrisome indicators of weakness in the market" for new Ph.D.'s in science and engineering, and particularly in mathematics and physics, the panel did not recommend "across-the-board limits on enrollment."
Instead, it said "extensive, disciplined research experience" would prepare Ph.D. students for "a wide variety of nontraditional careers for which scientific and technical expertise is relevant."
The report was praised by Walter Massey, provost of the University of California system and a former director of the National Science Foundation.
"For a long time, I have been saying that we are preparing students to follow in the footsteps of their professors, yet that's not the way it's going to be," Mr. Massey said.
"Some people say we should control the supply of Ph.D.'s, but I think it would be a terrible mistake to deny that opportunity to the people who want it," he continued. "It's better to open up the demand for them by giving them a different kind of training so they could work in different areas."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 26, 1995, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about a report recommending more versatility in the doctoral training of scientists and engineers misidentified the research institute at which one author, Phillip A. Griffiths, is director. It is the Institute for Advanced Study based in Princeton, N.J.; it is not the Institute for Advanced Research at Princeton University. The two institutions are not affiliated.

LOSING GROUND
American Environmentalism
at the Close of the Twentieth Century.
By Mark Dowie.
317 pp. Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press. $25. 
AS far as Mark Dowie is concerned, the national environmental movement is "courting irrelevance." Why? Because the people leading its largest organizations are too white, too male, too elite, too polite and too involved with Washington.
Mr. Dowie first offered this analysis in a pathbreaking article three years ago in World Policy Journal. He predicted then that unless the movement changed its tactics and its leadership, its influence and its economic base would erode. In "Losing Ground," he reports that this is precisely what happened. What makes "Losing Ground" one of the truly important books on a genuinely American social movement is Mr. Dowie's ability both to ferret out the telling fact and to make a cohesive narrative out of a complex and fractious story. By turns curious, contemptuous, even irritable, this is a courageous critique of a movement that Mr. Dowie, a former editor and publisher of Mother Jones magazine, has long admired.
The tale told here is not pretty. As chronicled by Mr. Dowie, the environmental movement's senior leaders, while selling themselves to a willing public as above reproach, have quietly conducted their business, especially their business in Washington, just like any other special interest.
In the late 1980's, for instance, Dean Buntrock, chief executive officer of Waste Management Inc., the country's largest toxic waste disposal company, joined the board of the National Wildlife Federation, one of the country's biggest conservation groups, and became a reliable contributor. Shortly afterward, Jay Hair, head of the federation, attended a breakfast meeting with his friend William K. Reilly, then Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Mr. Buntrock. The subject under discussion: helping Mr. Buntrock overcome state and Federal regulations that were stopping his company from opening new hazardous waste dumps in South Carolina and New Jersey.
Mr. Dowie writes that mediation on behalf of industry has become more common in the 90's as the national groups' membership rolls and revenues have declined. The organizations attribute their woes to the election of Bill Clinton and Al Gore and a public perception that a team friendly to the environment was in charge. Mr. Dowie argues that the sources of the movement's problems are considerably deeper, and that it includes supporters' dismay at the extent to which the groups are mired in their own bureaucracies and unwilling to work on new issues.
By far the best display of Mr. Dowie's formidable ability as an investigator is seen in his discussion of fund raising, and especially of how some of the largest foundations -- notably the foundations of industrial families -- gained enormous influence over the agenda of the national environmental community.
Traditionally, environmental groups decided what issues were the most pressing and applied for grants to set up programs to address them. In the late 80's and early 90's, Mr. Dowie writes, the cycle was reversed. Dissatisfied with the effectiveness of national groups, the foundations began to decide among themselves what were the most important issues, proceeded to set aside millions of dollars and solicited grant applications from environmental groups.
What this turnabout represents, Mr. Dowie argues, is no more and no less than political subcontracting. It kept the large environmental groups in business, but ultimately it weakened the movement.
Not long ago environmentalists were led by "committed warriors" like David Brower, the former head of the Sierra Club. In the 60's and 70's, Mr. Brower and his contemporaries attracted attention and money -- and gained political influence -- by rousing the grass roots. Now, Mr. Dowie argues, the movement is led by bland lawyers and M.B.A.'s whose primary interest is "developing entrepreneurial skills and organizational enhancement skills" designed to collect money from big business and industrial foundations. Ostensibly working to defend the environment, they are actually shoring up their bottom lines.
It's a strategy that's failing, Mr. Dowie says. And indeed, the loose coalition of property owners, ranchers, small-business executives and municipal officials known as the wise use movement has gained substantial political ground of late by accusing environmentalists of being arrogant and out of touch.
In Mr. Dowie's view, there is merit to their arguments, and leaders of national environmental groups are not helping themselves by branding their critics stooges of big business. "Ordinary people in the countryside are being ignored and disrespected by the same Government agencies that the environmental movement has been fighting for decades," he writes. "Most of these people love the land around them as much as any Sierra Club hiker does."
Grass-roots environmentalists are as disgusted with the national groups as are those ordinary citizens. The grass-roots groups see the nationals as hogging all the financial support, wasting it on fancy urban offices and feckless lobbying campaigns, and making compromise a matter of routine.
But Mr. Dowie sees rescue ahead, at the hands of a new "fourth wave" of American environmentalism, as regional organizations with professional staff members join with the roughly 10,000 volunteer local groups across the country that usually organize around a single issue, such as battling a toxic waste site. He also champions the so-called environmental justice movement, which works on Indian reservations, in urban and rural communities, and among civil rights groups to get regulators to enforce environmental laws in poor communities the same way they do in wealthy ones. The "fourth wave" groups, he predicts -- perhaps too romantically -- will supplant the large national organizations because they have more quickly come to understand and act on American environmentalism's new operative motto: Think locally, act locally.
Mr. Dowie is to be commended for keeping his analysis on a subject as expansive as environmental politics to little more than 300 pages. But because of its discipline and welcome brevity, "Losing Ground" also suffers from a sense of haste. For instance, Mr. Dowie cites Lois Gibbs, head of the Virginia-based Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes, as a model of the kind of leader who will reinvigorate the national environmental movement. But we learn less about this advocate, mother and former resident of Love Canal than we could have gleaned from a few newspaper clippings.
And there are noticeable small errors. Dixy Lee Ray, for instance, was the Governor of Washington State, not Oregon. The nation's newest commercial incinerator, in East Liverpool, Ohio, burns hazardous wastes, not garbage.
"Losing Ground" is an ambitious and brave book. Mr. Dowie has marshaled an exceptionally broad array of facts and produced a provocative explanation for why a once vibrant social movement is flagging. For the sake of what's left of America's natural heritage, and the tens of millions of citizens who are concerned about protecting it, let's hope the leaders of the big environmental organizations are among this book's most careful readers.

HEADLINE: Friendly Faces, Helping Hands

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
IN Bushnell Park in Hartford one recent sunny Saturday afternoon, a nervous-looking man approached Gladys N. Hoyle to ask if she could accompany his little girl to the restroom. He didn't feel comfortable taking the child to the men's room.
But he didn't seem bothered about approaching Mrs. Hoyle, even though she was a stranger. Her red windbreaker, golf cap and khaki slacks, made her recognizable as a Hartford Guide, someone always ready with a kind word and a helping hand. 
 In between her normal job of dispensing information and directions, Mrs. Hoyle is always on the lookout to provide more personal service. She regularly helps a blind girl pick out lipstick and other personal items in downtown shops. She holds open doors for women with strollers and men with their arms full of packages. She tells visitors about upcoming festivals or special events.
"I like being able to help people," Mrs. Hoyle said, her brisk stride carrying her through the park toward Jewell Street. "It makes you feel good about yourself." For almost four years, the guides have done their walking tours of downtown, doing what they can to help business owners and shoppers, tourists and office workers. They have logged more than 50,000 contacts on the streets of their city, circulating nonstop through the 26 square blocks they patrol, walking 11 miles or more in an eight-hour shift.
"Hartford really has a need for a friendly face, people who are knowledgeable about the city, and accommodating," said Phil Hopkins, a manager at Hartford Brewery Ltd., a downtown pub that has supported the guides with a yearly event called Brewfest. "Hartford has always been a city where people put on blinders and stick to themselves. The Guides can help change that image."
The executive director of the Guides, Austin Jordan, said the group was the cheapest economic development tool the downtown can employ. No matter how many different stores you bring in, if people have an unpleasant visit they won't come back to shop. "We've been known to change tires, we carry umbrellas for people who get caught in a sudden downpour, and we provide an escort service for people after dark," said Mr. Jordan.
One city council member has asked the Guides to consider expanding into Asylum Hill, if financial support can be found. There's also discussion about moving into a downtown Arts District, to the south of the area the Guides currently patrol. And Riverfront Recapture, the group developing a network of parks and walkways along the Connecticut River in Hartford and East Hartford, has opened talks about the Guides providing service in that area. "People have to feel comfortable and secure," said Joseph R. Marfuggi, director of Riverfront Recapture. "We want the kind of presence in the park that the Guides provide downtown, someone who clearly belongs, who answers questions and makes people feel welcome -- and who has a radio to call for help if people need it."
Tana M. Parseliti, director of Business for Downtown Hartford, one of the groups that helped found the Guides four years ago, said while the program was aimed at promoting tourism and other visits to the downtown, it's not just out-of-towners who use the Guides.
"You're probably, when you're talking to a guide, talking to one of the best sources for what's going on, where it's going on, and when it's going on," Ms. Parseliti said.
The Guides, patterned after a program in Portland, Ore., were started up in 1991 with the hiring of an executive director. There are now seven uniformed guides on the street, with plans to hire two more this summer, on a budget of $281,275. There could be an even dozen Guides if the budgetary goal of $325,000 -- largely from private and corporate contributions -- can be achieved, said M. Ronald Morneault, president of the Guides' board and owner of Tuesday's, a men's clothing store in the downtown. Working until 11 P.M. on weekends, the Guides make their rounds look easy. "But when it's cold out and the weather is inclement, there's not a lot of glory," Mr. Morneault said. What there is, is a strong tie to the merchant community.
"There are a lot of small retail operations in the downtown where there's only one or two people in the store, and when they have to go to the bank or grab a sandwich or even just go to the bathroom, it can be a problem," Mr. Morneault said. "If a Guide happens to be walking by they can ask them to step inside for a minute" to take over.
"It's not a Guardian Angel program or any other type of security," Mr. Morneault said. "It's more a comforting, reassuring presence in the downtown. It's the cordiality that's important." But security is a part of it as well. The Guides all carry two-way radios that can patch them into the emergency dispatch center, to summon police or rescue crews. Mr. Jordan proudly notes that crime in the downtown district has dropped more than 50 percent, according to police statistics, since the Guides began operating. That reflects police initiatives, and increased efforts on the part of merchants to provide a safe environment, but Mr. Jordan said some part of the credit belongs to the Guides, and the police agree.
"They're a significant addition to the eyes and ears we have out there," said Deputy Police Chief Thomas F. O'Connor, who shares his headquarters in the Police Museum at 101 Pearl Street with the Guides.
Deputy Chief O'Connor said just having someone with a radio nearby is often enough to defuse a domestic dispute, or calm a drunk. On one occasion a Guide helped apprehend a purse snatcher by following him and radioing directions to police.
But more important, Deputy Chief O'Connor said, is the routine: helping people who have locked themselves out of their car, or who are nervous about walking to a parking lot alone, calls the Hartford police might otherwise receive. With more than 350,000 calls logged each year, any relief is welcome, he said. The Guides perform other functions as well. Mrs. Hoyle often takes students to historic buildings. The Guides maintain a library of, for instance, the examples of Greek architecture downtown.
"I lived in Hartford for eight years, starting in 1983," said Mrs. Hoyle, who now lives in East Hartford. "I thought I knew the city. I got this job, and I realized how much I didn't know."
She also has memorized traffic patterns -- which streets are one way, which are busiest in the morning rush hour and so forth. And whenever a new shop opens, she stops in to acquaint herself with the owner and clerks. "I have a lot of people who want to know where they can buy beepers, or cameras, or whatever, and the more I know about the businesses the more I can help them out," Mrs. Hoyle said.
One continuing problem for the Guides has been finances. The organization is supported heavily by the Downtown Council, the state's Department of Economic Development and the city, as well as a variety of corporations and business groups. But fund raising is still a problem and Mr. Jordan said he hoped for more fee-based services: providing Guides at major events like Taste of Hartford or the Jazz Festival, for instance. The organization would also like to have more special events of its own, like the Brewfest organized by Hartford Brewery that raised almost $15,000 last fall.
And this year the Guides took over management of the information book at the Hartford Civic Center, where one Saturday afternoon recently James E. Hyland, a Guide, was answering two or three questions a minute for hours on end.
"When's the next time the Whalers will be playing in town?" "When's the next performance of 'Beauty and the Beast?' " Others want to know how to find restrooms and restaurants, shops and trade shows. On St. Patrick's Day, he recalled, one man wanted to know where he could find a shillelagh; after several calls, an imitation Irish walking stick was found at Luettgens Ltd.
A woman walked up to ask if Mr. Hyland could help her find her car; she had forgotten to note the name of the garage where she had parked, gotten turned around in the Civic Center and couldn't retrace her steps. He talked with her for a few minutes, finally eliciting enough information to make an educated guess, and sent her on her way. Mr. Hyland said that on another evening, a man from Vermont couldn't remember where he'd parked his car, either. It was snowing, and he couldn't even recall if the lot was paved or dirt. Mr. Hyland asked him to think hard: there are 12 parking lots within a reasonable walk of the Civic Center.
"On the coldest night of the year, we spent an hour and a half walking to every parking lot in the area," Mr. Hyland recalls. "We finally found it, shoveled it out, and waited while he warmed it up and got ready to go."
But the most frequent question Mr. Hyland had to deal with on a recent afternoon was, "Where do I find the fishing show?" And each time, Mr. Hyland patiently pointed to the white banner hanging next to the information booth, with 18-inch high blue letters proclaiming, "Fishing Show Downstairs."
Mr. Hyland said that's not unusual. On nights when there's a big game in the Civic Center, people will walk in, ignore the long lines of people waiting to buy a ticket, and ask, "Where can I get a ticket?"
"That really points out how important it is for visitors to have a human contact," said Ms. Parseliti of Business for Downtown Hartford. "They're overwhelmed by sights and sounds and can't always sort everything out. That's what the Guides have to do for them."

NOAH'S CHOICE
The Future of Endangered Species.
By Charles C. Mann and Mark L. Plummer.
302 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $24. 
NOAH'S big boat, 300 cubits long by 50 cubits wide by 30 cubits high and jammed to its gunwales with wildlife, has been a favorite metaphor among books about biological diversity. The very word "ark" has served as a signal of two things -- a rich miscellany of living creatures and an imperative for their rescue. Norman Myers's work "The Sinking Ark," published in 1979, was one of the first influential efforts to bring the whole problem of species extinctions caused by humans to public attention. Four years later, "The Secular Ark," Janet Browne's history of the science called biogeography (that is, the study of biological diversity as distributed in geographical patterns), was released. In 1986 came Lee Durrell's volume "State of the Ark," sort of a "Whole Earth Catalogue" of threatened species and ecosystems. And then, in 1989, Dale Peterson published "The Deluge and the Ark," an account of his travels to see some of the world's most spectacular and endangered primate species.
Charles C. Mann and Mark L. Plummer have turned to the same metaphor, which by now seems a little tired, but their variant carries some new energy. "Noah's Choice: The Future of Endangered Species" emphasizes the element of human decision making, not the condition of the boat. As construed by Mr. Mann and Mr. Plummer, Noah's choice determines which creatures get aboard and which don't. It's not one choice, of course, but a whole set of choices, with American society cast in the role of Noah.
American society? Yes, this is a domestic-policy discussion, as far as Mr. Mann and Mr. Plummer are concerned. Although the subtitle implies otherwise, their book mostly limits itself to one minor category of endangered species: those native to the United States. The truth is that our North Temperate ecosystems -- even the few portions not already badly fragmented and degraded -- don't harbor an extraordinary wealth of species, endangered or otherwise. The real superpowers of biological diversity are tropical countries like Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Venezuela and Madagascar. But never mind. America being America, our struggle to cope with our own modest share does have resonance in the larger world, and the fights waged over spotted owls and desert tortoises and California gnatcatchers are certainly large enough and hot enough to keep us exercised.
The ark represents our willingness to restrain ourselves collectively and individually, to compromise with one another, to pay. How much will we pay to insure the survival of an obscure, localized subspecies of butterfly? How much will we restrain ourselves on behalf of a species of salamander or cave spider or fungus? Unfortunately, the ark of our willingness isn't so huge as the assemblage of needy creatures that would board it. Therefore, choices are inescapable, as Mr. Mann and Mr. Plummer argue persuasively.
"Over the next century or so," they write, "humanity will face a staggering number of small choices, few of them alike, between accomplishing some goal (building a highway to a hospital) and protecting some part of nature (one population of a beetle). Not many will involve anything so dramatic as a certain extinction." Yet the cumulative effects "will represent a fateful decision about how much of the natural world accompanies us on our journey to the future." Mr. Mann and Mr. Plummer's point is that if we don't address those choices more lucidly and more effectively than we have been doing, they will be made anyway -- haphazardly, by default and at great social and ecological cost. This logic brings the authors to the real subject of "Noah's Choice," which is the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
The historical origins of that law are intriguingly described in a chapter titled " 'The Awful Beast Is Back.' " The "awful beast" was the snail darter, and the nice over-the-top rhetoric came in 1979 from Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, who also declared it "the bane of my existence, the nemesis of my golden years, the bold perverter of the Endangered Species Act," because the little fish and the big law had together been used to block (temporarily) the infamous Tellico Dam project in his state. Most of us know that tale in outline, but not its revealing details or its minatory significance, as the authors present them here. Had the act really been perverted in that instance, or was it functioning just as its designers had intended? If it was functioning as intended, had the intentions of the designers been sufficiently realistic and foresighted?
None of us should imagine that Senator Baker's reaction was purely theatrical, or that the snail darter case was an aberration. There are ranchers today in my neck of the Montana woods who are saying essentially the same thing about the gray wolf, now that it's being reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park under provisions of the Endangered Species Act: "The awful beast is back." Many of those ranchers are moderate, fair-minded people and one of them is a dear friend of mine, though I disagree with him diametrically about the return of the wolf.
The Endangered Species Act, as Mr. Mann and Mr. Plummer portray it, has for 22 years been our mechanism for pretending that we don't need to make Noachian choices about what can or can't be saved -- that the ark is big enough, that it must be big enough, to accommodate every jeopardized species and subspecies that turns up. Their view of the act will be controversial, and I don't share it completely myself. But they do a vital service by suggesting that we should rethink whether this law, as currently framed, contains all the best mechanisms for accomplishing its essential goals.
Can't we improve it or supplement it in some way, so that society at large bears the full costs of the biological diversity that society at large wants and needs, rather than assigning an incommensurate share of those costs to a few local people? Can't we mitigate the degree to which it fans the acrimony of our deliberations on the stewardship of the American landscape? What about positive incentives as well as sanctions? Maybe we should pay private landowners, in cold cash or tax credits, for harboring a pack of gray wolves or a female grizzly with cubs or a population of Karner Blue butterflies on the back 40. We have got to try something new. At present, all we're doing is shouting ourselves purple -- us against them -- while biological diversity drowns in a rising tide of consumptive land use.
"NOAH'S CHOICE" is no elegant piece of imaginative reportage, and you wouldn't read it for the grace of the writing. It also suffers just a bit, as most co-written books do, from having a "we" as the speaker instead of a less blurry and more accountable "I." But Mr. Mann and Mr. Plummer (who also collaborated on "The Aspirin Wars: Money, Medicine and 100 Years of Rampant Competition") have compensated for those limitations with the depth of their research, the clarity of their scientific explanations, the keenness and honesty of their thinking. As a study of the historical origins and the shortcomings of our precious but imperfect Endangered Species Act, "Noah's Choice" is a valuable work. It would be a good thing if we all read this book -- city people and ranchers, ecologists and economists, tree huggers and loggers, as well as those who cherish the sublimely sterile notion that our country's biological diversity doesn't concern them one way or the other -- and then sat down to a civil discourse about what we have, what we want, what we need and how we should proceed. Our boat is adrift, at the moment, with Ararat nowhere in sight.

SEA CHANGE
A Message of the Oceans.
By Sylvia Alice Earle.
Illustrated. 361 pp. New York:
G. P. Putnam's Sons. $25.95. 
WHEN Sylvia Earle was 3 years old, she stood on a New Jersey beach and fell in love. Fifty-six years later, glorious encounters like that are still in her dreams: "A monstrous wall of green water races my way, hissing, roaring, towering, inescapable, sweeping me into a cascading aquatic mayhem. I am lifted, tumbled, churned, pushed, and fall, gasping, clawing for air. My toes touch sand; a sweet breeze soothes my lungs. I stand, choking, face the next advancing wall, and leap into it, exhilarated!" The little girl who embraced the waves grew up to become one of the most distinguished of the 20th-century explorers who were drawn to what she calls the "indigo wilderness" of the deep seas.
A biologist specializing in the ecology of marine ecosystems, Sylvia Earle has been wreathed in honors. She is also an engineer, and a leader in the invention of technology for deep-sea research. From 1990 to 1992 she was chief scientist of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the first woman to be appointed to the post; there she made the demoralizing discovery that the United States commitment to marine sanctuaries was $11 million a year, while the national parks were receiving $1.4 billion. Above all, Ms. Earle is a joyful master of the calculated risk.
Underwater groupies will not find "Sea Change" a treasure trove of personal revelation. It is a moving plea for the preservation of the oceans. Three children, devoted parents and several husbands flicker like damselfish through "Sea Change," glinting occasionally in the light of Ms. Earle's affection, but the domestic balances required by her career are merely acknowledged, not recounted. Nor does she gossip. I have never read a book that took less advantage of a chance to settle scores, or seen so impressive a resume presented with so little self-importance.
An oceanographic expedition, like an astronomical one, requires enormous amounts of money and extraordinary technological expertise. It involves years of preparation and later analysis. Ms. Earle has still managed to spend 6,000 hours actually diving, living in underwater research modules, cartwheeling with dolphins, descending to 13,000 feet. She has written about what she found for publications ranging from Redbook to the Occasional Papers of the Farlow Herbarium of Cryptogamic Botany.
Her role model in the supermacho world of scuba exploration was Eugenie Clark, the celebrated authority on sharks. Being a woman meant, Ms. Earle writes, that she had to be "prepared to do twice as much work for half as much credit." She lived with silly headlines like "Beacon Hill Housewife to Lead Team of Female Aquanauts" because, she thought, "If people could see what we see underwater . . . they will be motivated to take care of the place." And so she tells us about the luminous wonders on the floor of the Nankai Trough off Japan. She describes the black horrors of the Exxon Valdez spill and the ruin of the Persian Gulf shore. All "critters," as Ms. Earle calls subsurface life, delight her, from the Nassau grouper with its "Labrador retriever-like" personality to the society of humpback whales: "The large, curious female who had first come my way remained the most attentive. Several times she moved slowly by, turning her great eyes, registering awareness, perhaps locking away in her large brain impressions for future reference."
"Sea Change: A Message of the Oceans" is only incidentally an adventure story and a tribute to all creatures great and small. Tragically, it is a eulogy, a Rachel Carson-like warning of the silent tide inexorably approaching. The ecosystems Sylvia Earle explored have begun, within her lifetime, to crash. Garbage and toxic waste, drift nets and overfishing have transformed the exhilarating possibilities of her girlhood into the environmental catastrophe she passionately chronicles. Nearly 80 percent of the commercially valuable fish whose status is known are overfished, Ms. Earle reports (while noting that expecting to feed the world's population on wild fish is, in any case, as unreasonable as expecting to sustain humanity on a diet of wild buffalo, squirrels, roots and berries). But what of those creatures whose status is not known? What of the value of creatures for their own sake, which may be far greater than their value as dinner? The changes of the past few decades, Ms. Earle writes, should command "the sort of interest one might take in, say, the life-support system of a spacecraft housing all of the past, present and future of humankind."
There is no question that she is correct, as anyone knows who has walked along a beach or snorkeled over the weakening reefs, or just tried to catch a fish. Ms. Earle still takes hope, provides lists of sanctuaries and organizations working to reverse the damage, pleads against ignorance. And she has forced a sea change on me simply by describing the multitudes of the world's species displayed at Tsukiji, the Tokyo fish market -- one million tons of fish a year, dead fish.
No more for me. Ever since my first dive 20 years ago, I too have believed that, as Sylvia Earle says, "If there is heaven on earth, it's under the sea."
 
 
 
OCEAN WATERS
 Arriving in plenty of time for swimsuit season come two books for the environmentally concerned seashore visitor. Both are companion volumes to a traveling Smithsonian Institution exhibit, Ocean Planet, and one is a perfect accessory for a summer home's wicker chaise. OCEAN PLANET: Writings and Images of the Sea (Abrams/Times Mirror, $39.95) offers evocative photographs, disturbing statistics (the death rate for commercial fishing, 155 per 100,000 workers, is the highest of any industry or profession), fun facts (a Scottish sailor wore a golden earring so if his drowned corpse was found on the beach his funeral could be paid for) and passionate raptures on the deep from such disparate seafarers as Benjamin Franklin, Joseph Conrad, John McPhee and Rachel Carson. Edited by Peter Benchley, our modern master of the undersea bugaboo, and Judith Gradwohl, the director of the Smithsonian's environmental awareness program, "Ocean Planet" preaches a singular respect for the world's waters as it mixes scientific profundities, New Age mysticism and the occasional soggy metaphor. Mr. Benchley laments, perhaps with more accuracy than he intends, "Those of us who spend our lives in, on and around the sea are able barely to scratch its surface." Diving somewhat deeper, in THE WEALTH OF OCEANS (Norton, $25), Michael Weber, a freelance writer who has worked on the staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service, and the Smithsonian's Ms. Gradwohl emerge with a jargon-laden but perilously persuasive account of humanity's ecological and economic relationship with the seas. They make a strong case for limiting coastal development, and blame the hearty commercial fisherman, romanticized in "Ocean Planet," for overfishing some species to the brink of extinction -- though they stop short of blaming American venture capital for every global ecological disaster (some of the ghastly red tides that have closed American beaches have had "natural" origins, for instance). Both books emphasize that by being blissfully ignorant about the ocean we are not merely fouling a few nests. As goes the ocean, these books say, so goes the human race. BILL KENT

HEADLINE: Harlem Empowerment Zone Embraces People and Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was disappointed by the Op-Ed article by Mitchell L. Moss ("Empty Promises for Harlem," April 15) on the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. It unfairly denounced the project as a failure even before a board was seated to determine a final course of action. It also reflected a misunderstanding of the goals of the creators, including myself. 
 Mr. Moss's most cynical allegation was that the zone was creating an enormous safety net for the poor by apportioning too much of its resources for community improvement at the expense of tax breaks to create jobs. I hope his fears will be allayed by the knowledge that Richard D. Parsons, president of Time Warner Inc., has agreed to be chairman of the board of directors, and that the New York City Partnership of 200 chief executive officers and business leaders endorses the project.
Even by Mr. Moss's standards, these executives ought to know what they are doing, even if he doesn't trust the coalition of community, academic, political and business leaders who designed the project.
I doubt that the Partnership would agree that its $1 billion commitment for residential and commercial construction in the empowerment zone represented a failure to attract private-sector resources, as Mr. Moss alleges. Nor would some of America's most respected companies that have endorsed the project or expressed their intention to participate call it a "political boondoggle."
Equitable Life, Travelers, New York Life, AT&T, Nynex, Republic Bank, Allen & Company, BDO Seidman and Salomon Brothers, to name a few, are excited and looking for ways to get involved. They understand that quibbling over the apportionment of the zone's resources is not the issue. The amount of investment tax credits (almost half the total) versus money for training, day care, education and other improvements will be worked out -- with the parties involved, in a way that gets the job done. What is important is the recognition that communities cannot be rebuilt -- or businesses attracted -- without an investment in the people who live there.
Mr. Moss took pains to belittle the location of an international trade center complex in Harlem. Proximity to financial centers is no prerequisite in the high-tech world of computers.

HEADLINE: Autos Weave in and Out of U.S.-Japan Relations

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman's impatience toward the Japanese intransigence in opening up auto and auto-parts markets is understandable (column, April 16). One need not be a "Japan basher" to be exasperated by the glacial speed of progress in solving what is a mutual problem in Japan-United States bilateral relations: the massive imbalance of trade between the two countries.
Whatever may be the cause of this problem, the lack of timely cooperation from Tokyo has not helped. Though the Japanese Government has made much progress in liberalizing and globalizing Japan's economy, not inconsequential vestiges of the "developmental state" abound in many sectors. However, in the automotive sector, the short-term perspective of American entrepreneurial capitalism is as much to blame as the Japanese Government's industrial policy. 
 Tokyo was not solely responsible for the reduction of United States share of the Japanese auto market from 60 percent in 1953 to 1 percent in 1960, as Mr. Friedman implies. The fault also lies with the failure of the United States automakers in the 1950's to see Japan as an important emerging (let alone, strategic) market, deserving continued investments and marketing efforts.
The American automakers were not simply driven out but, given the low rates of return on their investments, abandoned the Japanese market for greener pastures elsewhere. The reduction in the United States share of the Japanese automotive market was not only the result of political decisions made in Tokyo, but short-term, bottom-line corporate decisions made in Detroit.
Mr. Friedman must surely agree that the situation involving Chrysler is indicative of the self-defeating, short-term perspective that has contributed to America's massive trade deficit with Japan. If Kirk Kerkorian and Lee A. Iacocca succeed in their buyout bid, the shareholder value may be enhanced in the short run, but in the long run it would leave Chrysler in a weakened position to compete against its Japanese rivals, not only in Japan but here in the United States.

HEADLINE: Essay;
The Hanging of Flor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The dictatorial regime in Singapore, long critical of American weakness in upholding the law, hired a trio of American dry-bone experts to help gain moral absolution for too quickly executing a Filipino maid questionably convicted of murder.
Last month's hanging of Flor Contemplacion, who was one of the 60,000 Filipino household workers treated as little better than slaves by their Singaporean masters, has made a mockery of Strongman Lee Kuan Yew's pretense of upholding "Asian values" against the decadent West. 
 Remember how Singapore's prosecutors and local counsel extracted a "confession" out of an American teen-ager last year for the crime of graffiti?
The boy was sentenced to lashing by cane, and President Clinton's plea for mercy got exactly two lashes off his brutal beating. Dictator Lee exulted in humiliating the U.S., lecturing us on the efficacy of torture, while the local U.S. business community, sucking up to the dictator, cheered.
Now consider an Asian reaction to Singapore justice. When a Filipino maid and her ward were found dead, suspicion was directed away from a father-employer and toward Mrs. Contemplacion, another maid.
She was jailed, confessed -- perhaps under torture -- and her country's embassy did little in her behalf. Just another maid; who cared?
When Singapore's judges sentenced her to death, the Philippine public showed it cared. Protesters in that democracy burned Singaporean flags; Manila newspapers denounced the ruthless judicial system.
Lee Kuan Yew shrugged that off; his judges rejected appeals for a real investigation into the murders, the presentation of new evidence and independent interviews with the condemned woman. Promptly on schedule, Flor Contemplacion was hanged. Case closed. Message sent.
An unexpected message came back. Filipinos erupted in fury. President Ramos, under election pressure, fired his uncaring embassy officials and sent home Singapore's ambassador. The Philippine Foreign Minister who failed to stop the hanging quit.
When Filipino investigators dug up the body of the murdered maid, they found that she had been beaten, bones broken, and one later charged the Singapore pathologists had "tampered with the cadaver to simulate signs of strangulation."
The dictator's front man, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, realized this had caused a rift between two members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He agreed to a joint autopsy, at which the Philippine forensic experts saw their suspicions confirmed, but the Singaporeans -- apparently supported by their American experts -- professed to see the opposite.
I doubt if examination of a corpse after four years will determine if the hanged woman was guilty or if Singapore's judicial system protected a wealthy man and framed an innocent domestic servant, thereby maintaining its reputation as the world capital of punishment.
We do know this: The accused was given inadequate representation. As questions arose, the accusers were too quick with the noose -- suggesting cover-up of official wrongdoing.
The Contemplacion case teaches us also that democratic values -- individual rights -- are not culturally "Western," as the dictator scornfully insists, but universal. Even a poor Asian expatriate worker abandoned by her embassy has those rights.
Isn't it about time the world's free press broke the shackles imposed by Singapore's corrupt judiciary? Here's an idea I have not discussed with colleagues (if it's antitrust, come and get me): only a united front by all publishers with operations in Singapore will stop the judiciary from intimidating us one by one.
The Economist, Time, The Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post (owners of The International Herald Tribune) have all thundered at Singapore in home publications, but when publishing in the Far East write on eggs for fear of libel judgments or circulation harassment by the hanging judges.
Kowtowing to such coercion is not "respecting the laws of other societies." Filipinos are showing us that free speech knows no boundaries, and that silent submission to injustice need not be the price of doing business in Asia.
And if economic solidarity does not affect the dictator's judges -- why not cover the area from free Manila?

HEADLINE: American Center In Paris Is Stylish But Going Broke

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 23

 BODY:
In an urban landscape transformed in recent years by monumental architectural projects paid for by the national Government, the new American Center in Paris stood out not only as an exciting example of New World panache but also as an expression of faith in nongovernmental financing of the arts.
Designed by Frank Gehry with contrasting classical and Cubist facades, the $41 million building opened in the Bercy section of eastern Paris in June last year, raising hopes that it would add fresh verve to an American cultural presence that predates the American Center's founding in 1931. But if financial troubles were already on the horizon last year, they now threaten the center's survival because the private donations needed to run it have not come through. Put bluntly, the center has a fancy new headquarters but no money in the till. 
 The new center's programming has included dance, plays, concerts, visual arts and photographic exhibitions, poetry readings, movie festivals and conferences, and the public's response has been good and occasionally exceptional. Following a decades-old tradition, the center has focused on avant-garde art on the ground that more conventional art is already well represented in Paris.
Some of the most successful recent programs have been a conference series called "War and Memory," a Bill Viola installation, Toni Morrison and Max Roach performances and a gay and lesbian film festival. "Some say we should be more mainstream to attract the crowds," said Frederick B. Henry, the center's new chairman, "but we don't think that's the answer."
The center has annual revenues of around $1 million, but it needs six times that much to function as planned. It has been able to maintain a cultural program only by dipping into a $6.5 million endowment provided largely by a matching grant from the Frederick Weisman Company of California.
"This gives us 12 to 18 months' breathing time to develop a solution," said Mr. Henry, who also heads the New York-based Bohen Foundation. And that solution, he went on, must inevitably involve "a radical restructuring" of the way the center is financed.
To underscore the dimension of the crisis, Mr. Henry and Marie-Claude Beaud, the center's first non-American executive director, have even gone so far as to suggest that Mr. Gehry's building might have to be sold, not to close the center but to turn its main asset into an income-producing endowment. "It's as if we'd bought a Ferrari that used very expensive fuel, and we didn't put enough money aside to buy the fuel," Mr. Henry said during a recent visit to Paris. "We are in the ironic but not at all uncommon situation where we cannot afford our greatest asset." In hindsight, he added, the center should perhaps have spent less on its new building and funneled more into its endowment.
Yet when the decision to build a new center was made in the mid-1980's, the outlook was rosier. Thanks to a real-estate boom, the center's old premises on Boulevard Raspail in Montparnasse were sold for $42 million. And the center's longtime leaders, Judith Pisar and Henry Pillsbury, were eager to do something dramatic.
"The institution was a cultural jewel on the French- American landscape," said Mrs. Pisar, who was the center's chairwoman from 1977 to 1994. "It had a tremendous draw. But the old building no longer served our needs. We wanted the new building to be a cultural statement."
One of the new center's proudest features is a 400-seat theater with a spacious high-tech stage. Performers love it and audiences love it, but even when all tickets are sold, the theater cannot cover its operating and production costs. "It will always have to be subsidized," Mr. Henry said.
Mr. Pillsbury, the center's executive director from 1969 until last year, said he remained convinced that "we did exactly the right thing" in building the new center and that "time will prove us right." But he conceded that fund-raising projections of the late 1980's were too optimistic.
Ms. Beaud, who has headed the Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art, was quick to discover this when she took up her post in September last year. "I knew the center would be very expensive to run," she said, "but lots of promises of financial donations were never kept. Our first programs were meant to be already financed, but we had to pay for them." The reasons were obvious. Both the French and American economies had passed through difficult periods, many corporations had cut their support for the arts, the demands of American nonprofit foundations had increased, and as the United States looked inward, in Mrs. Pisar's words, "it was difficult for an American Center in Paris to compete."
Thus, what is now at stake is not only the center's role as a window for contemporary American creativity but also the very notion that nongovernmental subsidies can sustain a major cultural institution, at least in a country like France with a deeply entrenched tradition of state financing of the arts. Any thoughts that France might step in to save the day have been dispelled. Ms. Beaud said her efforts to persuade the Paris municipal government that it had an interest in supporting the American Center were quickly rebuffed. Her request for a $12.7 million short-term loan from one major bank was also turned down.
The only remaining avenue is to seek support in the United States. "Some people are scared of the slogan 'Save the American Center,' but that's where we stand," Ms. Beaud said. "We're in a great building; we have a tradition; we're a unique institution. We have to get our message across so that people in the United States understand."
Controversy continues over the new center's location in an area of Paris dominated by the Gare de Lyon, the Economy Ministry and the Omnisports Palace but far from many residential districts. Further, plans to build a footbridge across the Seine to link the center to the new National Library as well as to open a subway station beside the center have now been postponed until early 1998. But neither Mr. Henry nor Ms. Beaud calls location a problem. "The development of Bercy has been slower than we hoped, but it will come," Mr. Henry said. "More important is to create a frisson around what we are doing. We want people to think, 'What's happening at the American Center?' and 'Let's go to the American Center to see what's on.' "
For the moment, though, the institution's financial crisis blocks the path to the future. The center must not only raise operating capital and build up its endowment; it also needs well over $2 million to install a restaurant and complete its 26 artists' residences.
One plan is to lease the 26 apartments to American universities and cultural institutions for use by visiting artists and academics. But the most daring option remains that of selling the building to some foundation or corporation that, in exchange for name recognition, would allow the center to continue to operate on the premises. "We wouldn't move out," Mr. Henry insisted. "Our objective is to stay here and carry out our cultural mission."

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Sees Global Growth But Slower Pace for the U.S.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
In its latest survey of global economic conditions, the International Monetary Fund predicted that the economic recovery would gather steam in most of the world, although it forecast a significant slowdown in the United States this year and next.
The I.M.F. predicted that the world economy would expand by 3.8 percent this year and 4.2 percent in 1996. These would be the hihgest rates since a 4.6 percent surge in 1988. Global economic output grew by 3.7 percent last year, up sharply from 2.5 percent in 1993. 
 The I.M.F. projected that gross domestic product in the United States would rise by 3.2 percent this year and drop to 1.9 percent in 1996.
The I.M.F. said significant risks to its forecast came from fears that Mexico's economic crisis could spill over to other countries and that the dollar would continue to plunge. The dollar has dropped to record lows against both the yen and the German mark.
The dollar was expected to be the chief topic when finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's seven leading industrial economies -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- meet in Washington on Tuesday to prepare for spring meetings of the 179-nation I.M.F. and the World Bank.
The I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, took the unusual step last week of publicly urging the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a way of defending the dollar even though the Clinton Administration is worried that further Fed tightening could turn an economic slowdown into an outright recession.
The I.M.F. used today's release of its economic forecast to elaborate on Mr. Camdessus's arguments, noting that a rise in United States rates would be especially appropriate given that both Germany and Japan have reduced their rates in the last two weeks.
Higher American interest rates in relation to Japan and Germany would serve to bolster the United States currency because dollar-denominated investments would offer a greater rate of return.

Cupiditas Vincit Omnia

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
"We have an obligation tonight to talk about the legacy we're leaving our children and grandchildren." So Newt Gingrich said in his talk to the nation two weeks ago. "No truly moral civilization would burden its children with the economic excesses of the parents and grandparents."
Speaker Gingrich's concern for what we shall leave our grandchildren would be more convincing if he worried about leaving them not only a burdensome debt but a country of despoiled land, air and water. 
 Economic arrangements are temporary. This Congress may decide to victimize the poor, deny welfare to young women with babies, make it hard for people injured by defective products to sue. A later Congress can change those decisions.
But destruction of our surroundings is for keeps. An extinct bird or animal cannot be recreated. A wetland covered with concrete will not again nurture life.
A moral civilization, to use Mr. Gingrich's good phrase, must take the long view. It does not burden future generations with polluted water or denuded forests in order to let someone turn a quick profit now.
But that is exactly the tradeoff that legislation rushed through the Gingrich-dominated House would make: sacrificing the future diversity and richness of our natural resources for the short-term profit of a few. Plunder now and let tomorrow worry about itself: That is the common theme of several bills designed to strip away legal protections of the environment.
There are measures to gut the Clean Water Act and the endangered species law. Another would effectively prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing or enforcing regulations to prevent pollution.
But the most menacing bill is one that would define as a constitutional "taking" of property any environmental regulation that substantially reduced an owner's ability to use property as he wished. That innocent-sounding idea would make it economically impossible to impose many, perhaps most, environmental restrictions for the benefit of future generations.
One example shows how devastating the "takings" legislation would be. It comes from a story by Charles McCoy in The Wall Street Journal of April 4.
The Central Valley of California, which would otherwise be a semi-desert, has been made highly productive by vast amounts of irrigation water supplied from far away by government projects. Farming corporations get the water at subsidized rates that are about one-tenth of the true cost.
So much water is being pumped out of California rivers that salmon runs are drying up. State and Federal authorities want to keep more of the water in the rivers to save the salmon. But under the bill passed by the House, Central Valley farmers would have to be compensated for what they say would be taking of their "property" -- the irrigation water -- at exorbitant cost.
The McCoy story quoted a California farm lobbyist, Jason Peltier, as saying, "We have a right to that water, and if the government wants it for fish, they have to pay us." And pay at the economic rate for water there, he said: 10 times what the water actually costs the farmers.
That theory is proof of the old adage, "No good deed goes unpunished." The Government makes Central Valley farmers prosperous by bringing water hundreds of miles and selling it to them at discount rates. Now, when some of the water is needed somewhere else, the farmers want to hijack the Government. That means us.
Even in straightforward economic terms, it is a foolish idea to gut environmental laws. Canada and Spain have lately been in conflict about fishing off Newfoundland, for the inescapable reason that the fish are running out. All kinds of things will run out, or be ruined, if we remove safeguards.
The safeguards imposed over the last 30 years have worked well. Our air is cleaner, our water more likely to be safe for swimming and drinking, more of our forests self-sustaining. Why would we want to turn back from that success?
The reason is greed: nothing more complicated than that. Lawyers and lobbyists for various industries sat in Congressional committee rooms and wrote this ripper legislation. They do not care about their grandchildren, or ours. They want their money up front.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Fortune Adds Service Sector To Its '500' List Of Corporations

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY 

 BODY:
After 40 years of publishing its benchmark Fortune 500 list -- an annual compilation of the 500 largest industrial corporations in America -- Fortune magazine is making a dramatic change.
Having decided that its list no longer reflected the top level of American business, Fortune will announce Tuesday that for the first time since 1955 the 500 list will include service corporations -- banks, life insurance companies, utilities and so on -- as well as industrial ones. 
 This means that companies like J. P. Morgan, Metropolitan Life, Travelers, American Express, AT&T and Viacom are now on the list. The new Fortune 500 issue will be dated May 15 and arrive on newsstands on May 1.
The Fortune 500 rankings are a measure of standing in the business community; inclusion is considered an enormous marketing advantage and companies trumpet it in advertisements and company reports. Cities and states, in their efforts to attract industry, boast about the number of Fortune 500 companies they have.
It is hardly a secret that the industrial sector is no longer at the center of corporate America, as it was when the list was started in 1955. Indeed, few magazines have been as diligent as Fortune in tracking America's shift to a predominantly service economy.
"If you are writing about the new economy and your list isn't reflecting it, you begin to worry," said John Huey, managing editor of the magazine. "Is Microsoft a manufacturing or a service corporation? It doesn't really matter."
Not only have the lines between industrial and service companies become more blurred, but industrials have been deriving more and more of their revenue from service businesses. In 1994, for example, General Electric derived 40 percent of its revenue from service businesses.
In the first year of the new list, the number of service companies has already surpassed industrials, 291 to 209.
Fortune ranks companies by revenue, a system that has long drawn criticism from those who say a company's market value is a better measuring rod than its sales. That aside, the inclusion of service companies on the list has strikingly raised the level of revenue represented.
In the 1994 list, for example, the 500th company on the list, Texas Industries, reported revenue of $614 million. No. 500 this year, which Mr. Huey declined to name, has revenue of $2.2 billion. No. 250 last year, Quantum, had revenue of $1.7 billion. This year the 250th company has revenue of $4.65 billion.
In an interview, Mr. Huey and John Curran, assistant managing editor, who was in charge of compiling the list, disclosed little about the 1995 list and declined to give company rankings. They did say, however, that of the top 10 corporations, 7 were industrials. The highest-ranking service corporation on the list is at No. 4.
A quick comparison of last year's top industrials with the 500 service companies ranked by revenue would suggest that AT&T, Wal-Mart Stores and Sears, Roebuck are likely to be among the top 10 on the unified list.
The last 40 Fortune 500 lists provide a fascinating look at American business since World War II. One company, General Motors, held the No. 1 spot for 31 years. In the late 1970's and early 1980's the company ceded the dominant position nine times to Exxon. On last year's list, G.M. was No. 1 again, with revenue of $133.6 billion.
Americans love lists and magazines love to publish them, since issues with lists sell well on newsstands. Fortune's two leading competitors, Forbes and Business Week, also run annual lists, with each magazine contending that its own is the gold standard. The value of the lists lies not only in the rankings but also in the number crunching, analysis of data and huge amount of related information that the magazines provide. The Fortune 500 rankings issue, for instance, takes up about 300 pages.
Part of the news this year is that after losing its title to California last year, New York State finds itself once again as the state with the most Fortune 500 headquarters. New York is home to 65 companies on the list, compared with 51 for California. Last year, California had 48 and New York had 43.
New York City heads the 1995 list of cities, with 49 Fortune 500 companies, followed by Chicago, with 17. Last year New York had 29 and Chicago had 20.
The three business magazines' lists look very different. In the past, the Fortune 500 companies were those that derived the major portion of their revenue from manufacturing. That list was followed several months later with an issue featuring the top 500 service companies.
The 1995 list reflects a fiscal year ending on or before Jan. 31, 1995. Information for each company includes revenue, profits, assets, stockholders' equity and market value. Market value figures are based on the price per common share as of March 31, 1995.
Forbes has just published its top 500 list in its April 24 issue. It lists companies alphabetically and has separate rankings for sales, net profits, assets and market value. For example, Forbes ranked G.M. No. 1 in sales and net profits but No. 5 in assets and No. 10 in market value.
Asked to comment last week on reports that Fortune might change its list, Bruce Rogers, director of corporate communications for Forbes, replied, "If they do something different, it's because the Forbes list is better and they had to compete."
"If they don't change their list we'll still go after them," he added, pretty much summing up how the three magazines feel about each other.
The latest Business Week 1000 rankings -- "America's Most Valuable Companies, How They Rank in Market Value" -- appeared in the March 27 issue, with General Electric at No. 1. Business Week also includes information on sales, profits, assets, valuation, dividends, shares and earnings per share.
Since few people outside Time Inc., the unit of Time Warner that publishes Fortune, know about or have seen the new Fortune 500 list, it is too early to predict its reception in the business community. But some reaction is fairly easy to imagine.
"There are people who are going to wake up and not be on the list this year," Mr. Huey said, without feeling the need to elaborate.

HEADLINE: Mexico Seeks Funds For Gas Industry

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, April 23

 BODY:
The Mexican Government, breaking a long-standing practice, will open up the transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas to foreign investment and the private sector.
The country's energy minister, Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, said on Friday that a bill to make the necessary changes to the Constitution had been sent to Congress. 
 The Mexican Government, battling a four-month-old economic crisis, foresees private and foreign investment in the sector of about $5 billion in the next three or four years, Mr. Pichardo said.
Both chambers of the Mexican Congress are dominated by the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party of President Ernesto Zedillo, and approval of the bill is almost certain.
The move is likely to be welcomed by foreign companies, keen for a slice of Mexico's booming natural gas market, but it will anger nationalists.
The state's control of its oil and gas industry has been a powerful symbol of national sovereignty in Mexico since 1938, when it was nationalized and American and British companies were thrown out.
Mr. Pichardo said state control of the production and exploitation of gas and crude oil through the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos would not be affected by the change.

HEADLINE: TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: BUSINESS;
In Blast's Aftermath, Many Oklahoma City Companies Struggle to Survive

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: OKLAHOMA CITY, April 23

 BODY:
The worst terrorist attack on American soil has left many of the 25,000 people who work downtown here thankful that they escaped with their lives but struggling to save their livelihoods.
Last week, business in the heart of this neat city of almost half a million residents virtually ceased. Many companies far removed from the 50-square-block area that police cordoned off around the shattered hulk of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building decided to abandon any pretense of business as usual. 
 The major corporations -- the state's largest banks, utilities and oil companies -- had enough alternate sites and contingency plans to survive the days after the explosion without major disruptions. But many smaller businesses, like restaurants and garages, that still have doors might be forced to close them, after years of serving a downtown neighborhood that has now been blown away.
Local officials say 75 buildings in the downtown area were seriously damaged, and repairing or replacing them will cost at least $100 million.
Among those shaken buildings is the Y.M.C.A., across an intersection from the Federal building. There, Blanche's Deli, a storefront restaurant on the bottom floor, was a favorite lunchtime spot of Government employees, especially for the bean soup and corn bread.
The explosion blew the restaurant's doors and windows onto the sidewalk, their glass and steel fragments smeared with blood. Blanche David, a 65-year-old widow who ran the restaurant, was far enough inside when the blast occurred to escape uninjured, although passers-by were hurt. She now scours the newspapers and studies the faces on television, looking for clues to the fate of her former customers.
"I knew them by their first names but never did think of getting their last names," Mrs. David said.
Those who can relocate their shattered businesses had only a few moments this weekend for reflection and gratitude that they were still alive. "If I had been at my desk, this would have gone right through me," Shawn Hogan said this morning, and recalled in a later interview, as she grasped a twisted spear of steel driven deep into the wall of her office.
Most mornings found her right there at Hogan Information Systems, sometimes glancing out her window at the facade of the Murrah building across the street. But Wednesday morning, she was in her car on an errand. In the explosion, she suffered only the shock of a shattered rear window.
Ms. Hogan and her husband manage a credit information business whose round-the-clock flow of data lubricates the nation's financial system. So they quickly turned to the tasks at hand, in rain-soaked offices that no longer have roofs. Wearing hard hats and watched over by a Federal agent, Ms. Hogan recounted, they scrambled to haul out the computers essential to reviving their business.
Over machines hooked up in an executive's kitchen, the company resumed transmitting financial records on Saturday at 4 A.M. The Journal Record, a daily business newspaper the family owns and printed in the same building, was back out on Friday, written and edited in the public relations office of the University of Central Oklahoma and printed by The Edmond Sun in the suburbs.
In the long run, economists and business leaders say, a disaster could be an economic advantage, after insurance and Federal emergency assistance pay off, new construction kicks in and businesses find new quarters, furniture and machines.
"If you want to be sterile and insensitive about it, the net economic impact could be positive," said Wayne Stone, president of the operations here of the Bank of Oklahoma, which closed its headquarters last week but routed most transactions through its branches. "When you look back four or five years from now after the shock and emotion, this is something that could be positive."
Even last week, as thousands of journalists, firefighters, rescue workers and Federal investigators converged, this city became a hot market for building materials, taxis, clothing, glass, hotel rooms and space of any sort within sight of the blast.
Three hours after the explosion, the Forest Lumber Company, the closest major source of plywood, had sold almost all of its 1,200-sheet inventory, which usually lasts a month.
Gary Gatewood, owner of Radio Supply Inc., two blocks from the Federal building, shut his electronics store down after many of his windows and doors were blown out and his dropped acoustic tile ceiling dropped a lot farther. He slapped up some plywood, swept up the ceiling tiles and rented his space to NBC so that Bryant Gumbel and the cast of the "Today" show could broadcast from his roof.
The city's quickest disaster recovery took place at the 400-room Medallion Hotel, the largest in the downtown area. An hour and a half after the bombing, the Future Business Leaders of America, a youth group, called to cancel its block of 285 rooms, reserved for that night. Within three hours, the hotel was again fully booked, mostly by newspaper and television crews.
Others wanting rooms had to go as far as 20 miles away. By Friday, hotel managers told the Secret Service and advance teams for President Clinton's visit that they could have lodging only if they doubled up.
Few of the smaller businesses in the blocks around the Federal building see many benefits, however. After several busy days, one taxi company was routed from its offices yesterday when its roof caved in under heavy rain and wind.
By yesterday afternoon, the Federal Bureau of Investigation let Cliff Judd Jr. back into his Auto Body and Computer Diagnosis Garage, where he found thousands of dollars in wrecked, uninsured equipment. He was separated from the Federal building by a parking lot that was used as a morgue.
Those business owners who have found new homes now have to rouse their staffs, often bandaged, to work at all hours. Early this morning, about 20 Hogan family employees huddled on a glass-strewn sidewalk in a stiff easterly breeze, Ms. Hogan said. They waited for Federal investigators to let them into their ruined offices in carefully guarded foursomes. Hard hats and flashlights were mandatory for snaking through upended furniture, up dark stairwells and around ducts and light fixtures hanging from the ceilings.
The Hogan employees had worked past 10 P.M. Saturday at their new offices on two floors of a building about six blocks away.
Jumbles of computers, monitors, telephones and cords sat on the floors there as crews with hand trucks wheeled in dusty, dented furniture borrowed from the warehouse of a local bank that has been cutting back. "I don't want it to face the window," hollered Larque Piatt, the Journal Record's personnel director, as a worker rolled past with her desk.

HEADLINE: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: The Meaning of Digital Life;
Publishers Sell Remedies for Computer-Age Angst

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
It was Al Gore who came up with the notion of an "information superhighway" -- a phrase that's already a cliche, a reality that's somewhere in the future.
But nobody seems to know quite what it is, this highway of digital technologies that is somehow supposed to change the face of work, schools, home life and society itself. Which is why America's leading book publishers see an opportunity to cash in with the definitive what-it-all-means best seller. 
 And it's why the angst-tinged confusion surrounding the future of information technology has created a brisk market for answers, or what can pass for answers, and for the people bearing them: the aspiring gurus of the digital age.
The early lead is held by Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose "Being Digital," published by Knopf, a division of Random House, made it as high as No. 11 on The New York Times best-seller list of nonfiction hardcover titles earlier this month.
Behind the Negroponte book, but selling strongly since it was published two weeks ago is "Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information Highway," by Clifford Stoll, a computer-security expert. The publisher is Doubleday, which is owned by Bertelsmann A.G.,
Several other would-be gurus have joined the chase. And the person sure to create the biggest splash -- or flop -- in this part of the publishing world is Bill Gates, the billionaire chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, whose "The Road Ahead" will be published by Viking, a unit of Pearson P.L.C.
Delayed for months, and most recently overhauled during a marathon week of work last month by Mr. Gates and his collaborators at the entrepreneur's vacation home outside Seattle, the manuscript is finally finished. The book will be published in late summer or early fall, with the exact date to be set in the next week or two.
When the Gates book is published, Viking is expecting a blockbuster. Already, said Marvin Brown, president of Viking, a division of Penguin USA, also part of Pearson, there are advance orders from booksellers for more than 500,000 copies. "I have no doubt that this book will be a No. 1 best seller," Mr. Brown said. "The only question is how long it will last there."
In a sense, this is a race to emerge as the Marshall McLuhan of the 90's, a popular interpreter of digital technology, the way Professor McLuhan served as the sage of the mass media in the 1960's and 70's.
And just as Mr. McLuhan used a Gutenberg-era medium -- the book -- to describe how the printing press was quickly being overtaken by electronic media, the current crop of techno-pundits, though steeped in computer-age skills, have turned to the printed page. They have concluded that the printed word remains the richest, most interactive medium for conveying ideas -- viewed through the eye, brought to life by the intelligence and imagination of the human brain.
So the aspiring digital gurus are conventional authors all, with new books and soon-to-be-published books, running the gamut from Utopian celebrations of the new technology to dire warnings of looming disaster. The publishing industry is rushing to get their titles out, desperately trying to seize the cultural and commercial moment created by the rapid spread of personal computers and the public fascination with the idea of going on line.
In the last year, especially, as personal computers have gone into homes in record numbers and people have plugged into computer networks from America Online to the Internet, ordinary citizens have been forced to grapple with digital technology -- named for the electronic language of ones and zeros used by computers. Not just the machines, but the terms and acronyms of the new technology -- cyberspace, CD-ROM, Internet, World Wide Web, multimedia -- have become part of the vernacular of American culture, commonly used if only vaguely understood.
"People have a real craving for knowledge in this field," said Marty Asher, who edited the Negroponte book for Knopf. "Many people, especially in business, are terrified to admit that they don't know what this digital technology is about."
"Being Digital" is the first big commercial success in the field, though for The New York Times best-seller list that will be published on Sunday, April 30, it has slipped to No. 16 in its sixth week as a best seller. The Negroponte book, Knopf executives say, has sold more than 100,000 copies in America since its publication in February. In a hit-or-miss industry where most serious nonfiction hardcover titles sell between 8,000 and 12,000 copies, "Being Digital" is a standout.
Of the current entries, the book by Mr. Negroponte, a columnist for Wired, a monthly magazine of computer culture, is the most optimistic about what the new technology portends. His starting point is that once all forms of media -- text, voice and video -- are in the digital lingua franca, the structure and economics of the information and entertainment industries are totally transformed. And in the future, the real gap in society will not be between rich and poor, but between the old and the young, who are fluent with digital tools like personal computers and on-line communication.
There will be adjustments, he concedes, but Mr. Negroponte is confident that the technology will not only make people better off materially but also "be a natural force drawing people into greater world harmony."
The Gates book, although not yet out, also presents the vision of an unabashed enthusiast for new technology. The central premise of "The Road Ahead," said Jonathan Lazarus, a Microsoft vice president who served as agent and chief organizer for the Gates book, is "Bill's belief that the model of the personal computer industry is the model for the digital future." That means, Mr. Lazarus explained, a PC-style rapid pace of technological innovation with software playing a key role.
"The Road Ahead" runs more than 100,000 words, Mr. Lazarus said, but less than 10 percent of it deals with Mr. Gates and the explosive growth of Microsoft, the biggest maker of software for personal computers. Most of the book, Mr. Lazarus added, focuses on how the new technology will affect business, education and home life, and on issues related to the development of an information highway, like privacy, government involvement and financing. An accompanying CD-ROM, including interviews with Mr. Gates, is also planned.
Microsoft, of course, has a big stake in how the new digital technologies take shape. So the credibility of Mr. Gates's views are already being questioned. "Gates on this subject is like an arms manufacturer telling us why it's good to have an aggressive foreign policy," Richard Kot, an executive editor at Hyperion, said.
Several experienced computer journalists are weighing in with books cast as measured explanations of the new technology. An example is Danny Goodman's "Living at Light Speed: Your Survival Guide to the Information Superhighway," published by Random House, which is owned by Advance Publications. Having grappled with all manner of high-tech gadgetry for years, Mr. Goodman concluded, "The information highway is a mishmash of technologies that is going to dribble out over years, if not decades."
Mr. Stoll's "Silicon Snake Oil" is a digital backlash book from an engaging iconoclast. He is best known for his 1990 best seller "The Cuckoo's Egg," an account of tracking a computer hacker from California to Germany. The message of his new book, he said, is that "you lead a much shallower life on-line than you do in the real world."
This, Mr. Stoll admits, scarcely would qualify as a revelation to most people. But he has received a barrage of angry electronic-mail messages from cyberspace regulars, accusing him, Mr. Stoll says, of being "the Benedict Arnold of the computer world."
In "The End of Work," Jeremy Rifkin, an economist, warns that the new information technology poses the threat of mass unemployment and social unrest. "Guys like Negroponte predict the end of mass production, but they never say what happens to the masses," Mr. Rifkin said. Since the Industrial Revolution, technological change has destroyed jobs, but also created many more new ones. This time, Mr. Rifkin argues, that will not happen. Nations should cope by adopting a 30-hour workweek, tax credits for volunteer work and other measures.
Despite the varied field of entrants in the guru race, some readers are not satisfied. "We don't have a Marshall McLuhan yet for the digital age," said Mark Stahlman, who heads a media research firm. But Mr. Stahlman hasn't given up hope. He has his own book in the works, tentatively called "The Battle for Cyberspace."

HEADLINE: Long-Running Unabom Case Continues to Perplex the F.B.I.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 23

 BODY:
No one in the United States has apparently ever set off as many bombs, 15, over as long a period, 17 years, as the central figure in the Unabom case.
"We don't know what his motivation is," said Rick Smith, of the F.B.I. office here. "We don't know what his demands are. It's so difficult." 
 More than 20 agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Treasury Department and the Postal Service have worked on travel records, tips, interviews, laboratory reports and other records in the case code-named Unabom by the F.B.I. because universities were early targets.
"We're trying things in this case that we've never tried before," said Robert C. Barnett, head of the office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms here.
The authorities say the criminal is white, 40, quiet, antisocial and extremely meticulous. Instead of buying the electrical switches that he has used to kill 2 people and injure 23, the authorities added, he builds them himself. "He likes to show us his expertise," Mr. Barnett said.
The explosives are not exotic. From the heads of matches the bomber has moved to powders and now uses materials that can be extracted from firecrackers. "The bombs have increased in sophistication," Mr. Smith said. "Today he's more able to do certain things than 17 years ago."
Sometimes, the officials said, the bomber carves bomb parts from wood, and he often packages the bombs in wood, sometimes using four varieties.
The bomber used to autograph the bombs, placing a metal tab with "FC" where it would survive the explosion, but Mr. Barnett said the bomber no longer did that. "He doesn't need the FC anymore," Mr. Barnett said. "We can look at the bomb and know that he did it."
When a bomb is ready, the officials said, the bomber takes it apart and builds it again and again. Before mailing, the authorities added, the bomber polishes the exterior of the bomb.
The victims have changed, from universities and professors, particularly involving engineering, to aviation. One bomb almost blew up an American Airlines flight in 1979. Later the case involved computer stores, and in 1993 the case turned back to professors, including a geneticist.
In the latest attack linked to the case, an advertising executive, Thomas J. Mosser, was killed at his home in North Caldwell, N.J., in December. Mr. Mosser lived on Aspen Drive. Another victim, the president of United Airlines, Percy A. Wood of Lake Forest, Ill., was injured in June 1980 when he opened a package.
The bombs have also had fake return addresses like Ravenswood and Forest Glen Road. One bomb was in a book with a leaf design on it. Another had tree twigs attached.
For return addresses the bomber sometimes uses universities. In the New Jersey incident, the return address was for a nonexistent economist at San Francisco State University.
In the beginning the bomber apparently mailed some devices, as well as placing a few in parking lots, classrooms and stores. The first death linked to the case was in 1987, when a bomb in the parking lot of a computer store in Sacramento, Calif., killed the owner, Hugh Scrutton. The authorities said that when the bomber tried the same method in Salt Lake City four months later he was seen, and a composite drawing was released.
"He was seen, and he knows he was seen," said a postal inspector in San Francisco, Donald Davis.
The next incident tied to the bomber was a mailed bomb in 1993. "We've found people who remember handling the packages, but not anybody who mailed it," Mr. Davis said. "Some were found on the counter when the post office opened in the morning."
In a letter to The New York Times in June 1993, the bomber said he belonged to an anarchist group called FC and promised additional communiques, but none have been reported. "We'd like to hear from this guy if he's got some sort of an agenda," Mr. Davis said. "But I doubt he's that focused, other than to strike out at whatever demons he's striking out at."
One reason for the lack of communiques may be that the bomber made a rare mistake. On his letter to The Times, F.B.I. technicians found the impression of a note that the bomber had apparently written on another paper, "Call Nathan R Wed 7 pm." Mr. Smith estimated that investigators contacted 10,000 Nathan R's but said there had been no results.
Advances in DNA technology may make it possible to analyze saliva traces on an envelope or a stamp, and metal and chemical laboratories are working with the investigators. But none of the 8,000 calls to the F.B.I. about the case have proved fruitful, the authorities said.
"This case," Mr. Barnett said, "is probably going to be solved by an agent doing something ingenious."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Rose 47% in March

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
Orders for industrial tools rose 47.3 percent last month, capping the best quarter in almost 15 years.
Orders for machine tools have increased in four of the last five months, figures compiled by the Association of Manufacturing Technology, a trade group, showed. Economists monitor machine tool orders and shipments to gauge industrial output, consumer demand and business investment. 
 The association said orders rose 30.7 percent in the first three months of this year compared with the corresponding period in 1994.
"The quarter we just completed was the best since the second quarter of 1980," Albert W. Moore, the association's president, said.
Though consumer spending has slowed this year, capital spending is still strong, suggesting orders could maintain their gains, analysts said.
"Car producers still plan to expand factories, the overseas market is improving and companies are reaching capacity levels," said Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York.
To be sure, other reports show the economy is weakening. For example, the Commerce Department reported last week that housing starts fell 7.9 percent in March, to the lowest level in two years.
In March, machine tool orders increased to $558.90 million after rising a revised six-tenths of 1 percent, to $379.55 million in February. Previously, February orders were reported to have declined 1.1 percent. Compared with a year earlier, machine tool orders advanced 50.9 percent last month.
Machine tool shipments increased 24.7 percent in March to $400.05 million. The backlog of orders, which tracks pent-up demand for tools, rose 7.1 percent, to $2.39 billion.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Plans for Supermarket Caught Up in Politics

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
IN some places, a supermarket is a supermarket. In New York, it's a supermess.
That is about the mildest way to describe the status of a proposed $12 million Pathmark store for East Harlem. The long-pending project has turned into a racial, ethnic and political quagmire involving scores of politicians, three levels of government, community groups, nonprofit groups and declaiming lobbyists. It has pitted blacks against Hispanic New Yorkers, devolved into name-calling and sent the normally bold Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani into the hiding place of neutrality. 
 In the middle are the residents of all races living in East Harlem, who registered overwhelming support in a recent poll for building the supermarket on 125th Street and Third Avenue, no doubt because residents of poor city neighborhoods customarily have to pay higher food prices for less choice than other New Yorkers do.
"This is ridiculous," says the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, an arm of which would be the store's chief developer. "This is economic development. This is how we can do things with public and private resources. And people are playing the racial card."
Councilman Antonio Pagan bluntly admits that he resents the intrusion of black Harlem into East Harlem. "It's the wrong neighborhood," said Mr. Pagan, who represents a different district but says he's worried enough about small food markets, mostly owned by Dominicans, to speak out. "They didn't propose this for black Harlem. They proposed this for Spanish Harlem. It's amazing. Shame on them. I'm embarrassed for them. I'm sure you have never heard me pull a race card before, but this is very different."
AS if the controversy in East Harlem isn't enough, the Pathmark dispute has drawn in nearly every other elected official in Manhattan because it involves a land transfer. That requires a vote of the Manhattan Borough Board, which includes all Manhattan Council members, the head of the affected community board, who is supportive, and the Borough President, who votes if there is a tie.
Right now the tally is very close, which is why the Mayor could be a critical player. He can control the two Republican Councilmen from Manhattan, Andrew Eristoff and Charles Millard. Mr. Millard is inclined against the project. Mr. Eristoff is still neutral; both would presumably respect Mr. Giuliani's wishes. But the Mayor -- so enthusiastic about retail development and assumed supportive of the Pathmark project until recently -- has suddenly gotten very democratic.
Many of the project's supporters point to recent polls, which, in addition to reflecting the Mayor's traditional weakness among blacks, showed Mr. Giuliani in new trouble with Hispanic residents. "Maybe the Mayor said to himself, 'I can't afford to take a stand on Pathmark because they'll yell and scream,' " said former Mayor David N. Dinkins, who initiated the supermarket project. "Maybe. I don't know. But it fits."
Unfair, says Mr. Giuliani's communications director, Cristyne F. Lategano. "He doesn't look at polls to determine his opinion," she said. "The Mayor is going to take his direction from the Borough Board." That is odd, because if the board votes no, the project dies. Ms. Lategano said: "The Mayor doesn't have to get involved in this at all. It's not his project."
THE Mayor is no doubt feeling the heat from opponents, who object to the high level of subsidy for Pathmark and its football-field size. Their main fear is that it would push out other food stores, hurting not only them but their distributors. They are, through their lobbyist, Howard Tisch, making their objections known, as is Richard Lipsky, who represents the 16 small-store owners in the area.
Studies in other city communities found that the arrival of a large supermarket holds customers in the neighborhood and does not crowd out the smaller ones. "This is an effort to get food-buying money we know is leaving the community to be spent in the community," said Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. "I have tremendous respect for owners of small supermarkets, but I believe while Pathmark may increase competition, it will not put them out of business." Opponents disagree.
Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission, says critics are ignoring substance and instead churning up racial antagonisms. "This guy Lipsky is whipping up the local businessmen," said Mr. Rose, a Giuliani appointee in the curious position of arguing for Pathmark despite his boss's silence.
Mr. Lipsky says the issue is not race but "an unfair level of subsidy." Economists say that without sizable grants and loans, large developments in poor neighborhoods would be unlikely.
Stan Sorkin, a spokesman for Pathmark Stores, says Pathmark is committed to investing in New York and hopes the Mayor isn't changing his business-friendly message. Councilman Pagan says he hopes City Hall is not taking him and other opponents lightly, "because we're Latinos representing our community." Mr. Butts says he hopes the Mayor "will stick by his economic develoment plans." And the debate goes on. Without the usual referee in City Hall.

HEADLINE: Sinking Dollar Raises the Costs of U.S. Operations Overseas

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 23

 BODY:
The weak dollar is badly squeezing the Federal Government's operations overseas, raising the cost of everything from salaries for Embassy secretaries in Tokyo to living allowances for American soldiers in Germany.
The Pentagon estimates that the dollar's recent plunge to post-World-War-II lows against the Japanese yen and the German mark will increase the costs for the American military by $700 million this year. The Pentagon's total budget is $253 billion. 
 The State Department, with a $2.1 billion operating budget, predicts that the dollar's fall will push up its costs by $20 million this year, not just in Japan and Germany, but also in France, Britain and other European countries.
"The decline of the dollar has certainly caused us serious budgetary problems," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in an interview.
Officials at both the State Department and the Pentagon complain that after several years of essentially flat budgets, the financial squeeze caused by the plunging dollar is forcing them to scramble to compensate.
For instance, the American Embassy in France sent its diplomats on fewer trips around France for reports to the State Department about the French presidential campaign. The Pentagon has asked all the armed services to recommend cuts to help offset the unexpected costs caused by the sinking dollar.
The weak dollar increases the cost to American Government offices abroad of both goods and services, like gasoline and phone calls, and salaries for foreign employees, like cooks or interpreters.
The American Embassy in Tokyo, which pays its Japanese employees in yen, now pays a Japanese administrative assistant the equivalent of $54,000 a year, up from $40,000 last fall, the State Department says. The Embassy in Bonn has had to raise the cost-of-living allowance for a typical Foreign Service officer, which comes on top of salary to account for higher living costs than in the United States, to about $500 a month, double what it was last fall.
For an Air Force staff sergeant in Ramstein, Germany, with a family of four, the cost-of-living allowance has jumped to $580 a month, up from $427 in January. For an Army sergeant based in Yokota, Japan, the allowance has soared to $1,068 a month, from $793 in January.
Pentagon officials estimate that if the dollar remains at current levels, the cost of such overseas allowances will be $250 million more this year than the $1 billion budgeted.
The dollar's ups and downs do not affect the basic salaries paid to soldiers or Foreign Service officers, however, because they are in dollars.
The Pentagon's budget predicted that on the average for fiscal year 1995, the dollar would be worth 108.33 yen. In Friday's trading in New York, the dollar closed at 82.70 yen.
For years, the Pentagon and State Department have maintained a contingency fund to handle such currency fluctuations. But Administration officials say that both the Pentagon's $200 million currency fund and the State Department's $5 million fund will soon be depleted because of the dollar's 19 percent plunge against the yen so far this year and its 12 percent drop against the mark.
"We are burning up money needed for contingency operations," said John J. Hamre, the Pentagon's comptroller.
The dollar's fall would have a much worse effect on the Pentagon if the Japanese Government were not financing much of the cost of stationing 45,000 American troops in Japan. This year, Japan is expected to contribute more than $5 billion toward the troops, covering their utility and construction costs as well as the salaries for Japanese working for the American military.
The Pentagon estimates that Germany will contribute $1.2 billion this year toward maintaining the 88,000 American troops there.
Pentagon officials say they plan to offset the $700 million in increased costs with $250 million from supplemental funds approved by Congress, $200 million from what remains in their currency fluctuation fund and $250 million from cuts still to be decided.
Some Pentagon officials suggest that the weak dollar could aggravate the readiness problems that President Clinton's critics in Congress have sought to highlight.
To cover the State Department's $20 million in increased expenses, officials say they will first drain the $5 million that remains in their currency fluctuation fund. With little enthusiasm, they say they then plan to use $15 million designated for modernizing the department's obsolete computer system.
Richard Greene, the State Department's chief financial officer, said: "You could say that 20 million bucks out of $2.1 billion doesn't amount to very much, but you have to look at our overall budget situation. Our operating budget has been flat since 1993, and at the same time we have 29 new embassies to support."
With many Republicans in Congress already threatening to reduce the department's budget, State Department officials say they have no plans to ask Congress for extra money because of the weak dollar.
Donald S. Hays, administrative director of the Embassy in Bonn, expects the payroll for 900 German employees to increase to $31 million this year, $4 million more than budgeted. The utility costs will increase to $12 million, $1 million more.
The Embassy is cutting back in dozens of ways. It has reduced magazine subscriptions, eliminated overtime, delayed hiring and trimmed its travel budget.
"If you're in a budget crunch, you're not going to send people on a routine basis to cover meetings of Germany political parties or to see the latest developments in the economic field," Mr. Hays said. "You start missing a lot of the color, flavor and texture of what's going on."
As a result of the dollar squeeze, some embassies have delayed promotions, stopped giving cash awards to outstanding employees and even delayed plans to paint fading walls. All this, embassy officials say, is taking its toll on morale.
"It's a real tragedy," Mr. Hays said. "We're being forced to eat our own tail to survive. That's no way to prepare for the future."

HEADLINE: TERROR IN OKLAHOMA: THE ENEMY;
New Images of Terror: Extremists in Heartland

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
When news of the Oklahoma City explosion first spread, it was invariably depicted as an alien stab directly at America's heretofore invulnerable and innocent heartland. But when the suspect turned out to be a white extremist from a small town near Buffalo, the finger of guilt turned precipitously inward.
Suddenly there was a new image of the heartland, of alienated white men nurturing racism and hatred in grimy trailer parks, of shady, gun-loving right-wing groups that held the Federal government as the source of all evil. 
 The quip uttered 25 years earlier by Pogo, Walt Kelly's wise cartoon 'possum, came to mind: "Yep, son, we have met the enemy and he is us."
The first reaction after the massive explosion sheared the face off the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, crushing scores in the rubble, was that the foreign blight of terrorism had breached America's sacred core, and no place could any longer be considered safe.
"Heartland" figured in every headline, in every commentary. "If any statement was made," declared Douglas Simon, a political scientist at Drew University, in the refrain of the day, "it's that any place can be targeted. After all, this wasn't New York or Los Angeles. It was the heartland of America."
The inherent notion was that terrorism was an alien evil, indigenous to places like Beirut, London, Tel Aviv or Tokyo, and if it did invade America, as it had two years before when the World Trade Center was bombed, then it was restricted to what many Americans consider the Sodoms and Gomorrahs on the coasts -- New York, Washington, San Francisco, Los Angeles.
But to strike at the heartland was to strike at an America whose uncorrupted values and innocence were beyond the reach of such violence.
"If terrorists can strike in the safe and place heart of America," declared Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma, "then it is an awful statement about the evil that lurks in the world." To President Clinton, the bombing was nothing less than "an attack on the United States and our way of life."
Editorials across the Midwest joined in with litanies of cities that had suddenly become exposed to evil. "If it can happen on a street in Oklahoma City, it can happen in Minneapolis or Fargo, Madison or Duluth," warned The Minneapolis Star-Tribune. "If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere," said The Daily Oklahoman, "in Peoria, Dubuque, Boise, Montpelier, in Rapid City, Little Rock, Reno."
Conservative legislators rushed to harvest an anticipated wave of support for the Omnibus Counterrorism Act, which is designed to bolster the Government's authority in blocking or deporting suspected foreign terrorists but includes measures that have been criticized as violations of due-process rights.
Radio talk shows buzzed with speculation about Mideastern connections and foreign suspects, and the threat of anti-Arab actions hung in the air. At the St. Elijan Antiochian Orthodox Church in Oklahoma City, less than two miles from the bombing site, the pastor, Father Constantine Nasr, spoke of the anxiety that spread among his parishioners, many of whom are Arab-Americans.
Father Nasr said his parish plunged into the relief effort, but some parishioners urged against holding the traditional outdoor procession on Easter night, which the Orthodox celebrated yesterday, for fear of attacks. "I said we will go outside. Why not? What have we done?," he said. "In my sermon, I said this is a melting-pot society, there is evil here as everywhere, and people have to be very cautious, because emotions can take over from reason."
But when a suspect was announced, he turned out to be something entirely home-grown -- an unexceptional white drifter who had served in the Army, lived in a trailer, carried a 9-millimeter Glock handgun loaded with "cop-killer" bullets, and shared the pathological hatred of the Federal Government that motivates most extreme-right organizations.
Timothy James McVeigh has yet to be brought to court for even his preliminary hearing; that is scheduled for Thursday. But his arrest was enough for a dramatic swing of the pendulum in public perception.
The heartland abruptly lost its innocence. Newspapers and television shows plunged into the murky world of the extreme right, of paramilitary groups with names like The Order, Aryan Nation Group, White Aryan Resistance, Posse Comitatus, Bruder Schweigen or Duck Club, whose members rail against Jews, blacks, Communists, Muslims and bankers, train with weapons, and above all, despite the Federal Government.
"The one common thread is Big Government," said James P. Corcoran, a professor of journalism at Simmons College in Boston who wrote "Bitter Harvest," the story of one of the extreme-right's heroes, Gordon Kahl, a militant tax protester who killed three law-enforcement officers and was himself gunned down. "There are shadings in how they blame it -- some believe Jews control the Government, others that moneyed interests do, others that it's too big, too intrusive, that it's planning to take away their guns, their money. But government is always evil."
The shift in attention caught conservative legislators off-guard, and many found themselves having "a devil of a time" -- as the television host Robert Novak said after watching one squirm on his news show -- trying to reconcile their positions on foreign-based terrorism, internal law enforcement and gun controls."
Mr. Novak's co-host, Rowland Evans, pushed one Republican senator, Hank Brown of Colorado, on whether he expected new pressure for gun control. "I think people are going to be smart enough to understand that this was explosives," the Senator replied noncommittally.
The House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, angrily rejected a suggestion that Republican attacks on the size and intrusiveness of government may have inspired the Oklahoma City attack. But many of the senators pressing hardest for tougher measures against foreign terrorists were the same ones objecting to any toughening of gun controls -- even though, as The Economist noted, the carnage in Oklahoma City took as many lives as are taken each day in murders and accidents caused by firearms.
In the end, public opinion was bound to cease the violent lurches common in the wake of a disaster, and to recognize that the "heartland" was neither all that innocent nor all that depraved and prone to violence. Of the six major previous bombings in the United States, one was in Lansing, Mich., one in Chicago, one in Los Angeles, and three in New York, and all but one were committed by Americans.
In an age of constant electronic communication and incessant analysis, it would be difficult and painful to acknowledge that in the end there was no sure defense against either international or domestic extremists.
The Government was certain to beef up security at Federal buildings, and the F.B.I. was likely to acquire new powers against extremists, just as American embassies abroad are ringed by massive concrete barriers since the Beirut bombing, and airline travelers must submit to electronic checks since hijacking became common.
Whatever security measures were devised, the American Government could never be sealed off from the public. And anybody could rent a van and turn it into a fertilizer bomb, and sick minds were certain to think of new outrages.
But even as the disputes raged, there were other images of the calamity in Oklahoma, images that did not wane or change with the passing days. They were of President Clinton and his wife planting a tree, of exhausted rescuers working through rain and thunder, of people rallying as best they could to help, whether bringing food, talking, hugging a victim or just weeping and praying as the reports came in. That, as The Economist said, was "democracy's natural answer to terror."

HEADLINE: Diluting Day Care

 BODY:
In 1990 Congress enacted child care legislation that was both a boon to the working poor and a long-overdue response to the new realities of American life. Less than five years later, a new Congress is busily ripping it apart -- at a time when, more than ever, Americans are in desperate need of decent, affordable day care for their children.
Consider women who are receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Americans want to see them off the dole and into independence. But the version of welfare reform passed by the House of Representatives recently, which requires states to push recipients into jobs more quickly and cut off their cash benefits after five years, does not provide one extra cent for child care. Instead it cuts funding for all child care by 13 percent over the next five years. Furthermore, it eliminates the guarantee, set during the Reagan Administration, that mothers who leave welfare or participate in work or training programs will be assured of child care assistance for at least one year. 
 The legislation also allows states to transfer up to 20 percent of their already shrunken child care money to other services. They will surely be tempted, given their need to make up cuts in foster-care and child-protection services. The requirement that they match Federal funds to help with child care provisions for certain welfare recipients has been dropped, as has the requirement that most child care providers who receive public funds meet minimal health and safety standards.
Only a few months ago a study of hundreds of day care centers in four states showed that the care given by most was so poor it threatened youngsters' emotional and intellectual development. The House bill flouts those findings by knocking out money intended to improve the quality of day care
If the legislation is myopic, its consequences are a slap to every parent who, pushed to get off welfare, is going to find countless stumbling blocks. The bill is an affront to parents who already have a hard time finding and paying for child care. Above all, it slights hundreds of thousands of children who deserve better of their country.

HEADLINE: Autos Weave in and Out of U.S.-Japan Relations;
Made in America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Thomas L. Friedman (column, April 16) refers to statistics that indicate roughly 25 percent of cars sold in the United States today carry the nameplate of a Japanese manufacturer, whereas only 1.5 percent of the cars sold in Japan carry the nameplate of an American manufacturer. Many "Japanese cars" sold in America are often actually made in America, by American workers, and with largely American parts. 
 More than half the Japanese car models sold in the United States are made in America, and this percentage is rising. In 1993, 52 percent of these cars were made in the United States, and in 1994, 57 percent. They were not just assembled in America from Japanese-made parts.
Japanese car manufacturers provide about 320,000 American jobs in manufacturing, research and development, and distribution. Furthermore, roughly 200,000 American-made Japanese models are exported from America, compared with only 86,000 American-made American models in 1994 (excluding exports to Canada). Thus, Japanese-affiliated automakers in the United States are contributing to the American economy as a whole.
The share of American cars sold in Japanese markets is still low. But this is not proof that Japanese auto markets are closed to foreign cars. The share of German cars in the Japanese market is 3.6 percent. German cars only have 3 percent share in the American market. German cars then have a larger market share in Japan than in the United States.
Moreover, the share of the market held by foreign cars in Japan is growing rapidly, from 4.5 percent in 1989 to 8.1 percent in 1994.
Sales of American models are rapidly increasing in Japan.
January through March of this year, the sale of Ford cars in Japan increased by 180 percent over the same period last year. General Motors and Chrysler cars also recorded big increases. More than 34,000 American-made American models were sold during 1994 in Japan.
Purchases of American-made parts by Japanese car makers are also rapidly increasing, for both American-made and Japanese-made cars.

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: TOKYO;
The Traders

BYLINE: By SHERYL WUDUNN 

 BODY:
Hiroyuki Mizoguchi jumped up and reached across a row of colorful flashing screens to grab a blue order slip from a colleague.
As traders in New York arrived home and dealers in London were fast asleep, Mr. Mizoguchi was starting his trading day. He had just sold $3.6 million to a customer at 83.37 yen to the dollar and made a slim profit for the First National Bank of Chicago, where he buys and sells currencies. 
 At 30, Mr. Mizoguchi is one of this city's agile traders -- and he needs to be. It has been a frenzied month as he and traders around the world maneuver to profit as the dollar plunges, hitting a postwar intraday low of 79.75 yen on Wednesday.
But when Mr. Mizoguchi sat down at his desk Friday morning at 7:30 to chart his trading strategy, no clear picture of the yen's future came to mind. He had read the financial news during his 40-minute train ride to work. He had checked the news wires. He had analyzed the busy trading patterns of his night-shift colleagues.
It was four days until the meeting in Washington of the Group of Seven industrial nations and traders know that what they say about the dollar can move markets. But no one expected any major announcements this Friday. So, how should he bet today?
At first, Mr. Mizoguchi thought the dollar might go up, so he bought dollars by selling yen. He now held $5 million at a cost of 83.32 yen to a dollar. But the quiet market dipped slightly, so Mr. Mizoguchi sold his $5 million position, incurring a small loss, and then sold an additional $10 million. He now owned, net, $10 million of yen.
Then a news item flashed across his Reuters screen: Japan's Finance Minister says the G-7 meeting will make progress in ways to support the dollar.
The comment could be interpreted as an encouraging remark for the dollar. Unfortunately, it would not be helpful to his bet that the dollar would fall. So he switched again and sold yen to buy $13 million. Now he had a net position of $3 million. But later he decided to get out and sold his $3 million. "This market is boring," he said.
The dollar was up, after seesawing, but the unlucky timing of Mr. Mizoguchi's bets cost him about $20,000. Still, he took it in stride -- some days he makes that in a few minutes. SHERYL WuDUNN

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: OSAKA;
The Exporters

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
When Mitsuo Sugiyama left for work on Friday morning, the dollar was trading at about 83 yen, its highest level in days. "It's getting better, but only slightly," he said.
Probably few people worry about the dollar-yen exchange rate as much as Mr. Sugiyama, general manager of the overseas planning office of the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. Matsushita helped make Japan an economic powerhouse and its Panasonic brand familiar worldwide. But the drastic fall of the dollar and the rise of the yen are making Japan's exports less competitive and less profitable, forcing painful changes throughout the nation. 
 A quick look at the numbers: Matsushita, with total revenues of more than $80 billion at today's exchange rate, exports about 1.6 trillion yen of products, or about $19 billion. The company estimates that every one-yen decline in the value of the dollar cuts annual revenues, when measured in yen, by 8 billion yen, or about $96 million.
Despite his company's sensitivity to the yen, Mr. Sugiyama does not have a monitor in his office to watch the currency movements. Nor has Matsushita set up any committees to deal with the yen's surge.
"We know what we have to do," the soft-spoken 54-year-old manager said. "We have been suffering this kind of thing for more than 15 years."
The first countermeasure is to insulate it a bit from currency fluctuations. By hedging, Matsushita has already locked in until September the rates at which it will convert most of the dollars it earns abroad into yen.
A longer-term response is to move production out of Japan. Matsushita now produces only 20 percent of its goods abroad with 25 percent a target for next year.
But that is not the ultimate solution. Many of those overseas factories rely heavily on imported parts from Japan. Those imports have become more expensive with the yen's rise, making the factories less profitable.
There are other worries as well. Can quality be maintained at new overseas factories? Would raising overseas prices lead to lower market shares? Mr. Sugiyama said he thought that Matsushita would be able eventually to adjust to the new yen level as long as it can continue to innovate technologically.
Some economists think the dollar will rise, providing some relief to exporters. But Matsushita cannot count on the vagaries of the currency market. "We are not allowed to be optimistic," Mr. Sugiyama said. ANDREW POLLACK

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: HONG KONG;
The Shoppers

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

 BODY:
Richard Chen, looking crisp in his blue suit, white shirt and subdued tie, glanced at a computer screen in a corner of his jewelry shop inside the exclusive Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong.
"Well, the dollar's at 83.5," he said. "Of course Japanese customers can buy more now, but I don't see many Japanese these days." 
 Before lunch, he said, he had sold a diamond bracelet, but it was to an American.
"Our prices are still cheaper than in the United States," Mr. Chen said. "Diamonds are always quoted in dollars, so the yen doesn't affect that."
Only pearls, which he buys from Japan, have soared in price, by 20 percent. But it has not affected sales.
"Surprisingly, the demand is still there," he said.
Mr. Chen's experience is like that of many business people here in Hong Kong, where the local currency is linked to the value of the dollar. Indeed, many economists here see little negative impact from the soaring yen on Hong Kong's economy and suggest instead that the colony will benefit.
"Look at our trade account," said Ajay Kapur, the regional strategist for the Union Bank of Switzerland in Hong Kong. "As a percentage of total exports, Japan represents 5.5 percent, and about 16 percent of our imports are from Japan. So there is a trade deficit. But Hong Kong is such a durable economy that we will immediately shift to other sources."
Among the many things that are suddenly cheaper here for Japanese is the Hong Kong stock market. Mr. Kapur said that in the first two months of this year the equivalent of 31 billion yen was withdrawn from the Hong Kong market, but last month, there was an injection of 11 billion yen.
"The stock market is like any U.S.-dollar-based asset," he said. "It's suddenly 20 percent cheaper."
On Oct. 17, 1983, as the Hong Kong dollar continued to slip in response to worries about Britain's capitulations to China over the future of Hong Kong, the colony decided to peg the Hong Kong dollar to the American dollar.
There is virtual unanimity here that the move was correct and the concern now is not that the fixed link exists but that it will be abandoned after China takes over in 1997.
At the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Jim H. Y. Wong, the bank's economic adviser, cautioned that his inflation forecasts for Hong Kong this year, at 8.5 percent, might have to be revised upward because of the weaker dollar.
"But not much," he added. EDWARD A. GARGAN

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: ROME;
The Tourists

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

 BODY:
"The mark is like the dollar was in the 70's," said Maria Massa, a friendly dark-haired woman whose family has run the restaurant Dei Musei, across from the bustling Vatican museums, for three generations.
"In those days, the Americans left five-dollar tips, and now it's the Germans," she said. "Its a return to the good old days." 
 Exchange rates have in recent years turned into the rudder of tourism. And if the German mark and the Japanese yen have been surging against the dollar, one consolation for Americans traveling abroad has been that the lira, the wobbly tender of Italy, a perennially favorite destination of American travelers, has been wilting even against the dollar.
So, Italian tourism experts are reporting that the number of foreign visitors during Easter was up 15 percent from last year, led by the Germans but with a strong American presence.
"We had planned this trip 10 months ago, so our decision wasn't tied to the lira, but it was nice to arrive and find the dollar so strong," said John Kennedy, one of a group of teachers chaperoning a high school class from Medway, Mass., on a package tour (hotel rooms and two meals a day already paid for).
As his students lazed about like lizards at the warm and sunny Colosseum, Mr. Kennedy added: "The students aren't complaining about the prices." JOHN TAGLIABUE

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: SHANGHAI;
The Investors

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

 BODY:
Jimmy Sher, an executive with Hewlett-Packard, is starting to look over his shoulder at the growing investment by Japanese competitors.
With China's currency, the renminbi, virtually unchanged against the dollar in recent months, Mr. Sher says his sales of laser and dot matrix printers are growing steadily, unaffected by the currency turmoil. But the future concerns him. 
 With deeper pockets and a stronger currency, Japanese companies are expanding their role in manufacturing and assembly plants in China, an area in which until recently they ceded leadership to American companies, preferring to concentrate on trade.
"More and more Japanese companies are coming to set up manufacturing facilities here," said Akira Ito, general manager of the Bank of Tokyo's Shanghai branch. "Electronics, clothing, machine tools -- all are becoming more affordable to make here."
According to Japanese Government figures, Japanese investment in Shanghai alone doubled in 1994 to $730 million from $360 million in 1993, leapfrogging over United States investment in Shanghai, which reached $560 million.
United States officials are keenly aware of the shift.
"You are going to see a very rapid increase in Japanese investment," said Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, in a recent interview. "The last several years are no indication of the kind of competitive race we are going to face. The yen is one reason. We are seeing a real shift in Japanese strategy toward making Asia a platform for their commercial policy around the world."
If international currency prices shift by the minute, investment flows change over the months and years that follow. American representatives said the full effect of a stronger yen and weaker dollar might not be clear for some time.
"Normally, people are sitting down for a beer and grumbling about their currency problems," said Drew Thompson of MSL Express, a company whose business includes shipping textiles out of China and heavy machinery in. "But that's not happening now."
Yet currency problems in China, even for importers of Japanese electronics, are only one of several obstacles to doing business there. Imports of Japanese television sets and music components, for example, are hit by heavy import duties -- currently 117 percent.
"A 15 percent drop in currency is small change when you're facing duties of 117 percent," Mr. Thompson said. SETH FAISON

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: FRANKFURT;
The Prospectors

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

 BODY:
Trudi Schifter's office overlooks one of Europe's richest streets, Bockenheimer Landstrasse in Frankfurt, and with the weak dollar it should be a street paved with opportunity for Americans.
Ms. Schifter is head of the California Office of Trade and Investment, one of more than 30 representative offices run by American states in Europe as shop windows offering business openings back home to German investors. 
 "We do see an increase in activity," Ms. Schifter said. "We certainly see an increase in the number of Californian companies who are reassessing their ability to export."
The low dollar makes American exports to Germany much cheaper, while the American currency's weakness means lower labor costs that encourage German investment in the United States. Equally, though, the dollar's decline means that the cost of running an office in Germany has shot up, raising a question about the cost-effectiveness of offices like Ms. Schifter's. The answer from several directors of state offices in Germany is that their efforts are worth it.
"This is the time when you need to be here because the Europeans are interested," said Forrest Rogers, head of the North Carolina office in Dusseldorf.
 "We have never been busier and we have never had more inquiries," said Gagriele Brennan of the New York state office," We don't have to go after them." ALAN COWELL

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: LONDON;
The Acquirers

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

 BODY:
As head of European mergers and acquisitions for Merrill Lynch, Ed Annunziato has seen a big surge recently in European purchases of American companies.
But while the fall of the dollar enabled the European companies in some cases to bid more aggressively, it was long-term strategic planning and economic recovery -- not currency fluctuation -- that drove the deal-making, he said. 
 "If anything, the dollar is a secondary or tertiary factor," Mr. Annunziato said. "The way most buyers look at acquisitions is strategically, long term, through cycles over 5- to 10-year time horizons, not over short-term currency swings."
Since Saint-Gobain, a French glass maker, started negotiating in February to buy Carborundum, which is based in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and makes heat-resistant materials, the dollar has declined 7.5 percent against the franc. The decline makes Saint-Gobain's purchase cheaper in franc terms, but did not affect the decision to bid.
"It is a sensible investment, a good opportunity, but who knows where the dollar will be in three months when the deal is signed," said Jacques Valentin, a spokesman for Saint-Gobain.
Acquisitions Monthly, a British trade magazine, reported that the dollar value of European acquisition bids this year reached $18.4 billion by April 19, just below the $19.8 billion figure for all of 1993. RICHARD W. STEVENSON

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: NEW YORK;
The Oil Broker

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Those who buy and sell oil have watched the fall of the dollar from the corner of their eye.
"When you're trading in oil you're not watching the dollar, you're watching the oil fundamentals," said James T. Colburn, vice president of energy options at ED & F Man International Inc., which acts as a broker for big oil companies, Wall Street firms and large commodity funds that trade oil contracts. 
 Some of the questions traders were asking on Friday were: What are the prospects of Iraqi oil coming back onto the world oil market and how will that affect prices? Are some of the major economies slowing, which could reduce demand? Questions about supply and demand weigh more heavily on oil traders than the decline of the dollar does, Mr. Colburn said.
Certainly a big drop in the dollar could cause a decline in the United States economy and a resultant drop in the demand for oil. And that is always a concern to Richard Redoglina, who is a director of the energy group at Merrill Lynch. In Mr. Redoglina's daily work, however, the focus remains on the fundamentals.
"We watch the strategies of other oil companies," he said. "We watch the position of other traders. We don't watch the dollar much." AGIS SALPUKAS

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: RIO DE JANIERO;
The Central Banker

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

 BODY:
Persio Arida is the rare central banker who is quietly pleased about the dollar's recent fall.
"From the point of view of Brazil's trade balance, the fall of the dollar is beneficial," Mr. Arida, Brazil's central bank president, said in an interview from his Sao Paulo home on Friday. 
 Hitching a ride on the dollar's fall, Latin American countries are getting free devaluations, without the tears. Sometimes called the dollar zone, virtually all Latin American nations tie their local currency exchange rates to the dollar. In the region, the United States is the largest foreign investor, creditor and trader.
In Argentina and Venezuela, the dollar exchange rate is frozen by law. In other countries, like Brazil, central bank presidents carefully manage the exchange rate, usually through auctions or purchases of dollars. They know that a 10 percent local currency devaluation today can translate tomorrow into a 10 percent jump in the local inflation rate.
Mr. Arida would not say whether continued weakness in the dollar concerned him nor would he discuss whether Brazil is comfortable keeping its central bank currency reserves in dollars. He said the bank kept reserves in a diverse number of currencies and banks.
For the most part, he said, the weak dollar is a boon for trade.
"The dollar's fall has the effect of a devaluation, without the internal effects," Mr. Arida said. "And what is true for Brazil is true for any other country in the dollar zone. Today, half of Brazil's exports are outside the dollar zone -- Europe, Japan and Asia. To these countries, our exports are now more competitive."
With imports running at double last year's levels, Brazil needs all the help it can get to increase its exports. But economists say that a realistic exchange rate is only one factor needed to turn around a trade deficit.
"The Brazilian currency has depreciated 10 percent in real terms since October, largely as a result of the U.S. dollar's weakness vis-a-vis most European currencies and the Japanese yen," a report published this week by the NatWest Securities Corporation said.
Low inflation -- only 3.5 percent for the first three months of this year -- has put enormous purchasing power in the hands of Brazilians. With the economy growing by 9.5 percent since an anti-inflation plan started last July, consumer demand sucks in imports and diverts goods to the domestic market that might otherwise be exported.

HEADLINE: A DAY IN THE DECLINE OF THE DOLLAR: LOS ANGELES;
The Consumers

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

 BODY:
It was a cool afternoon and a soft breeze pulled at Chris Pawlowski's cap as he scanned a lot full of gleaming new cars at Marina Del Rey Toyota and faced some harsh facts.
A steady drumbeat of price increases in the last few years caused by the relentless plunge of the dollar against the yen, and another $200 price jump just two weeks ago, meant that he had had to abandon the idea of buying a new car. He was looking at a used car, and wrestling with finances. 
 "I'm only 23, and right now that $200 means a lot," Mr. Pawlowski, a health club manager. said. "I'm trying to save some money, and I can't spend that kind of money."
Ross Allen, a salesman at the dealership, said the recent rise was already a key factor in sales, and, worse, bigger jumps were expected.
"That $200 may not sound like much, but it can make or break a deal," Mr. Allen said. "And you know more is coming. You can't do anything about it. But the ones hurt are the little people, the consumer and the people who deal with the consumers. Why is the yen rising so much? Do you know?"
He added, "Used-car sales are where the money is at."
For the most part, car dealers, food stores and other shops that carry Japanese products have yet to pass on much of the increased cost of goods from the steep plunge in the value of the dollar. But it is clear that big increases are coming, if the dollar remains so weak.
The price increases have already brought about significant shifts as the strong yen, while not putting Japan out of business, is reshaping the way it does business.
Toyota and other car makers are raising production in the United States. Toyota recently doubled the capacity at a Kentucky plant, to 400,000 Camrys a year.
Other examples are evident at the Yaohan supermarket in west Los Angeles, part of a Japanese chain where about half the products are imported. Curtis Kasuyama, the store's assistant manager, said that while there had not been any quick leaps in price, the differences between Japanese-made and other products was growing.
Mr. Kasuyama pointed, for instance, to two almost identical packets of instant noodles, called Sapporo Ichiban; the Japanese-made packet cost $1.29, while the American-produced packet cost 33 cents.
"I don't worry as much as I used to whether things come from Japan," said Hiruma Akira, the sushi chef at a Japanese restaurant, who was shopping at Yaohan. "There were some things I liked and I thought they were better if they were Japanese, but it is so much cheaper to buy things from other places." JAMES STERNGOLD

HEADLINE: Kerkorian Bid For Chrysler Is Rejected

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 24

 BODY:
Accusing Kirk Kerkorian of threatening to cripple the company, the directors of the Chrysler Corporation rejected his takeover offer for the auto maker today, while dangling the prospect that they would buy back more stock or increase the dividend to mollify other investors.
In a peppery letter to Mr. Kerkorian, scorning his financial strategy for the buyout, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, Robert J. Eaton, wrote that "our directors do not have any interest in gambling with Chrysler's future." 
 Mr. Kerkorian is Chrysler's largest shareholder, with 10 percent of the company's stock. He did not indicate today how he would respond to what amounted to not just a formal rejection, but a public scolding.
"We are very disappointed in Chrysler's response, and we will make a further comment about our intentions at the appropriate time," said Michael Claes, a spokesman for Mr. Kerkorian's Las Vegas-based holding company, the Tracinda Corporation. He would not say if Mr. Kerkorian would continue to seek financing for his proposal.
Mr. Eaton's letter was addressed only to Mr. Kerkorian, and made no mention of Lee A. Iacocca, Mr. Kerkorian's partner in the proposed purchase and Chrysler's former chairman and chief executive.
After Mr. Kerkorian announced his $22.8 billion buyout offer on April 12, the board said that Chrysler was not for sale, but that it would review his proposal. Mr. Kerkorian has not publicly filled in the details of his financial plan, but the board evidently decided that it had enough information to act. Chrysler said its board had made a "thorough and careful review" of the offer.
The directors reached their decision after meeting at least two hours at the company's new headquarters in Auburn Hills, north of Detroit. The meeting was convened specifically to discuss Mr. Kerkorian's offer.
The board endorsed Mr. Eaton's goal of setting aside $7.5 billion in cash to pay Chrysler's bills and sustain its development of new cars and trucks during the next economic downturn.
Mr. Kerkorian and some other large Chrysler investors, who have been restive as Chrysler's stock price languished, call that too conservative, implying that the board is holding back money that should flow to shareholders.
Mr. Kerkorian has said he would use $5.5 billion of Chrysler's cash cushion, which was $7.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, to help finance his takeover. That idea may prove to have been a great miscalculation, since the United Automobile Workers union, Chrysler dealers and several of Chrysler's institutional investors seized on it to criticize the proposed buyout.
Mr. Eaton's letter seemed to have little effect on Chrysler's stock in trading today. It closed at $44.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 62.5 cents. "I'm surprised the stock didn't crater," said Joseph S. Phillippi, auto-industry analyst at Lehman Brothers. He said the letter was likely to kill Mr. Kerkorian's remaining chances of buying the company.
In a statement, Mr. Eaton said that once the company's reserves exceeded $7.5 billion, "Chrysler plans to use the excess to create additional shareholder value, through share repurchases or increased dividends." He added the proviso that the company would first consider "opportunities for investment in our core businesses and changes in business conditions."
Mr. Phillippi said Chrysler was likely to increase the dividend, but only modestly, so that the company would not feel required to cut back a sharply increased dividend during the next downturn. Instead, he said, Chrysler might be considering an "open-ended buyback program," in which it would continually buy shares, driving up their price by increasing the earnings per share. Currently, Chrysler pays an annual dividend of $1.60 a share
A stock buyback approach seems unlikely to please Mr. Kerkorian, since it would do little to raise the stock price in the short term.
Chrysler has already spent $403 million in a previously announced $1 billion stock-repurchase program.
In the letter, Mr. Eaton said that Mr. Kerkorian's buyout would actually cost $30 billion because it would force Chrysler and its finance subsidiary to refinance $10 billion of bank debt.
"Not a single non-Chrysler dollar of that financing -- according to Tracinda's announcements -- has been lined up," Mr. Eaton wrote. "Even if this immense financing could be accomplished, the result would be a crippled company."
On the day Mr. Kerkorian proposed to pay $55 a share to buy the company, Chrysler's stock, trading near its 52-week low, jumped $9.50 to close at $48.75. No additional investors or banks have stepped in at Mr. Kerkorian's side, and the price has since drifted down.

HEADLINE: Low-Wage Fathers and the Welfare Debate

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
When his son was born out of wedlock nine years ago, Moses Woodruff Jr. was 19 years old, a high school dropout and working at a fast-food restaurant, earning the minimum wage. Given the situation, Mr. Woodruff said, the child's mother had little choice but to go on welfare.
"I was not able to take care of a family," Mr. Woodruff said by telephone from his home in Cleveland. "The minimum wage was $3.25 an hour, and inflation was steady on the rise. My situation didn't allow me to be the provider I needed to be." 
 Mr. Woodruff's experiences highlight what many researchers say is a phenomenon that is being overlooked in the debate on overhauling welfare and reducing out-of-wedlock births: the economic pressures on young men to abandon their responsibilities as fathers.
A study released today by the Annie E. Casey Foundation reported that from 1969 to 1993, the number of households headed by women increased at virtually the same rate that the economic fortunes of young men declined.
Drawing upon census data, the foundation determined that the percentage of men 25 to 34 years old earning less than the amount needed to lift a family of four above the poverty line had more than doubled, to 32.2 percent in 1993 from 13.6 percent in 1969. Likewise, the percentage of children living in households headed by women increased twofold, to 23.3 percent from 11 percent, during that period.
"One of the things that's widely overlooked is the economic dimension in the rise in mother-only families," said William O'Hare, the chief demographer for the foundation, a philanthropy that promotes policies benefiting poor children. "Men with low incomes are much less likely to become married and, if they are in a married couple, they are much more likely to be divorced."
The Casey researchers found the trends to be the same for blacks, Hispanic people and non-Hispanic whites. Mr. O'Hare said global economic competition and automation had pushed down wages, especially among those with high school diplomas or less. That, along with drug and alcohol abuse, makes these men poor marriage prospects for women who want children.
"I think many women may have reconciled themselves to the fact that they can't find a husband who can support them," Mr. O'Hare said. "So they have children and try to support them as best they can."
If there is a link between the deteriorating economic status of young men and the rise in the number of households headed by women, researchers say, the debate over reducing the welfare rolls contains little discussion of the role of fathers, beyond proposals to better establish the paternity of children born out of wedlock and to enforce child-support orders more strictly.
"When you look about and compare the enormous amount of argument about what we need to do to equip, train, cajole or compel mothers to make this transition to work, and look at how much debate or attention is given to fathers, they are virtually invisible," said Douglas W. Nelson, executive director of the Casey Foundation.
But Mr. Nelson emphasized that he was not seeking to excuse the behavior of men who abandon their children.
Mr. Woodruff made the point that it was not just his low income that led him to turn his back on his son, and later on a daughter born out of wedlock to another woman. He candidly acknowledged a history of alcohol and drug abuse and an outlook that led him to evade responsibility.
Such an attitude, he said, also lowered the expectations and level of trust that women had in him, so that he received little pressure from the women to marry them. "We as African-American men have been given a bad reputation, so therefore women don't look at us as being providers," said Mr. Woodruff, who is black. "They look at us as worthless, and sometimes we confirm that."
But four years ago, Mr. Woodruff started to turn his life around. He entered a drug treatment program, got his high school equivalency diploma and began group therapy. He found steady employment paying more than the minimum wage.
Two months ago, wearing a crisp white shirt and clutching a bouquet of flowers, a greeting card and a new dress, he nervously visited his 8-year-old daughter, a child he had not seen since her birth, and whose paternity he had long denied.
"When we first met, she gave me a big hug and a kiss and said, 'Daddy, I love you,' " recalled Mr. Woodruff, who said he eventually would like to have custody of both his children.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
First-Quarter Profit at Nynex Does Not Reach Expectations

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
The Nynex Corporation reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter earnings yesterday and said that the mild winter and higher interest rates had contributed to the results.
Excluding a charge for employee buyouts, net income at Nynex rose a modest 4.6 percent, to $304 million, or 72 cents a share, in the quarter. Analysts had expected earnings closer to $316 million, or 75 cents a share. Revenue increased 2.5 percent, to $3.35 billion. 
 Nynex said its rate of use -- the number of minutes its customers spent on the telephone -- grew just 5.9 percent in the first quarter. That compares with a gain of 8.3 percent during the first quarter of 1994, when a spate of winter storms kept many people at home and made them more dependent on their telephones.
"They're installing plenty of lines," said William Deatherage, a telecommunications analyst at S. G. Warburg & Company. "But the volume of calls on those lines is below our projections."
Nynex also paid $32 million more in interest expenses, mostly on its commercial paper, than it did in the comparable period a year earlier. It said several analysts had not factored that additional expense into their first-quarter projections. Nynex had total interest payments of $191.6 million in the quarter.
Nynex executives sought to put a good face on the results. "There were a couple of things that went the way we wanted them to," said Alan Senter, the chief financial officer. He said Nynex had reduced costs in its core telecommunications group by 2 percent, after a cost increase during the first quarter last year. The reduction reflects the company's sweeping plan, begun last year, to reduce its labor force. Since the first quarter of 1994, Nynex has slashed 6,200 jobs, mostly through buyouts.
Nynex took a charge of $53.8 million in the first quarter to pay for the buyouts. Including the charge, the company had net income of $250.2 million, down almost 14 percent from $290.6 million in the 1994 quarter.
"They're controlling costs, which is a good sign," said Tim Horan, a telecommunications analyst at Smith Barney. "Nynex's costs have tended to be higher than their competitors."
Mr. Senter said Nynex would have generated higher earnings if New York State had approved a proposal to free the company from rate-of-return regulation. Specifically, he estimated that Nynex would have earned an additional $13 million in the quarter if it had been able to keep all the savings from its cost-cutting efforts.
Officials at the New York State Public Service Commission said recently that they would probably vote on the so-called incentive regulation plan in early June. But it is not clear whether the new rules, if approved, would apply retroactively to the first-quarter results of the company.
Separately, Nynex declined to comment on a report in The Observer, a British Sunday newspaper, that it was reconsidering a plan to sell shares in Nynex Cablecomms, its combined cable-telephone unit in Britain. The Cablecomms unit reported robust growth in both cable television and telephone subscribers in the first quarter. But some industry executives said Nynex was chary because other recent stock offerings in Britain had attracted a tepid response from investors.

HEADLINE: Borrowing and Taxing to Protect Water

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
The State Legislature created two new municipal agencies in the spring of 1984 to make it easier for New York City to borrow money to complete a new water tunnel and repair old water and sewer lines.
One, the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority, was set up to borrow money by selling bonds to pay for the multibillion-dollar effort to finish the new water tunnel and renovate the water and sewer systems. The other, the New York City Water Board, was created to set water and sewer rates. Revenues from the fees are used to pay off the bonds. 
 The goal, city and state officials said at the time, was twofold: to guarantee that fees raised for the use of city water and sewers went to repair and improve the system, and to reduce the cost of borrowing for modernization. Interest rates on bonds that are backed by designated revenues, like water and sewer fees, are generally lower than those on general obligation bonds, which are backed by general tax revenues.
The two agencies first attracted public attention in 1986, when Mayor Edward I. Koch announced that the city was beginning a 10-year effort to install water meters in all houses and apartment buildings. The water board approved a rate increase to pay for the installations.
The city, which had experienced several droughts in the previous years, hoped to encourage New Yorkers to conserve water through metering. Instead of paying a flat rate for water and sewers, consumers would pay directly for the water they used. To save money, officials hoped, they would save water.
The water board approved a series of significant rate increases in subsequent years, occasionally drawing the ire of homeowners. Industry groups that represent landlords frequently criticized the rate increases, complaining that the higher fees could not be passed on to renters. They said that landlords had to absorb the higher costs, while their tenants had no financial incentive to reduce their water use.
In all, water and sewer rates increased by nearly 150 percent between 1986 and 1993. City officials said there were several reasons for the increases, including a Federal ban on dumping treated sewage in the Atlantic Ocean, which forced the city to spend much more money to dispose of sludge on land, and a decrease in Federal aid for water projects, which caused the city to spend more of its own money, especially on water pollution control projects.

HEADLINE: From D'Amato, a Lecture on Bad Jokes

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: BROOKVILLE, L.I., April 24

 BODY:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, in his first public appearance since he was hospitalized overnight for chest pains two weeks ago, said today that it felt great to be back.
"This has been a rather tumultuous period in my rather serene political career," Mr. D'Amato said, joking with students on the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University about his health and recent verbal gaffes involving Judge Lance Ito, who is presiding in the O. J. Simpson trial. 
 "Think before you try to be funny," he advised the students and a group of Long Island banking and business executives. Three weeks ago, Senator D'Amato apologized on the floor of the Senate for mocking Judge Ito's Japanese heritage.
Mr. D'Amato also said that he took a stress test two weeks ago because he was suffering chest pains, and that his doctors said the initial results indicated he was "a ticking time bomb and could literally explode." But he said tests at St. Francis Hospital, in Flower Hill, L.I., found him to be in good health and without any problems with his heart or arteries.
Mr. D'Amato, who teaches a graduate course, Critical Issues in the Public and Private Sectors, at Post, lectured on a wide variety of topics today, including the economic health of Long Island.
The Island, he said, along with New York State, had "outpriced itself at every level," particularly in energy costs. "And there's enough blame to go around, so we should not attempt to make it a partisan or personal battle."
Among those in the audience was William J. Catacosinos, chairman and chief executive of the Long Island Lighting Company, who recently gave up a $60,000-a-year raise after criticism from business and political leaders.
Speaking of the high electricity rates, Mr. D'Amato said, "That was a situation long in the making before Bill Catacosinos came on the watch." The comment elicited a broad smile from Mr. Catacosinos.
The Senator said he was concerned about proposals for a nationwide flat tax to replace the income tax. "It's a very popular proposal," he said. "But such a change would be very difficult for high-tax states, like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
"While a flat tax of 19 or 20 percent might sound terrific, you lose the ability to deduct certain expenditures for home ownership, like mortgage costs and the high property taxes we pay here on Long Island."

HEADLINE: Dow Advances 33.89 Points, Topping 4,300

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Barreling through its third century mark in a month, the Dow Jones industrial average yesterday surged 33.89 points, to 4,303.98, its third consecutive session to record a closing high.
Broader market measures also gained, paced by a strong rally in semiconductor stocks and continued euphoria over robust corporate earnings reports. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks jumped 4.40 points, or 0.87 percent, to 512.89, also a record and the day's biggest percentage gain among the major market yardsticks. The Nasdaq composite index, heavy with technology shares, rose 5.47 points, to 828.91. 
 "The market is sprinting here," said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers. "It's running at a pace of being up more than 30 percent by the end of the year. I think that's unlikely, but it's converting a lot of bears into reluctant bulls."
Indeed, advancing issues yesterday outpaced decliners on the New York Stock Exchange by a healthy margin, 1,366 to 863.
Because no single reason exists -- or because the celebrants do not want to tempt fate by leaving out any one explanation -- analysts cited numerous causes for the market's continued strength. For one, corporate acquisitions continued apace yesterday: the Hillhaven Corporation, the nation's second-largest operator of nursing homes, agreed to be acquired by Vencor Inc., a provider of long-term hospital care, in a $1.4 billion stock swap, and Chiron Corporation, the biotechnology company that owns 17 percent of the Viagene Corporation, agreed to buy the rest for about $95 million.
Corporate profits also continued to surprise traders. Premark International Inc., the maker of Tupperware plastic products, ended the first quarter with earnings of 71 cents a share, up from 56 cents a year ago and well above the consensus analyst estimate of 64 cents. Premark closed up 2 3/8 a share, at 48.
Then there was the dollar: Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, speaking at a news conference yesterday in advance of today's meeting of the leading industrial countries in Washington, did not suggest any proposals about how the United States might build a floor under the dollar. Traders considered that a deliberate omission and interpreted it as a signal that interest rates might stay where they are, adding to the enthusiasm for stocks.
In addition, one of the most forlorn sectors of the market awakened yesterday -- Mexican stocks, which have performed dismally since the Mexican Government devalued the peso in December, gained sharply. American depositary receipts for shares in Telefonos de Mexico rose 1 3/4 to 31 3/8 yesterday, while those of Grupo Televisa S.A. jumped 1 3/4 to 20 3/4.
After taking a weekend to ponder last week's healthy earnings reports from I.B.M., analysts had kind words for the company and, to a greater extent, the semiconductor companies that thrive on growth in computer sales. I.B.M. gained 1 7/8 a share to 93 1/2, but the day's most impressive action came among the chip makers. Shares of Texas Instruments Inc. gained 7 1/4 to 101; those of the Intel Corporation jumped 3 5/8 to 96 1/2; Micron Technology Inc. rose 3 7/8 to 80; and Motorola Inc., a laggard in recent sessions, moved ahead 2 to 54 1/4.
"All of the semiconductor makers reported earnings well in excess of what the most bullish of us thought," said Rick Whittington, an analyst for Soundview Financial of Stamford, Conn. "In addition, we got highly favorable reports from I.B.M., Compaq and Silicon Graphics. That sets the stage for continued high consumption of semiconductors."
Mr. Whittington said that after last week's earnings announcements from the computer-chip makers, he raised his estimates of 1995 earnings by an average of 20 percent for each of those companies.
"For a number of these companies, people thought the semiconductor makers were like Ford and Chrysler, that earnings were about to roll over and die," Mr. Whittington added. "This is an upward trend that will last several more years, not just through the end of 1995."
There's no lack of illustrations of just how impressive a run stocks have had. Yesterday's close for the Dow industrials, in which the index broke through the 4,300-point level in the last hour of trading,, makes this the eighth consecutive week in which the industrials have hit a new record. And the index's 10 highest all-time closes have all occurred this month.
The bellwether Dow industrials' first close over 4,300 points came less than three weeks after breaking through 4,200 and one month after breaking through 4,100. The index first closed at more than 4,000 points on Feb. 23.

HEADLINE: 7 Rich Nations Meet for Talks In Bitter Mood

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
For years, the world's three most powerful economies -- the United States, Germany and Japan -- have maintained at least the pretense of cooperation and civility when it comes to managing the world's most vital currencies. Even when vitriolic in private, they always issued soothing statements in public, vaguely promising "coordination" in hopes that a magic word would soothe the markets.
But as the finance ministers of the world's seven wealthiest nations began to gather here today for an annual meeting, they have rarely sounded more divided or bitter. 
 Coordination? Not a chance, said Germany's Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, in a speech last week in which he called Washington's unwillingness to trim further the huge United States budget deficits as "not acceptable." The Japanese, who only a week ago were offering Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin vague promises of action, are back to arguing that the weak dollar is made in America and should be fixed there.
And to the chagrin of the Clinton Administration, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, will not relent in his criticism of American policy. Today he took another swipe at the Federal Reserve for failing to raise interest rates, a step that would attract more international investors to buy dollars, and asserted that the world's biggest economies, by bickering among themselves, "probably missed a good opportunity to prevent" the recent chaos in the currency markets.
There is reason for all this fingerpointing. For all the international angst touched off by the volatility in foreign exchange markets, there is little political incentive for any of the three countries to seek a radical change in the status quo. "The hard fact," one Administration official noted today, "is that we're all acting out of self-interest."
What worries many economists is that open dissension can set off forest fires. Debate still rages over the question of whether James A. Baker 3d, then the Treasury Secretary, helped touch off the 1987 stock market crash after he publicly criticized Germany's monetary policy. In the 1970's, there was a nasty public argument among major powers over their failure to cooperate in creating a "locomotive" effect to pull all of the economies into prosperity at the same time. In that case, everyone was embarrassed into joint action.
"In recent years, there has been something of a nonaggression pact in operation," C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics, said today. "No one wanted to bash, because no one wanted to be bashed. But now there is just too much frustration pent up."
It is pent up because all the major players seem convinced that the others are not paying attention to the fundamental underlying problem -- and naturally they cannot agree on what the problem is.
The Germans and the Japanese say the basic problem is America's Federal budget deficits. It is hardly a new argument, of course, and Mr. Rubin took time out today to argue that it is wrong. As a percentage of gross domestic product, he said at a news conference today, the United States has the lowest or next to lowest deficit of any of the Group of Seven countries, about 2.7 percent.
The Germans are unconvinced by Mr. Rubin's argument and contend that coordination is next to useless until the United States undertakes serious steps to cut its deficit.
"Central banks are certainly not helpless," Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank of Germany, said last week. "But they must follow stability-oriented domestic policies."
Rather than get into an argument, Mr. Rubin did everything he could today to play down the differences among the finance ministers, instead focusing attention on longer-term issues, including how to design international institutions to deal with future Mexico-style financial crises. Is the group as division-ridden as it appears? "There is a temptation to focus on exchange rates because that's sort of pizazzy and it's here and now," Mr. Rubin said. "I think what is critical for the future of the world and the future of this country is that we get beyond the thing of the moment."
Washington argues, of course, that the dollar is not declining on most world markets, but the Japanese yen is rising. And that means the problem is in Tokyo and can be solved only when the weak Government of Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama decides to get serious about opening its markets and stimulating its economy.
For a while last week, Mr. Rubin professed that he was beginning to win this test of wills. Japan's Finance Minister, Masayoshi Takemura, spent the better part of an hourlong meeting with Mr. Rubin in Bali, Indonesia, 10 days ago describing Japan's grand plans to speed up the deregulation of its economy and to stimulate demand with deficit spending.
Mr. Takemura offered no lectures to the new Treasury Secretary and engaged in no arguments, perhaps because, as he told the Japanese press later, he was a bit "intimidated" during the meeting. (That would be no surprise: Mr. Rubin spent 26 years on Wall Street at Goldman, Sachs & Company, while Mr. Takemura, the leader of a small party in Japan, had never dealt with economic matters of any kind before becoming Finance Minister.)
Mr. Takemura's conversion did not last long. Back home from the meeting in Bali, he and other finance officials began talking once again about the fundamental changes the United States needs to make.
Then there is Mr. Camdessus, who faults Japan, Germany and the United States for squandering their chances to work together and says Washington will have to wake up and raise interest rates if it wants to lure investors back to the dollar.
Such advice is hardly welcome at the Federal Reserve, which has a long history of raising and lowering rates according to the needs of the domestic economy, not those of America's trading partners. And as Mr. Rubin made clear by implication today, the domestic economy does not need it -- inflation is low, the economy is headed toward a "soft landing" and the stock market is at an all time high. "This is not the kind of situation you mess up unless you have to," one White House official said recently.
That is also the message the markets have figured out, too. And so far, Mr. Rubin has been unable to persuade them that his daily incantation -- "a strong dollar is in the United States' national interest" -- translates into a solid commitment to find a way to strengthen the currency.
To the Treasury Secretary's obvious frustration, analyst after analyst has gone on television to declare that the United States doesn't mind a weak dollar, in part because it makes American exports less expensive, and in part because it creates so much pain for Japanese industry. In time, the theory goes, that pain will become so intense that Japan will raise the white flag and agree to far greater market openings, particularly in the current trade crisis of the month, automobiles and auto parts.
Mr. Rubin has argued repeatedly and emphatically that the United States "has not and will not use the dollar as an instrument of trade policy." During a trip to Indonesia and India last week, he told reporters traveling with him that "I don't think there's been a meeting that I've had in the two and a half years that I've been here where anybody has suggested using the dollar as an instrument of trade policy."
That does not change the perception in Tokyo that Mr. Rubin keeps a little dial under his desk and inflicts another shock whenever he feels the need to get Japan's attention.
 But getting attention and getting action are two different things, and most analysts seem pessimistic that much will come of Tuesday's meeting. Of course, if there is division, it may take a while to learn about it. Finance ministers are practiced at turning out statements specifically intended to calm the markets and create the appearance of consensus even if little exists. The question is whether the G-7 still has the power to convince.

HEADLINE: Plan to Aid New Business District Rejected

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Facing criticism that it might help lure business away from New York City, the Grand Central Partnership will not help to create a new business improvement district in Jersey City, the partnership's top official said yesterday.
The chairman, Peter L. Malkin, said that his staff would not accept a one-year, $210,000 contract to act as consultants to the proposed district, which would encompass Journal Square and the surrounding blocks of Jersey City. 
 Negotiations for the contract had taken place in recent months between Daniel F. Biederman, the partnership's president, and Jersey City executives.
"Even though I believe helping start a business improvement district in Jersey City would have had social benefits," Mr. Malkin said, "I now know that you simply can't do anything that leads to the perception that you might be competing with New York City."
Mr. Biederman, who is also president of the Bryant Park Restoration Corporation and 34th Street Partnership, said he and his staff had made four presentations last year to the Jersey City group that wants to create the Journal Square District. He said they had done so without being paid.
Mr. Biederman announced the partnership's involvement in late March after an accountant's report of 1994 operations was made public and revealed that he and other partnership executives had already devoted time to the Jersey City project.
Mr. Malkin said the report had prompted criticism from several officials, including Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. Ms. Messinger, who has a seat on the partnership board, has asked for an emergency board meeting to discuss the district's involvement in Jersey City and other operations included in the accountant's report.
The report, prepared by KPMG Peat Marwick, found that the Grand Central Partnership and 34th Street Partnership, in addition to volunteering staff time of their executives, had made "certain expenditures" last year on behalf of the Jersey City project.
The Jersey City project has contributed to a current controversy over the practices and public accountability of business improvement districts, which are authorized by New York City to assess fees from property owners to provide security, sanitation and other neighborhood services.
Much of the debate has focused on the districts managed by Mr. Biederman. Several former employees of a homeless outreach program operated by the Grand Central Partnership have said that they were part of a squad used by the district to roust homeless people from automated teller machine vestibules, sometimes beating them up.
Both Mr. Malkin and Mr. Biederman have denied that any such squad existed or that any maltreatment of homeless people was condoned by the partnership.

No Progress on Umpires

 BODY:
Telephone conversations between negotiators for locked-out umpires and their employers, the National and American leagues, produced no progress yesterday, making it virtually certain that the baseball season will open tonight in Florida with replacement umpires.
The league presidents, Leonard Coleman of the National and Gene Budig of the American, said in a statement that the umpires' economic demands "in a normal year would be insupportable" and in "this year of heavy industry losses" were unrealistic. 
 They said their latest offer would give the umpires a salary scale of $70,000 to $215,000. They didn't say it, but the top figure would be for umpires with 30 years in the major leagues. Harry Wendelstedt of the National League is the only umpire who would qualify.
The scale in the expired agreement was $60,000 to $175,000 for 25-year umpires.

Dollar Up vs. Yen and Mark As Group of 7 Meets Today

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher against the Japanese yen and German mark yesterday ahead of today's opening of a meeting of the leading industrial nations in Washington.
Some currency dealers speculated that the finance ministers of the Group of Seven nations might make a concerted effort to bolster the dollar. 
 "The market doesn't really expect much to happen at the G-7 meeting," said David Glowacki, a senior trader at NBD Bank in Detroit. "But market players want to square their positions in case something does happen."
Indeed, many dealers who had bet the dollar might fall bought dollars yesterday to hedge their positions. But others avoided making any risky moves until more information was known.
"There's a level of risk involved with this meeting," said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics, an investment advisory firm in New York. "A lot of players are holding off until the meeting is over."
The dollar was also helped after the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, said he expected Mexico to recover by the end of the year. Mr. Camdessus was in Washington yesterday to present proposals for preventing another crisis like Mexico's. The peso was stronger, rising 5.8650 pesos to the dollar from 6.0550 pesos on Friday.
An improvement in the peso can help the dollar because the two economies are closely linked.
In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar edged up to 83.10 yen from 82.71 yen on Friday. The dollar also rose to 1.3762 German marks from 1.3680.
Some dealers speculated yesterday that the Group of Seven meeting might set a trading range for the dollar. Central bankers and finance ministers from the United States, Germany, Japan, France, Canada, Italy and Britain were to attend the meeting.
The United States has come under pressure from European and Japanese officials to take action to help the dollar, which has lost 16.45 percent of its value against the yen and 9 percent against the mark in the last three months.
But Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin indicated yesterday that long-term global currency issues would be the focus of the meeting.
Mr. Glowacki of NBD Bank said: "There are going to be a lot of things discussed at the meeting. One solution to the world's currency crisis just won't work."

U.S. Bond Prices Mixed As Group of Seven Gathers

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities ended mixed yesterday with many investors on the sidelines, apprehensive over today's meeting of leading industrialized nations about the plight of the dollar.
In addition, with a lack of economic news yesterday, few investors had reason to place any large bets. 
 The price of the 30-year bond rose 10/32 , to 10327/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 7.31 percent, from 7.33 percent on Friday.
Rates for Treasury bills at yesterday's auctions were moderately higher than last week's results. The average discount rate for a three-month bill gained 10 basis points to 5.66 percent, while a six-month bill rose 6 basis points to 5.75 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Today, the Treasury is auctioning $17.75 billion of two-year notes. It is selling $11.5 billion of five-year notes tomorrow. In late when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.48 percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 6.78 percent.
Analysts do not expect today's meeting of finance ministers of the leading industrialized nations, or the Group of Seven, to have a direct impact on the Treasury market.
But they do anticipate that the United States will be pressed to take steps to bolster the dollar. Previous coordinated efforts by central banks to prop up the dollar have had limited success. As a result, analysts say, the only move that could effectively strengthen the dollar would be an increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at the CS First Boston Corporation, said there was room for surprises coming out of the Group of Seven meeting in Washington.
"I'm getting more and more of a feeling that this is a battle of will between those who believe that a strong yen will impact the Japanese economy more negatively than those who feel a strong dollar will hurt the U.S. economy," he said. "So it's down to who blinks first."
This week, the market will turn its attention to a supply of new Treasury securities and to a fresh series of economic data. The Treasury will announce the size of its quarterly borrowing needs tomorrow.
The Government reports on consumer confidence today and on durable goods tomorrow. The most important report comes on Friday, when the Commerce Department releases its early estimate of first-quarter economic growth.
The preliminary report on the first-quarter gross domestic product is expected to be supportive for bonds. Economists expect the growth rate will be 3.1 percent, a much slower pace than the 5.1 percent of the last quarter of 1994.
But the overall economic growth rate is not as likely to draw the market's attention as is the report's data on final sales and inventory accumulation.
Some analysts are forecasting growth in final sales at 2.3 percent, a significant slowdown from 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter.
Chris Moore, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said most traders were hoping that the market would quickly absorb the supply from the two note auctions this week so that it could focus attention on the growth report.
"The market seems more susceptible to a move lower in yield," Mr. Moore said, "but sellers have consistently emerged when yields have challenged lower levels."
Municipal bonds were little changed yesterday as investors searched for higher-income bonds, but the run-up in bonds to higher prices has tempered demand somewhat, traders said.
Following are the results of yesterday's three- and six-month Treasury bill auctions:

HEADLINE: Let the Public, Not the Planners, Decide Future of Superstores

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Megastores Mean Lost New York Jobs" (Op-Ed, April 18) is the typical planner's accumulation of misconceptions. 
 While the elaborate planning ordinance restrictions of 1961 have resulted in a decline in New York City manufacturing jobs, from 985,000 to 282,000, according to governmental agencies, the article refers to "800,000 industrial jobs" through vacuous reasoning. There are actually fewer than 300,000 manufacturing jobs and if limited to "industrial" manufacturing, employment would be reduced by half because excluded would be most of publishing and other similar employment and thousands of executive office personnel working for manufacturers.
The article allude to the havoc that will be created by superstores. If and when the public objects to the superstores, they will disappear rapidly.
The thirty-five year failure of zoning ordinance restrictions should finally establish that the economy, in all its details, is guided by the public's interest and needs and is not desirably influenced by planners and planning.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper and Oil Prices Decline, While Cotton Rises to a Record

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Copper prices continued their slide yesterday on signs that demand might be weakening.
On other commodity markets, crude oil prices declined, while cotton rose to a record high. The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities fell 0.34 point, to 236.70. 
 On the Commodity Exchange of New York, copper for May delivery fell 3.4 cents, to $1.2825 a pound, its lowest price since Nov. 15. Copper prices have fallen 5.65 percent in the last week.
The decline came ahead of the report set for tomorrow on factory orders for durable goods like automobiles and kitchen appliances, which typically use large amounts of copper. The report is expected to show a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in March, which would be the first monthly decline in nearly two years.
"Copper should be going down," said David Threlkeld, general partner of Resolve Trading in Randolph, Vt. "The slowdown in the U.S.A. is taking hold in both housing and automobiles."
Crude oil prices fell as repairs to a broken pipeline in the North Sea proceeded faster than expected.
Shell U.K. Exploration and Production Ltd. said the emergency repairs on the Brent crude pipeline from the Cormorant Alpha platform to the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands off Scotland were completed ahead of schedule and pumping returned to normal on Sunday. None of the complex's production of 540,000 barrels a day was lost, Shell said.
"The fact that the Brent pipeline was resolved took a little bit of steam out of the market," said Morris Greenberg, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Inc.
In addition, analysts say they expect to see higher imports when the American Petroleum Institute reports on petroleum stockpiles after the market closes today.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for June delivery fell 29 cents, to $20.12 a barrel, ending a five-day rally. May unleaded gasoline fell 0.99 cent, to 61.21 cents a gallon, and May heating oil slipped 0.62 cent, to 50.02 cents a gallon.
Cotton for May delivery rose to a record high amid concern about low warehouse inventories.
There are only 6,291 bales of cotton in New York Cotton Exchange warehouses certified for delivery, unchanged from Friday, and the May contracts outstanding are for more than 300,000 bales. Yesterday was the first day that traders could post their intention to deliver cotton in fulfillment of May contracts. None did.
Cotton for delivery in May rose 1.38 cent, to settle at $1.1688 a pound, a record high.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
The world-class sign-scape of Times Square attracts its first Chinese marketer.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
TIMES SQUARE will soon add another language to the many tongues used to pitch products from the colorful cacophony of its oversized outdoor posters: Chinese.
The San Jiu Enterprise Group, a powerful Chinese company with Western investors and ties to the Chinese military, has signed a yearlong contract to sponsor a billboard atop two buildings at the southeast corner of Seventh Avenue and 48th Street. The sign will promote a drug company owned by San Jiu (pronounced San JOE), the 999 Pharmaceutical Company, which describes itself as China's largest. 
 The painted vinyl sign, being leased to San Jiu by Van Wagner Communications in New York, is believed to be the first notable presence of a Chinese advertiser in the neighborhood. It is scheduled to appear Monday, but may be posted as soon as Friday, in a space now occupied by Union Bay Sportswear to promote denim overalls. The cost of the sign's lease is estimated at $20,000 to $25,000 a month, or $240,000 to $300,000 a year.
San Jiu "is looking for an international platform to make a statement," said Wei-Tai Kwok, managing director of Dae Advertising, the San Francisco agency hired to handle the development and introduction of the billboard.
"And if you're looking for an international advertising platform," Mr. Kwok added yesterday in an interview during a visit to New York, "there's nothing like Times Square."
Executives at Van Wagner hope the sign is a harbinger of more Chinese advertisers in Times Square. They liken it to the billboards that a handful of Japanese and South Korean marketers began sponsoring in the 1970's and that have subsequently come to rival the spectaculars of American advertisers in number and prominence.
"We view this as the beginning of a long and mutually prosperous relationship," said Tom Turner, vice president of Van Wagner.
"We're defensive about overselling the value of Times Square," he added, "but here's a classic example of a company that wants to do something for the first time to raise awareness of its name." The Japanese and South Korean marketers that now write their names across Times Square in vinyl and neon include Canon, Fuji, Goldstar, JVC, Konica, Olympus, Samsung, Sony and Suntory.
The San Jiu sign will be in two parts, the larger of which will be 30 feet high by 40 feet wide. It will bear the 999 Pharmaceutical name in Arabic numbers and English letters and the Chinese characters for "San Jiu yao ye" or, as Mr. Kwok translated, "Three Nine Drug Company."
Through 999 Pharmaceutical, San Jiu, which is based in the Shenzhen special economic zone that borders Hong Kong, sells traditional Chinese medicines like herbal remedies that are marketed in Southeast Asia as well as China and Hong Kong.
The company sponsors what The South China Morning Post calls the world's largest neon advertisement, on the Sheung Wan waterfront of Hong Kong harbor, as well as ads in China on venues like blimps and even airport control towers.
Its medicines are made in Western-style dosage forms like capsules, pills and tablets and packaged in Western-style bottles and boxes. Last year, 999 Pharmaceutical, its San Francisco-based American subsidiary and its American distributor suspended United States distribution of its flagship product, a stomach-remedy capsule known as Wei Tai 999, after the Food and Drug Administration said the package made unproven health claims.
Rather than sell products to American consumers, Mr. Kwok said, the Times Square billboard will be aimed at North American drug makers to alert them that San Jiu "wants to partner with them and distribute their pharmaceutical products in China." When San Jiu executives hired Dae last year, he added, they already "had their minds made up when they came to us: 'We want Times Square.' "
The largest shareholder in San Jiu is the People's Liberation Army of China, which owns more than 20,000 businesses as part of extensive commercial and entrepreneurial efforts being undertaken by the nation's military-industrial complex. Among the Western investors in San Jiu are an Asian unit of Citicorp and two investment funds, the Tudor Investments Group, owned by the financier Paul Tudor Jones, and Paloma Partners L. P.
San Jiu is already thinking about when its contract on the sign atop 717-719 Seventh Avenue expires.
"We really think they're looking to be in Times Square on a long-term basis," Mr. Turner said. Indeed, Mr. Kwok said, the company's contract with Van Wagner includes a clause to upgrade the lease "if we want to move" -- perhaps to a site offering the potential to advertise in neon.
They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway. But in 999 ways?

HEADLINE: Congress Asks, Is Nature Worth More Than a Shopping Mall?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
INCREASINGLY over the last few years, Federal regulators have been criticized on the ground that they spent billions of dollars to attack environmental and health threats without adequately considering whether the benefits justified the costs.
In cleaning up toxic waste, for example, is it really worth the expense to make the site as spotless as a kitchen? Might some of the money be better spent on another problem? 
 In February the House of Representatives passed a bill requiring analysis of the costs and benefits, and comparison of the relative seriousness of environmental and health risks, before any regulation expected to result in an annual cost of $25 million or more can be issued. Similar legislation is soon to be considered by the Senate.
Who could argue with such a rational proposition?
Lots of people.
The main problem, say many experts in cost-benefit analysis and the assessment of risk, is that these analytical tools are too inexact, too prone to large margins of error, too dependent on assumptions and too riddled with value judgments -- necessarily so -- to be employed in the way in which the House bill stipulates.
How much, for instance, is an endangered ecosystem worth compared with the commercial or industrial development that could replace it? Many experts say that scientists and economists do not yet know nearly enough to answer the question quantitatively; that in the end, the attempt would often boil down to a subjective reckoning. Yet the emerging new legislation could require in some cases that the question of costs and benefits be addressed when land use is regulated under the Endangered Species Act. This would be especially true if, as has been discussed in the Senate, the requirement is broadened to include any case in which there might be a "significant impact" on the economy.
Risks to health as a result of environmental contamination -- and therefore the benefits of reducing them -- are considered somewhat easier to assess, but even there the ignorance quotient and the margin of error remain large, experts say. "At their best, risk assessments contain data gaps and rely on assumptions that can affect the outcome by 100 or 1,000 fold or more," seven prominent authorities on the subject said in a letter to the Senate earlier this month. They wrote that while cost-benefit analysis has a place in public policy, it is "no magic wand," and "public policy is not well served by pretending science can do what it cannot."
One of the seven, Dr. Nicholas A. Ashford of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an expert in cost-benefit analysis, says that the technique "is not ready for prime time, and I doubt that it will ever be."
The House bill appears to recognize the limitations of the method: it does not require regulatory agencies to base their decisions on a finding that benefits exceed costs, or even that costs and benefits be expressed in dollar amounts where that is not possible. It merely requires the agencies to show that the benefits are "likely to justify, and be reasonably related to" the costs.
If the bill stopped there, some critics say, all might be well. But it goes on to give the courts the authority to review the risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses in the case of a challenge. Since the imprecision of such analyses makes their results highly arguable, the critics fear, judicial review would open the door to interminable challenges by regulated parties like chemical manufacturers and owners of endangered habitats, paralyzing the regulatory process. That result, some charge, is precisely what the Republican sponsors of the bill intend.
Some prominent economists who support cost-benefit analysis, while recognizing its limitations, agree on the pitfalls of judicial review. "I shudder at the thought of turning these things over to the courts to decide," said Dr. Paul R. Portney of Resources for the Future, a nonprofit research organization in Washington.
The courts, Dr. Ashford says, "are just not equipped intellectually to pass on cost-benefit analysis or risk assessment; they just don't have the expertise."
Even some of the strongest proponents of the general thrust of the emerging new legislation think it goes too far on the question of judicial review. Carried out properly, judicial review "will favor those that have the strongest case in science and economic rationality," said Dr. John D. Graham, the director of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis at Harvard University. But, he said, the House bill "is a little too aggressive." This could be cured, he said, if the challenger is saddled with the burden of proof while the regulating agency is "given deference."
The provision for judicial review goes beyond existing arrangements for risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis, concepts not unknown to the Federal bureaucracy. The Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has performed several cost-benefit analyses over the years. Some have supported proposed regulations while others have not, says Dr. Richard Morgenstern, a senior policy analyst who recently left the agency after 12 years. He is now employed at Resources for the Future, where he is working on a book on cost-benefit analysis.
Another proposed new feature, he said, is a requirement in the House bill that when the annual cost of a regulation is likely to be $100 million or more, cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments must be reviewed by outside panels of experts. This, he said, is designed as a quality-control measure. Critics have attacked the measure because some of the experts sitting on the panels would be designated by regulated parties. But Dr. Morgenstern points out that all panelists would have to declare their interests, as is commonly done in such situations, and that any overweening interest would tend to weaken a panelist's influence. Besides, he said, it is usually impossible to find qualified panelists who do not have some interest in one side of an issue or another, as has been amply demonstrated by efforts to assess the environmental effects of asbestos.
In the past, agencies have sometimes based their assessments of health risks on the worst cases -- for instance, the effect of air pollution on the very old, the very young and those with respiratory or heart problems. The House bill would require that the impact on average people be assessed, as well. A regulation might then be based on the worst case or the average case, but this value judgment would be made explicit.
Similarly, in cases where benefits or costs cannot be well quantified -- as in determining the relative value of an endangered ecosystem and the mall that might replace it -- nonmonetary criteria would be allowed, but they would have to be explained.
Generally speaking, environmental benefits are harder to measure than costs, but even cost estimates are "ballpark at best," the seven experts said in their letter to the Senate. History has shown, said Dr. Ashford, that costs usually have been overestimated and benefits underestimated.
It is especially difficult to measure the value of natural ecosystems. While scientists know in a broad sense that nature has enormous value -- not least, it supports human life -- economists and scientists have often been frustrated in trying to attach dollars to specific slices of nature or natural functions.
These experts have tried to calculate how much people would pay for the use and enjoyment of nature. And it may, for instance, be possible to gauge in narrow terms the relative economic value of clear-cut logging versus recreational use of a forest. But how much are undiscovered medicinal plants worth? Or an individual species or ecosystem with no obvious special utility that is on the brink of extinction? The answers are elusive, perhaps unobtainable.
To some scientists, the exercise is pointless, or worse, because it devalues nature. They point out that while insurance companies may be able to put a dollar value on a human life, moral arguments place human life beyond economics. What is true of an individual human, some say, is or should be true of a wild species.
In the view of Dr. David Ehrenfeld, a conservation biologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, nature "is not a subject for cost-benefit analysis." Not only is it impossible to quantify nature's benefits, he says, moral and ethical arguments for preserving species are more compelling than economic ones.
He notes that this is a minority view, but argues: "The reason cost-benefit analysis has emerged is because, in fact, the moral arguments against killing species are very powerful, even though economists like to pretend they are not. Cost-benefit is a kind of smoke screen that hides those arguments."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW: ECSTASY;
Cheer and Economy In Baring the Soul

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
"If you can't have a laugh and a drink on a Saturday night, when can you?" announces a character in "Ecstasy," Mike Leigh's devastating portrait of four working-class English friends carousing in a shabby furnished room in northwest London.
Over the course of the party, which consumes the play's second act, nothing much happens except that the characters drink a lot of beer, smoke a lot of cigarettes, become sloppily sentimental and sing songs. But through a wealth of casually dispensed personal detail and naturalistic ensemble acting of astonishing intensity and nuance, "Ecstasy" cheerily bares the soul of a society on a precipice. 
 It is 1979. As these London bricklayers, house painters and store clerks chatter and reminisce, it becomes clear that the center is not holding. Booze and rowdy camaraderie provide the only insulation from their terror of being trapped in dead-end lives that are as economically precarious as they are spiritually stultifying. Threaded through their boisterous remarks are currents of racism and xenophobia, with special worry about the new wave of Pakistani immigrants.
Mr. Leigh is best-known in America as the film maker responsible for "Life Is Sweet," "High Hopes" and "Naked." "Ecstasy," which is being presented by the New Group at the John Houseman Studio Theater (450 West 42d Street, Clinton) through May 14, is his first play to be produced in the United States. Like his films, the play is a comic slice of life that gets painfully and sometimes hilariously under the skin of its characters.
Where Mr. Leigh's films have an edge of satire, "Ecstasy" is utterly naturalistic. In the play's opening scene, its taciturn central character, Jean (Caroline Seymour), waits in bed naked for Roy (John Wojda), her loutish married boyfriend, to get dressed and leave. No sooner has he gone than she breaks out the gin and begins silently drinking herself into oblivion. When Roy returns the next evening, she gives him the cold shoulder and is nearly raped. Things get out of hand when his wife, Val (Zaniz Jakubowski), shows up in a rage.
The second act fleshes out Jean's bleak world, as she returns from a pub with her married best friends, Mick (Patrick Fitzgerald) and Dawn (Marian Quinn), and Len (Jared Harris), an old friend who has unexpectedly shown up after a long absence. The party that follows is choreographed by the director, Scott Elliott, with such microscopic perfection that the actors no longer seem to be playing roles. You are looking through a keyhole into an impromptu bash that could erupt in any number of ways.
Mick, the life of the party, is an endearing bloke who suggests a cross between Rod Stewart and Rob Reiner as Meathead. He likes to spike his beer with vodka and when fully tanked does a crude Elvis imitation. Nothing, not even two scary asthmatic attacks, will deter him from having fun. He and his garrulous wife, Dawn, indulge in noisy bickering that threatens to turn nasty but doesn't. As the booze mellows them, they become sentimental and slow-dance to Elvis singing "Love Me Tender."
The couple are so intent on having fun that they are oblivious to the unhappiness of their two companions. Urging Jean to sing a song, they prod her into delivering a slightly embarrassed (and terrible) performance of "Danny Boy." It is Jean's only moment of exuberance.
And that's it, but it's not. "Ecstasy" is as much about a party as "The Cherry Orchard" is about real estate. Its compassion for its characters goes to the bone.

As Finance Ministers Meet, Harmony Stays at Home
Public harmony was notably absent as finance ministers of seven of the world's leading industrial nations met in Washington. A coordinated response to the world's currency roller coaster is "not acceptable," Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany has said; the Japanese see a weak dollar as an American problem that America should deal with, and Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, blamed the Federal Reserve for failing to raise interest rates even more. The discord has economists worried. A1.
 
Stronger international financial institutions were proposed by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Mr. Camdessus to avert Mexican-style crises. D7.
 
Boeing: Profit Off, Stock Up
Boeing earnings dropped 38 percent, to $181 million, or 53 cents a share, mainly because of fewer deliveries -- 59 commercial jets, down from 82 in 1994's first quarter. But Wall Street was expecting an even worse performance, and the company's stock touched a 52-week high. D8.
 
Hillhaven Takes Vencor Bid
Hillhaven accepted a $1.4 billion buyout offer from Vencor, a much smaller hospital chain. Hillhaven, the big nursing home chain, had just turned away another bidder. D2.
 
Lloyd's: Down, Not Out
Lloyd's of London will survive, it said, responding to news reports of its possible demise. This year looks bleak, but it has "utter confidence" for the long haul. D10.
 
Phar-Mor, With or Without Haft
Phar-Mor offered two blueprints for emerging from bankruptcy. One would involve Robert Haft, former Dart Group president, but the company filed a separate reorganization plan in case talks with Mr. Haft fall through. D2.
 
Microsoft Defends Antitrust Deal
Microsoft and the Justice Department defended their antitrust settlement in a Federal court, while opponents of the deal said a judge was right to strike it down. D4.
 
Chiron Bets on Gene Therapy
Chiron will acquire Viagene in a $95 million deal, placing a big bet on a gene therapy company the market had abandoned. D4.
 
Weather Lets Nynex Down
Nynex's earnings rose less than expected, and it said one culprit was the weather. A year ago, pinned inside by an exceptionally cold winter, people talked and talked. This year's mild winter meant mild earnings. D7.
 
Urging 'Brand' Appeal
For Newspapers
Newspapers should build brand identities and imitate the way American auto makers rebuilt their good names, the president of the Newspaper Association of America said at its New Orleans convention. The problem: even though newspapers' revenue is high, their share of ad dollars keeps shrinking and just 62 percent of American adults are daily readers, down from 78 percent in 1970. D4.
 
The Risks of Playing It Safe
For a natural gas company, it's an odd way to operate. Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas protects itself from volatile prices by hedging heavily -- which is fine if prices fall, but it'll lose out if prices rise. Investors are not impressed. Market Place. D12.
 
Times Square Learns Chinese
Times Square has many unusual features, but one thing it lacks is a billboard from a Chinese marketer. That's about to change, with a huge sign for China's largest drug company. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. D11.

HEADLINE: Prevention of Mexican-Style Crisis Sought

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 24

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, proposed today the strengthening of international financial institutions to help prevent another Mexican-style financial crisis.
The proposals, which will be discussed at this week's annual spring round of meetings among world finance ministers here, underscored the financial leaders' continuing preoccupation with the fallout from Mexico's botched devaluation last December and the destabilizing shockwaves it sent through financial markets around the world. 
 "We need to create a financial architecture that is as modern as the financial markets and the challenges of today's economy," Secretary Rubin told a press conference, stressing the greatly increased speed with which huge sums of money can shift around the world, disrupting economic growth and undermining exchange rates.
"There have been tremendous changes in the international financial system in the last few years" as capital flows have increased in size and speed, Mr. Rubin said, adding that the time was ripe for finance ministers to review the world's existing financial institutions.
The proposals that both men offered were fundamentally similar, stressing the need for a new early warning system to spot countries in potential financial trouble; an emergency financing system to help those with a sudden outflow of capital, and special steps to aid the poorest and most heavily indebted countries, including the possible sale of some of the I.M.F.'s 103 million ounces of gold bullion.
The main difference between the two proposals appeared to be a public appeal by Mr. Camdessus for a doubling of the I.M.F.'s capital, now about $217 billion, giving it more funds to lend to countries with financial difficulties so that they gain time to adjust their economic policies in a relatively controlled way.
Mr. Camdessus said the world needs "a strong I.M.F. able to respond decisively to future crises." He termed "conservative" his proposal for a doubling of the subscriptions, known as quotas, that the I.M.F.'s 179 member countries pay.
Secretary Rubin did not discuss increasing the I.M.F.'s quotas. But officals said the Administration has agreed to consider some increase. But increasing America's $40 billion I.M.F. quota has tended to create political difficulties for the Administration since 1983, when Congress mandated that all new contributions go through the normal Congressional appropriation process even though such payments do not affect the budget deficit.
Although the proposals put forward by Secretary Rubin and Mr. Camdessus are directly inspired by the Mexican crisis, both emphasized that Mexico's economy is on the mend as a result of the tough austerity measures taken by the government of President Ernesto Zedillo.
Mr. Camdessus called the "first results" of this austerity package "very encouraging," noting that the huge trade deficit that undermined the peso is being wiped out, while the exchange rate is now at a more reasonable level and investor confidence is returning.
The comments from the two helped send the Mexican stock market to a three-month high as the main stock index jumped almost 98 points, or 5 percent. The peso also rallied, rising 2.5 percent to just over 167 cents to the dollar.
Mr. Rubin said that a more effective early warning system to identify countries facing potential difficulties would require "comprehensive and timely public disclosure of monetary and financial data."
But he also called for more effective international surveillance of all nations' economies with the I.M.F. developing "a greater capacity for ongoing and more intensive monitoring of countries and of capital market developments that present potential risks to the system."
In a paper prepared for this week's ministerial discussions, Mr. Camdessus said he was making very similar recommendations, including more frequent I.M.F. reviews of some countries' economic policy than the single annual review required under Article 4 of its rules and more pointed and critical judgments by the I.M.F. instead of the opaque verdicts it usually issues.

HEADLINE: Let the Public, Not the Planners, Decide Future of Superstores;
Can't Ignore the Car

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Megastores Mean Lost New York Jobs" (Op-Ed, April 18), Tom Angotti and Ron Shiffman call for these proposed shopping giants to be situated "near mass transit while eliminating parking." 
 The secret to the success of giant shopping facilities in the suburbs is that they offer acres of convenient parking for shoppers who load up with the bulky items these stores and warehouses sell at discount prices. Shoppers cannot lug huge purchases into the subway, and taxi fares would wipe out the savings.
New York City planners repeatedly fail to recognize that the automobile is part of the 20th, and soon to be 21st, century. The Jacob K. Javits Convention Center suffers because of a total lack of parking. Too many New Yorkers cannot take advantage of Battery Park City's recreational and cultural activities because of insufficient parking. And just look at the brouhaha in the Bronx over parking for Yankee Stadium.
Unfortunately, until New York City planners and politicians recognize the automobile, and make acommodation for its use, large-scale developments like megastores and discount warehouses should be put in park.

HEADLINE: The U.S. Is Still No. 1

BYLINE: By Josef Joffe 

DATELINE: MUNICH

 BODY:
Thirty years ago, the dollar was worth four marks; today, it is one-third as much. Then, Americans could travel across Europe on $5 a day; now, $50 won't pay for bed and bratwurst. Have the mighty fallen? Have Japan and Germany, with their swollen currencies, muscled aside Uncle Sam? Hardly.
It is Washington that orchestrates the Middle East peace process. America, not Germany or Japan, leads the drive against the spread of the Bomb, coaxes North Korea and confronts Iraq. When the U.S. went into Somalia, the others followed; when it bolted, the others did, too. And who defines the relationship with Russia? 
 There are more power centers now than during the cold war. But the U.S. still sits on top of the heap, no matter what the traders say about the dollar. Indeed, power is when a country can devalue its currency as brutally as the U.S. has without unleashing retaliation. In the 1920's and 1930's, the watchword was "competitive devaluation." If country A devalued, countries B and C followed suit immediately so as to deny A the advantage of cheaper export prices. Or they would raise tariffs in order to get even.
Today, Germany and Japan just watch the dollar plummet; they manipulate neither tariffs nor parities, even as the skyrocketing yen and mark tear at their competitiveness.
Since the middle Reagan days, the external value of the dollar has been halved, which is the equivalent of a 100 percent surcharge on exports to the United States. The rest of the world submitted, another way of dramatizing America's exalted position in the global trading system. Nobody wants to wants to rile Mr. Big, let alone lose the largest market there is.
Historically, nations that play the devaluation game never win. After a short-term improvement in the trade balance, the bill comes due. Higher import prices fuel inflation by driving up the domestic price level. As a result, exports decline and the trade deficit rises again. Miraculously, though, the U.S. has been spared that fate. As the dollar declines, inflation holds steady. Indeed, the U.S. is once more the world's largest exporter.
This explains why Bill Clinton and Alan Greenspan, apart from ritual murmurings of "this can't go on," have been so laid back. In spite of the incredibly shrinking greenback, the U.S. is doing quite well. Nor, one must add, could the Fed do very much to arrest the slide. When trillions of dollars zoom instantly around the world, a few billions in intervention money amount to little.
So much for the short run. In the longer run, though, the U.S. has a big problem. America has lived like a person who writes checks at will. For almost a generation, it has bought more abroad than it sold -- hence, the zillions of dollars in global circulation. What happens when there is too much money? It buys less. Hence, no more four marks to the dollar.
Again, the external value of one's currency does not really matter as long as the fundamentals are sound. But the unstoppable fall of the dollar says that the fundamentals at home are askew. It virtually screams that America is consuming too much while saving and investing too little. The Government is living on borrowed money; so is the consumer.
When households are profligate, they go bankrupt. Great powers can postpone the reckoning for a long time. But even the greatest powers of their days -- Spain, France -- fell from grace because they ignored the ledgers for too long. It is not the dollar that will deflate American power. It is profligacy -- being hooked on the sweet poison of consumption -- that might yet lay low the American economy and thus American might.

Promises on the Dollar, But No Clear Course Is Set
 The U.S. and other economic powers promised to work together to reverse the dollar's fall. But some traders had their doubts even before the meeting ended that the seven big industrial nations would act decisively to revive the slumping dollar. 
 The dollar slipped further in New York, as the meeting took place, but in early Tuesday trading in Tokyo, it reversed course, climbing more than a half-yen. A1.
 Poor countries appealed to the economic powers to keep financing a World Bank agency that gives low-cost development loans. D4.
 
Low Point for RJR Nabisco
 RJR Nabisco's shares hit a 52-week low of $26.625 after the company reported disappointing earnings, which was only its latest bit of bad news. U.S. tobacco sales are falling, sales are weak abroad, legal liabilities loom, and Kohlberg, Kravis recently got rid of its 8 percent stake. D2.
 
Met Life in Merger Talks
 Metropolitan Life and New England Mutual are discussing a merger. Met Life, its insurance sales to the middle class sagging, is eager to expand among richer households, while for New England Mutual, the lure is Met Life's financial might. D6.
 
A New Microsoft Alliance
 Computer Associates and Microsoft teamed up to market a software package for corporate computer systems. D2.
 
After 6 Years, Profits at UAL
 UAL turned its first quarterly profit since 1989, a sure sign that the 1994 employee buyout put a big dent in United's costs. D8.
 
Newsprint on Their Minds
 Soaring newsprint prices -- up 40 percent recently -- will force more newspapers to close or scale back, publishers said at their New Orleans convention. D8.
 
The Power of Lobbyists
 Georgia-Pacific wanted the E.P.A. off its back, so lobbyists got custom-made language into a bill, due for a Senate panel vote today, on limiting Government regulators. A18.
 
Kmart Halves Its Dividend
 Kmart halved its dividend and said it expected a loss. Joseph Antonini, long the chief executive, defended the dividend, so the cut has been expected since he resigned. D2.
 
Rising Yen Takes Toll on Mazda
 Mazda will slash production twice as deeply as it had planned, a sign that the company -- which is more dependent than other Japanese car makers on exports to the United States -- is being battered by the yen's surge. D4.
 
Sitting Ducks Like Chrysler?
