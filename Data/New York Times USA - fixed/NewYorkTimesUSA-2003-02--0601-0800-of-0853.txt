HEADLINE: FROM PROJECTOR TO POLYGONS; 
A Thin Line Between Film And Joystick

BYLINE:  By MICHEL MARRIOTT

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif. 

 BODY:
AS if in a shadow play of a major Hollywood premiere, photographers pressed up to a procession of film stars strolling into a theater aglow with hype and klieg lights. Keanu Reeves chatted on camera with "Access Hollywood" and MTV reporters. Will Smith and his wife, the actress Jada Pinkett Smith, waved to onlookers. Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne glittered on a black carpet ordered for the occasion.
 The event at Warner Brothers Studios was a sort of coming-out party for Enter the Matrix -- not one of the long-anticipated sequels to "The Matrix," the cyber-chic 1999 thriller, but a video game. 
 With a production cost that some industry experts estimate at as much as $20 million, Enter the Matrix is likely to be the most expensive video game yet made. More important, the game, laced with an hour of new "Matrix" film scenes and megabytes of cinematic tricks, represents the closest collaboration so far between the converging orbits of moviemaking and game production in an entertainment universe that is finding new profits, partnerships and possibilities in ever more sophisticated digital technologies. 
The game's 244-page equivalent of a shooting script was written by Larry and Andy Wachowski, the brothers who wrote and directed "The Matrix" for Warner Brothers Pictures, as well as two sequels that are being readied for release this year. (The game's release by Shiny Entertainment is to coincide with the May 15 opening of the first sequel, "The Matrix Reloaded.") Similarly, the films' set and custom designers and much of their departments did double duty for the game, as did the movies' Hong Kong fight choreographer, Yuen Wo Ping, and the films' lead actors.
"We had a notion to take the stars of the movies and have them play supportive roles in the video game and tell a story that is a companion story to the movies'," said Joel Silver, the films' producer. Blending the productions, he said, became essential to maintaining the quality and requirements of the "content driven" projects.
"There are scenes that start in the video game and will complete the movie," he said, noting that the game was conceived to "feel like it's a part and experience of the movie." Some of the plot lines intersect, and one of the player's missions is to get a character to a location pivotal to the story in "Reloaded."
Bruno Bonnell, chairman and chief executive of Infogrames, which recently acquired Shiny Entertainment, calls the phenomenon "a revolution in interactive entertainment." 
Of her months of work on both the "Matrix" sequels and the game as the tough hovercraft pilot known as Niobe, Ms. Pinkett Smith said, "It's all one project." 
Some of the bigger video game developers, like Activision and Electronic Arts, have also been quick to capitalize on securing licenses to movies, gambling millions of dollars on whether movie premises and characters can make top-selling games.
This year, besides Enter the Matrix, game enthusiasts can expect a slew of movie-related video games that are being developed with the increasingly close cooperation of the moviemakers and actors. Even Disney's "Piglet's Big Movie," due in theaters March 21, is being accompanied by a video game, Piglet's Big Game, made by Gotham Games. It took advantage of Disney's willingness to help blur the line between movie and game by giving both the same look, feel and vocals, said Greg Ryan, general manager of Gotham Games. 
Last year, Activision, with games like Spider-Man: The Movie, and Electronic Arts, with Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, struck gold with movie-to-game projects. Both games, executives for the companies said, were created with unusually high access to the films' makers, including having the movies' actors reprise their roles specifically for the games.
And at an average retail price of $50 a game, the economics of translating a blockbuster movie into a game that could sell millions of copies is attractive, many gamemakers and moviemakers said. 
"I think what is going on is that everyone has realized that we are going after the same target audience," said Kathy Vrabeck, an executive vice president at Activision, referring to young males. "I'm not surprised to see more convergence of movies and video games, bringing that experience into the interactive realm where they can continue that experience for hours and hours."
Neil Young, an Electronic Arts vice president in charge of production for the company's "Lord of the Rings" game franchise, said he had video conference calls from his office in Redwood City, Calif., with Peter Jackson, the New Zealand-based director of the film trilogy.
"It is important to keep him in the loop," Mr. Young said. "We're trying to understand the language of the film and adopt and retain its core essence, but diverge in ways that are right for the game medium."
Mr. Young cautions that not every film, no matter how popular or celebrated, can be adapted into a video game. For example, gamers are not likely to see "The Hours" or "Chicago" games popping up on their Play-Station 2 consoles. Action, fantasy and science fiction genres appear to be the most adaptable.
"We rule out chick movies," Ms. Vrabeck said with a chuckle.
Trying to capture box-office lightning in a game cartridge is not new. Some of the first mass-market video games to emerge in the late 1970's were inspired by "Star Wars." But video games based on popular films have often disappointed gamers. For years, they tended to be marketing afterthoughts or blatant money grabs churned out with little more imagination than it took to flood the market with movie-themed lunch boxes and T-shirts, critics noted.
Only in recent years, with explosively powerful microprocessors and 3-D graphics chips, as well as the immense popularity of consoles like PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube, have game technologies matured enough to beginto approach convincing filmlike qualities, said David Perry, president of Shiny Entertainment.
"And we're still in our infancy," he added.
High on a California hillside in temporary quarters near Laguna Beach, Mr. Perry, 35, is overseeing Shiny Entertainment's completion of Enter the Matrix, its most ambitious project since the company was founded 10 years ago. Because of the game's crucial tie-in with the film's release in May, the game must be finished some time in April. So, Mr. Perry said with cool confidence, the pressure is on him and his 70-member team to complete the game, which will be available for PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and PC.
It was more than two years ago when Shiny landed the deal with the Wachowskis to produce the first commercial video game based on the world and characters of their blockbuster film. Mr. Perry said he remembered thinking how fortunate it would be if he could persuade the filmmakers to devote just a tad of the shooting for the "Matrix" sequels to the game's introduction.
He said he had no idea how committed the Wachowski brothers, who are known to be avid gamers, would be in lending their ideas and creative energies to the game itself. In addition to giving Mr. Perry and his game developers almost full run of the "Matrix" film studios and locations in the United States and Australia, they wrote the script, produced an hour of film sequences for the game and completed another hour that Shiny turned into computer-generated imagery that Mr. Perry calls "cinematics." 
The effect, he explained, is having a game that is so thoroughly infused with "Matrix" action, scenery and characters that it does not simply retell the film's story, but greatly elaborates upon it. "Our game and 'Reloaded' run in parallel, but they do affect each other as the story goes down," he said.
On first impression, the game still has more of a video-game look than the deep, richly colored tone of a multimillion-dollar movie. But as Mr. Perry notes, the game's characters are designed to move with the agility and fine facial expressions of live action. A major reason is that the Wachowskis insisted that all the characters' movements in the game be based on those of the actors or their stunt doubles.
"When Jada reaches for a phone in the game, she was motion-captured reaching for a phone," Mr. Perry said, describing a painstaking process that required actors to wear custom-fitted suits and strategically placed markers so that an array of up to 32 special cameras could capture their movements. The information was then uploaded into computers and incorporated into digital versions of the actors.
And because the Wachowskis favor tight close-ups in their filmmaking, Shiny incorporated new methods for capturing fine facial expressions as well as scanning actors' heads -- a technique that Mr. Perry calls alpha-mapping -- to create faces and hair that look real. 
Shiny Entertainment technologists also developed programs that can shift the tiny picture elements, or polygons, of an object or a character to where and when they are most needed. The result is a smooth fade from a long shot of two characters going hand to hand to a cinematic zoom into a close-up of a victorious expression. 
Hard-core "Matrix" fans may be disappointed that they cannot play any of the leading characters, including Neo, who is portrayed by Mr. Reeves and who does appear in the game. But Mr. Perry said playing the film's practically all-powerful character did not necessarily translate into the most engaging game play.
Characters new to "The Matrix" inits film sequels -- Niobe, portrayed by Ms. Pinkett Smith, and Ghost, a weapons expert portrayed by Anthony Wong -- are the figures that can be guided through the game's seven major missions, which cross several game genres, including shooting, fighting, flying and driving. The goal is to help Neo and his crew save humanity.
"We're really, really focusing on letting people have fun," Mr. Perry said. "That's the most important thing."

HEADLINE: As Gasoline Prices Rise, Drivers Have Doubts About Why 

BYLINE:  By NICK MADIGAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Beyond antiwar demonstrations and troop deployments, gasoline prices that have jumped to more than $2 a gallon in some places seem to many drivers to be the most tangible evidence of the Bush administration's plans for a possible attack on Iraq.
 People pumping gas from Los Angeles to Charlotte, N.C., in the past few days surmised that the oil companies were cashing in on the uncertain geopolitical climate, with the effect trickling down to the corner gas station. 
 "If there's a chance of the oil companies' driving up the prices, they'll do that," said Jeremy Levenson, a doctor who had just paid $30.63 -- at $2.09 a gallon, the most he had ever spent -- to fill the tank of his Infiniti I30 with high-octane gasoline at a Union 76 station in the Westchester district of Los Angeles.
"Who knows how much of this is artifice and how much is created by the oil companies for their own benefit?" he asked. "It's what the traffic will bear. It's capitalism." 
Since late last year, the price of gasoline has risen an average of 29 cents a gallon, according to the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group representing more than 400 oil and natural gas companies.
According to AAA, the motorist club, which assembles a daily compilation of gas prices, today's national average for regular unleaded gas was $1.66 a gallon, a few cents shy of the record average, $1.71, reached on May 15, 2001. Here in California, gasoline costs more than anywhere else in the country, with drivers today paying about $1.89 a gallon for regular unleaded gas and $2.05 for premium, AAA reported. Prices in Hawaii, usually the highest, were just a cent or two less. In New York State, regular was selling today for an average for $1.76 a gallon, with premium at $1.92; in New Jersey, home to many refineries, regular was $1.55 a gallon, while premium was $1.73.
But several factors are in the mix behind rising gas prices, including the possibility of war, said John Felmy, the petroleum institute's chief economist.
"You either believe in conspiracies or you believe in market fundamentals," Mr. Felmy said. "Most consumers just see the price going up and down, but they don't look into why."
Among the main reasons for the rise in prices, he said, was a 78-day strike by oil workers in Venezuela that removed as much as 4 percent of the world's supply for oil from the market. The United States imports 9 percent of its daily oil consumption -- primarily crude oil and petroleum products like diesel fuel and asphalt -- from Venezuela.
A similar strike in Nigeria has also affected the marketplace, Mr. Felmy said, though on a lesser scale. And the sharply colder weather has increased demand for home heating oil.
Inventories of crude oil are low and refiners have scaled back production accordingly. Typically, they stockpile oil this time of year to produce more gas as the heavy driving summer months approach. But because they are not stockpiling now, prices will probably stay high through the spring.
"There is some nervousness about Iraq," Mr. Felmy said, "and that's created some instability in the markets. Importers, traders and refineries tend to stock up, and so some participants put their prices up. If you don't, you exhaust your supply."
Such explanations seem to be small consolation to consumers.
"My theory is that they're stacking up on profits right now for if we do go to war," said Kathy Reilly, a minivan driver in Seattle. "I think a lot of it is pure greed."
Tim Jones, a computer network administrator from Tucson, recalled that in August 1990, immediately after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the price of gasoline soared virtually overnight. "And that fuel was already here, already in the tanks, already paid for," Mr. Jones said. "It's all about money."
Earlier this month, in Ann Arbor, Mich., Kathi Kelley got behind the wheel of her Toyota Rav4 for the first time since breaking her wrist in December and said she was astonished that gas prices had gone up 25 cents a gallon since she was last on the road. Ms. Kelley said she thought there was a direct correlation between the price increases and the mounting talk of conflict.
"With the idea of war looming, prices are not going down," said Ms. Kelley, who commutes 45 minutes each way to work every day to Jackson, Mich.
While some people said they did not want to pay at the pump for war, other consumers were willing to.
"I think the war is probably inevitable and probably necessary, and if higher prices are what we need for more security and safety than I'm willing to pay that," said David Fransko, a stockbroker filling up his Ford Explorer at a Shell station in Ann Arbor.
For some, sacrifice means driving less. In Bothell, a suburb of Seattle, Guy Nguyen and his wife, Diana, both drive to work, he to Bellevue, Wash., and she to Redmond, Wash. They recently returned from a vacation to find much higher gas prices, and decided this week to start sharing one of their two cars; they own a Toyota 4-Runner S.U.V. and a Chevy Tahoe pickup truck, the latter a guzzler with a V-8 engine that gets about 12 miles a gallon on the highway. The more modest Toyota seemed the better choice.
"I've looked everywhere and it's almost two dollars," said Mr. Nguyen, a car salesman, referring to the price of premium gasoline.
AAA reported that the average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas has increased in Washington State by 18 cents in the past month, to $1.55. In neighboring Idaho, prices for regular have increased nearly 15 cents in the same period, to $1.59 a gallon.
"I don't blame the government, I blame the gas companies," Mr. Nguyen said. "They have to find some way to make more profits."
Gasoline station operators are not necessarily happy about the increases, since they tend to strain relationships with customers.
"We got hit with another 4-cent increase yesterday," said Tom Simon, manager of a Union 76 station in Marina del Rey, west of Los Angeles, where full-service, high-octane gas was selling today for $2.29 a gallon. "We're not here for the fast buck, but it just keeps going up."
Paradoxically, Mr. Simon said, sales have risen, as drivers top off their tanks in anticipation of further increases.
"People are still going to buy gas and they're still going to buy S.U.V.'s -- at least in this area," he said, pointing to a Ford Expedition and a Cadillac Escalade being filled at the pumps.
"We're all dependent on gasoline -- it's like caffeine, or sugar," said Peggy Fisher, a dance teacher who had just spent $16.89 to put almost 10 gallons of the cheapest gas in her Honda Odyssey van. "These are our addictions."
Another customer, a taxi driver, Fred Sam, said he used to be able to fill up his tank for $20. Now, Mr. Sam said, it costs $50.
"At these prices, if you only make $5 or $10 an hour, you keep having to come back and put $5 or $10 worth of gas in the cab," said Mr. Sam, who pays $500 a week to lease his taxi. "I barely break even."
Even people who say that the prospect of a war with Iraq is a pretense to raise prices seem to have adopted an attitude of resignation. Few seemed indignant.
David Elder, a carpenter who was filling up his 1996 Chevy S10 truck on Monday in Charlotte, said he thought the troubles in Venezuela were the main culprit. But if war starts with Iraq, Mr. Elder said, prices "will really go up."
"They are going to get all the money they can out of us," he said.
Thomas Crosby, a spokesman for AAA Carolinas, said the gas price increases were distressing "because the prices are rising at a faster pace than increases in crude oil prices." Oil companies are raising prices on the street well before the prices in crude actually take effect in world markets, he said.
"It's a very typical practice," Mr. Crosby said. "It's a burden on all of us. Iraq gives them a reasonable explanation to offer consumers."
James Dozier, 36, a manager at a janitorial supply warehouse in Charlotte, decided to put just $7 of gasoline in his 1996 Dodge Caravan the other day because of the prices. Mr. Dozier said he also decided not to go out that night to save on fuel costs.
"I'll just stay home and watch television," he said. "It used to be you could put $10 in and go all weekend."

HEADLINE: Remedy for Slavery: Give Reparations? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Dalton Conley speaks eloquently of the need for Americans to recognize slavery's contribution to the early growth of the United States economy ("The Cost of Slavery," Op-Ed, Feb. 15). 
 But would the money for reparations come, for example, from corporations that profited from slavery or new corporate taxes?
Both options would lower corporate profitability, which in turn would mean fewer jobs for Americans of all races.
Second, the inflationary effect associated with a large influx of wealth can and would diminish the real value of the reparations.
In short, unless these problems can be avoided, alternative remedies for the wrongs of slavery should be considered.

HEADLINE: Remedy for Slavery: Give Reparations? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "The Cost of Slavery," by Dalton Conley (Op-Ed, Feb. 15):
 Slavery does not explain the current income and wealth deficits experienced by African-Americans. 
 Antebellum slaves experienced a material standard of living and skill development that was comparable to the Southern white yeomanry and English working classes. 
These deficits are due to the Jim Crow period, when African-Americans were legally excluded from employment and educational opportunities. 
It would be quite fitting to give reparations to living African-Americans who directly experienced the economic deprivations caused by Jim Crow. Jim Crow reparations would also help educate a younger generation of white Americans who know little of the legally enforced horrors that African-Americans so recently experienced.

HEADLINE: Despite the Danger Warnings, Ephedra Sells 

BYLINE:  By GINA KOLATA and WALT BOGDANICH

 BODY:
Investigators say it may never be known whether the dietary supplement ephedra contributed to the death of Steve Bechler, the 23-year-old Baltimore Orioles pitcher who died of heatstroke on Monday after collapsing during a workout in the Florida sun. 
 But what is clear, experts said yesterday, is that ephedra can be dangerous. They said no other dietary supplement on the market had stirred as many warnings and frightening medical histories as ephedra. It has been linked to deaths, to strokes, to heart arrythmias and even to psychotic episodes. 
 "There certainly are a lot of reasons for concern," said Dr. Mark B. McClellan, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, which has received more than 1,400 reports of adverse effects from ephedra. "There are a lot of adverse events associated with ephedra and ephedra products, and they do have effects on metabolic rates and heart rates." 
Yesterday, Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of Health and Human Services, asked by reporters to comment on ephedra in light of Bechler's death, replied, "I wouldn't use it, would you?"
But despite such warnings, ephedra is widely available -- in health food stores and drugstores and on the Internet -- and more than $3 billion worth of ephedra products are sold in the United States each year, according to Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who held hearings last October on the use of ephedra in diet supplements.
Ephedra, like other herbal supplements, can be legally sold over the counter under a 1994 law that allows their sale unless they are shown to be unsafe. In contrast, drug makers must prove to the F.D.A. that their drugs have benefits that exceed any risks before they can market them.
Dr. McClellan, of the food and drug agency, said it was "assessing what the proper way to handle ephedra is." It has commissioned a report by the Rand Corporation, to be delivered by spring, he said. 
Then, Dr. McClellan added, "you should see some prompt further action from us." If the agency identifies serious risks with the product, he said, it could insist on warning labels or even remove the supplement from the market.
Wes Siegner, a lawyer for the Ephedra Education Council, an industry group, said clinical trials had demonstrated that the substance was safe when used as directed. "You can't use these individual cases to raise more than a question," he added.
Ephedra, a stimulant derived from the Asian drug ma huang, contains a mixture of chemicals, several of which increase blood pressure and heart rate. The most powerful of these chemicals is ephedrine (also used in prescription and nonprescription drugs as a decongestant), which, like an amphetamine, stimulates the central nervous system.
On vitamin-store and drugstore shelves, ephedra is generally sold in small bottles of pills or capsules, often combined with caffeine and other substances. The bottles bear a dizzying array of labels, with names like Xenadrine RFA-1 (the pills that Bechler had been taking), Xtreme Lean and MetaboLoss. The active ingredients, like ephedrine, are typically listed in fine print on the labels in milligrams.

Uses and Side Effects
Dr. Rudoph Leibel, an obesity researcher at Columbia University, said the doses sold in supplements often provide the equivalent of 75 to 90 milligrams a day of ephedrine.
Doctors have prescribed it for weight loss, he said, but patients usually receive about 25 milligrams a day. To make matters worse, Dr. Leibel added, consumers often take even more than the supplement makers recommend. "You can get into a lot of trouble," he said.
The product Bechler took, Xenadrine RFA-1, made by Cytodyne Technologies of Lakewood, N.J., comes in capsules, each containing the equivalent of 20 milligrams of ephedrine. Consumers are advised to take four pills a day and are promised that they are getting a "revolutionary" fat burner that is "clinically proven to dramatically increase the rate of fat loss significantly more than diet and exercise alone." 
Ephedra has been widely used by athletes and is banned in several sports, though not by organized baseball. In the last decade, athletes who tested positive for ephedrine or ephedra have been suspended, penalized or stripped of medals and honors in sports including track and field, swimming, gymnastics, soccer and professional football.
"I've taken it in the past," Nick Johnson, a Yankees first baseman, said. But he added that the news of Bechler's death was "scary -- it's very scary."
"It would be a pretty good idea to stay away from it," he said. "I want to be around for a while."
Sterling Hitchcock, a Yankees pitcher, said: "I've used it. You just have to be smart with it. I've used less than the dosage." 
And catcher Mike Lieberthal of the Philadelphia Phillies told The Associated Press: "I used it for energy purposes during workouts. I stopped taking it two years ago when told the supplement could cause severe medical problems."
Ephedra can promote heatstroke in three ways, according to Neal L. Benowitz of the University of California at San Francisco. It speeds metabolism and thus creates extra heat. It constricts blood vessels in the skin, preventing the body from cooling itself efficiently. And by making the user feel more energetic and less fatigued, it keeps him exercising longer.
These effects can be especially harmful in people who are dehydrated, out of shape or overweight, Dr. Benowitz said. Bechler was 6 feet 2 inches and weighed 249 pounds, 10 pounds over his weight at the end of last season.
Dr. Harrison Pope Jr., who is chief of the biological psychiatry laboratory at McLean Hospital at Harvard, said ephedra is effective for weight loss. Virtually every female body builder he has interviewed takes ephedra, he said, and so do many male body builders.
"The reason people take it is that it has a pronounced stimulatory effect," Dr. Pope said. "The more you take, the more effect you get and the more potential fat loss you get. It is a very potent drug, it creates a mild euphoria in many and it increases appetite and increases the rate that you burn calories.
"It is common for people to take a small amount, decide it is innocuous, and then gradually escalate their dose and get into a range with significant side effects."

Researchers' Red Flags
A variety of research studies have called attention to ephedra's dangers. The most recent is to be published next month in The Annals of Internal Medicine and is available now on the journal's Web site (www.acponline.org). In it, Dr. Stephen Bent of the University of California at San Francisco and his colleagues report that ephedra is the most dangerous herbal product on the market. 
The researchers, who have consulted for lawyers suing ephedra makers on behalf of injured consumers, say that 64 percent of all reports of adverse reactions to herbal supplements in the United States involve ephedra. Yet products containing ephedra represent only 0.8 percent of all herbal products sold.
"The sale of ephedra as a dietary supplement should be restricted or banned to prevent serious adverse reactions in the general public," they write.
In recent years, ephedra has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress. Senator Durbin's hearing in October focused in part on two products called Yellow Jacket and Black Beauty, both made by NVE Pharmaceuticals of Newton, N.J. Anne Marie Murphy, an aide to Mr. Durbin, noted that Yellow Jacket is the "street name for barbiturates, and Black Beauty is the street name of amphetamines."
A constituent of the senator's, a high school wrestler, died after taking Yellow Jacket, Ms. Murphy said. She added that under Congressional pressure, the company recently stopped making the two products but that it continues to market Stacker2, which contains caffeine and ephedra.
Robert Occhifinto, president of NVE Pharmaceuticals, was convicted of money laundering in the early 1990's in a scheme to supply chemicals used in the manufacture of the illegal stimulant methamphetamine, according to the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. He did not return phone calls left at the company's headquarters seeking comment.
Last month Senator Durbin wrote to Secretary Thompson of the Health and Human Services Department, asking him to ban all ephedra products.
Another leading manufacturer of supplements containing ephedra is Metabolife International of San Diego. Its founder, Michael Ellis, is under investigation by the Justice Department after telling federal regulators that his company had received no "adverse incident" reports involving products with ephedra. Mr. Ellis is no longer with the company.
Ms. Murphy said Congressional investigators had recently found that 2,000 "serious adverse events" had been reported to Metabolife. And last year, an Alabama jury awarded $4.1 million to four people who suffered strokes or heart attacks after taking an ephedra-based appetite suppressant made by the company. Metabolife officials did not return calls seeking comment.
On Long Island, the Suffolk County Legislature recently passed a bill banning ephedra, the only government unit to do so. Legislator Jon Cooper, Democrat from Huntington, who led the campaign to ban ephedra, said he had to overcome a "massive lobbying campaign" mounted by companies in the county that make supplements with ephedra.
He said he expected the bill to be signed into law or vetoed within three weeks, and added that he had enough support to override any veto.
At a Vitamin Shoppe in Greenwich Village in Manhattan yesterday, the shelves of the weight management section were filled with bottles containing ephedra. There were no signs warning about any side effects on the shelves.
When asked if the supplement had any side effects, a store employee said ephedra was dangerous only for people with diabetes. Another clerk said he had heard of people taking it before going to clubs, like Ecstasy. "But a baseball player just died taking it!" a woman in line said. "They just said it on the news." 
At Duane Reade on 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, a pharmacist, Rajesh B. Kumbhani, said he was uncomfortable knowing that ephedra was readily available, given the health risks. 
"I don't tell anybody that they should take ephedrine," Mr. Kumbhani said, gesturing at the ephedra next to other weight-loss products. "This is all advertising and marketing. They should take it out."

U.S. Deadline for Turkey In Day or Two at Most
The Bush administration's impatience with Turkey boiled over, with officials saying the country had a day or two at most to accept an offer of $26 billion in aid for allowing American troops to use its territory. A1

Refusal by Turkey to allow American forces to use its territory as a launching pad for a northern thrust into Iraq "would not be a show-stopper," but would greatly complicate an already complex war plan, senior Pentagon and military officials said. A13

9/11 Suspect Is Convicted
Nearly a year and a half after the Sept. 11 attacks, a court in Hamburg, Germany, delivered the first conviction in the case.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
United Nations Delays Action on North Korea

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council postponed action today on the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program and on whether economic sanctions should be imposed.
 Before a brief Council meeting on North Korea's refusal to comply with its nonproliferation obligations, one diplomat said the Council would allow time for further diplomacy. 
 At issue was a vote by the governing board of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, to refer the crisis to the Security Council. The Council has the power to punish nations for violating United Nations rules aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.
Ambassador Gunter Pleuger of Germany said Council members had referred the matter to their experts for further study "as it is an important and very complicated issue."
Diplomats said after the meeting that no one wanted to anger North Korea, which has said that it would treat economic sanctions as "a declaration of war" by the Security Council.
"No one is looking at sanctions at this point," said another Council diplomat. 
Ambassador Wang Yingfan of China said he hoped that the United States and North Korea would sit down at the negotiating table.
"It's difficult when the two main parties involved are not talking to each other," Mr. Wang said. "Maybe at a later stage, we will see what could be done by the Security Council."

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Cites Progress In Trade Ties With China 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
The top United States trade official gave a generally favorable assessment of China's first year in the World Trade Organization today, saying that progress had been made on many issues even as China's annual trade surplus with the United States approaches $100 billion.
 After three days of meetings in Beijing, Chongqing and Shanghai, Robert Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said at a news conference that China had been lowering tariffs, making its regulations more understandable and transparent and granting more licenses to foreign insurers and other financial services companies. 
 American and Chinese officials still have differences over some agricultural products and the protection of intellectual property, but have been able to address some of those issues as well, Mr. Zoellick said. 
"There has been good progress, there's more work to do, and I also leave with a sense of tremendous opportunity," he said.
China entered the World Trade Organization on Nov. 10, 2001, promising to dismantle its extensive protectionist tariffs and other barriers to imports in exchange for guaranteed access to foreign markets. Despite some predictions that this might provoke a flood of imports to China, its trade surplus with many countries widened further, with exports climbing 23 percent and its imports 21 percent. That drew some criticism from trade officials in Japan and labor unions in the United States.
Led by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Washington officials have become increasingly critical of China in the last week for not doing more to support American positions on Iraq and North Korea at a time when the Chinese economy has benefited enormously from exports to the United States. But Mr. Zoellick said today that he had confined his discussions strictly to economic issues and had not raised security concerns, although he added, "China understands the importance of a sound economic relationship with the United States."
Mr. Powell will be traveling to Beijing for talks, Mr. Zoellick said, without saying when. The possibility of such a trip has been widely rumored, but no date has been announced.
Despite the United States' widening trade deficit, American businesses have voiced limited criticisms of Chinese trade policies, saying that they are improving and are providing more access for American companies to sell to Chinese citizens and businesses.
"The overall mood is one of 'better than we expected, so far so good,' " said James Thompson, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, adding that city and provincial governments had cooperated to an unexpected extent with the central government's push for more free trade. "We actually set up a subcommittee on W.T.O. issues and it has been fairly inactive because the issues haven't come up."
Mr. Zoellick echoed that position today. The biggest exceptions have been in agriculture, as China has been slow to lower tariffs on a few crops and has put many restrictions on imports of American genetically modified soybeans, despite growing some genetically modified crops of its own. Mr. Zoellick said that negotiations were continuing in those areas.
Zhang Xiaoping, assistant director of the Beijing office of the American Soybean Association, said that while China had been limiting imports of genetically modified soybeans on the ground that safety tests were needed, American farmers were suspicious that China was really trying to restrict imports for commercial reasons. "We think it is kind of a licensing system, which is illegal under W.T.O."
After running a hefty trade surplus of $30 billion with the rest of the world last year, China ran a trade deficit of $1.2 billion in January, its first monthly deficit since 1996 and a figure that initially prompted some alarm among investors last week.
But as economists have taken a closer look at the figures, most of them have been dismissing the deficit as a seasonal aberration rather than a bellwether of a long-term trend. The value in dollars of China's oil imports increased somewhat in January, partly because of higher prices and partly because China stepped up imports as it began a modest stockpiling effort as a precaution against the possibility of war in Iraq.
Much more important, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs, was a surge in imports as factories brought in extra components for final assembly just before the Chinese New Year holiday at the beginning of February. China's balance of trade in goods and services is likely to return to a surplus in February and March, said Jonathan Anderson, a Goldman Sachs economist.

HEADLINE: 2 Introduce Legislation That Is Close to Homes 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Raul M. Grijalva came to the Capitol to lobby Congress for a bill that went nowhere. It was a measure to grant citizenship to every member of the Tohono O'odham Nation, an Indian tribe whose land straddles the United States-Mexico border in the hardscrabble desert south of Mr. Grijalva's native Tucson.
 The O'odham, as they call themselves, have been traveling back and forth across the international boundary since long before it formally existed to visit family and conduct sacred religious rites. When changes in immigration law made that difficult, Mr. Grijalva, then a county official, accompanied the O'odham elders to Washington in their unsuccessful bid to make tribal membership tantamount to citizenship. 
 Now Mr. Grijalva is Representative Grijalva, the newly elected Democratic congressman from the Seventh District in Arizona. He no longer needs a member of Congress to introduce the proposed Tohono O'odham Citizenship Act. He can do it himself -- and last week, he did.
The bill is Mr. Grijalva's first and, like nearly all first bills, it demonstrates the adage, made famous by Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the former speaker of the House: "All politics is local."
Mr. O'Neill's rule also held true for Representative Candice S. Miller, a freshman Republican from Michigan who recently introduced legislation to award the Coast Guard cutter Bramble, soon to be decommissioned, to a group in her district. The group wants to convert the ship into a maritime museum.
"Now, that is not a big global issue for a first bill," Mrs. Miller said recently, on a day when Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was at the United Nations to lay out his case for war against Iraq. "But it's important to my district."
For Mr. Grijalva and Mrs. Miller, who have agreed to allow The New York Times to chronicle their freshman year in Congress, the six weeks since their swearing in has been a time of firsts. But the first bill carries special import and provides insight into who they are, not only as politicians but as ordinary Americans whose approach to legislation reflects their own personal histories and experiences.
Mr. Grijalva, who turned 55 today and whose father came to the United States from Mexico to work as a ranch hand, says he sees "strong symbolism" in the citizenship legislation. An unrepentant liberal Democrat in a conservative Republican town, Mr. Grijalva began in politics by fighting de facto segregation in the Tucson schools. The O'odham tribe members are precisely the kind of people who make up Mr. Grijalva's liberal base.
"We're correcting an injustice," the congressman said last week, before affixing his signature to the legislation with a flourish as two O'odham women, who had come to lobby him for money for the tribe's new community college, looked on. Mr. Grijalva's then walked to the House chamber to formally introduce the legislation, an act that is accomplished by simply dropping the bill into a box known as "the hopper" on the House clerk's desk.
Mrs. Miller, 48, the former Michigan secretary of state, often calls herself "a water person." She worked in her family's marina business, selling boats, before entering politics. An avid sailor, she competes every year in the Port Huron to Mackinac Yacht Race in her district. For years, she said, the Bramble has followed the fleet during that race. 
"For me," she said, "it's an important piece of legislation, because of my own personal feelings for this boat."
It is also important to a prominent development concern in Mrs. Miller's district, Acheson Ventures L.L.C, which is trying to redevelop the Port Huron waterfront and is looking to the maritime museum to bring in tourists. The company's spokesman, Paul Maxwell, said he has contributed to Mrs. Miller's campaigns over the years and began talking to her about the Bramble even before she was elected.
"It just goes hand in hand with what we are trying to do," Mr. Maxwell said.
As they settle into office, Mrs. Miller and Mr. Grijalva are still adjusting to the rhythms of life in the Capitol. Mrs. Miller finds herself so busy she rarely has time to eat.
"I'm subsisting on water and popcorn," she says. This month, she attended her first full hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, on which she serves. Her legislative director, Ashley Basquin, showed her how to get there.
"Republicans on this side," Ms. Basquin said, showing her new boss the correct door. Once inside, Mrs. Miller discovered what old Washington hands already know: the freshmen get the worst seats.
Mr. Grijalva, who in December came to the Capitol for his freshman orientation lacking a necktie -- and as a result was turned away from his official portrait -- now has a closet full. He keeps them hanging in his office, pre-knotted by an aide who has mastered the intricacies of the Windsor knot, which Mr. Grijalva has not. He wears them whenever the House is in session.
He has become "addicted to C-Span," and has been doing a lot of reading on the economy and education issues, given that he now serves on the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. 
Last week, just before he signed the Tohono O'odham measure, Mr. Grijalva attended a committee hearing at which Elaine L. Chao, the labor secretary, testified about a Bush administration proposal to set up personal accounts to assist the unemployed with job retraining. 
"I don't think it's enough money," Mr. Grijalva said. But he did not speak up. By the time the freshmen had their turn to ask questions, he said, all of his had already been asked.
As for their own bills, the prospects at this early stage are unclear. Mrs. Miller has lined up her Republican colleagues from Michigan as "original co-sponsors," Washington argot for lawmakers who sign on to a bill before it is introduced. 
Mr. Grijalva's bill has 53 original co-sponsors, including Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader. Even more important, the bill has the support of Representative Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Republican who is typically a staunch opponent of extending immigration rights.
Still, both bills may face competition, or just plain inertia. The citizenship bill died in the last Congress without ever getting a hearing. It had been introduced by Representative Ed Pastor of Arizona, whose district then included the tribal land. Mr. Grijalva said lawmakers were simply too consumed with the terrorist attacks to pay attention. 
And Mrs. Miller has heard that a Jewish group in California is also seeking the Bramble, because it is similar to the vessels that ferried Holocaust survivors from Europe to Israel after World War II.
"They need to have a boat also," the congresswoman said, in a game attempt at diplomacy. "But the Bramble has been in Port Huron for all these years. It is really our boat."
Articles in this series will periodically observe two Congressional newcomers as they take on their new roles.

HEADLINE: Gephardt, in Formally Taking Aim at the White House, Sharply Attacks Bush 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt began his second campaign for president in 16 years today with a fierce attack on PresidentBush's economic and domestic polices and a pledge to push for health care coverage for all Americans.
 Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat who stepped down as House minority leader after Democrats failed to win control of Congress in November, used his announcement speech in St. Louis this morning to offer some of the harshest criticism of Mr. Bush voiced so far by any Democratic presidential candidate. 
 He portrayed the White House as overridden with "special interest lobbyists," and said that Mr. Bush's policies had undermined the nation's economic recovery, soiled the environment and neglected public schools. Attacking the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's economic plan, Mr. Gephardt vowed to "scrap the vast majority of the Bush tax cuts for wealthier Americans and corporations."
"President Bush has taken us right back to the broken policies of the past, the economics of debt and regret -- unaffordable tax cuts for the few, zero new jobs, surging unemployment," Mr. Gephardt told 400 supporters this morning at the elementary school he attended.
"I've got to hand it to him: Never has so much been done in so little time to help so few," Mr. Gephardt said. "President Bush campaigned as a centrist, a coalition-builder and a compassionate conservative. But on issues after issue, the only thing he's conserved is compassion itself."
Mr. Gephardt devoted barely 2 of the speech's 43 minutes to foreign policy, and that included an affirmation of support for Mr. Bush's effort to disarm Saddam Hussein -- including military action if necessary.
His overriding and relatively detailed focus on domestic issues, coming as the nation seems to be on the verge of war, contrasted sharply with many of his major rivals. The focus appeared intended to reinforce his credentials with Democratic activists and labor unions who could prove crucial in the early presidential nominating caucuses.
"Every proposal I'm making, every idea I'm advancing, has a single central purpose: to revive a failing economy and give working Americans the help and security they need to make the most of it on their own," he said. 
He said his health care plan, under which companies would be given tax credits to cover most of the cost of paying the health care premiums for their employees, would be the central theme of his campaign.
Mr. Gephardt, who is 62 and was first elected to the House in 1976, became the second Democrat to declare his candidacy formally, after Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut.
As many as 10 others have said they may run as well, creating an extraordinarily crowded field, and putting pressure on all the contenders -- even those as established as Mr. Gephardt -- to compete for votes and attention alike.
His announcement today was in many ways an echo of the first time he ran for president, in 1987. Once again, he came to the town where he grew up -- rather than Washington, the city with which he has been identified for 27 years -- to make his address. As in 1987, he traveled directly from St. Louis to Iowa, signaling that he again considers a strong showing in that neighboring state's early caucus to be an important element of his nomination strategy.
In a sign of the extent to which he is turning to labor for help, Mr. Gephardt noted this afternoon that his very first speech as an official candidate in Iowa was delivered to a union, the Iowa Building and Construction Trades Council. And Mr. Gephardt not only called today for an increase in the minimum wage in this country, but also for the creation of an international minimum wage, which would vary by country.
Still, that Iowa strategy proved less than successful last time. Mr. Gephardt won the caucuses in 1988, but went on to win only one other state -- Michigan -- before dropping out of the race. Mr. Gephardt tonight attributed his previous collapse to a lack of money that he said hindered his ability to compete effectively in the quick run of primaries after Iowa.
Even after flying halfway across the country to make his speech, Mr. Gephardt did not try to present himself, like George Bush in 2000 or Bill Clinton in 1992, as an outsider running against the system. 
Instead, Mr. Gephardt sought to turn what many Democrats view as one of his chief obstacles -- that he is a too-familiar face of the Washington Democratic establishment -- into an argument why voters should vote for him during difficult times.
"I'm not going to say what's fashionable in our politics -- that I'm a Washington outsider, that I couldn't find the nation's capital on a map, that I have no experience at the highest levels of government," he said. "I do. And I think experience matters."
Mr. Gephardt has said that regardless of how he does this time, he will not run for the House again.
On paper, at least, Mr. Gephardt would appear to be in a stronger position this time. As a former minority leader, he enjoys what his advisers argue is broad support among Democratic activists and unions, and has a base of contributors. He is also better known than most of his rivals.
Still, he enters the race with some clear disadvantages. As one of two Democratic leaders in Congress, he was closely identified with the party's setbacks last year, a perception that was reinforced when he stepped down from the minority leader post. Even some of Mr. Gephardt's admirers said that Democratic primary voters, given a choice of so many new faces, might not turn to someone who has been a fixture of Democratic politics.
And while Mr. Gephardt is widely admired on Capitol Hill as an affable and effective manager of the House Democratic caucus, it is an open question whether the skills that have served him as a Congressional leader would help a presidential candidate.
History would seem to argue against it; only one sitting House member, James A. Garfield, has ever been elected to the White House, in 1880.
Although Mr. Gephardt went to great efforts today to come across as an animated and engaging speaker -- speaking slowly and forcefully, and punctuating each sentence with a sweep of his hands -- he acknowledged that he was not one of the most colorful candidates.
"Experience matters -- it's what our nation needs right now, not the political flavor of the month," he said. "I'm not the flashiest candidate around, but the fight for working families is in my bones."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 21, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the announcement by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri that he would seek the Democratic nomination for president in 2004 misstated the number of state primaries and caucuses he won in 1988. It was three -- Iowa, South Dakota and Missouri -- not two. The article also misstated his finish in the Michigan caucuses that year. It was third; first place was won by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and Mr. Gephardt's showing of 12.8 percent prompted him to drop out shortly afterward.

HEADLINE: All Governors To Be Asked To Back Bush On Medicaid 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said today that he wanted the nation's governors to endorse President Bush's proposal for sweeping changes in Medicaid when they meet here next week.
 But state officials said they had many questions about the proposal, and some expressed reservations. 
 In announcing the proposal on Jan. 31, the administration said it would give states vast new power to expand, reduce or eliminate benefits for millions of low-income people, including many who are elderly or disabled.
States have long sought more control over the program, to tailor benefits to the needs of individual recipients and to control costs, which shot up 13 percent last year and have increased an average of 9 percent a year since 1997. 
In return for such flexibility, states would receive a fixed amount of federal Medicaid money, set by a statutory formula, in each of the next 10 years. The amount would grow each year, but the growth would be constrained by the formula. By contrast, the federal commitment to Medicaid is now open-ended; the federal government puts up more money for every additional dollar spent by a state.
Mr. Thompson, who was governor of Wisconsin for 14 years, said he believed that the National Governors Association would support the Bush proposal after he explained it to the group. 
"It's a great deal for states," Mr. Thompson said. "It's an opportunity for them to structure an innovative Medicaid program that will actually cover more people."
David Parrella of Connecticut, chairman of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, said the Bush administration sought support today in a two-hour conference call with state Medicaid officials.
States have an immense stake in Medicaid because they provide 43 percent of the money. The federal government provides the rest.
At a Congressional hearing last week, Mr. Thompson was deluged with questions about the Medicaid proposal. The National Governors Association recently sent Mr. Thompson a list of 60 questions, but has not received any answers.
Gregory A. Vadner, the Medicaid director in Missouri, said: "From the states' point of view, flexibility is great, but when you stop to think about it, I don't see any new money in this. I welcome a dialogue with the federal government, but I am concerned that we may end up with a short-term good deal that causes huge problems in later years."
Mr. Thompson insisted today that the administration was not proposing a block grant, defined as a lump sum of federal money given to states for a broad purpose. The money, he said, would increase with medical costs and other factors specified in the formula.
But Mr. Vadner, who is also vice chairman of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors, said: "It looks like a block grant to me. Every block grant I've seen can go up or down depending on future appropriations from Congress."
Medicaid provides health insurance to 45 million people. The administration proposal would allow states to change eligibility rules and benefits for two-thirds of the beneficiaries whose coverage is optional under current law.
Charles C. Duarte, the Medicaid director in Nevada, said he was concerned about whether federal payments would be adequate to cover the costs of poor children and others whom states are required to cover.
"Medicaid reform is important," Mr. Duarte said, "but we need to have some protection against very rapid growth in Medicaid expenditures for the mandatory coverage group."
Nevada has been the nation's fastest-growing state in each of the last 15 years, and the economic downturn has increased the demand for medical assistance there, as elsewhere. 
The number of Medicaid recipients in Nevada grew to 142,000 in mid-2002 from 110,000 in mid-2001 and is expected to reach 166,000 in June, for an increase of 50 percent in two years, Mr. Duarte said.
Under the administration proposal, Mr. Thompson said, states participating in Medicaid would still have to provide coverage to the mandatory population groups. States would finance care for both mandatory and optional recipients with their annual allotments of federal money.

HEADLINE: Dollar Diplomacy 

 BODY:
After taking a hard look at the poker game being played by President Bush and Saddam Hussein, Turkey, in effect, told Mr. Bush this week to ante up $32 billion if he wants Ankara to take a seat at the table. That's serious money and the demand, which Washington is pondering, says a great deal about the tradeoffs taking place beneath all the lofty arguments about going to war with Iraq. The business of lining up reluctant governments to provide bases and support for possible military action is not exactly an exercise in Wilsonian idealism. 
 Should the confrontation with Iraq come to war, American military operations would be greatly aided by an invading force from Turkey. But that doesn't make the bargaining anyprettier. It undercuts Washington's repeated assertions that the showdown with Iraq is about the defense of great principles and the advancement of democracy in the Middle East. With no agreement reached yesterday, Ankara has put off parliamentary action and Washington is threatening to divert troops and supplies headed for Turkey to the Persian Gulf. 
 Turkey's role is important, and not just because it shares a border with Iraq. Turkey is also a model of the kind of secular Muslim democracy Washington says it favors for Iraq and the wider Middle East. In the administration's efforts to line up Turkish support, it risks trampling on the very values America claims to be fighting for.
Turkey's elected leaders know that most Turks strongly oppose war with Iraq. They also know that they need Washington's help to revive their economy, press for European Union membership and stave off challenges from Turkey's coup-prone generals. They hope that a big enough economic package could make support for the war more palatable at home. The 1991 Persian Gulf war cost Turkey billions of dollars in lost trade, shut down a lucrative oil pipeline and left Ankara temporarily sheltering a million Iraqi Kurdish refugees. 
Washington's bargaining with Ankara also has a Kurdish dimension, and it's a rather cynical one. Turkish leaders fear that war in Iraq could fuel demands for an independent Kurdish state, among Turkish as well as Iraqi Kurds. Iraq's Kurds now enjoy de facto autonomy, while Turkey's much larger Kurdish population still faces harsh restrictions. The Bush administration is unwisely considering a plan to allow thousands of Turkish soldiers to move into areas of Kurdish-ruled northern Iraq behind advancing American troops. Washington has a long and shameful history of encouraging Iraqi Kurds to fight Baghdad and then abandoning them to their foes. Doing so again would be a poor start on constructing a more just and democratic Iraq.
Turkey is entitled to seek economic compensation. But pledging $32 billion to a single country could make this the most expensive alliance ever bought. Turkey would want financial guarantees even in a war against Iraq endorsed by the United Nations Security Council. Without such endorsement, and the change in Turkish public opinion it would likely bring, the price of Ankara's participation could prove exorbitant.

HEADLINE: Federal Debt Near Ceiling; Second Time In 9 Months 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
With budget deficits climbing rapidly, the Bush administration acknowledged today that the government had reached its legal limit on borrowing and would run short of cash by early April unless Congress once again raised the debt ceiling.
 Because Congress inevitably does raise the ceiling after intense jousting, the announcement will have little, if any, effect on operations. But it highlights the new era of red ink that the government faces even before President Bush's latest proposals for more than $1 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years. 
 Two years ago, administration forecasters predicted large budget surpluses. But the economic slowdown and the faltering stock market sent tax revenues plunging, even as government spending continued to increase. 
The White House now projects a deficit of more than $300 billion this year and next, as well as deficits for at least the next decade.
Democratic lawmakers have begun to attack the administration over raising the borrowing limits. The Blue Dog Budget Watchdog Group, 34 Democrats who emphasize reducing deficits, has created the phrase "debt tax" to discuss the additional interest that will have to paid on the growing debt.
Hoping to minimize the embarrassment associated with raising the ceiling, House Republicans reinstituted a rule last month that lets them include such increases in an overall budget resolution. That procedure, which the Democrats used when they controlled the House, lets the party sidestep a separate recorded vote.
"They're trying to raise the debt ceiling in the cloak of night rather than in the sunshine of the morning," said Tom Kahn, staff director for Democrats on the House Budget Committee.
The Senate does not have a comparable rule, which means that Senate Democrats may be able prolong a fight on the debt ceiling.
Congress raised the limit nine months ago by $450 billion, to $6.4 trillion. That was less than the $750 billion increase that Mr. Bush had requested, at least partly reflecting the determination of Democratic lawmakers to make the administration endure a repeat battle as soon as possible and to continue to highlight the return to deficits.
Such jockeying has prompted some experts to propose scrapping the ceiling entirely. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a House hearing last week that having an official ceiling did nothing to force deficit reduction.
To make ends meet for the next month or so, the Treasury Department said it would postpone making mandatory contributions to two big investment funds for government employees.
Such shuffling tactics can allow the government to keep borrowing money without technically breaching the overall ceiling. But the Treasury Department said the tactics might not be enough to carry the government to the point when new cash starts pouring in from tax returns due on April 15.
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow pleaded in a statement today for "prompt action" by Congress. 
"I know that you share the president's and my commitment to maintaining the full faith and credit of the U.S. government," Mr. Snow said in a letter to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois.

HEADLINE: A Strange Budget Cut 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Say it ain't so, Mr. President.
 You might think that with the country gearing up for war this would be the wrong time -- absolutely the worst time -- to cut federal school aid for the children of men and women in the armed forces. 
 Nobody would do that, right? Right?
Alas. 
Undeterred by the anxiety and hardships faced by youngsters whose parents may be heading overseas, and perhaps into combat, President Bush has proposed substantial cuts in the government's Impact Aid program, which provides badly needed funds to school districts that have a significant number of students from military families.
The program was established during the Truman administration. When a school district is in an area that has military installations or other types of federal property, it is cut off from a range of revenue sources -- residential, business and industrial property taxes, for example -- that would have been available if the land and facilities were privately owned and developed. The districts are still obligated, however, to provide schooling for children whose parents are stationed or work at such facilities.
The idea of Impact Aid is to at least partially offset this revenue shortfall. In school districts that serve a large number of military families, Impact Aid is a crucial component of the annual budget.
Case in point: The Virginia Beach public schools. The school system has students whose parents are assigned to Fort Story, the Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base, the Oceana Naval Air Station and other military installations. It receives about $12 million in Impact Aid. President Bush's budget proposal would cut that by more than half -- an estimated $7.5 million, according to the district's superintendent, Dr. Timothy Jenney.
"That would be fairly devastating for us," Dr. Jenney said in an interview. "We're very lean with our operating funds, the lowest per pupil in the area, and certainly well below the state average. So we're not flush with money to begin with. And with the economy right now, people are not predisposed to increasing their taxes."
Under Mr. Bush's budget proposal, Impact Aid would continue for youngsters whose parents live on a military base, but not for those whose families live off base. This is a specious distinction that does not take into account the overall deficit in tax revenues and the special needs of military youngsters.
The Virginia Beach school system has more than 26,000 children from military families, the vast majority of them off base. And like military youngsters everywhere, they are living through a traumatic period.
"There's a fair amount of anxiety among our children," said Dr. Jenney, "especially at the elementary level, from the kids whose parents are now deployed, or those who hear that their mom or dad has been called up and the deployment is imminent. So we've had to ratchet up all of our comprehensive services -- psychological and guidance services -- to work with our parents and the community. It's been a burden."
Just last week a gung-ho President Bush stood before thousands of sailors at a naval station near Jacksonville, Fla., and declared, "In this challenging period, great tasks lie ahead for the Navy and for our entire military."
If that's so, how do you then turn around and tell your military personnel: oh, by the way, we're going to cut the financial support we've been providing for your kids in school?
Virginia Beach is just one of many districts across the country that will be hit hard if the president's proposed cuts actually take effect. They would have to make up tens of millions of dollars in lost federal aid.
Presidents eager for budget savings have frequently proposed cuts in Impact Aid. Congress has almost always resisted. What makes Mr. Bush's proposal so potentially devastating is that it comes when he is marshaling the nation for war, when the federal government is running up record budget deficits, when most states are struggling with huge budget deficits of their own, when school districts across the country are already suffering financially, and when both houses of Congress are controlled by the president's party.
Who could imagine that in a wartime atmosphere we would consider leaving the children of the military behind?

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: WHITE HOUSE; 
U.S. IS PESSIMISTIC TURKS WILL ACCEPT AID DEAL ON IRAQ

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER with DEXTER FILKINS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 

 BODY:
White House officials sounded pessimistic today that their offer of $26 billion in aid to Turkey would be enough to win the country's approval for the United States to open a northern front against Iraq if war comes. 
 Their growing frustration with Turkey came as President Bush was dealing with a variety of recalcitrant allies at the United Nations and in capitals around the world, allies that are urging considerably more time for weapons inspections or a strategy of containment for Iraq. Even Italy, a stalwart ally, today urged that Mr. Bush not take military action unless he had explicit approval from the Security Council. It is far from clear that Mr. Bush can win that approval, and today he spent half an hour on the telephone with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain developing a strategy for introducing a brief resolution that might, in some form, set a deadline for Iraqi compliance. 
 But the immediate concern was Turkey, and Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld was talking publicly about how the Pentagon was already considering alternative deployments. 
The leader of Turkey's governing party, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said tonight that the offer the White House described as "final" was not yet good enough, and that Parliament would not vote this week on whether to allow the deployment of upwards of 40,000 American troops along the Iraqi border.
Mr. Bush made no public comment about the standoff today when he met Lord Robertson, the NATO secretary general, in the Oval Office. But both men offered pointed reminders that surveillance planes and chemical and biological protective gear were already arriving in Turkey in response to the country's call for help to prevent a retaliatory attack from Iraq in any conflict. 
In private, though, administration officials were fuming, with one senior official calling the Turkish efforts to hold out for more aid -- and perhaps access to oil from the Kirkuk region of Iraq -- as "extortion in the name of alliance." Another said that despite a stream of aid from the United States, "the Turks seem to think that we'll keep the bazaar open all night."
"There comes a moment when plans must be made, decisions must be made," the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said today, adding that negotiation "cannot stretch on indefinitely."
But Turkish leaders say that their country, where popular opinion is strongly opposed to a war, sustained huge economic losses in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and that they are are determined to make sure that such things do not happen again. 
Lord Robertson's visit here was intended to show that Mr. Bush intends to continue working closely with NATO, despite the fractious battle that took place within the alliance over the last week about whether to send military aid to Turkey. France and Germany tried to block the defensive aid, arguing that to help Turkey was to pave the way to war. 
In a double-edged reference to NATO's problems and Mr. Bush's own, Lord Robertson gestured to a statue of Churchill that Mr. Bush keeps within sight of his desk and noted that the World War II leader of Britain "once famously said of the United States of America, the United States can always be counted on to do the right thing, after it's exhausted every other alternative." 
As Mr. Bush laughed, Lord Robertson added: "Well, you can say exactly the same thing about NATO, but when we get there, we're strong, and we stand for the values that unite a great alliance." They took no questions from reporters. 
But unity did not seem the message of the day. Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, distanced himself from Mr. Bush's declaration that he had all the authority he needed to order military action against Iraq for defying United Nations mandates. Mr. Berlusconi, one of Mr. Bush's closest allies, said he believed that more explicit United Nations backing was needed, though he criticized France and Germany for their opposition. 
The administration has made no secret of its growing anger at President Jacques Chirac of France, who told Central and Eastern European nations on Tuesday that if they continued to ally themselves with Mr. Bush on Iraq, they would jeopardize their chances of joining the European Union. 
Today Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the French and others opposing confrontation with Saddam Hussein were "afraid of stepping up to the responsibility of imposing the will of the international community." 
Asked today whether he meant to suggest that the French were afraid of war, Mr. Powell replied, "I didn't." He said all of the Security Council members that signed the Iraq disarmament resolution in November "must not be afraid of what might be required in the future to implement such a resolution."
Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman for the United Nations inspectors under Hans Blix, said tonight that no Iraqi scientists whom the inspectors had sought to interview on issues related to potential chemical or biological weapons or missile technology had consented to be interviewed alone since Mr. Blix last visited Iraq on Feb. 8. Although more than 30 such private interviews have been requested, only 3 have been conducted to date.
Mr. Fleischer and other administration officials said another resolution would be introduced at the Security Council soon, and the British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, told reporters that "explicitlyor implicitly" he expected that it would contain a deadline for Iraqi compliance. The time line under discussion now, officials of several nations said, would point to a vote after March 1, and it seems unlikely that Mr. Bush would order military action before the Security Council vote is resolved.
One reason the introduction of the resolution has been delayed, officials say, is the continuing uncertainty over Turkey. Much of the negotiation concerns grants and the forgiveness of debt for an economy that, in the estimation of the International Monetary Fund and others, has been run without discipline for years. 
The Turks, who are demanding as much as $32 billion in aid, "see a moment this month to get the kind of deal that other countries in similar financial straits could only dream of," a senior administration economic official said the other day. 
Still, an administration official said other issues were in contention in negotiating with the Turks -- namely, the future of the Turkish military presence in northern Iraq and the Turkish desire for some oil concession at Kirkuk in Iraq.
"The Turks want to control the operation at Kirkuk, at a minimum through a pipeline," the official said. "That's in a way a better deal for them than American aid."
But Mr. Bush and his aides have often said Iraq's oil is for the benefit of the Iraqi people, and they realize that any discussion of guaranteeing access to the oil to Turkey -- or any other nation -- would make it appear that the war is about oil rights, not weapons of mass destruction.
The official said giving Turkey guarantees was impossible "without breaking an awful lot of crockery," including "looking disingenuous to our Kurdish friends" in northern Iraq.
If talks with Turkey fail to turn around, the Pentagon would have to divert ships full of troops and equipment that are approaching Turkey's coast. American officials said they would send those ships to the Persian Gulf if they did not have a Turkish decision Turks by the end of week. 
Mr. Rumsfeld -- acutely aware that the first rule of negotiating is not to appear too eager a buyer -- told reporters this afternoon, "Obviously the more assistance one gets, the easier it is; the less assistance one gets, the more difficult it is." But with Turkey's aid or without it, he said, an attack on Iraq is "doable." 
As negotiations with the Americans appeared to go nowhere, Turkish officials spoke with bitterness over what they said was the American refusal to offer more economic aid. A senior Turkish official said tonight that he had grown pessimistic that a deal could be reached. 
"Things are not going well," the Turkish official said. "Nothing has happened in the past few hours to change my mind." 
The deadlock was apparently unbroken by a string of high-level meetings and conversations today. Mr. Powell called the Turkish prime minister, Abdullah Gul, and Robert Pearson, the American ambassador to Turkey, visited officials at the Turkish Foreign Ministry. Vice President Dick Cheney made similar phone calls several days ago.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

"ALL THE REAL GIRLS," starring Paul Schneider, Zooey Deschanel and Patricia Clarkson. Written and directed by David Gordon Green (R, 108 minutes). Mr. Green follows "George Washington," his luminous found fable of Southern childhood, with a more conventional story of young love. Mr. Schneider plays a small-town cad whose easygoing promiscuity is derailed by Ms. Deschanel, whose character has just returned home from boarding school. Their sweet, fumbling romance is captured with scruffy, low-key lyricism. The film is an awkward hybrid of free-form, do-it-yourself filmmaking and professional discipline (supplied by the wonderful Ms. Deschanel, and by Ms. Clarkson), but its beauty and sincerity overcome its flaws and hesitations (A. O. Scott).

* "CITY OF GOD," starring Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora and Seu Jorge. Directed by Fernando Meirelles (R, 130 minutes; in Portuguese, with English subtitles). A scorching anecdotal history of gang warfare in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, "City of God" is narrated by Rocket (Mr. Rodrigues), a young photographer who chronicles the deterioration of the housing project in which he grew up from a shantytown into a war zone. The movie, which begins in the 1960's and ends in the early 80's, parallels Rocket's story with the rise of his childhood playmate Li'l Ze (Mr. da Hora) from a petty thief into a ruthless drug dealer and neighborhood kingpin commanding a small army of gun-toting children. The history is told in a loose, tall-tale style that suggests a quasi-cinema-verite version of Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" (Stephen Holden).

"DAREDEVIL," starring Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (PG-13, 96 minutes). Sometimes playing a comic-book hero gives actors a chance to show suave, stylized moves. After stripping off their civvies, they emerge from the phone booth a star. Christopher Reeve gave a breezy, farcical charge to Superman and Clark Kent. As Batman and his alter ego, the wastrel playboy Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton seemed to have a thousand things on his mind, most of them unpleasant. But poor Ben Affleck is lost in the minor, passable "Daredevil," where he portrays the blind, red-costumed and horn-headed crime fighter whose other senses -- hearing, touch, taste -- were exaggerated in the chemical accident that cost him his sight. A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role. Even his scarlet leather outfit makes him diminutive. The interlocked double D on his left breast makes him look like part of the food-service industry: "Hi, I'm Daredevil, and I'll be your superhero this evening" (Elvis Mitchell).

"FINAL DESTINATION 2," starring Ali Larter, A. J. Cook and Michael Landes. Directed by David R. Ellis (R, 97 minutes). This gleefully morbid sequel may, in the end, be as nonsensical as its title, but it's also much more imaginative. Ms. Larter is Clear Rivers, the sole survivor of the first "Final Destination," who has locked herself away to hide from the grisly death she is sure must be stalking her. Ms. Cook is Kimberly, who has foreseen, and escaped, a horrific traffic accident and is now similarly stalked. But death, which turns out to have a macabre and elaborate sense of humor, gets all the best material, and the filmmakers delight in staging a series of ghoulishly slapstick demises, involving pigeons and refrigerator magnets as well as the more traditional exploding cars and out-of-control elevators. The spirit of the movie is best summed up in the following line, spoken by a television news reporter after one such death. "Ironically, the woman was impaled through the head after her air bag inflated." Ironically indeed (Scott).

* "GANGS OF NEW YORK," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 165 minutes). Long awaited, enormously expensive, endlessly gossiped about, Mr. Scorsese's brutal epic of mid-19th-century Manhattan is a near-great film that, as time goes by, may well make up the distance. As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story -- a revenge tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Mr. DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Mr. Day-Lewis) -- is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. In his mouth the rough vernacular of the old New York streets becomes poetry. If Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is the way it brings history to life, not merely by meticulously recreating its details but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continues to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to re-imagine the germs of America's historical identity (Scott).

"HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS," starring Kate Hudson, Matthew McConaughey and Bebe Neuwirth. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG-13, 100 minutes). Yet another mediocre New York romantic comedy, yes, but notably less mediocre than "Maid in Manhattan" and "Two Weeks Notice." This is because Ms. Hudson and Mr. McConaughey are an energetic, well-matched comic pair, and because the writers have smuggled a few sharp, funny jokes into the lockstep conventions of the plot. The premise, too, has a nice frost of screwball cynicism, as the two principals woo each other for venal, professional reasons. Ben (Mr. McConaughey), a tomcatting ad man, must make a woman fall in love with him if he is to win a big account; to write a feature story for a women's magazine, Andie (Ms. Hudson) must drive a man away. Would you believe that they actually fall in love? Nobody would, but it's sometimes fun to pretend, just as it's fun to pretend that the advertising and magazine industries are untouched by recession, the Knicks are in the N.B.A. finals and Staten Island is full of people who talk as if they're from Texas (Scott).

"LOST IN LA MANCHA," with Terry Gilliam. Written and directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe (R, 89 minutes). After watching this fascinating and compelling new documentary, you may forever wonder how it is that movies are made at all. "Lost" may not be a great piece of filmmaking, but it is a great story; its directors display dramatic intelligence. "Lost" is an inside view of how a film -- in this case, Mr. Gilliam's "Man Who Killed Don Quixote" -- can fall to pieces, even under the guidance of a master director. Imagine watching a real-life version of Ian McKellen's kindly, indomitable Gandalf in "Lord of the Rings" give his life for his cause, only to find that his supreme gesture is meaningless because his fellows are slaughtered anyway. That's what "Lost" is like. What's clear and astonishingly entertaining about "Lost" is that the directors' only good luck was that they happened to be safely behind the scenes when epic mishaps struck so often on the set that Beelzebub probably put in for overtime (Mitchell).

"THE RECRUIT," starring Al Pacino, Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan. Directed by Roger Donaldson (PG-13, 105 minutes). The C.I.A. setting, the utterly predictable plot twists, the chase scenes and the climactic bout of gunplay may suggest a thriller, but really this slick and pointless exercise belongs to a more specialized genre: the Al Pacino crazy-mentor picture. This time, Mr. Pacino is Walter Burke, whose job is to recruit and train intelligence operatives. "I have a scary eye for talent," he says. What Mr. Pacino displays is his peculiar, and often amusing, gift for ranting, spluttering and braying, and his wildly unpredictable, borderline-incoherent performance is the only interesting thing in the movie. Mr. Farrell, as Burke's troubled protege, James Clayton, an M.I.T. graduate student who seems to have misplaced his shaving kit in all the excitement, works very hard without producing anything like the casual, nutty intensity Mr. Pacino can summon so effortlessly. Ms. Moynahan is James's fellow trainee and love interest, who may or may not be a mole (Scott).

HEADLINE: Inside the Music: A Cellist's Perspective 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
CARTER BREY could be having a major solo career. He used to have just that, appearing with virtually every leading orchestra in the United States, becoming the first musician to win the Arts Council of America's Performing Arts Prize and earning international attention as a prizewinner in the Rostropovich International Cello Competition.
 Instead, since 1996, Mr. Brey has been playing cello with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. True, he is principal cellist, which means he leads the section. Otherwise, though, he is no different from the 11 other cello players, several of whom could also have solo careers but instead perform about 34 weeks of subscription concerts a year, as well as tours and special appearances. 
 For those attending a concert, it is rare to know much about the musicians beyond the music they make together. To most audiences they are little more than a sea of anonymous figures in black, bent over their music stands. But singling out one section of the New York Philharmonic -- the cellists -- for a closer look offers some sense of the varied, complex, accomplished individuals behind the instruments. As a group that helps to depict the sunrise in "La Mer" by Debussy and to establish the theme of the Offertorio section of Verdi's Requiem, they are an integral part of the top-flight 106-member ensemble known as the New York Phil. 
At the end of every performance, the cellists pack their instruments -- which can cost anywhere from $40,000 brand new to $5 million for the rarest of Stradivarius -- away in their hulking cases and haul them back into their personal lives. The players range in age from their early 30's to their late 70's. Some have been with the orchestra for 40 years; others joined more recently. All are adjusting to a new maestro, Lorin Maazel, who took over the baton from Kurt Masur this season. All have taken different routes to this point in their careers and have particular reasons for deciding to perfect the sometimes understated but often lyrical, insinuating instrument that is the cello.
During the week between Christmas and New Year in 1995, Mr. Brey was washing the dishes when the phone rang. He and his wife had just had a second child, and he was preparing to go on yet another concert tour, wondering what was wrong with this picture. The more successful his solo career became, the more it took him away from home. The larger his family grew, the less he wanted to travel. The call was from Catherine Cahill, then general manager of the Philharmonic, who invited him to audition for the position of principal cellist; Lorne Munroe was retiring.
"It couldn't have been better scripted by Frank Capra," said Mr. Brey, now 48. "In the space of a few seconds, it appeared to me this would be the perfect solution."
He auditioned on a hot and sultry Tuesday the following May. Preparing wasn't simple; having concentrated on solo performing, Mr. Brey said, he needed to reacquaint himself with the orchestral repertory. He rehearsed meticulously for the audition, he said, and was one of 14 finalists. "Auditions are peculiar," he said. "You have to go in for a limited amount of time and prove something about yourself."
"I had an attitude of pleasurable expectancy," Mr. Brey continued. "The pleasure is particular and intense. I was very relaxed after the first 10 minutes." By the time he was through, a thunderstorm had started.
"I walked all the way home in the rain," he said. "I ruined my suit."

Supporting Actors, Not Stars
Ask cellists to define the part the cello plays in an orchestra, and they describe it as subtle but essential. "It's a foundation role," said Eric Bartlett, 45, who joined the orchestra in 1997. "It provides stability and structure."
Rather than supplying the main melody, the cello generally supports it. "It's hard to be the background," Evangeline Benedetti said.
At the same time, Ms. Benedetti added, the cello is "a very sensuous instrument, a great part of the musical sound," she said. "Because of its range, it makes a huge contribution."
Avram A. Lavin said the cello was more versatile than many other instruments. "It's an instrument that has unlimited possibilities; it has the widest range of any string instrument," he said. "It can be a soprano, and it can be a bass, and I think it's generally accepted that the total quality comes closest to the human voice."
"The cello is a solo instrument, though not as popular as the violin or piano," Mr. Lavin continued. "There's no doubt that the first violin section has some of the most demanding material. However, the cello mostly plays a middle voice. It would be hard to rate instruments in terms of importance, because if you take any of them away, you have no orchestra."
Mr. Lavin, who auditioned for the New York Philharmonic in spring 1963, is in his 40th season with the orchestra. He is 77 -- "but you don't have to stress that," he said. In World War II, he played in the Signal Corps String Quartet that gave concerts around the world. "It certainly was better than getting shot up," he said.
He was reared in Chicago. His father was a violinist; his mother played piano. "I think my parents wanted to have a trio, so they stuck me with the cello," he said.
"It's an interesting life," he added. "I don't think hard is the right word. After all these years, I wouldn't want to do anything else."
Hai-Ye Ni, 30, auditioned for the position of associate principal cellist in 1999.Having made her New York debut at Alice Tully Hall in 1991 and become, at 18, the youngest musician to win first prize at the Naumburg International Cello Competition, Ms. Ni had never auditioned for an orchestra before. One of 99 applicants, she was sent a list of pieces to prepare, including two cello concertos, one by Dvorak and one by Haydn.
"It was really scary," Ms. Ni said. "I was quite nervous, and I remember Mr. Masur made me play through the solo in Brahms's third movement of his second Piano Concerto."
"He wanted it a certain way, wanted it a little slower," she recalled. "He said, 'Imagine you're an older person playing this theme at the end of your day.' "
Born in Shanghai, Ms. Ni began studying cello with her mother, also a cellist, when she was about 7. In 1985 she moved to the United States to study. "I love the sound of the cello," she said.
As associate principal cellist, Ms. Ni occasionally leads the section in Mr. Brey's absence. Describing the role of principal, she said, "Sometimes I relate what the conductor wants to the section; other times I interpret what he wants."
When Mr. Brey was a member of the Cleveland Orchestra, he spent two seasons sitting in the last chair of the cello section. Leading a section for the New York Philharmonic is very different. As just a member of the section, "you're a cog in someone else's musical machine," he said. "Being section leader was a strain on my self-confidence. It took me a full season to grow comfortably into the role."
As principal, Mr. Brey has tried to draw on his past experience of being one of several musicians. "Players in the back of the cello section can feel disenfranchised, isolated from what's going on up front," he said. "I try to maintain lines of communication."
He said he also tried to create the aura of a chamber music group within an orchestra. "Most of what I do has to do with maintaining a sense of ensemble awareness," he said, "unanimity of articulation, phrasing, bowing." 
There are also psychological aspects to his role, he explained, and he tries to unify the group without meddling. "I have to play paterfamilias to the section," he said. "It's none of my business how anybody feels on a particular day except insofar as it affects their contribution to the playing."
Mr. Maazel credited Mr. Brey with giving the section its sense of cohesion and its high quality. "The tone is set by Carter, who's an amazing soloist, has a lovely sound -- technically without peer -- and knows the repertoire as few cellists do," Mr. Maazel said. "With someone like that sitting in the first chair as principal, a standard is set which the others feel they have to meet."
Indeed, Brinton Smith, 33, who joined the Philharmonic last September, said Mr. Brey played a large role in his decision to leave his post as the principal cellist of the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. 
"He's unique among principal cellists," Mr. Smith said. "His hiring sent shock waves through the cello world. Not only is he good enough to have a major solo career, but he does such an important part. Having a leader everyone can look up to and respect makes such a huge difference in the way everybody feels and works together."

Where Women Made History
The orchestra has four rehearsals for each concert, the last one occasionally open to the public. The cellists are expected to practice their own parts before rehearsals. "The most difficult part of playing is you're onstage with 99 other people, and everybody can hear you," Ms. Ni said. "It can be very embarrassing if you come in a little early."
By the time they reach the Philharmonic, of course, cellists don't have to worry much about making mistakes; they are at the top of their field. Everyone in the section has been playing since childhood and has had extensive training and experience.
Qiang Tu, 38, who joined the Philharmonic in 1995, was taught the cello by his father, who asked a friend in an instrument factory in China to build small cellos for his children. Young Qiang wanted to play the tuba, but his father insisted on the cello. While Mr. Tu did not say so outright, it was clear that he was pushed hard by his father, something he does not want to repeat with his own two daughters. At one point, he had to stop talking because he was overcome by tears.
"I went through tough situations in my whole life," he said. "Everything now I really appreciate. I enjoy my own life even more because of all those tough things."
Mr. Tu made his solo debut at 13 in Beijing, and at 17, he won the Menuhin Prize in Britain as a member of the China Youth String Quartet. "It's part of my life," he said. "You have to love it if you want to do it well."
Ms. Benedetti, born in Austin, Tex., played French horn and bassoon as a youngster because she wanted to be in the band. But she felt especially lucky to be able to take free cello lessons at the University of Texas. "String instruments were scarce in Texas," she said.
In 1967, Ms. Benedetti, now 61, became the second woman to join the Philharmonic (Orin O'Brien, a bassist, was the first in 1966). "I'm in books about the history of music," she said.
Cello was less rare in Oklahoma City, where Nancy Donaruma grew up. In her own home her father played the violin and her mother the piano, and by the time she was in kindergarten, she knew many string quartets. "From the time I can remember, there was always music at my house," she said.
Ms. Donaruma, now 54, played concerts with her father at church and at weddings, and as a child she would watch the Young People's Concerts of the Philharmonic on television. "Someday," she would say to herself, "I'm going to play in that orchestra."
She did exactly that in 1976 as the ninth woman to join the Philharmonic. "It was a tremendous deal to get into this orchestra," she said.
It is female players like Ms. Benedetti and Ms. Donaruma who paved the way for women like Eileen Moon, 33, who joined the cello section in 1998. Ms. Moon, born in Northern California, started the cello at 10, attending music camp every summer and chamber music parties as a teenager. "It was what I did," she said. "Other people went to school dances and I went to youth orchestra."
Ms. Moon said she was sometimes overwhelmed by her position. "I feel very lucky, very blessed to be here," she said. "It's the New York Philharmonic. I went to Juilliard. It was always the orchestra."
As a result, she said, she lives her work intensely. "It can be rough on your psyche," she said. "Music for me really could never feel just like a job, and I sometimes struggle against that."
"In some ways, I wish I could be more laid back, not about the way I approach the job, but because of the way it comes back at me, the way it affects me," she continued. "It took me a long time to say, 'I'm going to work. I'm going to go to work and I'm just going to come home.' "
Mr. Brey said he felt a similar awe when he joined the Philharmonic. He grew up on the orchestra, traveling to the city from his childhood home in upstate South Salem, N.Y., for the Young People's Concerts.
"This was always my orchestra, my hometown orchestra, just asNew York was my city," he said. "To walk in and sit in the chair that had been occupied by Lorne Munroe and before that by Carl Stern and Laszlo Varga, it was a humbling experience. It was pretty scary that first season."
Mr. Brey, born in Montclair, N.J., came to the cello on his own. His mother was tone deaf, he said; his father was an artist. One of his earliest memories is of being home with the chicken pox and listening to Benjamin Britten after his father took home "The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra," a musical introduction written by Britten. "I'd always liked the sound of strings," Mr. Brey said.
"There was a great cellist who said, 'You don't choose music; music chooses you,' " Mr. Brey added. "At a certain age, I felt I couldn't live without it."
While the cellists play certain pieces over and over each season, they say their performances vary, depending on the music director. Their new maestro, Mr. Maazel, was the choice of the musicians if ever there was one. He was appointed after the orchestra made its preference for him clearly known, despite objections from music critics who called the decision conservative.
So far, the musicians say, so good. While some critics have faulted Mr. Maazel at times for being too much of a technician, the musicians say they appreciate that exactitude, that it makes their work smoother.
"It's easy to see exactly what he wants," Ms. Donaruma said. "It's a pleasure to work with somebody who is so easy to understand."
The cellists also say that they appreciate Mr. Maazel's extensive knowledge of the music and that he himself is a violinist.
"He's very professional, he's considerate of the musicians and he seems to be having a wonderful time," Mr. Bartlett said. "And that is infectious. Everyone seems to be feeding off that."
To be sure, Mr. Maazel said, "I'm just loving the job. This is an orchestra I can really relate to."

Adjusting to a New Leader
Nevertheless, Mr. Maazel has required some adjustment; music directors always do. "You have to get used to their stick technique," Ms. Donaruma said, referring to the baton, "how they say things and how they ask for things, get used to listening to their voice, what they do with their body, things that get communicated that aren't verbal."
"It's mostly personality," she added. "You hope they have some charisma, hope they have some innate musicianship inside their gut. If you don't have that, you're in trouble."
The cellists say Mr. Maazel and Mr. Masur have distinctly different styles. Mr. Maazel is more head, Mr. Masur more heart; Mr. Maazel is more contained, Mr. Masur more emotive. "They're about as different as two heads of corporate companies can be," said Elizabeth Dyson, 32, who started with the orchestra in 1996.
To be sure, there are those who feel a certain loyalty to the maestro who brought them in. "Masur gave me my job, and that's a very special thing," Ms. Moon said. But, she added, "I really enjoy having Maazel here. Maazel is accessible. Very clear."
Mr. Maazel said he has been impressed with the cellists: "I don't think I've ever encountered a cello section with so much talent. It's a very cohesive section. They work well together and have a great sense of camaraderie."
Zarin Mehta, executive director of the Philharmonic, says he likes what he hears. "There is more of a brilliant sound," he said, "a sureness of attack in the orchestra."
The cellists say they like to play a range of material. But they also have their personal favorites. Mr. Brey's is Mozart. "His music is everything that's perfect in art to me," Mr. Brey said. "Perfectly balanced, profoundly moving, funny, sexy. He accomplishes all of that with incredible economy of means."
Ms. Ni loves the Brahms Fourth Symphony. "Every time I play it, I always hear something new," she said. "There's always a line I never heard before."
Ms. Donaruma prefers Beethoven and Mahler. "Some of my biggest thrills have been playing big Mahler symphonies with Bernstein and Mehta," she said, speaking of the conductors Leonard Bernstein and Zubin Mehta.
Some critics have complained that the Philharmonic plays too traditional a repertory. Mr. Bartlett, who is a regular performer with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, said that he understood the need for a balance between modern and classical. "Personally, I prefer to do lots of contemporary music; I think today's composers need and deserve to have their music played," he said. "There are people who would come more, and there are clearly people who would come less."

Have Cello, Will Travel
By the end of July, the Philharmonic will have traveled for a total of seven weeks, including trips to Asia; Italy; Vail, Colo.; and the southeastern United States. The musicians described the traveling as both grueling and glamorous. On one hand, they have to hit the ground running, jumping into rehearsals and performances with little time to recover from jet lag. And many of them miss their families. "I'm always amazed how the orchestra sounds so good when people are tired," Ms. Ni said.
On the other hand, she pointed out, they are seeing the world, all expenses paid. "If I hadn't played cello, I probably would never have been to all these places," she said. "Visiting all these quarters of the world has opened up my being."
There is a more basic aspect of playing for the Philharmonic. It is the way these cellists pay the rent and put their children through school, like any other professionals. "I have used before the analogy that it is sort of like a marriage," Ms. Benedetti said. "Sometimes it works well; sometimes it doesn't; sometimes it's stormy."
"But," she added, "it's extraordinarily pleasing."
Ms. Donaruma chose the cello because it was easier than medical school. But she also became an emergency medical technician and now volunteers a few days a month at her home in upstate Beekman, N.Y. "I think I'm different from the rest of the section because I've reached a point in my life where cello isn't everything anymore," she said.
Despite his abiding passion for the cello, Mr. Brey said there were moments when it failed him. "At times I feel the limitations of the instrument," he said. "I wish often I were a violinist."
Still, the cellists say they feel lucky to be part of the Philharmonic and appreciate the caliber of their fellow players throughout the orchestra. 
"One of the advantages is, after I've been playing pieces all my life, I know my part so well I really get to listen to the other parts," Ms. Benedetti said. "After you've played Tchaikovsky's Fifth 250 times, you have to search for something new. 
"The high level of playing from colleagues is a delight," she continued. "I can hear one cymbal crash that's just crystal clear. That's beautiful."

HEADLINE: Development of Biotech Crops Is Booming in Asia 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHIANG RAI, Thailand, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
Worried about falling behind its global competition, much of Asia is rushing forward with the development and cultivation of genetically modified crops.
 The three most populous countries in Asia -- China, India and Indonesia -- are already planting millions of acres of genetically modified cotton. Several other large Asian countries, including Japan, Thailand, the Philippines and Malaysia, are earmarking billions of dollars for private and government-sponsored research on biotech crops. 
 Given that there are already 145 million acres planted with genetically modified crops worldwide, mostly in North and South America, these developments in Asia could pave the way for bioengineered crops to dominate the world's food production. 
"This is a significant development in the acceptance of genetically modified crops," said Nicholas Kalaitzandonakes, a professor of agribusiness at the University of Missouri at Columbia. "This is not only a region where most of the population growth is, it's a region where most of the food growth is."
Aware of food safety concerns, especially among Europeans, most governments in Asia plan to move cautiously before approving the use of genetically modified food crops, which are much more controversial than nonfood crops like cotton and flowers. China for now is holding off on letting farmers plant biotech food crops, though tests are continuing.
But spending on biotech research and development is booming throughout Asia, according to delegates at a biotech policy conference sponsored here by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group.
Malaysia is creating a biotech hub outside Kuala Lumpur that it calls "biovalley." Indonesia is setting up its own industrial park, called "bioisland." Even in Japan and South Korea -- where some consumers have been unnerved by the prospect of genetically modified foods -- there are investors and others spending heavily to develop biotech products.
Experts at the conference said most of these countries must embrace biotechnology or risk seeing their crops lose value in a rapidly changing marketplace that promises a new breed of super crops.
"If they don't employ biotechnology, they're going to be left behind," said Dr. Cho Kyun Rha, a professor of biomaterial sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a conference participant. "They would end up buying the seed from others, and that would be biotech colonization."
China -- which after the United States has the most advanced biotechnology programs -- could come to dominate agricultural production in the region, because it is so far ahead in its research on genetically modified crops.
Already, a majority of the cotton grown in China, the world's leading producer, is genetically engineered to resist pests. Besides rice and tomatoes, China has developed genetically modified corn, tobacco, sweet peppers, petunias and poplar trees.
Other Asian countries, meanwhile, are beginning to release their first biotechnology products. India and Indonesia recently approved the planting of a variety of insect-resistant biotech cotton that drastically reduces the need for pesticides. 
Indeed, biotech cotton is so popular with farmers that a black market has emerged in several Asian countries that have not yet approved the products.
"There's piracy going on," said Clive James, head of the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications, an industry-sponsored organization that tracks global plantings of biotech crops. "These farmers think so much of this technology, they will steal it."
The enthusiasm extends beyond cotton. The Philippines has allowed the marketing of foods made with biotech corn, a first for Asia. The Philippines is also the site of the International Rice Research Institute, which is working to use biotechnology to develop "golden rice," a variety fortified with vitamin A. 
Critics of genetically modified crops say these moves in Asia could leave consumers around the world with little choice but to accept them.
"It's troublesome, because these countries don't have the regulatory infrastructure to assess the risks," said Dr. Jane Rissler of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group that has been critical of biotech crops.
But in the absence of any solid evidence that genetically modified crops are harmful to humans, scientists in Asia are experimenting on everything from genetically modified corn, potatoes and papaya to biotech mustard and chili peppers. 
Biotechnology advocates in Asia believe that genetically modified crops will increase food production, significantly reduce the use of pesticides and insecticides and even create drought-resistant crops that can grow on land now regarded as non-arable. Farmers' incomes will rise, they claim, with the greatest benefits in the the poorest regions.
China has over 20,000 people employed in government-led research at about 200 labs. Government spending on biotech research has tripled in recent years and could top $1.5 billion for the five years ending in 2005, making China second only to the United States in this area. 
The rest of Asia is now playing catch up. India is conducting biotech research at most of its major universities. Japan and South Korea expect to spend over $300 million a year on biotech research. Malaysia wants to engineer palm oil trees genetically to serve as factories of specialized plastics for medical devices. Vietnam and Singapore, too, are exploring the development of portfolios of biotech crops.
China's enthusiasm is dictated from the top. But both there and in India -- places where small farmers work under the harshest conditions, often suffering from the effects of their own pesticide spraying -- biotech crops have mainly been seen as beneficial.
However, Japan, a major food importer, has been reluctant to accept genetically modified crops, because of concerns about food safety. Opposition in Europe has prompted China to place a moratorium on biotech food crops that had already been approved for commercialization.
Some experts say the world's largest seed and biotechnolgy companies are lobbying in Asia to promote genetically modified crops and to sway regulators and public opinion.
"They fear if they don't succeed there, the future could be a rocky one," said Neil Harl, a professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University. "So there's this enormous effort under way."
There is a push -- articulated by several delegates at the conference here -- to coordinate regulatory, food labeling and trade policies to ensure the success of genetically modified foods.
"With today's globalization, you can't have some do it and some don't," said Dr. Chen Zhangliang, a professor at Beijing University and one of the leaders of China's biotechnology program, who delivered a fierce attack on biotech critics. "You need to have these issues harmonized." 
Some policy makers also worry that cross-border seed piracy could create legal trade and regulatory disputes. Biotech cotton leaked into India long before the country approved its planting. And pirated seeds are believed to be in wide use today in Thailand and Pakistan.
For many governments in Asia, though, biotechnology appears to be seen as a potential silver bullet for a host of food and agriculture ills, and a means to create new products that could sell for higher prices.
"We are trying to develop the blue orchid," said Sotat Sriwattanapong, who works at Biotec, a government agency in Bangkok. "It doesn't exist in nature. But this may attract the people or the market."

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Are Up Sharply; Jobless Claims Also Higher 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Prices paid to producers in January rose at the fastest pace in more than a decade, pushed up by rising energy and auto costs, the Labor Department said today in a report suggesting more evidence of inflation than expected.
 Overall producer prices climbed 1.6 percent, the largest rise since January 1990, surpassing forecasts of a 0.5 percent increase. This compared with a 0.1 percent decline in wholesale prices in December. 
 Excluding relatively volatile food and energy items, prices rose 0.9 percent, the fastest since December 1998 and also above forecasts of 0.1 percent.
The Federal Reserve and the financial markets will be looking at Friday's report on consumer prices for a more complete picture of inflation pressures.
In today's data, gasoline and home heating oil prices surged as cold weather increased demand and uncertainty over a possible war in Iraq pushed energy prices higher. Gasoline prices rose 13.7 percent; heating oil was up 19.7 percent.
Car prices posted their fastest increase since October 1986, rising 3.5 percent. Automakers cut back on financial incentives in January, pushing up prices.
In other areas, pharmaceutical costs climbed 1.2 percent and capital equipment prices rose 0.7 percent. Food prices were up 1.6 percent.
A report from the Labor Department today showed that the number of Americans seeking jobless benefits for the first time rose by 21,000, to a seasonally adjusted 402,000, in the week ended Feb. 15. Analysts had expected 382,000. Some economists consider claims above the 400,000 level a sign of a deteriorating job market. The four-week moving average, a more reliable gauge, rose to 394,750, an increase of 4,750 from the previous week. 
The Labor Department said it had to estimate jobless claims in states that had difficulty providing data because of the recent blizzard. But it added there was no reason to think that the estimates were skewed or that the total figures would be subject to large revisions. 
In a third report releasedtoday, a crucial economic forecasting gauge declined slightly in January. The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of leading economic indicators fell 0.1 percent, after a 0.2 percent rise in December. Many economists had expected a 0.1 percent rise. 
The Conference Board's chief economist, Ken Goldstein, said: "There's a chance we could be talking about a real recovery, not a jobless recovery, as early as the second quarter. There's a sense that there is forward momentum; it's there. The question is, Is this a mirage?"

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Decline on 4 Disappointing Reports on Economy

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors already edgy about the economy received new reasons to sell stocks yesterday with the release of four disappointing economic reports. In addition, worries about a potential war with Iraq and what it might do to the economy continued to depress the market. 
 Analysts said that investors were particularly unnerved by a jump in energy prices, fearing that costs will go up even more if there is a war with Iraq. 
 "People are unwilling to invest and make commitments until we get clarity on Iraq," said Brian Bush, director of equity research at Stephens Inc. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 85.64 points, or 1.1 percent, at 7,914.96. The broader market also pulled back. The Nasdaq composite index declined 3.09 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,331.23. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 8.03 points, or 1 percent, to 837.10. 
Several disappointing economic reports pulled the market lower. First, there was news that the United States recorded a $435.2 billion trade deficit for 2002, the largest in history, as the weak global economy hampered American exports while imports of cars and other consumer goods reached record highs. 
And the Labor Department reported that inflation at the producer, or wholesale, level jumped 1.6 percent in January, the biggest increase in 13 years, led by a 4.8 percent increase in energy costs. The government also said the number of newly laid- off workers filing unemployment claims jumped to a seven-week high of 402,000 last week, up by 21,000 from the previous week. 
In the fourth report, the Conference Board said a crucial gauge of future economic activity declined in January. The industry group reported that its index of leading economic indicators slipped by 0.1 percent in January from a month ago, to a revised 111.2, which was weaker than the reading of unchanged that analysts had expected. 
"Iraq is essentially a wet blanket over the economy at this point," said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Ryan, Beck & Company. "When you get a slightly higher-than-expected jobless claims number and a rise in producer prices because of oil, there is some concern about the economy." 
Investors have been concerned that a war with Iraq will prompt consumers and businesses to further clamp down on spending, slowing what is already a sluggish economy. 
Target, the discount retailer, fell $1.10, to $26.77, after meeting fourth-quarter earnings expectations but reporting smaller-than-expected revenue. The company said sales at stores open at least one year fell 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter. 
Skechers U.S.A., which makes shoes, dropped $1.91, to $6.09, after it reported a fourth-quarter loss of 23 cents a share, more than the 21 cents that analysts expected. 
Kellogg fell $1.10, to $30.12, after Credit Suisse First Boston downgraded it to neutral from outperform. 
Gainers included J. C. Penney, which rose $1.34, to $19.77, after releasing fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's forecast. 
"No one is going to make a bet in this market until we think we are close to a resolution in Iraq," Mr. Bush of Stephens said. "That is what you are seeing in the weak volume." 
In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note increased 5/32 , to a price of 100 2/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.87 percent, from 3.89 percent on Wednesday. 
The 30-year bond rose 5/32 , to 108 21/32 . Its yield fell to 4.81 percent, from 4.82 percent.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
Korean Issue Shapes Powell's Asia Agenda

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell departs on Friday for a five-day trip to Asia intended to smooth over tensions with South Korea and build support for a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning North Korea's nuclear weapons program, administration officials said today.
 Though the official purpose of Mr. Powell's trip is to attend the inauguration of Roh Moo Hyun as South Korean's president on Tuesday, he will also stop in Tokyo and Beijing, with North Korea and Iraq at the top of his agenda, officials said. The United States is engaged in an even more urgent effort to get Security Council backing for a resolution endorsing the use of force against Iraq, a position not so far supported by China, one of the five veto-bearing permanent Council members. 
 Administration officials said Mr. Powell would try to reduce some of the differences separating Washington from the three major nations in Northeast Asia on the issue of North Korea. South Korea, Japan and China have urged the administration to engage in one-on-one talks with North Korea as soon as possible.
But administration officials have said they will not talk with North Korea about economic or security issues until it "steps back" from its nuclear programs. The officials have also said they will only meet with North Korea in a "multilateral forum," an offer North Korea has repeatedly rejected.
"There needs to be a way of making clear that the world does care about these matters," said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman.
Korea experts said Mr. Powell must begin building a consensus among the Asian nations on North Korea -- a first step toward seeking a tough United Nations resolution condemning North Korea's recent steps to develop nuclear weapons. 
That resolution could provide a basis for the United States to seek stronger action by the United Nations -- including perhaps sanctions -- if North Korea resumes ballistic missile tests or begins reprocessing plutonium for nuclear weapons.
"If things go poorly, you need that resolution as a first step to something more," said Victor D. Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University. "From a North Korean perspective, seeing a resolution like that, that everyone signs onto, including the Chinese and Russians, would have a powerful effect." 
Just as important for Mr. Powell, officials and Korean experts said, will be to ease tensions between South Korea and the United States that flared during the South Korean presidential campaign last year.
Having Mr. Powell attend the inauguration when he is embroiled in Iraq-related diplomacy will send an important message of respect to Mr. Roh, Korea experts said.
In China, Mr. Powell is expected to emphasize that the United States believes that Beijing can do more to pressure North Korea, American officials said. 
"We give the Chinese some credit for doing something," a senior administration official said. "But we think the point has to be made again and again and more clearly to the North Koreans, at a high level, that they are endangering their relations with the world."
Highlighting the continuing tensions on the Korean Peninsula, a North Korean fighter plane swooped over the Yellow Sea off the South Korean west coast for two minutes today, raising the question of whether the flight was timed to precede Mr. Powell's arrival on Monday.
After six South Korean jets scrambled to chase the plane back to North Korean territory, the South Korean Defense Ministry called the flight a "provocation," although officials also acknowledged that the incident might have been a chance foray.

HEADLINE: Daimler Is Upbeat on Chrysler, With Some Ifs 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: STUTTGART, Germany, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
DaimlerChrysler said today that further recovery at its Chrysler unit would help the group improve profit this year, but that this assumed stable economic conditions in its main markets. 
 The carmaker, two-thirds of the way through a three-year turnaround plan at Chrysler, declined to put a figure on its goal, citing the degree of political and economic uncertainty. "DaimlerChrysler plans to achieve higher earnings this year than in 2002," the company said. "However, a precondition for this anticipated increase is that conditions remain stable in the most important markets." 
 Georg Stuerzer, an analyst at HypoVereinsbank, said, "This is quite a clear statement, given the current danger for giving outlooks, and it is more than many investors had expected." 
Volkswagen earlier this week offered no outlook after posting a 10 percent drop in 2002 profit. 
Daimler said last year that it might meet an adjusted operating profit goal later than 2003, the date set two years ago. The goal is 8.5 billion to 9.5 billion euros ($9.2 billion to $10.3 billion at current exchange rates). 
Daimler, which makes cars, trucks and buses, said it aimed for revenue of 151 billion euros ($163 billion) this year, up 1 percent from 2002, and 163 billion euros ($176 billion) in 2005, with the biggest gains in Asia.
The Chrysler unit posted fourth-quarter operating profit today of 77 million euros ($83.27 million), implying slowing momentum from previous quarters. 
Chrysler reiterated a goal of an operating profit of two billion euros for the year, as it continues to cut costs to offset weak demand. It also said it was counting on new models to help revive its fortunes, after the business broke even sooner than it had predicted. 
The overhaul in the United States includes a 20 percent cut in Chrysler's work force, price savings from suppliers and lower costs at the Mercedes unit and its Japanese partner, Mitsubishi Motors.

Suit Made a Class Action
NEWARK, Feb. 20 (Bloomberg News) -- A federal judge granted class-action status today to a lawsuit accusing DaimlerChrysler of fixing prices on Mercedes-Benz cars in the New York area. 
Judge Alfred M. Wolin, in United States District Court here, ruled that customers who bought or leased new Mercedes-Benz vehicles at 27 New York-area dealers from 1992 to 1999 could proceed with a group case against DaimlerChrysler. The company denied the charges and said it might appeal the class certification.

HEADLINE: Slump Aside, Trade Deficit Hits a Record 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Aided by a surge in December, the trade deficit easily reached a record last year, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, a sign that economic growth around the world remains even weaker than it does in the United States. 
 The value of American goods and services exported to other countries declined for the second consecutive year, as Europe, Japan and South American all cut back on their purchases even though the dollar was losing value. Imports rose, with those from China leading the increase, sending the trade deficit to $435.2 billion in 2002, up from $358 billion in 2001, the report said. 
 The size of December's deficit -- $44.2 billion, up 10 percent from November -- surprised analysts and was among a handful of disappointing economic reports released yesterday. The Standard & Poor 500-stock index lost 8.03 points, or almost 1 percent, to close at 837.10. 
Since the start of the year, "we had a string of hopeful data," said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers. "We're going to see some of that strength fade now."
The number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits rose last week to the highest level since the end of last year, the Labor Department said. A survey by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve suggested that a nascent manufacturing recovery might be slowing. According to the Conference Board, a research group in New York, its index of leading indicators, intended to forecast the economy's near-term movement, dropped slightly, its first decline since September.
In the one sign of economic strength, the Labor Department said the prices that companies received for their goods jumped in January. The report provided more evidence, economists said, that the weak growth was unlikely to cause deflation, a sustained decline in prices of the sort that has recently afflicted Japan.
Since the recession in this country appeared to end in late 2001, the economy has lurched through one cycle after another of hope-inducing growth followed by disappointment. With companies still working through the excesses of the 1990's bubble, and the fear of an Iraq war now compounding public uncertainty, the strong periods have yet to last long enough for executives to add many new workers.
"We got off to a surprisingly good start this year," said Maury Harris, chief North American economist at UBS Warburg. Now, however, "we've got this environment of heightened caution," he said.
The end of the decade-long expansion has caused the dollar to lose about 15 percent of its value relative to the euro since late 2000. But even if the United States seems more vulnerable than it did in the late 90's, it remains economically stronger than its closest rivals, and the currency decline has not been large enough to lower the trade deficit.
Instead, the current account deficit, which includes profits on investments as well as trade in goods and services, was equivalent to about 5 percent of the American economy last year, its largest share ever, according to UBS Warburg.
"The U.S. has a 100-pound pack on its back that it's hauling around -- the global economy," Mr. Harris of Lehman Brothers said. "It's a big demand on an economy that's not all that strong to begin with."
The decline in exports was broad based in 2002. American companies sold less industrial equipment, fewer telecommunications services, less meat, less newsprint, less tobacco and fewer books to othercountries than they had in 2001. 
At the same time, foreign companies increased their sales of consumer items in the United States -- including oil, television sets, appliances, wine and baked goods -- to offset a decline in the sales of products like chemicals and aircraft engines.
American computer makers particularly struggled to keep up with foreign rivals. While computer exports fell 12.6 percent, to $9.2 billion, imports jumped 27.6 percent, to $16.2 billion. 
Over all, the United States had its biggest trade deficit with China, followed by the European Union, Japan and Canada. 
Most economists consider large trade deficits to be unsustainable. Eventually, they say, the dollar will probably decline by enough to make American exports more affordable. 
That would help manufacturing industries -- which have cut two million jobs in the last three years -- compete with foreign companies, Mr. Harris of UBS Warburg said. But it would probably also lead to an increase in inflation and interest rates that could prevent economic growth from reaching the pace it had in the late 90's.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
In Jersey City, Apartments Where Soap Was Made

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY 

 BODY:
Along the Hudson River in Paulus Hook, one of this city's oldest neighborhoods, a new enclave of high-rise apartments and office buildings is taking shape where a soap and toothpaste factory once stood. 
 Several residential projects are also under way elsewhere in Paulus Hook, including 1,000 rental and condominium apartments recently completed, under construction or about to rise. The 105-unit Pier House, a condominium developed by Trammell Crow Residential of Atlanta, is filling with owners, and Metro Homes of Hoboken recently began work on a 32-unit condominium called Liberty Point. 
 The latest components in the 24-acre redevelopment area once occupied by Colgate-Palmolive, the toiletries company, are twin 37-story rental buildings nearing completion with 648 apartments. Fisher Development Associates of Purchase, N.Y., is developing the $100 million project, called Liberty Towers, with Northwestern Mutual Life of Milwaukee, among other partners. 
The apartment towers are rising next to the 1.5-million-square-foot office building that Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, is developing and will mostly occupy on one of the three former Colgate parcels it owns. The Goldman Sachs tower, which at 792 feet and 42 stories would be New Jersey's tallest building when completed as expected next year, will join three office structures totaling 3.3 million square feet in the redevelopment area.
Three million more square feet of office space is planned and four other housing developments, smaller than Liberty Towers, are under way or planned on the former Colgate property.
The 35-block Paulus Hook area juts into Upper New York Bay, and part of it is included on the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places. It is known for its 19th-century brownstones and brick row houses, some predating the Civil War. Nowhere else in Jersey City, said Robert Cotter, the city's planning director, "does an Old World neighborhood sit cheek by jowl with a new one." 
The neighborhood was where the area's first permanent white settler, Michael Paulsen, a Dutch trader, built his home in 1633 and started trading with the Communipaw Indians. It was also the site of a Revolutionary War battle.
Mr. Cotter said Liberty Towers and the Goldman Sachs building were among a small group of "point towers" in the Colgate redevelopment that "will mark the waterfront's western shore, balance the Jersey side of the Hudson with Manhattan and serve as an entrance to New York Harbor."
The neighborhood offers ferry and PATH service to Manhattan as well as light-rail service along the New Jersey side. Brian Fisher, a partner with his father, Lester, in Fisher Development Associates, developers of Liberty Towers, said he hoped that those amenities, as well as the attractions of waterfront living and views, would lure tenants and defy the slack rental market when leasing starts next month. In the last 18 months, rents along the city's waterfront have fallen by 10 to 20 percent, according to the ACI Group, a real estate services firm in Jersey City. 
Fisher Associates, alone or with other partners, has overseen several developments in New Jersey, including a 300-unit residential building in Hoboken. 
To maximize views, the Manhattan architectural firm Gruzen Samton designed the rental towers so their inside facades curve away from one another at their north and south ends, while their outside faces follow a zigzag pattern. The towers, 100 feet apart, sit atop an eight-story base.
"This way there are views from all four sides of the buildings, which look past each other as well as the Goldman Sachs building," said Jordan L. Gruzen, a design partner for the project.
The studio-to-two-bedroom rentals have 685 to 1,190 square feet and high ceilings. Many also have floor-to-ceiling windows or terraces. 
The base will house the lobby, 24,000 square feet of retail space, seven floors of parking for 800 cars and a pool and health club. Other amenities include a business center and a waterfront park that will be open to the public. 
Brian Fisher said monthly rents would initially be $1,600 to $3,150 for the apartments; penthouses will cost more. He said the partners also own a site south of Liberty Towers, closer to the water, where they plan an eight-story residential building, safeguarding tower residents' views of the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island and Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Nissan Settles Bias Suit by Minority Buyers 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The finance unit of Nissan Motor has reached a tentative settlement with black and Hispanic car buyers who said that the company discriminated against minority customers by charging them higher interest rates.
 Under the terms of the settlement, the carmaker's finance unit, the Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, will offer preapproved loans to hundreds of thousands of current and potential black and Hispanic Nissan owners, and will limit how much it raises the interest charged to car buyers above the company's minimum acceptable rate. The finance unit will also contribute $1 million to America Saves, a nonprofit program that tries to help low-income people save and build wealth. 
 The settlement will also result in the payment of $5,000 to $20,000 to the 10 people named in the class-action lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Nashville. Other car buyers wishing to recover money will still be able to sue N.M.A.C. separately. The finance unit denied any liability or wrongdoing in the settlement.
Lawyers involved would not comment on the proposed settlement, which is subject to approval by Judge Todd J. Campbell of United States District Court in Nashville. A hearing on the settlement is scheduled for Monday.
In the lawsuit resolved by the settlement, the plaintiffs contended that car dealers were more likely to increase, or mark up, the interest rate charged to car buyers who were black or Hispanic. Typically the markup is shared by the lender and the dealer, according to court documents. The plaintiffs also said that the average markup for black and Hispanic car buyers was greater than that for white buyers with similar financial backgrounds.
Nissan's finance unit contended that markups are common and are an important revenue source for car dealers. The company asserted in the proposed settlement that it used a "risk-based pricing system that uses higher rates for higher-risk applicants."
The plaintiffs did not accuse the company of racial bias. Lenders typically do not know the race of car buyers. The Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation determines its interest rate based on a consumer's credit rating, but the company allows car dealers to tack on additional percentage points, and dealers could be biased. The plaintiffs argued that the credit policies and dealer decisions had a disparate impact on blacks and Hispanics. For example, buyers in a higher credit tier may face lower markups, and whites are more likely to be in a higher tier. 
Similar lawsuits have been filed in several states nationwide and it is unclear whether the Nissan settlement will pave the way for similar deals in those cases. The defendants in those other suits include the finance arms of Ford Motor, General Motors, Toyota Motor and DaimlerChrysler, as well as Bank of America and others. In its court filing, N.M.A.C. asserts that it has only 2.5 percent of the market for retail contracts from car dealers.
Under the settlement, for five years the Nissan finance unit will limit the size of the markup to three percentage points above the company's minimum interest rate for buyers in a given credit tier. The markup for longer-term finance agreements and for used vehicles could be no more than two percentage points.
The unit will also set up a program for current customers who are black or Hispanic, and will offer preapproved car loans, with no markup, to at least 50,000 such people over the next five years. 
The company will also screen enough potential black and Hispanic car buyers to offer 625,000 such buyers preapproved markup-free loans over the next five years.

HEADLINE: Seducing the Governors 

 BODY:
After Congress failed to create a national health care plan, Medicaid became the default solution to the crisis of the growing number of uninsured Americans. Expanding Medicaid was a success in terms of meeting a critical need. But the price is now staggering strapped state governments. 
 The Bush administration is responding with an offer of modest help, essentially a loan against future Medicaid payments -- but there is a catch. To get the aid, states must agree to radical changes in their Medicaid plans, which will eventually take the federal government off the hook for some -- and perhaps much -- of its share of the costs. At bottom, Washington wants to limit its long-term responsibility for the only kind of health program many Americans can afford. And it's planning to bribe the governors to go along. This is outrageously unfair. Any federal aid should be made available to all states, even those that want to maintain the current structure of their Medicaid programs. 
 Medicaid was originally intended mainly for poor children and the disabled, but most states have expanded it to include the families of the working poor or near-poor and elderly people who could not afford to fill in the gaps in their Medicare coverage. It grew, almost without notice, into the largest health insurance program in the country. It now covers more people and spends more money than Medicare. The federal government picks up from 50 percent to 77 percent of the tab, depending on a state's per capita income, with state revenues paying for the rest.
Some states are already cutting back on Medicaid in order to save money -- ramping down their already low payments to hospitals and nursing homes, and lopping off people or benefits they added in better times. By one count, about a million low-income people could lose Medicaid coverage under cutbacks already adopted by states or proposed by their governors.
The federal government should be trying to find ways to keep people who would otherwise be uninsured from falling out of the Medicaid program. It makes sense to give states more flexibility to require co-payments, spread their limited resources among a wider group of beneficiaries and pursue cost-saving efforts like encouraging people to use cheaper home health care instead of nursing homes. What Washington should not do is try to sneak out of the federal obligation to support the system. That's what a critical part of the Bush proposal amounts to. Participating states would receive more money than usual for the first seven years, then the sum would drop below normal for the next three years. In the end, the states would be left with a capped annual lump sum that might not rise fast enough to meet need in times of recession.
Most governors are near-frantic with budget worries right now, and some of them might calculate cynically that they will probably not still be in office in seven years when federal aid starts dropping. But the current expanded Medicaid system does not deserve to be dismantled, even over the long run. If it really wants to help, the administration could give Medicaid a much larger infusion of money by simply providing prescription drug coverage for all Medicare recipients, thus relieving Medicaid of paying those costs for the elderly poor.

 For Paul D. Reichmann, it must be a sweet sight, signifying his return to the heights as a real estate developer from the depths of financial distress. Along with his brothers, Mr. Reichmann once realized some of the most outsize real estate visions of recent decades before suffering some of the business's most devastating losses in the early 1990's. 
 The risks Mr. Reichmann took in pursuit of those visions cost him, and others, dearly. He pierced the vertical horizon of the Toronto skyline and set new standards for efficiency in building. He built the four towers of the World Financial Center in New York, breathing life into Battery Park City. 
He went to London and, in 1988, started building Canary Wharf, a hugely ambitious project on the eastern edge of the city, and there his career seemed to end. Poor timing amid the global economic downturn of that era and inadequate transportation left much of the project without paying tenants. Loans came due, and Mr. Reichmann's whole empire crumbled.
"Who were his peers?" asked John E. Zucotti, a former first deputy mayor of New York City who later worked for Mr. Reichmann at Olympia & York, once the world's largest developer. "He said, 'I have a vision, and I'm ready to write a check with a letter of credit behind it.' That's very rare in the development business."
"The biggest weakness," said Mr. Zucotti, now the co-chairman of Brookfield Properties, which descended from Mr. Reichmann's O.& Y., "was perhaps he believed in himself so well that he failed to recognize that the world changed around 1990."
In the Mexico City coda to this story, success is back within Mr. Reichmann's reach.
At 732 feet, Torre Mayor -- meant to evoke Templo Mayor, the religious center of the ancient Aztec world -- eclipses the next tallest building here, the 52-story, 702-foot Petroleos Mexicanos building. But height is merely a starting point. The construction materials and methods are of the highest caliber and expense, which is still uncommon here. The building, almost complete after nearly a decade of costly false starts, is intended as a catalyst for urban renaissance along La Reforma, the wide boulevard where demonstrators hold their political protests almost daily.
In recent days here, Mr. Reichmann has been seen shuffling through the soaring glass lobby, nodding to the construction and maintenance workers and asking questions. He wears dark suits and patternless ties, a yarmulke and tennis shoes. There are bags under his eyes, and he walks with a hunched back.
His re-emergence here as a speculative entrepreneurial developer is complemented by continuing involvement in Canary Wharf, which is now booming, and new footholds in real estate markets in the United States. Torre Mayor is a new epilogue to the story of a self-effacing, patient man who long operated at the outer fringes of the confluence of boldness, timing and luck necessary to succeed in the commercial real estate market.
Mr. Reichmann changed, though, partly because the nature of the real estate business has changed, according to people who have dealt with him from his early days through his re-emergence as a player. 
The contrast is most evident in the structure of his holdings in the United States and Europe, where he has used publicly traded companies to rebuild his portfolio.
"It is more cautious; it is more conservative," said Vinay Kapoor, the chief executive of IPC U.S. Income REIT, a real estate investment trust that is publicly traded in Canada and invests alongside Mr. Reichmann in commercial properties in the United States. "That does not mean that Paul will not look at opportunities and take risks like he did in Mexico."
The publicly traded concerns provide a distribution of risk, but they also require far more disclosure than the closely guarded deals Mr. Reichmann made in the past, when only his brothers and his bankers, if anyone, were privy to his dealings.
"He is still very enthusiastic about the projects he does and has passion, but the world has changed," Mr. Kapoor said. "There aren't developers now like there were in the 1980's."
With his brothers Ralph and Albert, Mr. Reichmann started a floor and tile business in Toronto in the 1950's, parlaying it into a real estate empire that built First Canadian Place, that city's tallest skyscraper, at 72 stories, or 951 feet. In 1988, he completed the four office towers of the World Financial Center.
But Mr. Reichmann then spread his capital into other types of investments, even as he sought to recreate the city-shifting success of the World Financial Center on the docklands three miles from London's traditional financial center, the City. Olympia & York spent $3.5 billion on Canary Wharf, a tract of land then difficult to reach by mass transportation.
Eleven banks took control of Canary Wharf, and they froze the development process. In the spring of 1992, the Reichmanns put Canary Wharf under the protection of a British bankruptcy court, disclosing more than $2 billion in debts to banks around the world. They made bankruptcy filings for sundry operating units in the United States and Canada with total debt of $14.9 billion.
Books were written about the Reichmanns, chronicling their rise and fall.
But while Albert and Ralph retired, Paul Reichmann started investment partnerships.
With Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia; CNA Insurance, controlled by the Tisch family; and Franklin Mutual, Mr. Reichmann organized a consortium that bought Canary Wharf in 1995 for about $:720 million, including $:420 million in equity, eventually turning the development into a publicly traded company in London. He now serves as chairman and holds about 7 percent of the company's shares.
The company estimates that about 42,000 people now work at Canary Wharf, most of them in the financial services business. Of the development's total of 14 million square feet, completed or under construction, 11.5 million are owned by the Canary Wharf Group.
And with the financier George Soros, Mr. Reichmann came to Mexico City in 1993 with three developments in mind. Centro Alameda, a 194,000-square-foot mixed-use public-private venture in the historic downtown, was eventually sold to the city for a public plaza. About 30 acres in the southwestern Santa Fe area were eventually resold as raw land. Mr. Soros dissolved the partnership in 1995.
By then, even Torre Mayor seemed ruined. Mr. Reichmann purchased the 1.7-acre site for $25 million, including relocating existing businesses, in 1994 -- a time when the North American Free Trade Agreement was opening borders and attracting companies and investors. But then, from December 1994 to April 1995, the value of the peso fell 45 percent.
The project stalled, and the money already spent was simply gone. But Mr. Reichmann was not in debt. There is no such thing as a construction loan here. Buildings are developed with cash, and loans are put in place only when a tower is proved to be profitable, or at least existent.
But persistent marketing to international companies seeking to consolidate their offices has helped salvage the project, as did, paradoxically, the recent downturn in the United States economy, which made quality materials available at less expensive prices.
All told, the tower has cost about $250 million, and completing the leasing at profitable rates will be a challenge, brokers here say.
"He needs a lot of guts to do something like that, the size of that," said Victor Manuel Lachica Bravo, president of Cushman & Wakefield de Mexico, a real estate services concern. "But nobody thought the economy was going to be so weak."
Mr. Reichmann has sold about 30 percent of Torre Mayor to private investment funds in the United States, and he has secured a $90 million loan from Scotia Bank using Torre Mayor as collateral.
Asked what he hoped would be his legacy, Mr. Reichmann said through Mr. Kapoor that he had not thought about it, offering as proof the fact that he has not named his buildings after himself.
"Hopefully, in each city, they will last a long time and be meaningful for the city," he said through Mr. Kapoor.
In the United States, through his partnership with IPC, a Canadian real estate investment trust, he has bought interests in 1.35 million square feet of office space in Philadelphia, Cleveland and Lexington, Ky.
With the other two Mexico projects abandoned -- sold at a modest profit instead of gambled upon -- Mr. Reichmann now spends much of his time in Britain, where Canary Wharf is 80 percent complete. Current annual rents are around $65 to $80 a square foot, about $8 less than for rents in the City. It is also responsible to public shareholders, leaving Torre Mayor as the last of Mr. Reichmann's big gambles.
"Maybe it's tempered, but he's still capable of believing in himself," Mr. Zucotti said. "To lose a fortune of that size and dimension and come back from it is truly remarkable."

HEADLINE: Our New Hydrogen Bomb 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: MESA, Ariz. 

 BODY:
To understand how we might bolster our national security aside from invading Iraq, I'm on a General Motors test track here in Arizona, driving the coolest car you've never seen.
 It's called Hy-wire, and it's a one-of-a-kind prototype: a four-door sedan fueled by hydrogen, capable of speeds of 100 miles an hour, whisper-quiet, and emitting no pollution at all -- only water vapor as exhaust. It looks like a spaceship, with glass all around and no pedals or steering wheel. 
 Jeff Wolak, the engineer who travels with Hy-wire and mothers it, explained that it is drive-by-wire, controlled by electronics and computers rather than cables and hydraulics. To accelerate, you rotate the handgrips. To steer, you move the grips up or down. 
Then Mr. Wolak tells me to drive the $5 million prototype. He is in the passenger seat and picks up what looks like a computer game console that he rests on his lap.
"It's a second set of controls with an emergency brake," he explains brightly. "We only have one of these vehicles, and we don't want to risk it getting in a crash."
And he hadn't even seen me drive. 
On the vast track, the Hy-wire zipped about flawlessly. It turns sharply, brakes smoothly and accelerates easily -- all almost noiselessly. It's all you would expect of a $5 million car. And if a driver crosses to England, he could press a button and the driving controls would whirr over to the right front seat. 
Likewise, each driver of a family car could have a different steering mechanism. "It could be a joystick for the 20-something generation who are used to computer games, or a steering wheel for the older set used to a Cadillac," said Timothy Perzanowski, a G.M. engineer.
In short, hydrogen fuel cells are not necessarily a distant dream. Toyota, Honda and BMW also are churning out hydrogen prototypes. General Motors is talking about having the Hy-wire in showrooms by 2010 and selling a million hydrogen vehicles by 2015. 
"We see fuel cells as the first technology that has come along in 100 years that has the potential of competing with the internal combustion engine," said Scott Fosgard, a G.M. official involved in hydrogen cars. "We're doing this because we're going to make a boatload of money."
Mr. Fosgard says that eventually, hydrogen cars will have significant advantages: "What does it cost in New York for a parking space? Maybe $500 a month? Well, imagine if the parking garage paid you, because while it's parked there it's producing electricity that is sold back to the grid." 
This may be pie in the sky, of course. For example, it's true that hydrogen vehicles can generate electricity while parked, but the cost of producing it might be prohibitive.
History is littered with other energy technologies that fell flat: synthetic fuels, biomass, nuclear fusion, solar, electric vehicles. Hydrogen cars still face technical hitches, as well as the central challenge: how to cut costs. Carlos Ghosn, the head of Nissan, has joked that fuel cell cars would carry a sticker price of about $700,000.
Moreover, getting the hydrogen can be a problem and can produce greenhouse gases. Hydrogen does not exist on its own but is locked up in water and fossil fuels. The goal is to use wind energy to pluck hydrogen from water in the ocean, but in the near term it's more likely that the hydrogen will come from natural gas. 
The bottom line is that President Bush was dead right last month to offer $1.7 billion to boost hydrogen technology, although it would help if the White House also promoted high-mileage hybrid cars for the present. The government could also do more, by deregulating commercial power supply by fuel cells and by encouraging fleet purchases of hydrogen vehicles. 
What does any of this have to do with Iraq? 
Hydrogen cars are a reminder that there is more than one way to ensure our supplies of energy in the years ahead, even if invading Iraq and investing in hydrogen address the issue on very different time horizons. Nonetheless, I have to say that waging war seems a reflex, pushing toward a hydrogen economy a vision.
As Mr. Fosgard of G.M. put it only half-jokingly: "I don't want to say that this car will eliminate war, but we might not have wars for energy anymore. We'd have to find different reasons to go to war."

F.C.C. Leaves Most Rules On Network Leasing in Place
A divided Federal Communications Commission largely left in place rules that are meant to foster local competition by requiring the four regional Bell companies to lease their local networks to their rivals at low prices set by state regulators. But in a compromise, the agency relieved the companies of their obligation to give rivals low-cost access to many elements of their high-speed Internet networks.
 While the impact, if any, on consumers may take months to become evident and could vary widely from state to state, the decision was a stinging defeat for the agency's Republican chairman, Michael K. Powell, and a disappointment for the Bell companies. Page A1.

Land-Line Rules in a Wireless World

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
In fits and starts, local telephone competition has taken hold in many parts of the country since the Telecommunications Act of 1996 -- most significantly in New York, the home state of the nation's biggest local phone company, Verizon Communications. 
 And yet, in many ways local competition is taking forms, like the remarkable growth of wireless communications and the emergence of Internet-based telephone systems, that were beyond the imagination of many policy makers of the mid-1990's. 
 That is why, for all the lobbying devoted to it, the compromise effort yesterday by the Federal Communications Commission to fine-tune the 1996 rules for competition may prove steadily less relevant in the coming years. 
The fact is, even as more local telephone lines have been claimed by the Bells' competitors in recent years -- 11 percent by the middle of last year -- the actual number of local phone lines in the nation has been edging down, as consumers and businesses adopt wireless phones and other alternatives. 
In 2001, for the first time since the Depression, the overall number of local access lines declined, falling by half a percent from the previous year, to 191.7 million lines. Last year, it fell again, to 189.1 million. 
And so rather than being preoccupied with the tug of war over access to their local phone networks, some analysts say, the local Bell companies like Verizon, SBC Communications and BellSouth are likely to focus more on ways to fend off competitors that do not need the Bells' phone lines at all. Increasingly, that means the Bells will need to offer consumers bundles of services like local, wireless, long-distance and fast Internet links.
"Over time, the real battle will be waged between the Bells and the companies that harness the Internet into a competitive force for providing voice and other services," said Blair Levin, a telecommunications analyst at Legg Mason, who was a chief of staff at the F.C.C. during the Clinton administration.
But yesterday's action was far from moot, because the regulatory framework that the commission largely upheld has proved to be a moderately effective way of fostering competition for local phone service. 
In 1999 competitors of the Bells controlled only about 4 percent of the nation's local telephone lines, according to the F.C.C. By the end of last June, the F.C.C. says, about 11 percent of the nation's local lines were served by the Bells' rivals. 
The competition varies greatly from state to state, though. Fifteen, including Arkansas, New Mexico and North Dakota, have negligible local competition. New York, meanwhile, leads the nation, with about 25 percent of its local lines operated by competitors; followed by Michigan, with 18 percent; Illinois, with 17 percent; and Texas, with 16 percent.
The wide variations partly explain why the decision may have different impacts on the various Bell companies. Another factor is the varied level of success the Bells have had in offering long-distance service in different states -- an expansion of their businesses that the 1996 act allowed in exchange for giving competitors access to local phone networks.
Verizon, the dominant telephone provider in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic region, has had the most success among the Bells in signing up long-distance customers. Verizon now provides long-distance service in more than 10 million homes. That puts it ahead of Sprint as the nation's third-largest long-distance provider, although Verizon still trails Sprint, WorldCom and AT&T in revenue per long-distance customer.
SBC sharply criticized yesterday's F.C.C. action. The company has had less success winning regulatory approval to provide long-distance service and it faces the largest potential threat to its local business because its coverage area includes states like Michigan, Illinois and Texas, where local competition is relatively robust. 
"This decision allows the giant long-distance companies to continue cherry-picking the highest-margin customer without providing any benefits to the average consumer," said William Daley, president of SBC, the second-largest local phone company after Verizon. 
To be sure, just two companies, the long-distance carriers AT&T and WorldCom, accounted for 70 percent of the total revenue companies made last year from competing locally with the Bells, according to Raul L. Katz, a vice president at the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton. 
Over all, according to Booz Allen, competitors had $14.7 billion in revenue from their local phone operations last year compared with $118 billion at the Bells, illustrating the extent to which the largest companies still control most of the industry. 
But the Bells say they have reason to worry. "The rules discussed by the F.C.C. today are not the only necessary means for people to compete with us," said Eric Rabe, a Verizon spokesman. "The industry is seeing a large shift in voice traffic from traditional land lines, mainly to wireless but also to cable." 
About 3 percent of telephone users have made cellphones their primary phones, and that figure is expected to climb, according to the Yankee Group, a telecommunications consulting firm in Boston. 
Because Verizon and SBC are big wireless players -- Verizon Wireless is the largest cellular provider and SBC is a partner with BellSouth in a big cellular carrier, Cingular Wireless -- the trend is effectively cannibalizing the Bells' existing fixed-line voice service with wireless alternatives that are more costly to provide and ultimately less profitable. 
Another competitive threat to the Bells comes from companies that provide voice service over the Internet-based networks. This group includes small companies like Vonage, of Edison, N.J., which provides relatively inexpensive voice service over high-speed Internet connections, and larger companies like Cox Communications, which provides telephone service over its cable television lines.
Indeed Cox surprised people in the telecommunications industry last week when it announced that its number of voice subscribers had risen by 58 percent in 2002, to more than 718,000. Cox, which has invested heavily in voice-over-cable, said that more than 30 percent of its customers in its two oldest markets now get their phone service from the company: 97,944 voice customers in Orange County, Calif., and 94,942 in Omaha.
Such erosion of the Bells' core business helps explain why investors have been concerned of late with the prospects of the Bells and their equipment providers like Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks. The Bells' spending accounts for about two-thirds of the overall telecommunications equipment market.
Even the partial victory the F.C.C. handed to the Bells yesterday, exempting their high-speed Internet, or broadband, services from the competitive network-access rules, was not enough to buoy shareholders. The share prices of the three largest Bell companies, Verizon, SBC and BellSouth, each declined yesterday to their lowest levels in five months. The shares of the fourth Bell, Qwest Communications, also fell sharply.
"Despite all the noise about the future, it's voice and not broadband that remains at the core of the Bells' business," said Scott Cleland, an analyst with the Precursor Group, a research firm in Washington. "That's why we just got farther away from a telecoms recovery."

HEADLINE: Port Authority's New Budget Reflects the Straitened Times 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey yesterday approved a $5 billion expense and capital budget not much larger than last year's, reflecting the region's flagging economy and the new security and rebuilding demands on the agency since the attack on the World Trade Center.
 The budget for calendar 2003 calls for spending $500 million more than last year's, an increase that is accounted for largely by the one-time reimbursement that the bistate agency expects to receive this year from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the insurers of the trade center, which the Port Authority owned. Agency officials said the increase could be used for capital projects like airport security and rebuilding the PATH station at the trade center site. 
 The Port Authority is trimming the sails somewhat on the five-year capital program it announced two years ago. Several signaling projects for the PATH system will be delayed, as will design and preliminary construction work on a new bridge near the Goethals Bridge.
Still, the authority chairman, Jack G. Sinagra, said the new budget "demonstrates the agency's continued resilience and determination to fulfill its commitments to the public."
The plan does not raise bridge and tunnel tolls or PATH fares.
The budget includes some spending plans. The agency will reduce its reserves by $260 million and spend that cash on capital programs, including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's redevelopment of the Farley Building and Pennsylvania Station in Midtown, the purchase of bilevel cars for New Jersey Transit, and the addition of barrier-free E-ZPass lanes at the Hudson River crossings that the agency operates.
To reassure the financial markets that the Port Authority remained financially strong, it decided last year to put more than was required into a reserve fund covering its outstanding $7.2 billion in bonds. The decision to resume normal payments into those reserves suggests that agency financial planners feel the markets are satisfied. 
The budget gave few clues to what is happening in the negotiations between the authority and New York City over the future of La Guardia Airport and Kennedy International Airport, which are operated by the Port Authority under leases with the city. The airports have figured in proposals that the city trade title to the land at the airports for clear title from the Port Authority to the site of the World Trade Center. In addition, extending the agency's lease to operate the airports has figured in an effort by Gov. George E. Pataki to provide budget relief for New York City. 
Similar relief was provided to Newark last year in a large payment in exchange for extending the Port Authority's operating lease for Newark Liberty International Airport. The port agency's budget includes some $350 million that Charles McClafferty, chief financial officer, called a "place holder" for what the city could receive if a lease extension agreement was reached. 
Governor Pataki had suggested that $500 million might be a reasonable lump sum payment to the city for such an extension, and Charles A. Gargano, the Port Authority vice chairman, said he was sure that the agency could find that amount if the governor insisted and the city agreed.

HEADLINE: Pataki Using Budget Tactic He Scorned 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
In 1996, in his second year in office, the Republican governor, George E. Pataki, signaled a memorable turnabout in New York's financial habits by renouncing the use of nonrecurring revenues that his Democratic predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, had come to rely on to balance the state's books during crisis.
 A year later, Mr. Pataki warned the Democrats in the Assembly not to "repeat the mistakes of the past," saying $7.7 billion in so-called "one-shot fiscal gimmicks" were implemented from 1989 through 1994. 
 A serious question, then, has arisen in the Capitol about what the first-term Mr. Pataki would make of his third-term incarnation: a governor who relies heavily on nonrecurring revenues to help fix New York's worst financial mess since the Great Depression. 
According to an analysis of the governor's recent budget proposal by State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, Mr. Pataki has called for a total of $9.3 billion worth of nonrecurring savings and sources of revenue in the fiscal year that ends March 31 and the new one that begins April 1. The figure includes one-time infusions of cash, like selling state property, drawing down reserves that will not be available again, and transferring lumps of cash between state agencies and accounts.
Breaking it down, the governor has called for $5.92 billion worth of one-shots this year ($4 billion of which the Legislature has enacted already), and $3.33 billion more in the coming fiscal year, according to Mr. Hevesi.
So far, Sheldon Silver, the Democratic leader of the Assembly, has refused to approve the centerpiece of Mr. Pataki's package of nonrecurring revenue, a plan to borrow some of the $12 billion the state is owed after a court settlement with tobacco companies. In his budget, the governor proposed using $1.5 billion of the tobacco money for recurring costs in the current fiscal year and $2.3 billion more next fiscal year. Mr. Silver has said he wants to consider the entire budget and array of gap-closing solutions at once, not piecemeal.
Today, as a small group of demonstrators protested Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts to school aid when he opened a community development office in Inwood, Manhattan, the governor vowed to pass a balanced budget this year. Because of the Assembly's reluctance to pass the tobacco borrowing, Mr. Pataki said, certain discretionary payments would be delayed.
In recent years, the state has paid some of its bills in February or March, earlier than legally required, state officials said. Now it will delay them until April or May, the legal deadline, said the officials, who declined to specify which payments would be delayed.
Aides said that Mr. Pataki still wanted to use the tobacco money to close the budget gap, and that he has not stopped imploring Mr. Silver to act quickly. Even if his use of the tobacco money were approved today, it would take 10 weeks for the money to reach the state treasury, after the budget deadline, they said.
"I think the message today that we are going to have to delay these payments is certainly a message of gravity of the importance that we pass this legislation," said Lisa Dewald Stoll, a spokeswoman for the governor.
Altogether, Mr. Pataki has had to contend with a shortfall of roughly $18 billion since last year, as tax collections have continued to fall in the weak economy.
What remains is an $11.5 billion gap, including $2.2 billion in this fiscal year and $9.3 billion in the next year, according to Mr. Pataki. 
Many lawmakers and lobbyists, and nearly every fiscal analyst, say, however, that relying on one-time revenue sources is abhorrent, just as the governor himself sternly asserted in his first term.
Indeed, Mr. Pataki's budget proposal in 1996, his second, reported that it would reduce the reliance on such one-shots in the state's general fund to just $123 million.
"This stands in sharp contrast to the record level of one-shots used over the last decade, which totaled as much as $1.9 billion in one single year," that budget said.
The $7.7 billion of his predecessor's one-shots over five years that Mr. Pataki cited in a March 25, 1997, press release is actually less than what he is proposing now in a two-year period.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Cuomo said: "He condemned one-shots, and now he is proposing the mother of all one-shots; and he has beaten me on one-shots. The things he condemned, he proved to be more guilty of by his own definition of what is condemnable."
Officials in the Pataki administration did not dispute Mr. Hevesi's figures but pointed out that Mr. Pataki had accumulated more than $2 billion in an unrestricted rainy-day fund to prepare for just such economic downturns. 
"The governor's fiscally responsible budgeting practices brought New York back from the brink of fiscal disaster in 1995, revitalized our economy, created hundreds of thousands of new jobs and earned the state its strongest credit rating in 24 years," said an administration official, Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the Division of the Budget. 
"It is a proven record that speaks for itself," he said. "At the same time, in spite of the tremendous fiscal challenges New York is facing, both Fitch and Standard & Poor's last week affirmed the state's credit rating."
While avoiding new taxes, Mr. Pataki also has not proposed a significant cut in state spending.
According to E. J. McMahon, a Manhattan Institute analyst, if New York had begun restraining spending earlier, when the Wall Street markets first began to decline in the summer of 2000, the need for one-shots now would be reduced.
Mr. McMahon said he was not opposed to one-shots if, over time, expenses and revenue balance. Mr. Pataki has said the one-shots are a bridge to that fiscal goal. Mr. McMahon disagreed, saying, "They are much more of a stop-gap than a permanent solution."
As evidence, he said, the state can already see real problems ahead, with a budget gap of $2.9 billion already forecast for fiscal year 2004-5, and of $4.2 billion in the following year.
In an analysis, Mr. McMahon said New York's increases in spending from state funds has far outpaced the rate of inflation since 2000. That spending rose by 8.8 percent in 2001, when the inflation rate was 3 percent; it rose by 5.2 percent in 2002, when the inflation rate was 2.5 percent; and it is on track to rise by 3.5 percent this year, while inflation is at 2.7 percent, he said. 
If spending from state funds had kept pace with inflation, New York would now be spending $4.8 billion less, Mr. McMahon said.
Before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which further rocked the state economy, Mr. Pataki proposed a 4.9 percent spending increase from state funds and battled with the Legislature to keep it down to that level. 
Nationally, officials in the Pataki administration said, the state's annual average spending increase since the governor took office in 1995 is far below the annual average in 49 other states. They said the average of annual spending from all funds rose 4.3 percent in New York but 6.3 percent in other states.
Still, Robert A. Kurtter, senior vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, a Wall Street bond-rating agency, said New York was financing its current gap with one-shots in the hope that revenue growth would meet expenses in the future.
"But the rapid revenue growth of the late 1990's will not reoccur as it had before, in federal, state or city coffers," he said. "And in our view, relying on this growth to solve the problem is a risky strategy."
Mr. Kurtter said that was one reason New York State's general obligation bond rating was A2, according to Moody's scale, the lowest among the states and tied with California and Louisiana.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: STRATEGY; 
U.S. SEEKS 9 VOTES FROM U.N. COUNCIL TO CONFRONT IRAQ

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN with FELICITY BARRINGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
The United States and Britain have decided that their strategy in the United Nations will be to try to persuade 9 of the 15 members of the Security Council to back a new resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, and then to challenge France, Russia or China to veto the will of the Council's majority, administration officials said today.
 American and British officials worked today to settle their differences over the resolution's language while refining it to attract the support of other Council members. Administration officials said the talks meant the resolution would not be introduced until next week, possibly on Monday. 
 One point of disagreement was a desire by British diplomats to include in the resolution an explicit deadline for Iraq to disclose its weapons and start disarming, administration officials said.
The strategy reflects an evolution in the two countries' thinking. A month or so ago, they were still hoping for unanimous Council approval. 
Some officials involved in the discussions argued that a resolution approved by a divided Council -- with those nations holding veto power abstaining -- would be viewed by the world as so weak that it might be preferable to go to war without any resolution at all.
In the last few weeks, however, administration officials have concluded that a resolution with a weak majority would still have authority. 
The United States has often been on the other side of an uneven vote, and has exercised its veto. One notable case was in 1996 when the United States stood alone, 14-1, against another term for Boutros Boutros-Ghali as secretary general.
The Security Council today put off until March 7 the next report by Hans Blix, the chief United Nations inspector for chemical and biological weapons. An administration official said the British wanted the resolution to make refer to the presentation as the last chance for Iraq to avoid war.
Part of the discussion this week, diplomats said, concerned how to win over six wavering Council members, known informally as "the middle six" -- Angola, Guinea, Cameroon, Mexico, Chile and Pakistan -- countries that do not command a great deal of diplomatic attention, as a rule. They are nonpermanent members, along with Bulgaria, Germany, Spain and Syria.
The six countries "are really feeling the heat, and they're going to be feeling even more heat in coming days," said an administration official. "On the other side, the French and Germans are turning up the pressure, too."
It takes nine votes to pass a resolution, and the United States and Britain have only Bulgaria and Spain on their side. The permanent members, with veto power, are the United States, Britain, Russia, France and China. If any of them vote no, the resolution is killed. 
The strategy is to try to get Russia, France and China to acquiesce by abstaining, perhaps under pressure, if there is a base of 9 or 10 votes in favor. But many in the administration concede that this would be extremely difficult.
Meanwhile, the administration remained unable to close a deal with Turkey on approval for American troops to open a northern front against Iraq from its territory in the event of a war. Some in the administration said they were pessimistic that an accord could be reached, whereas others expressed incredulity that Turkey would turn down an American offer of $26 billion in aid.
There was some confusion even about the nature of the disagreement. At the State Department, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said he expected to hear from Turkey tonight on whether it would go along with the deal.
In Ankara, Prime Minister Abdullah Gul said Turkey would make its position known on Friday.
Another point of disagreement was over the terms demanded by Turkey. American officials said Turkey wanted more money than the $6 billion in grants and $20 billion in loan guarantees it has been offered. But there were also signs that Turkey wants oil concessions in Iraq and more of a role for its troops in the northern region of the country.
At the United Nations, the current draft of the resolution would declare Iraq in "further material breach" of its obligations to disclose its weapons and disarm, and would declare further that there would be "serious consequences."
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British ambassador, was due to meet with all 10 nonpermanent members of the Security Council on Friday.
France, meanwhile, has not been relaxing. In Paris, French officials met with leaders of several African countries, including Angola, Guinea and Cameroon, and they issued a statement endorsing the French position on the issue.
Specifically, the statement called on Iraq to disarm and supported "the continuation of the inspections and the substantial enhancement of their human and technical capabilities."
Both the French and Germans on one side and the British and Americans on the other say that they are not using economic leverage on the nonpermanent members, but many diplomats at the United Nations say that the sizable aid programs provided by the big powers are weighing heavily in the discussions.
The Bush administration continued to hope today that by the end of next week, inspectors in Iraq will come back with a list of tasks that Iraq has refused to carry out. They include refusal to destroy missiles, refusal to allow reconnaissance flights without sufficient warning time to move incriminating evidence, and most important, the refusal to allow private interviews of scientists.
President Bush, while campaigning in Georgia for his economic program, said Iraq was "throwing away" its last chance to disarm voluntarily, and he implied again that the time for using force was approaching.
A separate part of the administration's strategy has been based on the hope, and in many quarters an expectation, that Mr. Blix will be more specific than he has been in the past concerning Iraqi noncooperation when he reports again in March.
The main "tasks" before Iraq, as the administration calls them, are unfettered interviews with scientists, unimpeded flights by reconnaisance aircraft and the destruction of rockets.
"Iraq has provided the United Nations with nothing," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. "Private interviews with inspectors have dried up. Iraq has insisted on a 48-hour advance notification of the U-2 flights, making U-2 spy missions, designed to determine what is happening, predictable."
United Nations officials said Mr. Blix was preparing to send a letter to the Iraqi government on Friday that was expected to contain a demand for the destruction of its Al Samoud 2 missiles, which he said last week have a range beyond the 92-mile limit set by the United Nations.
In his report last week, Mr. Blix asked that the Iraqis provide additional names of scientists who had been involved in the destruction of biological weapons and those who had worked on missiles. In the last two days inspectors in Baghdad were given such lists, a spokesman for Mr. Blix said.
Sir Jeremy has told his colleagues that the Council was entering its "endgame" phase, said one diplomat with whom Sir Jeremy had spoken.
The diplomat noted that the wavering nations are under many conflicting pressures but distilled these to a simple choice: "People hate Saddam Hussein," the diplomat said. "But people hate war more than they hate Saddam Hussein."

HEADLINE: TriBeCa Film Fest, Take 2, Planned for May 

 BODY:
The TriBeCa Film Festival, initiated in part to rejuvenate Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks, will return in the spring, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday, citing its successful inaugural effort last May.
 The festival, created by Robert De Niro, Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff, is scheduled to run from May 3 to 11, four days longer than last year. 
It will include the premieres of more than 200 feature films, documentaries and film shorts; last year's event included 150. 
 "We're going to do it again," Ms. Rosenthal said. "We're going to do it bigger and hopefully even better."
Kevin Spacey announced the creation of an award for a new filmmaker, to be given at the festival by his production company's Web site, TriggerStreet.com, and by Budweiser.
The mayor said that last year's events brought more than 150,000 people into TriBeCa; they filled 3,600 hotel rooms south of Canal Street, hailed 78,000 cabs and consumed 90,000 meals in downtown restaurants during the festival.
"It was a huge boost for the New York economy and sent the message that New York City was once again open for business and a top tourist destination," Mr. Bloomberg said at a City Hall news conference.
The festival will also feature a filmmakers' forum, a rock and comedy concert and a series of family events. 
Mr. De Niro, a man of a few words, said a few words: "This neighborhood is my home. I'm committed to it, and that's what this festival is all about."

HEADLINE: Frustrations for South American Oil 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
With crude prices edging toward $40 a barrel and a shortfall looming in world production, South America's two main oil producers, Petrobras of Brazil and the Spanish-owned Repsol YPF of Argentina, might be forgiven for spotting a silver lining among the clouds of war gathering over Iraq. 
 Remote from the potential combat zone and convenient to the United States, both companies could find ready buyers for stepped-up oil exports and give the economies of their home countries a welcome injection of fresh petrodollars. 
 But in fact, analysts say, neither company can expect to reap a windfall, because of economic volatility, changing government regulations and growing political pressure to keep a lid on fuel prices at home. 
Energy analysts say a war in Iraq and the continuing instability in Venezuela could combine to depress world daily oil production by 3.5 million barrels, to about 73 million barrels. Most OPEC nations are already running close to full capacity, so the shortfall would have to be made up by non-OPEC suppliers. 
Increased output in Russia and Norway would probably fill part of the gap; the remainder is where the opportunity lies for Latin producers like Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. 
"Anyone who is producing will benefit from higher prices," said George Beranek, an analyst at PFC Energy in Washington. "Petrobras and YPF will also benefit, provided they can get the world price." 
That last proviso is crucial. 
With the advent on Jan. 1 of a new left-leaning government in Brazil, Petroleo Brasileiro, as Petrobras is formally known, appears likely to lose some of the autonomy it has won over the last decade, especially regarding prices. The Brazilian state owns 56 percent of the voting shares in Petrobras and names its top management.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva made two political appointments that will effectively tame Petrobras: a little-known senator, Jose Eduardo Dutra, will take over the company's presidency from the respected, market-friendly Francisco Gros; and Sergio Gabrielli, an academic economist with little commercial experience, will become chief financial officer. 
Petrobras's refinery prices for fuel are now 23 percent lower than those in the United States, a situation that the company cannot maintain indefinitely. To run its refineries efficiently, it must import some lighter oil to mix with its own heavy crude, and pay the going world rate for the imports.
Mr. Gabrielli said today that Petrobras would "alter prices as soon as possible" but that a recent surge in inflation might prevent the government from allowing any price increases for a while.
Despite its dependence on light-crude imports, Petrobras, Brazil's largest industrial company, has grown rapidly to become an aggressive player in global markets. Last year it was Brazil's top exporter, with much of its success coming in refined products rather than crude. 
In January, it was able to double its exports of gasoline, mainly to the United States, after supplies from Venezuela all but ceased because of a nationwide strike against President Hugo Chavez. 
Petrobras is producing more oil than ever -- 1.62 million barrels a day early this month. According to Fabiana Fantoni, oil analyst at Tendencias, a Sao Paulo-based consultancy, and it has room to expand its exports of 235,000 barrels a day by about 8 percent.
Doing so might bring in $500,000 a day in extra profits, Ms. Fantoni estimated -- "not an extraordinary increase, but it would certainly be good for Brazil's trade balance."
Still, she said, "Petrobras could increase its profits greatly if it kept its pricing at international levels." Though it stepped up production last year, Petrobras posted an 18 percent drop in net profit, to $2.25 billion for 2002. 
After years of trade deficits, Brazil recorded a $13.2 billion surplus last year, offsetting a slide in foreign direct investment, which had financed past deficits.
At the moment, though, tackling inflation seems to be the government's prime concern. The central bank has raised interest rates twice this year, despite Mr. da Silva's campaign pledges for easier credit. 
Unlike Brazil, Argentina is a net oil exporter. But it is still gingerly recovering from a four-year economic slump that broke the Argentine peso loose from its dollar-pegged moorings and upended the country's politics. And like his Brazilian counterpart, President Eduardo Duhalde has pressed his country's oil companies to limit their exports and hold the line on domestic prices to nurture the fragile domestic market. 
So Repsol YPF "can only export a certain part of its production," said Ian Reid, oil analyst at UBS Warburg in London, "and there's a question mark over whether it can pass on price hikes to consumers."
What oil it can ship abroad does not earn the company what it might: there is a 20 percent tax on exports, and regulations saying that at least 30 percent of export revenue must be brought back to Argentina to be spent or invested.
At one point, the central bank thought the figure should be 100 percent. According to an official at another oil company in Buenos Aires, there is widespread concern in the industry that the economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, wants to increase the export tax rate now that world crude prices are above $35 a barrel. 
In January, Argentine oil companies reached an agreement with the government to freeze prices for three months and to supply crude to Argentine refineries at $28.50 a barrel, well below the current world price. Repsol YPF has been leading the oil sector's negotiations with the government.

HEADLINE: A Last Chance to Stop Iraq 

BYLINE:  By Kenneth M. Pollack; Kenneth M. Pollack, a former analyst of the Iraqi military at the C.I.A., is a fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and author of "The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the Bush administration set to put a resolution on Iraq before the United Nations Security Council next week, those opposed to war will rally around the notion that Saddam Hussein can be deterred from aggression. They will continue to say that the mere presence of United Nations inspectors will prevent him from building nuclear weapons, and that even if he were to acquire them he could still be contained.
 Unfortunately, these claims fly in the face of 12 years -- and in truth more like 30 years -- of history. 
 Observers have a very poor track record in predicting the progress of the Iraqi nuclear weapons program. In the late 1980's, the nuclear experts of the American intelligence services were convinced that the Iraqis were at least 5 and probably 10 years away from having a nuclear weapon. For its part, the International Atomic Energy Agency did not even believe that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program. After the 1991 Persian Gulf war, United Nations inspectors found that not only did Iraq have a program far more extensive than anyone had realized, but it was also less than two years away from producing a weapon. 
Four years later, the international agency was so certain that it had eradicated the Iraqi nuclear program that it wanted to end aggressive inspections in favor of passive "monitoring." Then a slew of defectors came out of Iraq -- including Hussein Kamel al-Majid, the son-in-law of Saddam Hussein who led the Iraqi program to build weapons of mass destruction; Wafiq al-Samarrai, one of Saddam Hussein's intelligence chiefs; and Khidhir Hamza, a leading scientist with the nuclear weapons program. These defectors reported that outside pressure had not only failed to eradicate the nuclear program, it was bigger and more cleverly spread out and concealed than anyone had imagined it to be.
In the late 1990's, American and international nuclear experts again concluded that the Iraqi nuclear program was dormant: yes, the scientists were still working in teams; yes, they still had all of the plans; and yes, they probably were hiding some machinery -- but they were not making any progress. Then another batch of important defectors escaped to Europe and told Western intelligence services that after the inspectors left Iraq in 1998, Saddam Hussein had started a crash program to build a nuclear weapon and that the Iraqis had devised methods to hide the effort. 
The reports of these defectors prompted the German intelligence service in 2001 to conclude that Iraq was only three to six years away from having one or more nuclear weapons. Today, the American, British and Israeli intelligence services believe that unless he is stopped, Saddam Hussein is likely to acquire a nuclear weapon in the second half of this decade. 
Even this estimate may be overly optimistic. While it's true that the presence of weapons inspectors does hamper the Iraqis, there are some critical caveats. We simply do not know how close Iraq is to acquiring a nuclear weapon, nor do we know to what extent the inspectors' presence is slowing the Iraqi program. What we do know is that for more than a decade we have consistently overestimated the ability of inspectors to impede the Iraqi efforts and we have consistently underestimated how far along Iraq has been toward acquiring a nuclear weapon.
For all of these reasons the assurances from Mohamed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that he has Iraq's nuclear program well in hand should be less than comforting.
Nor is there reason to be confident about how Saddam Hussein will behave once he has acquired a nuclear weapon. 
He has been anything but circumspect about his aspirations: He has stated that he wants to turn Iraq into a "superpower" that will dominate the Middle East, to liberate Jerusalem and to drive the United States out of the region. He has said he believes the only way he can achieve his goals is through the use of force. Indeed, his half-brother and former chief of intelligence, Barzan al-Tikriti, was reported to say that Iraq needs nuclear weapons because it wants "a strong hand in order to redraw the map of the Middle East."
It is probably true that fear of retaliation kept Iraq from using chemical weapons against coalition forces during the gulf war. However, this should give us little comfort that he will be similarly deterred in the future. Before the 1991 war, Secretary of State James Baker warned his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, that Iraq faced "terrible consequences" if it used weapons of mass destruction, mounted terrorist attacks or destroyed Kuwaiti oil fields. 
Yet despite this warning, Saddam Hussein tried to send terrorist teams to America and did blow up the Kuwaiti oil fields -- he simply gambled on which two of the three things Mr. Baker mentioned were unlikely to result in America ending the regime. (Many officials from that Bush administration have suggested, in fact, that Saddam Hussein didn't even make the right calculation.) 
Proponents of deterrence also argue that since nobody has ever actually tried to deter Saddam Hussein from attacking another country, how can we claim that doing so will be difficult in the future? The example most often cited is the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, where the common wisdom holds that because of the botched messages he received from the American ambassador, AprilGlaspie, Iraq had no reason to believe we would fight. 
In fact, all the evidence indicates the opposite: Saddam Hussein believed it was highly likely that the United States would try to liberate Kuwait, but convinced himself that we would send only lightly armed, rapidly deployable forces that would be quickly destroyed by his 120,000-man Republican Guard. After this, he assumed, Washington would acquiesce to his conquest. 
Much of the evidence for this remains classified, but at least two points can be made using public material: Tariq Aziz has told reporters that this was what Saddam Hussein thought at the time; and we know that when the Republican Guards invaded Kuwait they moved quickly -- even before they had consolidated control over the country -- to set up defenses along Kuwait's borders and against amphibious and airborne landings. 
In other words, Saddam Hussein thinks we tried to deter him, and that we failed. He was ready and willing to fight the United States for Kuwait.
Even that crushing defeat, however, didn't dim his adventurism. Just two years later he attempted to assassinate the emir of Kuwait and former President Bush. This was not a rational act but a meaningless bid for revenge. And he is lucky that the attempts failed. If they had succeeded, there is no question that the United States would have obliterated his regime. 
Then, in October 2000, he dispatched five divisions to western Iraq. All of the evidence available to the American government indicated that, with the acquiescence of Damascus, he intended to move them through through Syria and into the Golan Heights. In response, Washington began preparing a military strike far greater than Desert Fox of 1999 (which itself prompted revolts throughout Iraq for six months), and the Israeli military planned its own crushing response. Only American and Saudi diplomatic intervention with Syria, combined with the Iraqi military's logistical problems, quashed the adventure.
Most ominous today, we have heard from many intelligence sources -- including some of the highest-level defectors now in America and abroad -- that Saddam Hussein believes that once he has acquired nuclear weapons it is the United States that will be deterred. He apparently believes that America will be so terrified of getting into a nuclear confrontation that it would not dare to stop him should he decide to invade, threaten or blackmail his neighbors. 
America has never encountered a country that saw nuclear weapons as a tool for aggression. During the cold war we feared that the Russians thought this way, but we eventually learned that they were far more conservative. Our experts may be split on how to handle North Korea, but they agree that the Pyongyang regime wants nuclear weapons for defensive purposes -- to stave off the perceived threat of an American attack. The worst that anyone can suggest is that North Korea might blackmail us for economic aid or sell such weapons to someone else (with Iraq being near the top of that list). Only Saddam Hussein sees these weapons as offensive -- as enabling aggression. 
Finally, we cannot forget that all evidence has shown Saddam Hussein to be an incorrigible optimist who willfully ignores signs of danger. Consider that on at least five occasions over the last three decades, he has embarked on foreign policy adventures that nearly destroyed him: his attack on Iraq's Kurds in 1974 (which might have ended in an Iranian assault on Baghdad if the shah of Iran had not unexpectedly decided to double-cross the Kurds instead); his invasion of Iran in 1980; his invasion of Kuwait in 1990; his assassination attempt against former President Bush in 1993; and his threatened attack on Kuwait in 1994. In each case, he took a course of action that we know even his closest advisers considered extremely dangerous. 
This is the problem with Saddam Hussein. The assertion that he is not intentionally suicidal may be true, but it is irrelevant. In the end, he has frequently proven inadvertently suicidal.
And he seems to be doing it again. With more than 150,000 American soldiers taking positions on his borders he continues to run the international inspectors in circles, foolishly confident that his minor concessions will stave off an invasion. Is there any other person on earth who wouldn't turn his country inside out to prove that he did not have more weapons of mass destruction? Once again, he seems to be betting his life that the game is not as dangerous as everyone else thinks it is. 
Given Saddam Hussein's current behavior, his track record, his aspirations and his terrifying beliefs about the utility of nuclear weapons, it would be reckless for us to assume that he can be deterred. Yes, we must weigh the costs of a war with Iraq today, but on the other side of the balance we must place the cost of a war with a nuclear-armed Iraq tomorrow.

HEADLINE: With Help From Democrat, Bush Pitches Tax Cut Plan 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: KENNESAW, Ga., Feb. 20 

 BODY:
President Bush picked up the first Democratic endorsement of his $670 billion tax cut plan today, from Senator Zell Miller of Georgia, and then asserted that if a bipartisan Congress did not join in passing his proposal the nation's economy would languish.
 "We have a responsibility to lift up issues beyond the mud pit of politics," Mr. Bush said in a speech to entrepreneurs and business leaders at Harrison High School in the heavily Republican suburbs northwest of Atlanta. 
 Without the tax cuts, the president added, "we could jeopardize the recovery that we long for." 
Although the endorsement by Mr. Miller, who supported Mr. Bush's 2001 tax reductions, was not a surprise, the White House heavily promoted it as part of an increasingly aggressive lobbying and public relations campaign on behalf of the current round of proposed cuts, which have been criticized as extreme and extravagant by some members of Mr. Bush's own party. The president, whose speech here today was his sixth this year on the subject, was the most noticeable salesman among 14 other senior administration officials who are fanning out this week and next to sell the tax cuts in 20 cities across the country.
As Mr. Bush spoke, the White House continued to work closely with business groups on what amounts to a political campaign for the plan. Karl Rove, the president's top political adviser, and Stephen Friedman, the president's chief economic adviser, met recently with more than 60 representatives from corporations and lobbying groups to exhort them to sell the tax cuts.
The group, which calls itself the Tax Relief Coalition, was formed with help from the White House in 2001 to sell the first round of cuts. In the next weeks it plans major advertising, letter-writing campaigns to members of Congress and communications to shareholders about the proposal to eliminate the tax individual investors pay on dividends.
One member of the coalition, Verizon, has already sent its one million shareholders a letter with their recent dividend checks suggesting that "you may wish to express your views on the taxation of dividend income to your representatives in Congress."
Today Mr. Bush took his own hammer to the dividend tax, saying that it was unfair to tax dividends twice, and that 900,000 Georgia residents would benefit from repeal of the tax. Seeking to counter criticism that his plan is heavily weighed toward investors and the rich, Mr. Bush asserted that 60 percent of those Georgia residents "made $75,000 or less in the year 2000."
The president, who spoke nearly an hour, chiefly about the economy, hailed Mr. Miller's endorsement as a celebration of bipartisanship.
"One thing you can be certain of," Mr. Bush said, "he puts his country ahead of the political party. I'm proud to call him friend."
The endorsement by a single Democrat allowed the president to say for the first time that support for his tax cut was bipartisan, a claim his political advisers had been eager for him to make. Today Mr. Bush called his proposal a plan that "members of both parties" recognize as sensible.
Before today, Mr. Miller had remarked favorably on Mr. Bush's tax cut proposals and tax cuts in general, saying, "Like with my grandchildren, I love them all." Democrats had not counted on him in the first place.
Today Mr. Miller agreed to be a co-sponsor of the Bush tax cut plan in the Senate, a gesture that brought the president to Mr. Miller's side in Cobb County as Mr. Bush was en route to his Texas ranch.
Democrats scoffed at Mr. Miller's endorsement in the face of widespread opposition to the Bush plan, including a rebuttal last week from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, on many of the arguments in favor of the cuts.
"The support of one Senate Democrat does not negate the criticism of Chairman Greenspan, the condemnation of 10 Nobel laureates, the unenthusiastic response of dozens of elected Republicans and the unfairness to the majority of Americans," Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. "This plan is still the wrong plan for the country and it is still dead on arrival."
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the most influential senator on tax legislation, said this week that at least two constituents recently told him that they had received the Verizon mailing about the proposed dividend cut. Mr. Grassley, who supports the cut but remains skeptical that he can round up enough votes to pass it, said he expected more such comments from constituents because "there are millions and millions of stockholders" being told to write members of Congress.
"Will it work?" Mr. Grassley said. "I don't know if it will work."

Spending Bill Becomes Law
(By The New York Times)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 -- President Bush today signed the $397 billion spending bill approved by Congress last week, which will finance government operations through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Mr. Bush complained that the bill did not provide enough money to help state and local emergency personnel prepare for a terrorist attack and that it appropriated $3.3 billion in drought relief that he had not request.

HEADLINE: The Martial Plan 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The Marshall Plan was America's finest hour. After World War I, the victors did what victors usually do: they demanded reparations from the vanquished. But after World War II America did something unprecedented: it provided huge amounts of aid, helping both its allies and its defeated enemies rebuild. 
 It wasn't selfless altruism, of course; it was farsighted, enlightened self-interest. America's leaders understood that fostering prosperity, stability and democracy was as important as building military might in the struggle against Communism. 
 But one suspects that our current leaders would have jeered at this exercise in "nation-building." And they are certainly following a very different strategy today.
It's not that the Bush administration is always stingy. In fact, right now it is offering handouts right and left. Most notably, it has offered the Turkish government $26 billion in grants and loans if it ignores popular opposition and supports the war. 
Some observers also point out that the administration has turned the regular foreign aid budget into a tool of war diplomacy. Small countries that currently have seats on the U.N. Security Council have suddenly received favorable treatment for aid requests, in an obvious attempt to influence their votes. Cynics say that the "coalition of the willing" President Bush spoke of turns out to be a "coalition of the bought off" instead.
But it's clear that the generosity will end as soon as Baghdad falls.
After all, look at our behavior in Afghanistan. In the beginning, money was no object; victory over the Taliban was as much a matter of bribes to warlords as it was of Special Forces and smart bombs. But President Bush promised that our interest wouldn't end once the war was won; this time we wouldn't forget about Afghanistan, we would stay to help rebuild the country and secure the peace. So how much money for Afghan reconstruction did the administration put in its 2004 budget?
None. The Bush team forgot about it. Embarrassed Congressional staff members had to write in $300 million to cover the lapse. You can see why the Turks, in addition to demanding even more money, want guarantees in writing. Administration officials are insulted when the Turks say that a personal assurance from Mr. Bush isn't enough. But the Turks know what happened in Afghanistan, and they also know that fine words about support for New York City, the firefighters and so on didn't translate into actual money once the cameras stopped rolling. 
And Iraq will receive the same treatment. On Tuesday Ari Fleischer declared that Iraq could pay for its own reconstruction -- even though experts warn that it may be years before the country's oil fields are producing at potential. Off the record, some officials have even described Iraqi oil as the "spoils of war." 
So there you have it. This administration does martial plans, not Marshall Plans: billions for offense, not one cent for reconstruction. 
Of course, postwar reconstruction in Europe and Japan wasn't just a matter of money; America can also be proud of the way it built democratic institutions. Alas, the Bush administration's postwar political plans are even more alarming than its economic nonchalance. 
Turkey has reportedly been offered the right to occupy much of Iraqi Kurdistan. Yes, that's right: as we move to liberate the Iraqis, our first step may be to deliver people who have been effectively independent since 1991 into the hands of a hated foreign overlord. Moral clarity! 
Meanwhile, outraged Iraqiexiles report that there won't be any equivalent of postwar de-Nazification, in which accomplices of the defeated regime were purged from public life. Instead the Bush administration intends to preserve most of the current regime: Saddam Hussein and a few top officials will be replaced with Americans, but the rest will stay. You don't have to be an Iraq expert to realize that many very nasty people will therefore remain in power -- more moral clarity! -- and that the U.S. will in effect take responsibility for maintaining the rule of the Sunni minority over the Shiite majority.
If this all sounds incredibly callous and shortsighted, that's because it is. But then what did you expect? This administration doesn't worry about long-term consequences -- just look at its fiscal policy. It wants its war; there's not the slightest indication that it's interested in the boring, expensive task of building a just and lasting peace.

HEADLINE: COMMUNICATIONS COMPROMISE: THE OVERVIEW; 
LOCAL PHONE RULES TO STAY IN PLACE

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
A deeply divided Federal Communications Commission today largely left in place rules that are meant to foster local telephone competition by requiring the four regional Bell companies to lease their local networks to their rivals at low prices set by state regulators.
 But in a compromise order, the agency relieved the companies of their obligation to give rivals low-cost access to many of the crucial elements of the Bells' new high-speed Internet networks. News analysis, Page C1. 
 The impact, if any, on consumers may take months to become evident and could vary widely from state to state. Some experts predicted that the changes could lead to rate increases for consumers of high-speed Internet services offered by the telephone companies. 
The decision was a stinging defeat for the agency's Republican chairman, Michael K. Powell, and a disappointment for the Bell companies. The Bells have been lobbying and litigating for years to scrap the rules and had hoped for a definitive repudiation of them in Washington's new deregulatory climate. 
In a partial dissent, Mr. Powell warned that the ruling would sow regulatory confusion, prompt a new wave of litigation and do too little to encourage investment in updating the nation's telephone system. He said the inconsistent approaches of the states and the lawsuits that are bound to challenge the new rules "will take many years and will hardly be the quieting and stabilizing regime that was so craved by a rocky market."
But another Republican commissioner, Kevin J. Martin, who brokered the compromise order by joining the agency's two Democrats on some aspects of it and sided with Mr. Powell and the F.C.C.'s other Republican on other details, said it was vital for consumers that the states continue to play a leading role. He said local regulators needed the flexibility to require the Bells to provide low-cost access to their networks to assure greater competition in many local markets.
"We have crafted a balanced package of regulations to revitalize the industry by spurring investment in next-generation broadband infrastructure while also maintaining access to the network elements necessary for new entrants to provide competitive services," Mr. Martin said.
By removing restrictions on broadband -- or high-speed Internet access -- but not on traditional phone service, the decision was both a partial victory and a partial setback for the four regional Bell companies: BellSouth, Qwest, SBC and Verizon. Those companies' stocks all tumbled yesterday.
Since 1996, the regional companies have been required to give small start-up rivals and large competitors like AT&T and WorldCom access to their local networks at low wholesale prices set by regulators to nurture the fledging competition in traditional local services.
The outcome was denounced by the Bells, which threatened a new round of lawsuits challenging the rules, just as they have in the past. Twice they have succeeded in court challenges, forcing the agency to rewrite the rules, only to be stymied by the F.C.C. They had hoped that the commission today would begin to do away with the wholesale pricing system altogether in favor of a system allowing them to negotiate higher rates directly with their rivals rather than have the lower rates imposed on them by utility regulators in the states.
But in the long-running legal, regulatory and political battle among the various sectors of the telephone industry, the decision today also offered the Bells some important gains. In a partial granting of their wishes, the commission ruled that they no longer needed to provide rivals low-cost access to crucial elements of the new high-speed Internet networks that the Bells have just started to build. 
That provision raised concerns among some Internet access providers, including Covad Communications and its main marketer, EarthLink, and prompted predictions by some experts that the cost of high-speed Internet access services would rise for consumers.
The outcome will now largely be in the hands of state officials. In recent months some states, notably New York and Illinois, imposed cuts that reduced some consumer bills by 20 to 30 percent. 
Executives at the Bell companies expressed bitter disappointment today.
"This is a major setback for the industry," said Thomas J. Tauke, a senior vice president and top lobbyist for the largest Bell company, Verizon, and a former member of Congress. "It's a major setback for investment. It is a major setback for consumers. It is a deterrent to make the investments that would be so important to the economy. The F.C.C. simply blew it."
William M. Daley, a former commerce secretary in the Clinton administration who is now the president of SBC, called the decision "a loss for American consumers, telecom employees and advocates of real reform."
But the ruling was praised by some of the rivals to the Bells.
"We applaud the F.C.C. commissioners who forged a bipartisan compromise to resolve contentious issues that have dogged this industry for more than half a decade," said James W. Cicconi, general counsel of AT&T, which has been actively trying to expand its local business in many states. "While the decision grants the incumbent monopolies far more deregulation than warranted, it also should permit AT&T and other carriers to continue to deliver competitive voice and broadband services." 
The F.C.C.'s move was also endorsed by some equipment manufacturers, including Intel, which are hoping it will encourage the telephone companies to increase their spending to try to improve their networks.
On Capitol Hill, the rules were criticized both by prominent Republicans, many of whom had supported the efforts by the Bells for more complete deregulation, and by Democrats, who opposed the deregulation of broadband services.
"Market forces once again have been shackled by political forces," said Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee. "This marks a low point for the F.C.C."
Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, said the agency had "missed an important opportunity to speak with one voice and to provide the telecommunications industry with greater certainty."
Though Mr. Powell was the F.C.C. commissioner whom President Bush named chairman in 2001, the decision today was a sign of the emergence of Mr. Martin, a former official in the Bush White House, as an influential deal maker at the commission. He said the new set of regulations "achieves a principled, balanced approach."
"It ensures that we have competition and deregulation," Mr. Martin said. "We deregulate broadband, making it easier for companies to invest in new equipment and deploy the high-speed services that consumers desire. We preserve existing competition for local service -- the competition that has enabled millions of consumers to benefit from lower telephone rates. And we continue the strong role of the states in promoting local competition and protecting consumers."
But Mr. Powell, in a strongly worded partial dissent, said that the decision "could prove harmful to consumers in the long run, and I cringe to see their welfare raised on the staff of the majority's decision."
"What is remarkable about today's decision is that one looks in vain to find a clear or coherent federal policy in the choices made by the majority," Mr. Powell said. His dissent is the first by a chairman on a major F.C.C. regulation since 1991. 
Trying to open local telephone markets to greater competition, Congress in 1996 adopted landmark telecommunications legislation that required the regional Bell companies to share their equipment with competitors at relatively low cost. 
The legislation required the federal regulators to determine which elements of the Bells' networks were necessary for rivals to enter the market feasibly and to make those elements available on an individual basis and at low prices.
Regulators ultimately decided to put every element of the network on the list under a rule formally known as the unbundled network elements platform.
Last year a Federal appeals court, in a victory for the Bells, overturned the network rules, prompting today's proceedings. 
But Mr. Powell and others said that today's decision would shift the unending and hugely expensive telephone wars back to the states and the courts. In fact, Mr. Powell's partial dissent virtually invited litigation, accusing the majority of flouting the decision by the appeals court and outlining those areas of the proposal that he said would not withstand legal scrutiny. Dismissing the rules as "Picasso-esque," he predicted that they would lead to legal and regulatory chaos.
"The nation will now embark on 51 major state proceedings to evaluate what elements will be unbundled and made available to the competitive local exchange carriers," Mr. Powell wrote.
"These decisions will be litigated through 51 different federal district courts. These 51 cases will likely be decided in multiple ways -- some upholding the state, some overturning the state and little chance of regulatory and legal harmony among them at the end of the day."
Industry executives, critics and supporters of today's decision also said that it would shift the battleground to the states and the courts.
"The one clear winner in all this is the state public utility commissions, and for everybody else it was a mixed bag," said Royce J. Holland, chairman and chief executive of Allegiance Telecom, a nationwide competitive telephone company based in Dallas. "The second biggest winner here was probably the American Bar Association."

C5) Chart: "Degrees of Competition"The Federal Communications Commission continues to try finetuning the rules that govern the way the nation's dominant local telephone companies sell access to their networks to competitors. Here are two typical approaches to local competition. Structure of the dominant local phone networkThe local phone company owns all elements of the system: the lines into customers' homes and businesses, the central office where traffic is routed, and the network lines to other central offices and customers. Service resellerSome competitors mainly buy access to the local network's customers at wholesale rates and resell the phone company's service at retail prices. Competitor with own equipmentSome bigger competitors have many elements of their own local system like direct lines to their biggest customers and their own switching equipment. This allows the competitor to pocket more money from the customer, while buying fewer services from the local phone company. (Source: Booz Allen Hamilton)(pg. C5)

HEADLINE: An Arab Gadfly With a Memorable Bite 

BYLINE:  By ADAM SHATZ 

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
If you can judge a man by the company he keeps, you can also judge him by the enemies he makes. And Mohammed Harbi, Algeria's most renowned intellectual, has certainly made some formidable enemies. Over the last decade, his writings on Algerian history and politics have landed him death threats from the Algerian secret police, radical Islamists and right-wing French settlers still angry over their loss of Algeria to the National Liberation Front or F.L.N., of which he was a high-ranking member as a young man. 
 The members of this improbable alliance of government spies, religious fanatics and unrepentant colonialists have little in common besides their hostility to Mr. Harbi, who embodies an Algeria still struggling to be born: democratic and secular, rooted in North Africa yet open to the West, embracing the Berber as well as Arab aspects of its identity. It may be surprising that someone so powerless is considered to be so threatening. After all, Mr. Harbi represents no party, faction or interest group. Yet a man of principle is always a thorn in the side of authoritarian forces. 
 "In addition to being an important historical figure and the most respected historian of the Algerian national movement, Harbi is the preeminent engage Algerian intellectual of the past four decades," says Arun Kapil, an American expert on Algeria who teaches in Paris. 
Like many secular Arab intellectuals caught between repressive military regimes and fundamentalist oppositions, Mr. Harbi has found sanctuary in Paris. Algerians here and at home speak of him with an admiration bordering on reverence. In Menilmontant -- a neighborhood lined with halal butchers, pastry shops and hip little bars -- young men greet him as "Si Mohammed," in Arabic Sir Mohammed. 
"I've lived here for 25 years, and I feel very much at home," said Mr. Harbi, a slender, refined man of 69 with close-cropped white hair offset by striking black eyebrows. Sitting at a bistro around the corner from his apartment, he wore a black cashmere turtleneck, corduroys and wire-rimmed glasses, and spoke in lightly accented French. He dispatches quickly with personal questions, as if he'd rather talk about anything other than himself. Writing his memoirs -- the first volume was recently published here to considerable acclaim -- was, he says, "a strange undertaking, since I don't have a taste for intimate confessions." 
It helps to have a good story, and Mr. Harbi undoubtedly has one. He helped lead his country to independence from France in one of the bloodiest colonial wars of the 20th century, only to become a prisoner of the newly independent state. Since fleeing to France in 1973, Mr. Harbi has gone from making history to writing it, establishing himself as an insightful student of Algerian politics and as an unbending champion of secular democracy and human rights. "The Algerian government," Mr. Harbi says, "is not a state with an army, but an army with a state." In books like "The F.L.N.: Mirage and Reality," he has traced the rise of a military-bureaucratic elite that, in his view, has led the country to economic ruin and civil war, displaying flagrant contempt for the people whose praises it ritually sings. "To understand Algeria today," he says, "you have to begin with the massive exclusion of people from power and the rejection of pluralism."
In 1992, a ghastly war broke out between government security forces and Islamist rebels after the army canceled the country's first democratic legislative elections, which the radical Islamic Salvation Front won. Tens of thousands of Algerians have died, and over 7,000 "disappeared." Since the early 90's, the Algerian government has projected itself as the country's only defense against theocratic despotism. In Mr. Harbi's view, this is a false choice, since, he said, most Algerians reject both the state and its radical Islamist opponents. The army and the rebels, he argues, are objective allies: both sides refuse to allow Algerians to govern themselves, both reject political pluralism and both are willing to use extreme violence -- and even, some reports suggest, to cooperate behind the scenes -- to further their aims.
Wishing a plague on both houses is, of course, the most dangerous position of all in a civil war, and Mr. Harbi has kept a low profile for much of the last decade, evading various assassination plots. "He seemed less nervous about his safety than I was," Stuart Schaar, a historian of North Africa at Brooklyn College, remembers. "I was afraid when he'd take subways. I begged him to take taxis, but he wouldn't." 
If Mr. Harbi seems oddly serene in the face of these threats, it's because he is used to the clandestine life. Born in 1933 into an affluent and highly distinguished Muslim family in El-Arrouch, a town in eastern Algeria, he joined the nationalist underground at 15. From 1954 to 1962, the years of the independence war, he held various influential positions within the F.L.N. After the war, he served as an adviser to Algeria's first president, Ahmed Ben Bella.
Yet even at the peak of his influence, Mr. Harbi was always an outsider in the F.L.N. The seeds of rebellion were planted in him by his iconoclastic father, Brahimi Harbi, and by his French high school teacher, an anti-Stalinist Marxist named Pierre Souyri who had fought in the resistance. Under Mr. Souyri's tutelage, Mr. Harbi rejected the Islam-inflected populism common to most Algerian nationalists in favor of libertarian socialism. 
Mr. Harbi's secular ideals placed him at odds with most of his colleagues in the F.L.N., who espoused the creation of an "Arabo-Muslim" state. A staunch defender of the few Algerian Jews and French settlers who supported the F.L.N, he says that these men and women "were arguably the most genuine nationalists, because their understanding of Algeria wasn't colored by religion."
As a member of Mr. Ben Bella's cabinet, Mr. Harbi tried in vain to combat the increasingly authoritarian direction of the revolution. He publicly condemned the torture of dissidents and urged Mr. Ben Bella to arm the people to avert a military coup. It was already too late: in June 1965, Col. Houari Boumedienne seized power. Mr. Ben Bella was jailed, followed, two months later, by Mr. Harbi. 
Never formally charged, he spent the next six years being transferred from one prison to the next, until he was placed under house arrest in 1971. 
Two years later Mr. Harbi escaped across the Tunisian border, with a fake Turkish passport. He ended up in Paris, where he'd studied two decades earlier at the Sorbonne, and where his children from an earlier marriage to a Frenchwoman lived. His first life, as a politician, was over. 
But while under house arrest, the revolutionary was reborn as a historian. In the depths of confinement, Mr. Harbi had begun to write a chronicle of the independence movement. 
In 1975, he published "The Origins of the F.L.N." It was the first in a series of sober, unsentimental studies that demolished the founding myths of the Algerian revolution, starting with the notion that Algerians had been unified under the F.L.N. and that anyone who opposed it was a traitor.
Using a trove of documents that he had collected during the war, Mr. Harbi revealed the internal life of the Algerian national movement, marked by ideological splits, purges and brutal score-settling. As a witness to the party's power struggles, and as an Algerian patriot of unimpeachable nationalist credentials, he was able to expose the grim underside of the F.L.N. as no scholar could. Without minimizing the wounds of colonialism, he insisted on the indigenous roots of Algeria's troubles, stressing the almost hysterical fear of political and cultural pluralism and the penchant for suppressing it by violence, as well as the weight of conservative, rural traditions. 
As the French critic Pierre Vidal-Naquet, a close friend, puts it, "Harbi is that rare example of a political activist who has been able to achieve the historian's detachment from his subject." 
By breaking the taboos surrounding the Algerian revolution, Mr. Harbi was placing himself in the line of fire. Algeria's secret police had assassinated a number of exiled dissidents. No sooner had Mr. Harbi arrived than Algerian agents began to stop by his apartment, offering a monthly salary in return for cooperation. French leftists with connections to the Algerian state promised to get him a French passport if he would keep quiet. "I felt extremely lonely in those years," he said. 
Today, Mr. Harbi is a celebrated figure in French intellectual life, but his living conditions haven't much improved. He lives in a small apartment on a tiny pension from the University of Paris, where he taught political science for 20 years. "Mohammed refuses to be helped because he doesn't want to depend on anyone," Mr. Vidal-Naquet said, half in admiration, half in exasperation. 
The first volume of Mr. Harbi's memoirs (the second is to be published this fall) is in large measure the story of a ferociously self-reliant man. Spanning the period 1945 to 1962, the book provides an absorbing account of Mr. Harbi's life in the underground in France, when he was raising support for the revolution and running from one safe house to the next. And it beautifully conveys the passage from lyrical illusions to lost illusions -- the experience of an entire generation of Algerians who experienced the great hopes, and the equally great disappointments, of the independence era. 
The most revelatory section may be Mr. Harbi's chapter on his adolescence in the city of Skikda, since it offers a view of the colonial experience that has seldom appeared in print, registering the volatile intimacy that both joined and divided Algerians and the settlers. As the historian Benjamin Stora notes, "Harbi was one of the first writers to show the colonial world as it really was, a world of segregation and inequality but also of contact between communities."
Mr. Harbi's memoir is now prominently displayed in bookstores throughout Algeria, where his work was banned until a decade ago. One Algerian reviewer, the sociologist Lahouari Addi, likened the book to "collective therapy," urging that it be "translated into Arabic and read by as many Algerians as possible." He added, "All is not yet lost in a society that can give birth to activists like Mohammed Harbi."
Mr. Harbi, for his part, doesn't see his life in heroic terms. "My story," he said, chuckling softly, "is the classic story of the radical son of bourgeois parents," a tale of rebellion, disillusionment and downward mobility worthy of Herzen. Does the retired academic ever feel a tinge of nostalgia for his days as a nationalist revolutionary? 
"I have to be honest with you," he said, blushing. "For all its miseries, being a political militant is much more exciting than life in academia." A wry little smile flashed across Mr. Harbi's face, and he returned the conversation, once again, to the country on the other side of the Mediterranean.

To the Editor:
 Re "U.S. Combat Force of 1,700 Is Headed to the Philippines" (front page, Feb. 21): 
 It is alarming that even as war in Iraq looms on the horizon, and fighting in Afghanistan continues, American troops are beginning a major new counterterror operation to "disrupt and destroy" Muslim rebels in the Philippines. 
Are the risks of deploying troops there worth it to prove the Pentagon's ability to fight a war in Iraq and still hunt down terrorists elsewhere? One American Green Beret has already been killed in the Philippines, and our new combat role puts our troops in greater danger. 
President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has pledged her support in the war on terrorism and gained millions in military and economic aid as a result. But she is also committed to quashing domestic insurgency movements at any price, and recent reports of human rights abuses and torture in the Philippines are troubling. 
Is Washington sidelining human rights in the interest of enhancing its partnership with Manila?

HEADLINE: Necessary Foreign Aid 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Helping Poor Countries" (editorial, Feb. 17): Foreign aid is critical -- and it is the United States' obligation as a world leader to help those who are less fortunate. 
 I have worked for five years in Moldova, the poorest country in Europe, and have seen United States aid in action. With American assistance, Moldova privatized its collective farms. New programs are helping farmers succeed in a market economy. 
Elena Manic is one beneficiary of foreign aid, joining a milk-collecting cooperative (assisted by the United States Agency for International Development). She says it best: "Before our cooperative was formed, it was not profitable to have a cow because we didn't have a market for our milk. Now, I sell my milk and earn 600 lei a month. With this money, I can buy myself some clothes." 
That 600 lei equals $42 -- more than the average Moldovan monthly wage. It makes United States foreign aid look terribly small, and vitally important.

HEADLINE: The Middle East Belongs in the World Economy 

BYLINE:  By Charlene Barshefsky; Charlene Barshefsky was United States trade representative from 1997 to 2001.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For much of history, the Middle East was the commercial and intellectual bridge between Asia and Europe. It was among the most cosmopolitan regions of the world, the birthplace of religions and alphabets, even the source of some terminology common in today's globalized era; technical terms like "tariff," and commodity names like "cotton" and "coffee," have their roots in Arabic.
 Today, however, it is painfully clear that the main roads of international trade have bypassed the Muslim Middle East. As it formulates its strategy, the Bush administration should seize this opportunity to complement its fight against terrorism by bringing trade and economic liberalization to the region. 
 The United States has long recognized the role of trade policy in building a lasting peace. Well before the end of World War II, Roosevelt and Truman developed a strategy for stabilizing postwar Europe through economic assistance and trade integration. This strategy led to a 23-nation tariff agreement reached in 1948. More than 50 years later, the World Trade Organization includes 145 governments representing about 5.5 billion people. Over time, by strengthening areas of common interest among nations, the W.T.O. has helped governments deal with economic crises and political stress.
The policies of institutions like the W.T.O., the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and their practical consequences for the global economy, have lately become controversial. But their critics are missing something fundamental. While raising important questions about fairness, sustainability and balance between economic growth and social reform, they have lost sight of one of the foremost benefits of trade policy: helping to secure a more stable peace.
It is this vision that must now be realized in the Middle East, which has more trade barriers than any other part of the world. Muslim countries in the region trade less with one another than do African countries, and much less than do Asian, Latin American or European countries. This reflects both high trade barriers -- tariffs in Egypt, Syria, Algeria and other major Arab states are all multiples of world averages -- and the deep isolation Iran, Iraq and Libya have brought on themselves through violence and support for terrorist groups.
Meanwhile, as Latin America and Asia have shifted away from reliance on exporting natural resources and toward manufacturing, the Middle East still depends on oil. Today, the United States imports slightly more than $5 billion worth of manufactured goods and farm products from the 22 members of the Arab League, Afghanistan and Iran combined -- or about half our value-added imports from Hong Kong alone.
And governments in the Middle East are less likely than those in any other region to participate in the World Trade Oganization. Aside from Israel and Turkey, 8 of its 11 largest economies remain outside the W.T.O. This means that countries like Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Syria have little chance to open foreign markets fully to their goods, regardless of price or quality.
The consequences of all this are profoundly dangerous. The region's population is young and growing, having nearly doubled to 300 million from 170 million since 1980. Meanwhile, its place in the world economy has shrunk. In 1980, Muslim countries in the Middle East controlled 13 percent of world exports and received almost 5 percent of direct investment; today the figures are barely 3 percent of world exports and 1.5 percent of investment. Last year, the entire Muslim world received barely more foreign investment than Sweden.
In sum, the Middle East has a growing share of the world's population and a shrinking share of its economy. And with the region's political and religious disputes always in the background, its young people are increasingly drawn to radical ideology and religious fundamentalism.
A more active economic approach is necessary. A Middle East with new jobs and stronger growth would have better prospects for more stable societies and a more firm foundation for political reform and peacemaking.
In Jordan, for example, King Abdullah II has overseen a comprehensive revision of economic and trade policy, ranging from deregulation to tariff reductions. This, coupled with various American initiatives, including duty-free industrial zones and a free trade agreement signed by President Bill Clinton in 2000 and passed by Congress in 2001, has begun to alter the economic landscape. In 2002, Jordan's exports to the United States exceeded $400 million, up from $16 million in 1998. Some 40,000 Jordanians -- many of them Palestinian women living in depressed regions -- have found jobs in a newly energized economy.
Such developments show what a more comprehensive Middle East trade policy might achieve. As many Arab intellectuals now recognize, the region has reached an economic dead end and needs a new approach -- economic liberalization as well as improved education, empowerment of women and political reform.
The United States should build on this through an integrated, long-term strategy for returning the Middle East to the world economy. The administration's prospective free-trade agreement with Morocco can be a starting point for a far more comprehensive approach to the region, comparable to that which already exists for Latin America and Africa. For example, accelerated W.T.O. membership for Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Yemen -- all of which have already applied -- is essential. In the interim, bilateral free trade agreements can be part of the solution, as can a regional trade-preference program similar to the African Growth and Opportunity Act.
Such a strategy will not cure the region's political problems. Nor will it substitute for security policy in the campaign against terrorist groups. But history gives little reason to be confident that either a politics-only approach to Middle East peacemaking, or a military-only approach to terrorism, can succeed.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Inflation Report Helps Send Shares Higher for the Week

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A government report of a moderate increase in inflation helped soothe Wall Street yesterday, sending stocks to their second consecutive week of gains despite concerns about Iraq and a United Nations Security Council meeting on Monday.
 Analysts said many investors could not resist picking up bargains after four weeks of steep declines. Trading remained light, leading to exaggerated price swings. 
 "A lot of stocks have gotten down to levels where people want to buy them and where maybe the economy has bottomed," said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird & Company. "But the question of Iraq and whether or not we go to war" continues to hang over the market. 
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 103.15 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 8,018.11, after a two-day loss of 126 points.
The broader market also finished higher. The Nasdaq composite index gained 17.79 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,349.02. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.07 points, or 1.3 percent, to 848.17.
The three main gauges posted their second week of advances, which they have not done since the period ended Jan. 10. For the week, the Dow climbed 1.4 percent, the Nasdaq gained 3 percent and the S.& P. 500 rose 1.6 percent.
The Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in January as worries of a possible war with Iraq helped push up energy prices. The increase matched analysts' expectations.
Wall Street was particularly nervous before the release of the report after the department said on Thursday that inflation at the producer, or wholesale, level jumped 1.6 percent in January, the biggest increase in 13 years. The figures yesterday were modest in comparison. Three other economic reports Thursday also raised investors' fears about the health of the economy.
The United States and Britain, meanwhile, were preparing to present a new resolution to the Security Council on Monday in support of using force to disarm Iraq. Iraq allowed a second flight by an American U-2 spy plane yesterday, although the United Nations said Iraq was still not cooperating fully with inspections.
Trading has been choppy in recent weeks as investors made short-term bets on whether or when there will be a war with Iraq. Analysts say the market will have trouble sustaining gains since investors worry that a prolonged conflict could weaken the economic recovery.
An explosion at an oil storage site at the edge of Staten Island yesterday also put investors on edge. The Dow fell as much as 60 points in early trading but quickly recovered after the authorities said there was no indication of terrorism.
"We had an early-morning scare relating to the fire," said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company. "Given the proximity to Wall Street and looking out the windows and seeing the billowing smoke, obvious concerns surfaced."
Target climbed $1.71, to $28.48, after U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray raised its stock rating to strong buy from outperform.
Verizon gained 88 cents, to $35.64, after Credit Suisse First Boston raised its stock rating to outperform from neutral, citing low valuation.
Agilent rose 85 cents, to $13.45, after the company, a maker of test and measurement equipment, posted a first-quarter loss and said it would cut 4,000 jobs to reduce expenses.
Declining stocks included Tupperware, which dropped $1.90, to $12.89, after warning that its first-quarter results will be significantly below the prior year's because the winter weather has hurt sales.
BEA Systems, a software maker, fell 58 cents, to $10.63, after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat estimates; however, it also gave a cautious outlook for the current quarter.
Treasury bond prices fell. The 10-year note lost 6/32, to a price of 99 28/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.89 percent from 3.87 percent on Thursday.
The 30-year bond dropped 18/32, to 108 3/32. Its yield climbed to 4.85 percent from 4.81 percent.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid By Consumers Rose 0.3% In January 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose only moderately in January, as low costs for everything from food to new cars helped offset a surge in energy prices, the Labor Department said today.
 The Consumer Price Index, the government's main inflation gauge, rose 0.3 percent, allaying concerns about price pressures caused by a report on Thursday that showed an unexpectedly large jump in wholesale prices. 
 The rise in the consumer index was the biggest since last April but it was overwhelmingly driven by energy costs, which soared 4 percent on the back of frigid weather and worries about a possible United States war with Iraq. 
The core index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, rose only 0.1 percent -- slightly less than economists expected.
"Consumers have shut off the ability for producers to raise prices," said Kurt Karl, chief economist with Swiss Re in New York. "There's so much competition on the retail level. You have to give them discounts."
If inflation were to move higher, it could complicate an already uncertain economic picture by limiting the Fed's leeway to use lower interest rates to spur growth.
In November, the Fed cut overnight rates to a four-decade low of 1.25 percent. The central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 18 but might need to consider raising them later in the year if inflation were to threaten an acceleration.
In addition to constraining the Fed, higher prices would restrict the purchasing power of consumers, who are already grappling with slow wage gains amid a weak job market.
The Labor Department said that inflation-adjusted weekly earnings for workers did not budge at all in January. They were up 0.4 percent in the 12 months ended in January.
With consumer demand soft, prices in a variety of categories of the January Consumer Price Index were subdued. Food prices fell 0.2 percent, the biggest drop since January 1997. Apparel and new-car prices both slid 0.9 percent. Even medical care costs, which typically outpace other components, rose just 0.1 percent -- the smallest rise since January 1998.
Housing prices, which make up more than 40 percent of the index, rose by 0.4 percent, offsetting weakness elsewhere.
Fuel oil costs surged 8.6 percent, natural gas climbed 4.6 percent and gasoline prices jumped 6.6 percent.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: The New Capitalists; 
Western Investment Provides A Bonanza for East Europe

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
As Europe divides politically over war in Iraq, a different campaign is shaping in places like this, once held in thrall by the Soviet Union. Put simply, it is a battle to redraw a continent's economic frontiers, and it is cast, like the rift over Iraq, as a collision of old and new.
 Last year alone, foreign investors poured a record $30 billion into Eastern European economies, which many American executives see as hungrier and more ready for innovation than those in the West. Two-thirds of the total went to nations set to join the European Union by June 2004, according to the Vienna-based Institute for International Economic Studies. 
 The calculations are simple enough. The slow-moving economies of Western Europe, particularly in France and Germany, are too hidebound and cosseted to pine for growth. The changing economies of Eastern Europe, by contrast, can only expand as they are drawn into the single market of the European Union.
"Western Europe is lagging and Eastern Europe is where the opportunities for growth are," said Christopher J. Navetta, head of an American steel plant in Kosice, Slovakia.
At corporations like the General Electric division in Budapest, or Mr. Navetta's U.S. Steel plant in Slovakia, executives like to say that people here are more eager to turn to new ways than in other parts of Europe.
"You give people an opportunity to be freethinkers, and they get it," said Mr. Navetta. At General Electric, one of the first and biggest American investors in post-Communist Eastern Europe, Istvan Szini, who oversees G.E.'s $1.1 billion investment in Hungary, recalled a decision last year on setting up a new plant that required workers to speak at least two languages other than their own. What swung the choice in favor of Budapest, he said, was "the willingness of the Hungarian work force to learn and further develop themselves."
However, this European expansion is anything but smooth. In Hungary, for instance, American companies including I.B.M. scaled back last year because of the global slowdown, and some relocated assembly lines to China. 
Since 1990, about one-third of the $25 billion invested by foreigners in Hungary has come from the United States. But America has slipped from Eastern Europe's biggest foreign investor in the 1990's to third place behind Germany and the Netherlands.
Nonetheless, countries like Hungary, Poland or Slovakia could still provide a valuable toehold for American and other non-European investors as Europe unites and expands to stretch from Ireland's Atlantic coast to the borders of Russia.
The fusion of West and East will "enrich Europe," said Hubert Warsmann, the Budapest representative of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a development agency. "It adds new opportunities. It's not a zero-sum game where you are taking from one to give to another."
American companies investing here, said Peter Hegedus, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce, will have a base in a market of some 450 million people, drawing on a mix of low costs and high skills backed by government incentives.
As the fledgling capitalist economies of Eastern Europe expand and aspire to the standards of Western Europe, however, there is a downside. A strong local currency has made Hungary less attractive. In addition, Hungary's national wage bill soared by 11 percent last year because of pay increases, ending the perception of Eastern Europe as a bargain basement for low-cost labor. The average monthly wage is $500 -- far lower than in Western Europe or the United States, but far higher than it was not so long ago in Eastern Europe.
The European Union has put a halt to some of the big tax breaks enjoyed by foreign investors over the last decade. New bureaucratic rules could prove costly. Just this week, a newspaper reported that one-third of Hungary's 1,870 outdoor swimming pools might be drained and closed because their water circulation plants do not conform to European Union standards.
And, despite their vaunted flexibility, workers in many parts of Eastern Europe are still far less productive than those in Western Europe.
Studies by labor unions here say it will take 10 to 20 years for even a relatively developed nation like Hungary to catch up to the living standards of Western Europe.
Meanwhile, growth in the new European Union member nations could run at twice the continental average of around 2 percent, and the European Union itself will pour some $40 billion into its 10 new members between 2004 and 2006 to improve roads and other infrastructure.
"One of the attractions of coming into Central Europe is that you are looking at another 10 or 20 years of solid growth," said Mr. Warsmann of the European Bank.
That is the kind of opening companies saw as the Berlin Wall fell. General Electric swiftly took over the Tungsram state light bulb factory here to begin building a local empire that now spans seven different businesses and employs 14,000 people.
German companies, building on centuries of trade to the east, spotted opportunities to offset their own record-setting wage levels at home. Robert Bosch, an auto-parts company based in Stuttgart, Germany, announced last year that it would move its production of engine starters to Miskolc, Hungary, where labor costs are less than one-sixth of the $26 an hour earned by workers in Germany. Laundry from Berlin's five-star hotels is reportedly sent each day to be cleaned in low-cost Poland.
The list of big foreign investors is long: Volkswagen bought the Skoda car company in the Czech Republic, which topped the list last year as the favorite destination for foreign investment with $8 billion. Continental Tire bought the Czech tire maker Barum. Ford bought an auto-parts plant there. U.S. Steel is now considering expansion in Poland, where it has bid for Poland's state-owned, multibillion-dollar-a-year steel industry. G.E. ranks as the second biggest foreign company in Hungary after Deutsche Telekom.
"There's a certain dynamism here that you don't see in more mature economies," said a Western diplomat. "In that sense they are new Europe, and they are really struggling to get their heads round how they'll be old Europe in a regulatory sense and still catch up."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: A Heritage of Protest; 
The Germans Who Toppled Communism Resent the U.S.

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Every Monday at the Nikolai Church in the former East German city of Leipzig -- the very church and the very day of the week where the demonstrations that brought down the former Communist government began -- residents protest the possibility of war with Iraq. The rally is both a symbol and a paradox of the great European schism on the question of Iraq. 
 What used to be called the German Democratic Republic stands out these days as the only former member of the Soviet bloc that does not back the American position on Iraq. The leaders of all the others, from Estonia to Bulgaria, Romania to the Czech Republic, have signed letters of support and solidarity with the United States, to the tremendous annoyance of the countries, especially France, that oppose the Bush administration's policy. 
 Eastern Germany in this sense remains very much a part of what Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld called "old Europe," as compared to the "new" Europe of countries grateful to the United States for its stalwart support during the cold war. But why?
For 50 years, the western half of Germany was the closest and, in some respects, the most dependent ally of the United States, the country most directly threatened by Soviet tanks and missiles, and thus most directly protected by American power.
Now Germany is run by the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, which is the most adamantly antiwar of all European governments. Three of its ministers actually marched in the huge antiwar protests held last weekend in Berlin. This would have been inconceivable if Soviet tanks were still in place.
The former East Germany is very much a part of this picture; indeed, Mr. Schroder's close victory in national elections last September was made possible by his appeal to the antiwar vote, a major portion of which deserted the leftist successor to the former East German Communist Party to support the chancellor.
Germany itself can show defiant independence of the United States because the cold war is over and it feels secure. But eastern Germans, many of whom have been very disappointed with the results of reunification, may reject American policy because they feel neither secure, nor sometimes even represented, in the new Germany of which they have become a part.
"It's because they are poorer in the east than in the west, and there's a kind of anger at America for this," said Christoph Dieckmann, a former dissident Protestant minister from eastern Germany who now works as a reporter for the weekly Die Zeit. "They blame America for their poor economic state."
Alone among the former Soviet bloc peoples, Germans in the east did not inherit their own country, and what Mr. Dieckmann called a resulting "sense of separateness" includes a rejection of America as the capitalist model for the western half of the country, which has simply swallowed the east's identity.
"Today in the east, people defend socialism who were never socialists or communists in the old time," Mr. Dieckmann said. "It's just because they want to be East Germans. They want to keep something for themselves.
"This East German identity was created after unification, not before," Mr. Dieckmann said. 
To a great extent, eastern disappointment with the results of national reunification has contributed to what some commentators call a generalized resentment, a feeling that the Ossis, as the East Germans are called in the western part of the country, are not so much antiwar or anti-American as they are, simply, anti.
By contrast, if other countries of the former Soviet bloc have problems, they are, at least, the problems of independent people who believe that they owe their independence, at least to some extent, to the UnitedStates. 
There are other reasons to explain the strength of the peace movement in eastern Germany and the relative absence of pro-American gratitude.
"I think there are three reasons that bring people to this attitude," said Friedericke Eckhoff, a peace activist from Rostock, a port on the Baltic Sea. "First, nobody wants this war. Nobody wants it but Bush and his oil companies. Second, people are angry about their situation -- about money, jobs, poverty, no future for their children."
Third, she said, echoing a widely held view here, the end of Soviet domination in East Germany did not come about because of the United States.
"Thirteen years ago, masses of people went to the streets and said, 'We are the people,' " she said, "and now they are saying again, 'We are the people and we don't want this war.' " 
East Germany was not the only country to throw off communism via a popular revolt, but it may be the only country that believed its revolt was generated at home -- as a result of looking westward to fellow Germans, rather than much farther, across the Atlantic, to the United States.
That Americans expect East Germans to feel gratitude, Mr. Dieckmann suggested, may reflect a misunderstanding of how certain events, celebrated in American cold war history, are viewed elsewhere.
"I still remember Mr. Reagan in front of the Brandenburg Gate saying, 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,' " Mr. Dieckmann said. "At that time, in 1987, that was not brave. That was just provocative, because at that time the safety of Europe depended on the balance of East and West."
Chronicling the collapse of East Germany in the late 1980's, he concluded that it was the cumulative effect of exposure to American, or Western European culture, on West German television (which was widely watched in the old Communist Germany) and the mass flight of East Germans through Hungary after that country opened its border with Austria in May 1989. "Actually," he said, "I think that small steps did it."
The long tradition of protest by the Protestant churches in this land of Martin Luther is another explanation for the current antiwar feelings of eastern Germany. The Nikolai Church protests of 1989 grew out of an earlier church peace movement that spread east from the west in the early 1980's, when West German churches were protesting their government's decision to install medium-range Pershing II missiles to counter what Washington perceived to be the Soviet threat.
There are also those who believe that the residue of old Communist attitudes here has played a role in the strength of antiwar sentiment here -- that phrases about American imperialism and the horrors of capitalism resonate because they sound like the old days. The other day, the German minister for the environment, Jurgen Trittin, said that the real interest of the United States in Iraq was oil, and this view, announced near the top of the German government, played to an audience in eastern Germany.
"Everything is more pronounced in East Germany," said Michael Sturmer, a commentator for the newspaper Die Welt. "The resentment is more pronounced, the poverty is more pronounced, and so is the feeling of being cut off."

HEADLINE: At Columbia, Journalists and the Faculty Rewrite a Journalism Curriculum 

BYLINE:  By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
Lee C. Bollinger's aim was keen and his angle well considered. As one of his first acts as president of Columbia University, he declared the curriculum at the heart of the Graduate School of Journalism "insufficient." At the same time, he refused to select either of two finalists for the school's vacant deanship. 
 Like a smartly delivered cue ball, Mr. Bollinger's message on July 23 sent a collection of faculty members and alumni ricocheting off one another in anger and confusion. Within weeks, journalists from Canada to South Africa, some proud that they had never taken a journalism course, were arguing about what academic training reporters need, if any. 
 But six months after Mr. Bollinger's call for an overhaul, some see the debate he set off as a turning point. Just how the school -- currently offering a 10-month program that leads to a Master of Science degree -- will be reshaped remains unclear. But competing visions have been put on paper, and experimentation with a two-year program seems likely. 
"Journalism education has been looked down upon by both the profession and by academics for so long," said Mitchell Stephens, a journalism professor at Columbia's rival, New York University. "I think what we have now is some people who have the wit to rethink it. I think it's marvelous. But a lot of tensions are unleashed by that."
One question that has dogged the debate is whether prospective journalists could afford a two-year degree. Mr. Bollinger says he is ready to face the economic reality that entry-level journalists are paid about $25,000 a year, perhaps making it hard to find students willing to pay double the $40,000 for tuition and expenses they pay now.
Mr. Bollinger said in an interview that he would raise whatever money it takes, to make moot the economic objections that are at the core of arguments against extending the time it takes to get the master's degree. "We do not accept that argument for historians and political scientists," he said. "I won't accept it for journalists. Which means I have to raise money and financial aid and support curriculum developments and appointments. All of which I am prepared to do."
He added, "If we can have a capital campaign of $2 billion" for the entire university, "I don't know why we can't raise $50 million for the journalism school."
Mr. Bollinger's handling of the journalism school has been perhaps his most dramatic move in his short tenure. He has shown a new commitment to the arts, and he is seeking to reduce Columbia's role in Biosphere 2, the big earth science experiment in Arizona. Most recently, he has commissioned a large study of Columbia's need for space.
Whether or not Columbia's journalism program expands to two years, the school that emerges in the next decade will be different, if Mr. Bollinger has his way. It will provide a body of knowledge it deems essential for any journalist. Mr. Bollinger, a First Amendment specialist and a newspaper executive's son, wants new journalists to think of their work as a profession. He has said he will name a new dean by April.
To help reimagine journalism education, Mr. Bollinger set up a committee of more than 30 people, among them well-known journalists like Eugene L. Roberts Jr., who was a managing editor of The New York Times and executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer; Ken Auletta and Nicholas Lemann of The New Yorker; and Newsweek's chairman, Richard M. Smith.
Central to the discussions was a series of questions: Should journalism school continue to concentrate on basic skills -- that is, how to write a newspaper article or edit a television report, as Columbia does now? Should it also give students a chance to specialize in a particular field, like science writing? Should skills training be minimized to make room for the theoretical study of a journalist's role in society?
As the academic year began, the faculty members and students felt under siege. Teachers had to assure students that they had not signed up for a substandard program. Faculty members received hundreds of e-mail messages from alumni, many echoing the alumnus who wrote that the president had offered "a solution in search of a problem."
The tensions were evident in the rare flare-ups at meetings of the task force, which put practicing journalists in the same room as some leaders of the journalism school. 
Last fall, James W. Carey, a professor with a reputation as a curmudgeon, took on Anna Quindlen of Newsweek when she noted that she and other task force members had not attended journalism school. "The contemptibleness of that argument!" Mr. Carey exclaimed to an alumni gathering last month. "That because I did it this way, everyone should follow my example."
Ms. Quindlen said later that Mr. Carey mistook her meaning. "What I was saying is, if you are going to think about what journalism school does, let's justify its existence."
The continuing debate prompted the faculty to develop a new curriculum of its own to supplement existing training, which has always been built around "RW1," a bedrock course requiring students to report and write about New York City neighborhoods and produce weekly feature reports and deadline news articles. 
As a result, even some faculty members now give Mr. Bollinger credit for setting off a productive debate. As Samuel G. Freedman, the school's interim associate dean, said, "The last month has been a very different mind-set: that we could actually pull out something really interesting here."
Earlier this month, at the task force's fifth meeting since it was formed, Mr. Bollinger's task force applauded an extensive two-year curriculum drafted by Mr. Lemann.
In the first year, students would be required to take both the basic skills courses and new requirements, including a history of journalism course and a "great books" course. In the second year, students would major in a field like science, international relations or legal issues.
The committee had already considered a one-year curriculum emphasizing issues like professional ethics and media criticism. It met with scant enthusiasm, according to three task force members, partly because it focused more on what journalists should be thinking and doing than on what the rest of the world was thinking or doing.
A separate faculty proposal, developed under the guidance of the interim dean, David A. Klatell, calls for an extra semester to allow students to concentrate in one of three fields: business, the arts or religion.
The faculty plan would supplement the Master of Science program, enrolling up to 25 students, compared with the 200 or so full-time M.S. students. But it is unclear if the Lemann proposal would move the entire school toward a two-year program or would be the basis for a supplemental degree for a smaller group.
The debate has raised the school's profile and Mr. Bollinger's. Columbia has the most-recognized name in journalism education, but the quality and variety of the programs at N.Y.U., the University of California at Berkeley and the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern make them strong competitors.
At Medill, students cover Evanston, Ill., the school's suburban home,then Chicago, then Washington. A supplemental program in subjects like law and religion is being created.
At Berkeley, students take a two-year program. The first year is much like Columbia's. Second-year students specialize in a field like Russian studies, or in a journalistic form like television production.
Mr. Bollinger said the new journalism dean's job would entail playing midwife to a new curriculum -- something Mr. Lemann has already begun to do -- recruiting faculty members and attracting financial support.
As for Mr. Bollinger, "whatever he decided to do was the most important decision he made as president," said Charles R. Eisendrath, the director of the University of Michigan's Knight-Wallace Fellows program for midcareer journalists, a task force member and a friend of Mr. Bollinger.
"If he did it wrong, he would blow it in the midst of world journalism," Mr. Eisendrath said. "If he did it right, he would make a link of incalculable value to those in the top ranks of the business."

HEADLINE: Fear on the Home Front 

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER; E-mail: billkeller@nytimes.com

 BODY:
With our troops massed against Iraq, Americans are apprehensive and divided. The polls show us still torn between containment and war, between the instinct to give it time and the yearning to get it done. We worry about civilian carnage, American casualties and terrorist reprisals, about further shocks to a shaken economy, about being a nation alone. The Pentagon is ordering body bags by the thousand.
 President Bush has enlarged the war agenda: we are not just eliminating a threat, we are delivering a promise of democracy to a region steeped in tyranny. Many, though, remain suspicious of his motives. "No Blood for Oil," the protest placards insist, and others mutter that this is somehow, too much, about Israel. The question of what comes after war has revived our longstanding fear of getting bogged down in unfriendly places. 
 Colin Powell, after trying to slow the march to war, has fallen loyally into step with his commander in chief. But the world, whose collaboration we crave, is in no hurry. The Germans are paralyzed by war angst. The French, deeply invested in Saddam and always happy to tweak the Americans, have been maddening. Democrats are straining for a way to be patriots without forfeiting independent judgment. The pope is calling for more "dialogue." Susan Sarandon is rallying opposition outside the United Nations. Saddam watches it all on CNN and assures us we will be bloodily humbled. 
Ah, the memories. The paragraphs above are constructed entirely from coverage of our national mood in the winter of 1991. Reading those old files made me wonder if maybe George Santayana was only half right: even those who remember history are condemned to repeat it.
A little time in the archives is a reminder that this war is in many respects a continuation of that war. We are calling to account a tyrant who has flouted the terms of his surrender. It's not just that we have been here before; technically, we never left.
Another thing that strikes you when you revisit the first gulf war is that much of what we anticipate with such confidence today will turn out to be wrong. Both the dire foreboding and the high hopes of Desert Storm proved exaggerated. The victory was not so difficult. Nor did it plant freedom in the Middle East -- as the abandoned Kurdish resistance, the miserable inmates of Iraq and those yet-to-be-democratized Kuwaitis can all testify.
What leaps out most powerfully, though, comparing then and now, is the visceral fear that this time war will admit new horrors into our own lives. In the reporting of 1991 you find occasional mentions of a possible terrorist backlash, but they are hypothetical. Americans then, four years before Oklahoma City, were mostly innocent on the subject of terror. This time, when the C.I.A. predicts that invading Iraq will provoke new assaults on our cities, Americans know in our stomachs what that means. 
These anxieties are amplified by doubts about the president who leads us. Some Americans question Mr. Bush's very legitimacy as president and as commander. I doubt anyone ever referred to his father as a "chicken hawk," or to the first Bush administration as a "junta." These are insults, not arguments, but they add heat to an opposition that is more passionate this time.
Our uncertainty about whether we are in safe hands has been compounded by Mr. Bush's own leadership. We have the skewed priorities of an administration that bids $26 billion for Turkish basing rights but shortchanges local emergency preparedness, that declines to call for any sacrifice, even from those who can best afford it. We have Mr. Bush's manhandling of our partners in security -- beginning with the gratuitous decision to take a project that could have been framed from the beginning as the enforcement of United Nations resolutions and elevate it to an America-first doctrine of pre-emptive power. We have the loopy alarums of the Department of Homeland Security -- what Garrison Keillor calls the Department of Scaring People Into Staying Home -- which is prescribing duct tape one day and Prozac the next.
What most of all animates our national anxiety, I think, is the fear that war will backfire. Most people did not imagine themselves anywhere near the front line in 1991. Now the front line is where we live, and we are afraid.
We fear that in pursuing Iraq, we are diverting money and attention from the hunt for Osama's villains and from the fortification of America. 
We fear that if we attack Iraq, Saddam will have every reason to arm the terrorist brigades against us, which we have no evidence he has done so far.
We fear that every civilian killed by American bombs will inflame the hatred that much of the Islamic world already feels for us.
We fear that if we occupy Arab land, new recruits will flock to the martyr brigades.
And we fear that fracturing our most vital alliances will leave us to face our legions of new enemies alone.
Those of us who have come to believe Saddam should be ousted must concede that all of those dangers are real -- and they are also, to use the most abused adjective of this debate, "imminent." These fearsome possibilities can be minimized, but in the short run it is entirely possible that attacking Iraq makes us less safe.
The problem is, not attacking does not eliminate the risks. At best, it postpones them. At worst, it allows small nightmares to grow into big ones. 
First, Al Qaeda terrorists do not need the pretext of an Iraq war to come after us. They will attack us, unprovoked, repeatedly and in as spectacular a fashion as their lethal ingenuity allows, regardless of what we do in Iraq. We know this, because they have done it.
Second, any containment regime we can conceive in place of war will eventually unravel, because the outside world does not have the resolve to maintain it and because a dictator with oil has the market on his side. We know this, too, because we have been through it. Saddam is likely to outlast our inspections and our sanctions, and certain to return to the production of the nuclear weapons that he sees as essential to his personal mythology and that any sober person regards as inimical to our well-being. 
Third, any clampdown sufficiently draconian to reassure us would amount to a United Nations occupation, which would be a grave humiliation to Saddam. It seems to me a year or two of this would be as likely to stimulate vengeance as war itself.
Fourth, we come to the murky relationship between the terrorist state and stateless terrorism. The administration has surely strained our trust hyping the connections between Saddam and Al Qaeda, but skeptics have just as badly understated the mutual interests of these two thugs. Yes, Saddam came to power as a secular, pan-Arab extremist and Osama bin Laden as a virulent Islamic fundamentalist. Stalin and Hitler were ideologically incompatible too, when they signed their nonaggression pact. All these monsters are at heart power-hungry, history-seeking opportunists. None have a record of being terribly fastidious about doctrine when it stands in the way of expedience. 
No one has stated this quite as baldly as bin Laden himself, in his latest taped screed. The Iraqi leadership may consist of "infidels" and ungodly "socialists," he said, but "it does no harm in these circumstances that the interests of Muslims and socialists agree in the fighting against the Crusaders." I would not be so quick to rule out Saddam's giving weapons to the Qaeda killers, but suppose he only gives them safe passage. Are we fine with that?
And finally, there is the price America would pay for backing down now with Saddam still in power.
Hawks within the administration have for some time dreaded the possibility that Saddam would make a good show of capitulating. Faced with a serious U.N. ultimatum, they worried, he would "discover" the missing toxins and offer them up for destruction. France and Russia would lead a new campaign to lift economic sanctions -- keeping a skeleton crew of inspectors on hand. At this point President Bush would face enormous pressure to claim his hollow victory and bring home the troops. Saddam would remain smugly in place, biding his time. America's job would be unfinished once again, and our credibility severely compromised. 
The peace camp will dismiss this as schoolyard machismo. But credibility is a great peacekeeper, because enemies who trust your word are less likely to test it. Which, as much as any other reason, is why we can count on going to war.
The protests last weekend and the anguish in the polls represent something genuine, a force that Mr. Bush will have to reckon with and that some of his foreign allies may not survive. But what the antiwar camp offers as an antidote to fear is a false sense of security. In the short run, war is perilous. In the long run, peace can be a killer, too.

HEADLINE: Exiled American Outlives Stalin's Shadow 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: DUBNA, Russia 

 BODY:
When David Natanovich Bell first applied for a visa to visit the United States, at the American Embassy in Moscow in October 1987, the consular official took one brief look at his Soviet passport and one long look at him. She left the room, then returned with her boss.
 "So," they asked him, "do you want to renew your American citizenship?" 
 It was a reasonable question. Beneath the red cover of his passport, with its hammer and sickle, was a page noting his date and place of birth: May 14, 1921; Houston, Tex. 
Mr. Bell had been living in the Soviet Union since he was barely 10.
Now 81, David Bell is among the last of a small band of Americans and their kin -- hundreds, surely, and probably thousands -- who quit the United States in the depths of the Great Depression and headed for Josef Stalin's socialist paradise.
For acting on their convictions, many suffered grievously. Some died, marooned in prison camps or worked to death building dams for greater Soviet glory.
Many others, including Mr. Bell's brother, sister and children, fled to America and Europe the instant the Soviet Union's borders began to crack open.
Mr. Bell stayed. He lives with his wife, Katya, 75, in Dubna, a tree-studded town of about 60,000, 80 miles north of Moscow, in the four-room fourth-floor apartment they have occupied since 1961.
"It never occurred to me to leave -- what would I do?" Mr. Bell, a tall, spare man with long shocks of white hair, an animated manner and perfect Midwestern English, said during a recent conversation. Russia, he said, is his home and home to Katya, who speaks no English and has six Russian sisters. "Men have a habit of kicking the bucket before women do," he said. "Imagine her in America alone."
Besides, he has built another life here, erected on the remains of the first. Since visiting the United States in 1987, Mr. Bell has helped to bring more than a thousand Americans to Dubna -- and sent a thousand Russians to America in return -- under an exchange program he established with civic leaders in La Crosse, Wis.
Mr. Bell retired in 2001 as the Dubna head of the sister cities program, recognized as Russia's best. In the last decade the venture has transformed the city's Soviet-style health care system, spawned a new Dubna university and given hundreds of local students an opportunity to live and study in the United States.
It is a remarkable coda to a life that could easily have been consumed by bitterness, for Mr. Bell's future was wrested from his hands by a twist of fate.
David Bell was born to Ukrainian schoolteachers, Nathan and Anna Belkovsky, who fled to Texas about 1910 after his grandfather died in anti-Jewish pogroms near Kiev. In Houston, Nathan Belkovsky opened a newsstand, then sold insurance, and entered America's middle class. They had three children, bought a four-room house and truncated the family name to Bell.
Then, in May 1931, Nathan Bell shepherded a group of tourists to Russia, and never returned.
"He met, well, a big chinovnik -- a big official in the Agriculture Ministry, an old friend who talked him into staying," Mr. Bell said. "So my father sent the group back and stayed on, and then he brought us over.
"Hey, I don't want to hurt my father's memory. But I call him naive."
THE Bell family arrived in Moscow that December and was crammed into two rooms of a house that had been carved into communal apartments. Mr. Bell's father taught English at the All-Union Scientific Institute of Vegetable Cultivation. His mother worked in a foreign-language bookshop.
They lived next to a top Communist bureaucrat. One day he asked Nathan Bell to give him one of the family's two rooms.
"Daddy refused," Mr. Bell recalled. "There were five of us. And the man said, 'Posmotrem' -- 'We'll see.' "
It was early 1938. On March 14, "a bright, sunny day," Stalin's police arrested Nathan Bell as he sat in his apartment eating cornflakes. A loyal Communist, he refused to confess to engaging in anti-Soviet activities. He was exiled to the Kazakhstan desert anyway. His family was put on the street.
At first they slept in a Moscow park. David Bell soon found a dormitory room in his school. His mother became a transient, caring for elderlypeople in exchange for a bed, until she could rejoin her husband in Kazakhstan in 1940.
"They had three happy years, until he died," Mr. Bell said. "The diagnosis was heart failure. But he had no job, no income. There was hunger, absolute weakness. The word I use is that life just seeped out of him."
David Bell saw brief military service near the end of World War II -- the army initially refused to draft him, calling him a security risk. Then he returned to Moscow and tried to build a life. He finished school, married and applied to teach English at a prestigious Moscow institute.
But fate was not finished with him.
In 1950 the government ordered him to teach in rural Siberia instead. His wife took their daughter and fled, unable to face a life of privation. Soon, Stalin began singling out Jews in the guise of a campaign against "cosmopolitanism," and Mr. Bell lived in fear of meeting his father's -- and grandfather's -- end.
"The camps were already placed," he said. "The railroad cars were ready to ship all the Jews out. And do you know what saved us? Good old Joe died."
With Stalin's passing, in 1953, came a reprieve from Siberia. Mr. Bell found a teaching job in Voskresensk, near Moscow. The name means city of resurrection, incongruous for a factory town so sooty that the snow turned black shortly after falling. But Mr. Bell was in fact reborn there.
As an instructor of aspiring teachers, he met and married his current wife. He also befriended a tall young student from a newly founded city devoted to nuclear research, called Dubna.
"I'd heard about Dubna," Mr. Bell said. "It was a city of science. So I said to him, 'It's my dream to go to Dubna.' And he looked at me and said, 'You will be there.' "
It took eight years. But in 1961, at age 40, Mr. Bell began teaching English at Dubna's School No. 8, across the street from his new apartment in a model Soviet city. He taught for two decades, then retired.
A few years later, in the late 1980's, a Russian friend brought him an English-language letter for translation, from Physicians for Social Responsibility in La Crosse.
Thus began Mr. Bell's second life -- or third, depending on one's count, and the founding of the Dubna-La Crosse Friendship Association, which has thrived through economic shocks, a divisive war in Yugoslavia and, so far, a split over war in Iraq.
"With his help, we've had active exchanges between doctors, municipal workers, businessmen, students, teachers and other categories," the mayor of Dubna, Valery E. Prokh, said in an interview. "We have deep relations with the people of La Crosse. And it's all attributable to David Natanovich Bell."
Mr. Bell eventually made it to the United States, and has returned about seven times since. But it is not home, despite what Stalin's henchmen stole from him. "Bitter?" he said. "I've been bitter all my life, especially when my father was arrested. I felt very sorry for him. He was a very honest man, a very conscientious man."
But in Dubna, he said, "there's something I have done which I'm proud of."
"Would you leave if you were me?" he asked.

HEADLINE: Eastern Europe, On a New Stage 

 BODY:
Most Eastern Europeans are looking forward to becoming full members of a European system that they hope will bring economic salvation and stability in a region scarred by memories of war and dictatorship. 
 But with the exception of eastern Germans, whose inspiration for revolution in 1989 came more from western Germany than across the Atlantic, they believe that only the United States can guarantee their security. 
 As the nations prepare to join the European Union, neither foreign investment nor political integration are going smoothly. In Poland, an unbridled enthusiasm for the United States is setting the tone. For eastern Germans, an uncomfortable union with the West is expressed in resistance to the American model that drives business there. 
And across the region, a hunger for economic growth and intellectual freedom is shaping a bloc distinct from any other, old or new.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: On Washington's Side; 
Poles Cherish U.S. as Friend, Fondly Recalling Its Support

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Waiting for a McKielbasa sandwich at a downtown outlet of the world's most ubiquitous American fast food chain, a 29-year-old economist did not hesitate when asked where he would stand if asked to choose between the United States and Europe.
 "America is a better partner for us and I trust America more than France or any other country," said the economist, Maciek Wesolowski, joking that he was buying the McDonald's sandwich -- a Polish sausage on a hamburger bun -- in honor of Polish-American friendship. 
 Poland, the largest and most economically promising of the 10 countries set to join the European Union, is unapologetic about its enthusiastic American allegiance and its vocal resistance to the current quest by two traditional European powers, France and Germany, to establish their political independence from the United States.
Like its Central and Eastern European cousins, Poland hopes integration into the European system will bring economic salvation and promote stability in a region still apprehensive from the memories of war. But most Poles believe that only the United States can guarantee the country's security. 
"As long as the U.S. is a functioning reality and a united Europe is a dream, we will always choose the reality over the dream," said Janusz Reiter, Poland's former ambassador to Germany and the director of the Warsaw-based Center for International Relations, a research organization.
That bodes ill for any swift and complete integration of the European Union, which began more than a half-century ago as a six-nation common market intended to bond Germany and France. The union now has 15 member nations, but with the addition next year of 10 mostly former Communist states, France and Germany may find their traditional dominance harder to maintain.
Certainly, this week's admonition by President Jacques Chirac of France to the Central and Eastern European candidate nations -- who support the American position on war with Iraq -- to keep silent rather than undermine European unity won France no friends in Poland. "He is trying to treat the E.U. candidates as a French colony or a French suburb," said Mr. Wesolowski over his McDonald's sandwich.
Squeezed for centuries between Germany, which last occupied and ravaged Poland in World War II, and Russia, whose Soviet dominance is an all too recent memory, Poles so yearn for closeness to America -- home of millions of Polish immigrants -- that some have even suggested the country should join the North American Free Trade Agreement, not the European Union.
But in the basement canteen of Warsaw University law school, Maciej Szczerba, a recent graduate, hunched over a wooden table to explain that, despite reservations, Poland had "no alternative" to the European trading bloc.
More than 20 percent of Poland's working-age youth is unemployed, and economic growth has slowed since the burst of the 1990's to 1.3 percent in the last two years.
"The mood is very gloomy and everybody is waiting for E.U. accession," Mr. Szczerba, 24, said.
European Union membership next year will bring in billions of dollars in subsidies for infrastructure, and gradually grant Poles the coveted right to work and live anywhere in the member states -- a stark contrast with the closed borders of Communist years.
Yet ambivalence persists. There have been large protests against the European Union by Poland's numerous farmers. Two opposition parties argue that membership will dilute Poland's national identity. The Rev. Tadeusz Rydzyk, a charismatic priest who controls one of the country's most popular radio stations, worries that it will erode the country's strong Catholic faith.
There is serious concern among government officials and diplomats that a referendum in June on joining the European Union may fail to draw the minimum 50 percent of the electorate required.
"Poles aren't enthusiastic about being subsumed by another entity, given their history of being subsumed," said a Western diplomat who has lived for many years in the country.
Indeed, as elsewhere in Eastern Europe, these questions of national identity, economic welfare and the frequently small-bore politics of emerging democracies often overwhelm global matters -- like possible war in Iraq -- as a matter of everyday conversation.
Polls show that the majority of Poles oppose war with Iraq -- a rare instance of not following the government in its pro-American position -- but the opposition is mostly passive. When hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people turned out to protest a possible war in Western European capitals last weekend, fewer than 2,000 protesters gathered in Warsaw.
There is none of that hesitation, however, about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which the Poles -- along with the Czechs and Hungarians -- joined in 1999.
The NATO flag flies above the presidential palace in Warsaw; from 2008, thanks to the purchase of 48 F-16 fighters from the United States, Poland will be able to fly in alliance operations.
That purchase of American rather than European warplanes has particularly angered European Union officials because it will spend money freed from the state budget by incoming European Union subsidies.
"Poland has become one of our most important allies at NATO, given its strong military capabilities and clear political will to face the problem of global terrorism," the United States ambassador at NATO, Nicholas Burns, said this week.
Julius Janiszewski, 24, a law student at Warsaw University whose great-grandfather was killed by the Germans, said of Poland's support for the United States, "We always felt when we were oppressed that America supported us, even during Communist times."
As an example of how America can be counted on to act, Mr. Janiszewski pointed to the wars in the Balkans in the 1990's. "A horrific war with terrible atrocities was stopped, not by France or Germany or the European Union, but by America," he said.
Mr. Reiter, the former ambassador to Germany, was clearer yet about Poland's reluctance to follow any European policy that might mar the alliance with the United States. "If France considers this need for emancipation from the U.S. as the basis for a common European security policy, it will not be supported by Eastern European countries," he said.
Yet it is plain to Polish diplomats that Europe cannot be just an economic unit, with no political voice. "We believe there is much sense in having a strong European voice," Poland's foreign minister, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, said in an interview. "But why must that be seen as competition or in contradiction with America?"
"The real problem is the method to achieve that common position," he said, adding that no country could expect to dominate the process. "We all have to learn how to live in a bigger family and in a family of equals."
Mr. Reiter said: "The alternative is an economic bloc within which there would be political coalitions, and ad hoc coalitions would create an unbearable distrust between countries in Europe. It would destroy everything we've built since World War II."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: The Intellectuals; 
Artists Feel Chirac's Slap, But Hesitate to Take Sides

BYLINE:  By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: ONDON, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Questions of the United States versus Europe, or even of "old Europe" versus "new Europe," mean little to the Hungarian novelist and Nobel Prize winner Imre Kertesz, whose sympathies transcend such geographic distinctions. 
 "As an artist, I am European," said Mr. Kertesz, 73, who divides his time between Budapest and Berlin. But he cannot shake off his emotional attachment to the United States, which he has visited just once but which liberated him from Buchenwald and much later helped release Hungary from Communism. 
 "Freedom during the cold war and the development of democracy would not have been possible without American protection," Mr. Kertesz said in a telephone interview from Berlin. "There are very important ties between Europe and America, which helped save Europe from two dictatorships. This applies especially to Western Germany, where I now live, which has a lot to be grateful for." 
Like Mr. Kertesz -- and unlike many of their counterparts in Western Europe -- several writers and other cultural figures from Eastern and Central Europe who were interviewed this week seemed reluctant to take sides in the increasingly fraught dispute that is fracturing old political alliances. 
Yet it is hard for these European intellectuals -- silenced under decades of Communism and often centuries of authoritarian, alien rule before that -- to ignore the outburst by Jacques Chirac, the French president, who accused Europeans in the east of being "badly brought up" for siding with the United States over Iraq. 
Mr. Chirac's comments were a slap in the face to many in the east, and they are going to be hard to forget in the countries that have applied for membership in that European club, the European Union. 
"Chirac's remarks have highlighted more than anything else that the E.U. has a long way to go before it lives up to its ideal of equality for all of its members," said Jiri Pehe, director of New York University in Prague and until early this month chief political adviser to the just-retired Czech president, Vaclav Havel. "Many people in the candidate countries have long been convinced that their countries won't be admitted to the E.U. as equals."
Nor, he and others believe, is it fair to force the countries in the east to choose between the United States and Western Europe. 
"I have always been pro-American, and for me that in itself entailed being pro-European," said Krzysztof Czyzewski, a former dissident theater director and president of the Borderland Foundation, a cultural group in Sejny, Poland. It was not until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and he could enjoy closer contacts with the West, he said, that he discovered -- to his surprise and chagrin -- that there was a growing anti-Americanism bubbling up in Western Europe. 
He said he still considered himself both pro-American and pro-European -- in the sense of all of Europe, east and west. "The fact that President Chirac, and similarly minded politicians, think the two to be contradictory results from a different understanding of what it means to be European today," he said. 
Poles -- and others who fell under Communist rule after 1945 -- cannot forgive Western Europe for sacrificing them to Stalin at Yalta, Mr. Czyzewski said, and cannot help but perceive the rise of dictators like Saddam Hussein through the prism of their own history. "That is precisely why we feel that Mr. Chirac has no mandate to instruct, on anything, the very countries which just recently freed themselves from the totalitarian regime," he said. 
Attitudes from the east toward the western players in the current drama vary considerably from country to country and from generation to generation, of course. In Poland, where the close ties between the old-style intelligentsia and France largely fell away during World War II and the cold war, there is a feeling that Mr. Chirac's remarks have creepy Soviet-era echoes.
"Mr. Chirac's words were more or less like the words we heard from the Kremlin for the previous 50 years of Communism -- that you are not equal partners; that you should behave the way we like and not do anything on your own; that you are a second-class country," said Andrzej Kapiszewski, a professor of sociology and political science at Krakow University in Poland. 
Many Romanians, too, feel piqued by the French lecture. "Romanians have always perceived the French as being their close European friends, and they think it's a bit disconcerting to see your friend talking to you that way," said Matei Paun, a businessman who runs an Internet news group.
Yet the pragmatic side of Mr. Paun feels a certain sympathy for Mr. Chirac, and other guardians of Western Europe's history and material riches. "Chirac is a member of a club that has rights over new entries, and he is entitled to his conditions for entry," he said. 
The French and German position presents a particular quandary for Eastern Europeans who came west during the Communist years and never moved back home. Tzvetan Todorov, a historian and moral philosopher from Bulgaria who moved to Paris 40 years ago, when he was 24, said he could see both sides. 
"If I were Bulgarian today, I would say that the only country that can protect me if a threat appears from my immediate neighbor, Russia, is the United States," he said. "But as a Western European, I can understand why Chirac and others are irritated. The Iraq crisis has had one clear consequence, in that it shows the difficulty of creating political and military unity in Europe."
The Czech writer Ivan Klima, who unlike Mr. Havel did not engage in politics during the Communist years -- or since -- said he found the Western European position on Iraq to be "a little more clever and realistic" than that of the United States.
But describing his deep affection for the United States and the greatest influences on his writing -- the works of Britons like Graham Greene and Americans like Hemingway, Faulkner and Philip Roth -- he said he hated to have to choose between the two angry allies. 
"I don't think we should prefer Europe against America, and I don't think we should prefer America against Europe," he said. "I think we could use this moment to work to be on one side together."

HEADLINE: For Democrats, an Early Chance to Sample the 2004 Line of Presidential Candidates 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Four Democratic presidential candidates strongly criticized President Bush's economic policies today in speeches before party leaders here. But they clashed over United States policy toward Iraq, a hint of one of the few issues about which the Democratic field disagrees.
 The remarks came at the first of two days of appearances by candidates, both formally declared and still in the "exploratory" stage, at the winter meeting of the Democratic National Committee. Party leaders from across the country packed a basement ballroom to view this early showcase of most of the presidential candidates. 
 One leading contender, Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, is recovering from prostate cancer and was not on hand, depriving this influential group of Democrats of an opportunity to take a full measure of the field.
The four speakers today provided a fiery tonic to party leaders who remain distressed about their losses in November yet confident about unseating Mr. Bush in 2004. They cheered and applauded as the candidates presented the lines and arguments they have been offering in living rooms and small venues across the country -- though former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri drew the day's warmest receptions by far.
Dr. Dean moved to distinguish himself sharply from his rivals. Taking advantage of the fact that he is not a sitting member of Congress, he criticized Democrats who had supported White House policies for the past two years, starting with the Iraq resolution last year. Dr. Dean did not even bother to warm up his crowd, starting his attack immediately after walking to his microphone.
"What I want to know is why in the world the Democratic Party leadership is supporting the president's unilateral attack on Iraq?" he asked, to applause from most of his audience. "What I want to know is why are Democratic leaders supporting tax cuts? The question is not how big the tax cut should be; the question should be, Can we afford a tax cut at all, with the largest deficit in the history of this country?"
"I'm Howard Dean, and I'm here to represent the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party," he said.
Dr. Dean did not mention any names either in his speech or in an interview afterward. But the meaning of his remarks was not lost on anyone in a room where Democrats were torn on the issue of Iraq.
Dr. Dean followed Mr. Gephardt, who noted in his own speech that he had helped to write the resolution authorizing Mr. Bush to move against Saddam Hussein. At that, a man in the back of the hall shouted, "Shame!" Mr. Gephardt did not even cast a look in his direction.
Former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois restated her opposition to a war, arguing that Mr. Bush's policies had hurt the nation's standing in the world community.
The fourth candidate who spoke today, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, again declared his support for removing Mr. Hussein from power in a speech that drew a respectful if restrained reception.
"I know that some in our party and our nation and many around the world are against the use of force in Iraq," Mr. Lieberman said, "but the history of the last century teaches us the consequences of unchecked power and unconventional weapons in the hands of an inhumane tyrant." 
Mr. Kerry and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, who is scheduled to speak here on Saturday, also voted in favor of the Iraq resolution. Scheduled to speak on Saturday as well are Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who both oppose invading Iraq.
At times, the meeting today had the feel of a political convention. Dr. Dean filled the hotel with young supporters holding signs -- "The Doctor Is In," they read -- and loudly chanting his name.
Mr. Edwards appeared, with some flourish, at noon, walking slowly amid a throng through the hotel lobby and into a bar to greet party regulars taking a break. With Mr. Kerry absent, his aides flooded the hotel, trying to measure support and nail down commitments.
In interviews, Democrats spoke highly of Dr. Dean, saying he had with his speech provided a sense of ideology and passion that many said had been absent among Democrats in last year's Congressional elections.
But Mr. Gephardt -- who as the former House minority leader took much of the blame for last year's defeats -- drew reviews that were almost as warm.
"Howard Dean has a little Clintonesque in him: I think he let his passion show through," said Mike Erlandson, chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. "But Gephardt might have won on his policies."
Indeed, in many ways, the day might prove to be especially beneficial for Mr. Gephardt, who is a regular and perhaps overly familiar figure to many Democrats here looking for a fresh face.
Mr. Gephardt drew repeated cheers, laughter and standing ovations as he belittled the Bush administration and displayed what many Democrats said was the first thing they were looking for in a candidate: the gumption to take on Mr. Bush.
"There's an old saying: If you're handed lemons, try to turn it into lemonades," Mr. Gephardt said. "Well, this president got a great big pitcher of lemonade and he's busy turning it into a lemon economy."

HEADLINE: Report Card From Mayor Says Cuts Have Not Eroded Services Yet 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The budget has been cut four times, but essential services have not yet eroded, according to statistics released by the Bloomberg administration yesterday.
 The administration's preliminary Mayor's Management Report, a report card on city agencies, covers the first four months of the fiscal year, which began in July, and sets goals for the coming year. 
 The report is a vastly overhauled version of the Giuliani administration's management report, which came out twice a year. That report was short on numbers and long on prose, much of it praising each agency and the administration. 
In contrast, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's report is chockablock with performance statistics for every city agency, from the percentage of cable service complaints resolved by the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications to the occupancy rate of the city's public housing complexes. 
The report says most city agencies have been able to meet their goals so far this year, especially in crime reduction and other important quality-of-life areas, as defined by the administration. Areas in which performance was strongest tended to be those that deal with administrative and community service functions, as well as cultural affairs. Health, human services and education agencies did less well. 
Some areas of service deteriorated as a result of budget cuts or for other reasons. The Department of Homeless Services has been unable to find enough shelter or permanent housing for homeless people. Because of budget constraints that have delayed construction of six ambulance sites, the city has not reached its goal of having 90 percent of advanced-life-support ambulances responding in less than 10 minutes; 79 percent met that standard.
The Department of Health inspects fewer restaurants, and is not expected to meet its goal of 100 percent by the end of the year. And in spite of the mayor's promise to reduce the escalating price of garbage collection, the cost per ton to process city refuse rose to $257 from $243 from fiscal years 2001 to 2002. 
Other data seemed to reflect a protracted economic downturn in the city. The number of people getting Medicaid benefits grew 27.6 percent, to 2.1 million recipients, many of them receiving Disaster Relief Medicaid offered after the Sept. 11 attack. Similarly, the number of people getting food stamp assistance in the city increased 3.4 percent, to 836,000.

HEADLINE: Chirac Pledges French Support for African Prosperity 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS FULLER, International Herald Tribune 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
Seeking to renew and extend French ties with Africa, President Jacques Chirac told African leaders at a summit meeting today that France would be a "tireless advocate" for their interests and a catalyst for their prosperity.
 Responding to criticism that Europe's farm subsidy program hurts African farmers, Mr. Chirac announced ambitious proposals to help the troubled continent's economies, including a moratorium on subsidies on European exports to Africa. 
 Mr. Chirac said that he would urge other rich nations to consider ways of stabilizing prices for key commodities such as coffee and cotton and would propose that Africa be given special trade privileges above and beyond other regions. 
At the same time, the French leader sought to extend his campaign to avoid war in Iraq, rallying to his side the more than 50 African leaders in attendance.
French officials distributed what they said was a joint statement on the Iraq question.
"There is an alternative to war," the document said, adding that the leaders were expressing their support for continued inspections and for substantially reinforcing the "human and technical capacities" of the inspectors.
Three of the countries whose leaders were at the meeting -- Guinea, Cameroon and Angola -- are nonpermanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Their votes are considered crucial in the event of a future United Nations resolution on the Iraq question.
But there were doubts Friday on how the joint statement had been produced. President Paul Kagame of Rwanda said he was never consulted about it.
"Nobody asked me my opinion," he said. "We didn't even discuss it." 
President Chirac appeared to continue his political tug-of-war with the United States over more than just Iraq. He seemed to be referring to Washington when he said his economic proposals regarding Africa could meet with some resistance.
The proposals, he said would "naturally" meet with opposition at global trade talks, but he vowed to mobilize the world's richest countries to his side.
"Africa," he said, "will be able to count on its real friends."
But one expert on Europe's agricultural program said the proposal for a moratorium on export subsidies to Africa was largely symbolic and taken alone was likely to do little to help.
"I would be on the cynical side here," said Johan Swinnen, a professor at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.
Analysts said President Chirac's proposals were an effort to deflect criticism that Europe's farm policy harms African farmers by dumping cheap sugar, dairy products and meat onto the market.
Professor Swinnen said focusing solely on Africa would have a very limited economic impact for the region because if the European Union continued to subsidize exports to other parts of the world, the global market price would be depressed anyway. This would continue to hurt farmers in Africa.
As Mr. Chirac offered concessions to Africa, the country's agriculture minister, Herve Gaymard, signaled that Paris would continue to take a hard line on broader trade talks and oppose efforts to dismantle Europe's system of trade tariffs and subsidies.
"I don't think we'll have a deal by March 31," Mr. Gaymard said of a deadline at the World Trade Organization.
He described negotiations between the European Union and other countries eager to sharply reduce tariffs on farm products as a "dialogue of the deaf."
In an interview with a group of American and British journalists today, Mr. Gaymard vigorously defended Europe's agriculture subsidies.
He said Europe needed to maintain the policy in order to preserve the culture of farm life.
He spoke of a fundamental split between "our Anglo-Saxon friends who have a purely commercial vision of agriculture" and the French, who believe "rural areas should be inhabited by human beings."
The European Union is responsible for about 90 percent of the approximately $5 billion spent on export subsidies every year, according to Ken Ash, an agriculture expert at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris.
Subsidizing exports is illegal according to world trading rules but agriculture, a sensitive issue in Europe, Japan and the United States, has been permitted as an exception.
Closing the summit meeting, President Chirac sought to secure a role as Africa's peacemaker.
He urged warring factions in Ivory Coast to stand by the deal that his government had brokered.
Mr. Chirac brushed off criticism about the invitation of Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, who was allowed to attend despite a travel ban imposed on him by the European Union because of allegations of human rights abuses.

HEADLINE: Bids Scarce, Sotheby's Takes Itself Offthe Block 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Sotheby's Holdings, the auction house that has struggled through a price-fixing scandal and financial troubles, has been successful in selling multimillion-dollar paintings in this poor economy, but cannot seem to find a buyer for itself.
 Sotheby's and A. Alfred Taubman, its largest shareholder, announced yesterday that they had agreed to take Sotheby's off the block. In an eight-month search for a buyer, the 259-year-old company had several flirtations but no firm bidders. 
 "Ourboard met this week and it was our recommendation to concentrate on the business," said William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby's chief executive. "The future opportunity for any sale of this company will be dramatically different in a different economy." 
The announcement comes as Mr. Taubman, who is serving time in prison for his role in the scandal, and his family are fighting a hostile takeover of the shopping malls they control. The Simon Property Group, the nation's largest mall owner, has sought to acquire Taubman Centers, which owns the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey and the Beverly Center in Los Angeles. Taubman Centers and the Taubman family have rejected the bid and are being sued by Simon Property, which says Taubman Centers has failed to fulfill its fiduciary duty to shareholders by rejecting the offer.
Faced with the prospect of losing the shopping center empire he spent a lifetime creating, Mr. Taubman, according to people who know him, wants more than ever to hang on to Sotheby's, which he considers the jewel of his businesses.
In June, Sotheby's announced that it was exploring the possibility of a sale or merger. Goldman, Sachs, which has been Mr. Taubman's adviser, together with Morgan Stanley and J. P. Morgan, which represented Sotheby's, said at that time that they were contacting "qualified parties" who might have an interest in Sotheby's. 
Mr. Ruprecht said that "right through this week Sotheby's kept talking to people who were interested in the company."
Over the last few months, Sotheby's held talks with Edgar Bronfman Jr., who is on the board of Vivendi Universal; eBay, the online auction site; the American International Group, the finance and insurance company; and UBS, the Swiss bank, among others. These courtships fell apart early in the negotiations, said several officials at Sotheby's, who insisted on anonymity.
Last April, Mr. Taubman was sentenced to a year and a day in a prison in Rochester, Minn., for his role in the price-fixing scheme with his counterpart at Christie's. Some people at the auction house said yesterday that it was too hard to negotiate a sale of Sotheby's while its former chairman and largest shareholder is in jail. Moreover, no one was willing to offer a price Mr. Taubman considered acceptable.
Over the last year, Sotheby's has been trying to improve its dismal finances. Last month, it sold its 10-story New York headquarters to RFR Holding, the commercial real estate company, for $175 million, and then rented the building back for $18 million a year. 
Sotheby's said that it was using the money from the building sale to pay off $100 million in loans and fines connected with the price-fixing scandal. It has also reduced its worldwide staff to 1,700 employees from 2,100. More staff cuts are expected soon, Sotheby's officials said.
In 1983, when Mr. Taubman, 79, bought the auction house, which was then ailing, he was seen as a white knight. Five years later, he took the company public. Mr. Taubman owns about 13.2 million Class B shares of Sotheby's Holdings, which represents a 62.9 percent voting stake in the company.
Shares of Sotheby's fell 7 cents yesterday, to $8.25. Shares of Sotheby's traded as high as $47 a share in 1999, before the price-fixing charges against Mr. Taubman were disclosed.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE NORTHERN FRONT; 
U.S. and Turkey Reach Accord to Let G.I.'s Establish a Base

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 

 BODY:
The United States has reached agreement with Turkey on a package of $15 billion in immediate economic and military aid, in a step that is expected to pave the way for American troops to use Turkish territory as a base in case of war with Iraq, administration officials said today.
 The Turkish Parliament is expected to approve the arrangement next week, the officials said. 
 The United States had been discussing an offer of $26 billion with the Turks. But much of that money was to be given over a number of years. The breakthrough in the talks was said to have come when the United States focused on what could be furnished to Turkey this year. 
That sum was $6 billion in immediate cash, with roughly $1 billion of that money set aside to guarantee $10 billion in American loans for Turkey's immediate needs, the officials said. Turkey would then have many years to pay those loans off. 
A few details on the timing and makeup of the loans remained subject to negotiations over the weekend. But American officials were optimistic that this could be done. 
"There will be a deal," said an administration official involved in the talks with Turkey. "The two sides are finally in the same universe. The Turks have to decide exactly how they want the money, but the money totals are set."
Despite the agreement on money, Turkey and the United States are still ironing out a separate point of contention, over the size and role of Turkish troops in northern Iraq, officials said. Turkey plans to send large numbers of troops into with American forces and carry out relief efforts for refugees.
American officials said they hope to resolve all the financial and military issues by Monday or Tuesday. But some acknowledged that the disagreement on the role of the Turkish military in Iraq could prove to be a long-term irritant, no matter how it is resolved for now. 
Turkey wants to send tens of thousands of troops into Iraq to prevent a repetition of the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War of 1991, when hundreds of thousands of Kurdish refugees jammed the Iraqi-Turkish border and flooded into Turkey itself.
But the United States is concerned that Turkey might use its troops to exercise control in northern Iraq, prevent the Kurds from establishing their own state and possibly to demand oil concessions in Iraq. The ultimate American fear is that such a force might, in turn, encourage Iran to send in a force of its own to control the Shiite portions of southern Iraq, potentially fracturing the country.
A senior American official said the role of Turkish forces would be "primarily humanitarian" but that the specifics of what they would do might be worked out as the war gets under way. He expressed confidence that a Turkish presence "will not prevent us from reaching our objective" of maintaining Iraq's territorial unity.
The consummation of an aid package and a deal to get Turkish participation would be a crucial development in establishing a northern front for a war, American military officials say.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who was flying to Asia today on a mission to deal with the crisis over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, said Turkish and American negotiators would try to resolve everything "over the next two to three days" with the hope of getting Turkish parliamentary approval "early next week." 
Administration officials said that the future role of Turkish troops may be determined more specifically by Turkish and American military officials as they work together in the event of a war. Turkey and the United States, both NATO allies, have a long record of military cooperation.
But there are signs that Turkey and the United States may not see eye-to-eye until the fighting begins, if then. Today, for example, the Turkish foreign minister, Yasar Yakis, said Turkey expected its forces to number "several times more than the number of the American troops" in northern Iraq.
That statement suggested that the Turkish presence could be in the range of tens of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of troops, an enormous contingent by any standard.
Mr. Yakis said the Turkish goal was to make sure that the semi-autonomous Kurdish region that has taken root in northern Iraq does not become a full-fledged Kurdish nation that would then have designs on adjacent territory with large Kurdish populations in Turkey itself. He said it took some time for Turkey to persuade the United States of its concern.
Turkish troops, he said, "would go down to the south only as far as necessary," and would "never" try to occupy Mosul or Kirkuk, two areas where Americans fear that Turkey wants concessions on oil reserves.
In Washington, the Turkish ambassador to the United States, O. Faruk Logoglu, said he was "disheartened" by what he called "Turkey-bashing" in the United States over the delay in the American-Turkish deal. He asserted that given overwhelming opposition among the Turks to a war, Prime Minister Abdullah Gul was "taking a risk" in taking the vote to Parliament, even if the aid package was worked out. 
The $15 billion aid figure for Turkey was frantically worked out in recent days after the Turks rebuffed earlier American offers. According to an administration official, the Turks first came in some months ago with a request for $92 billion in aid over five years.
Turkey has asked for the money to handle what it fears will be an economic crisis in the event of war, including the possibility of an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Turkish leaders are still bitter that aid promised during the 1991 Persian Gulf war did not materialize and were determined not to be hurt again.
An American official said "one obvious question" was why Turkey could not leverage all $6 billion into a loan of $60 billion. The answer, he said, was the desire not to plunge Turkey into such deep indebtedness that it could not repay the loan.
As part of the deal, Turkey would also agree to continue abiding by International Monetary Fund curbs to maintain fiscal austerity, keep budget deficits down and expand its privatization program.

HEADLINE: WHY WE LOVE FASHION? IT'S THE PASSION.; 
Going Postal

BYLINE:  By Sarah Raper Larenaudie; Sarah Raper Larenaudie is a freelance writer in Paris.

 BODY:
Last fall, while readers of The Economist sparred over whether the United Nations had a double standard in dealing with Israel and Iraq, Vogue readers were in a lather over the magazine's unusual October cover. There was the supermodel Christy Turlington, belly down on a blue wooden bench, arched like the figurehead on a ship's prow. Doesn't everyone do yoga in a hammered-silk-satin Calvin Klein evening gown?
 "I have never seen a more undignified fashion magazine cover than your October issue," one Beverly Hills reader wrote. "The model's pose was reminiscent of the elderly lady in the TV ad whose catch phrase was 'I've fallen and I can't get up.' I know Christy does yoga but it isn't pretty." Others, including a yoga teacher, wrote in to say that Turlington was doing the pose incorrectly, and one blasted the magazine for calling her "the guru of breathing" -- "judging by your photos of her yoga technique she has a long way to go toward perfection in that department." 
 But even more Vogue readers -- all cursed with the same sticky computer key -- begged to differ. "FINALLY!!! A real cover for Vogue!! I was so pleased to see the return of a Super Model no less on the October cover. Now that is what Vogue is all about. Art and Beauty!" And: "Unreal! Stunning! Steven Klein's cover photo of Christy Turlington is the strongest and most modern image in women's fashion that I have seen in a while." One man from Santa Rosa, Calif., trilled: "Brains, integrity, guts, and principles . . . not to mention a face that makes men cry. . . . If this is what a 'dumb model' is, I hope my granddaughter grows up to be one!" 
Vogue, Elle and W receive hundreds of letters each month and select a dozen or so for publication. (Surprisingly, Glenda Bailey, editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, killed the letters page when she came in. "Our readers tell us they would rather have another page of fashion than a page of letters," explains Jenny Barnett, the deputy editor in chief.) As a genre, fashion letters have a style all their own. Newsmagazine readers tend to be dismayed, saddened or encouraged but are forever measured, even in the face of genocide or famine. Not fashion freaks -- they are "tickled" by the choice of a cover, they "enthuse" over photos, they are "scratching that itch," and they are probably doing more than any other group to save the interjection "Kudos!" from extinction.
And the letter writers are masters at the backhanded compliment. "Vogue, with its excellent articles and fabulous pictures, is my favorite nonessential reading," writes Margie Bauman, of Wasilla, Alaska. Agnes Cashen of Waterloo, Iowa, writes: "Receiving W each month is a delight. My eye devours every page. Well, nearly every page -- some may be a bit grotesque." 
Fairchild Publications' editorial director, Patrick McCarthy, says, "I'm fascinated by the model experts." He changes voices to mimic the archetype: "Thank you for putting Natalia on the cover.' Now even that requires some kind of inside knowledge -- you have to know who Natalia is." Not only do readers know the girls -- the model is Natalia Vodianova -- but they also keep score: Mary Markova, of Bal Harbour, Fla., praised Vogue editors for putting the "glorious Carmen Kass" on the cover of the bathing-suit issue last spring: "It's her second May Vogue cover, and she totally deserves it." Of the Brazilian model Gisele Bundchen, Lillian Rodriguez of San Jose, Calif., wrote to W: "What sets Gisele apart from all the other models? Her chest! . . . The next time you write an article about this model call it 'Gisele's Breasts."'
Eventually you have to wonder, Who are these people? Are they for real? At Harper's Bazaar during the Liz Tilberis reign, they were often not, according to a former staff member. McCarthy and the editors at Vogue and Elle insist otherwise at their magazines; that editors call all those whose letters are selected in an effort to root out any fakes. For example, Alexander Ives, of Palm Beach, Fla., a 24-year-old employee in a law firm, picked up his mother's copy of W, saw Paris Hilton at Siouxsie Sioux's party and headed to the computer. "These Hilton sisters are everywhere, I had just seen them on TV," he explains in a phone call. "With war in Iraq 60 days away, it's annoying that these people are pushed forward."
Other letters are from serial correspondents who consider it their duty to report back from the heartland. "I am very vocal and I love fashion," explains Baroness Belle von der Goltz of Needham, Mass., whose most recent letter, decrying three scary fashion shoots, was published in the January W: "Thank goodness it was Halloween when I received the November issue of W. . . . I hate trying to exhume something wearable from all that witchy brew. Modern times are scary enough."
Though the baroness has had letters published before, it's not as if she has nothing else to do: she's a mom, anchors a local cable show and markets a collection of scarfs online. She says she once canceled her W subscription for several years because the social coverage became too Manhattan-centric. Currently, her chief beef is the way the fashion magazines show unwearable clothes or publish photos so blurry that the fashion disappears. "I do feel the reader has a responsibility to react," she explains in a telephone interview. "It gets back to freedom of speech." Even when her letters are not published, she says: "I feel I've gotten it out of my system, and somebody has read it. Maybe after enough letters one might be able to have a smidgen of influence."
Such heresy! Cancel her subscriptions! Banish her from Neiman's! The baroness should know full well that fashion magazines are about as democratic as elections in Iraq. And yet, she and other readers have found the perfect way to pester dictatorial editors.
At Vogue, letter writers have long complained that older women and normal body types (as opposed to rail-thin models) are excluded, prompting the editor in chief, Anna Wintour, to recently organize an "Age Issue" and a "Shape Issue." Some thought Vogue did not go far enough: "The list of body types on the April issue's cover leaves out the most prevalent type in the country!" harrumphed Rachel Avidon of New York. "What are we fatties supposed to wear, sackcloth and ashes?" For others it was over the top: "Fat is fat," wrote C. Wilson of Philadelphia. "When I browse through the pages of Vogue I want to see slim models that make you get off the sofa, put down that pizza and exercise."
McCarthy doesn't remember any specific changes made to W as a result of readers' letters. "You absorb it," he says. "I pay attention to an avalanche." An urbane man who likes to maintain his distance, he concedes that he is intrigued by his self-appointed kitchen cabinet. "It's a strange kind of democracy."
Roberta Myers, the editor in chief of Elle, says she's aiming for "an informed dinner party" on the page, where new facts and angles are added to articles previously published.
Vogue's letters page is the longest running -- it was started in the 1980's by the former editor in chief Grace Mirabella. Every month, Phyllis Rifield, who handles reader information, prepares a memo for Wintour on readers' letters and phone calls -- the magazine typically receives 500 to 700 each month. Rifield sorts them into 30 or so tidy categories, like "Gwen Stefani's Refusal to Wear Fur Hat"; "Fingers on Model's Shoulder"; "Anorexic Models"; and "Nuts/Cranks." She tabulates overall impressions, too.
* "Loves Vogue." Like Ivan Kovacevic of New York: "As a male reader of Vogue, I find that it is much more to me than just a fashion magazine; it is a comrade and adviser."
* "Does Not Love Vogue." Like Margaret Ryalls of Charlottesville, Va.: "The Age issue, the Shape issue, the Power issue. What's next? The Boring issue?"
Vogue's managing editor, Laurie Jones, who selects the letters for publication, says: "We get readers complaining that the magazine is too heavy. Someone wrote to say they could not read it in the bathtub." If fur is photographed, the letters pour in; ditto for cigarettes. (Those often are organized campaigns.) "I got a letter from a man who wishes we would write more about feet -- I guess he's obsessed," Jones says. "And there's a psychotherapist with skin cancer who wants us to lobby for a return to carrying a parasol." (Unlikely, Jones says.)
Readers want actresses banned from the cover. They want to be in the magazine themselves. "Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine you would one day do a fashion story in El Salvador," Alejandro Gardia of Los Angeles wrote to W. "I've never seen pictures of my country as beautifully diverse. . . . My only complaint is, 'Where was I?"'
At least once, back in 1972, the direct pitch worked. Nine-year-old John Scher, who is now a designer, sent a letter to editors at Fairchild Publications, the publisher of the fashion trade paper Women's Wear Daily, which started W the same year. He enclosed sketches and fabric descriptions and suggested retail prices, and amused editors ran an interview with the boy. Soon after, the story goes, Oscar de la Renta and Bill Blass were spotted at Orsini's lunching with "a dwarf," in John Fairchild's words, and Life magazine picked up the story.
Don't expect the same indulgence today. Overall, Jones says she's looking for "humor, intelligence and insights" when choosing letters, but "I wouldn't want to print anything hurtful to the subject." At W, McCarthy worries about libel and whether the information in the letters can be verified, but he isn't one to lose sleep over "hurtful." So W's "Readers React" page, like the magazine, has a high threshold for snobbery and cattiness, so long as readers are witty and McCarthy and his editors are chuckling.
* "I was wondering if you could tell me what kind of beauty you see in Lady Victoria Hervey ('London's Newest Bad Girl,' August)? She looks more like a trashy beauty than a Lady." (Veronica Del Llano, Redlands, Calif.)
* "Your March cover left me wondering who the slutty-looking blonde was. To my horror, I discovered it was the previously gorgeous brunette Gisele. . . . What did you do to her?" (Aleta Carpenter, Newport Beach, Calif.)
* "How about this scenario?" began one letter criticizing the magazine's unflattering article on Anna Nicole Smith. "Anna Nicole Smith uses some of her inheritance to buy W and then fires the entire staff. I do believe that could also be considered a social makeover." (Maxine DeOld, Newton, N.J.)
Every now and then, the readers have the last laugh.

HEADLINE: Fortress America 

BYLINE:  By Matthew Brzezinski; Matthew Brzezinski, a contributing writer for the magazine, last wrote about the detention of Hady Hassan Omar, a Muslim immigrant.

 BODY:
In the last several weeks, as preparations for the war against Iraq have heated up, it has begun to sink in that this will be a different conflict from what we have seen before -- that there may, in fact, be two fronts, one far away on the ground in the Middle East, the other right here at home. For the first time in history, it seems plausible that an enemy might mount a sustained attack on the United States, using weapons of terrorism. The term "soft targets," which refers to everyday places like offices, shopping malls, restaurants and hotels, is now casually dropped into conversation, the way military planners talk about "collateral damage." 
 Earlier this month, the federal government raised the official terrorism alert level and advised Americans to prepare a "disaster supply kit," including duct tape to seal windows against airborne toxins. Members of Congress organized news conferences to demand that passenger jets be outfitted with missile-avoidance systems. In major public areas of cities, the police presence has been especially conspicuous, with weapons ostentatiously displayed. Whatever the details, the message was the same: war is on the way here. 
 The impossible questions begin with where, what and how, and end with what to do about it. Sgt. George McClaskey, a Baltimore cop, spends his days thinking about the answers, and one cold day recently, he took me out in an old police launch to survey Baltimore harbor. He showed me some of the new security measures, like the barriers at the approach to the harbor, which rose out of the water like stakes in a moat. Cables were suspended between these reinforced pylons, designed to slice into approaching high-speed craft and decapitate would-be suicide bombers before they reached their mark. It looked fairly daunting.
Then McClaskey maneuvered the boat toward an unprotected stretch of Baltimore's Inner Harbor. With the temperature dipping into the teens, the place was empty. But when the weather is warm, up to a quarter of a million people congregate on these piers and brightly painted promenades every weekend.
"If I wanted to create a big bang," McClaskey said, adopting the mind-set of a suicide bomber, "I'd pack a small boat with explosives and crash it right there." He pointed to a promenade. "It'd be a catastrophe," he declared. "It would take 48 hours just for the tide to flush out the bodies from under the boardwalk."
The port is lined with large oil terminals, storage tanks and petrochemical facilities, incendiaries in need only of a lighted fuse. Even the Domino sugar refinery, with its sticky-sweet flammable dust, poses a threat. "Most people don't think about it," McClaskey said, "but that's a giant bomb." 
The list of vulnerabilities is perilously long in Baltimore, as it is just about everywhere in the United States. And every one of those potential targets can set in motion an ever-broadening ripple effect. Should terrorists manage to blow up an oil terminal in Baltimore, for instance, the nearby ventilation systems for the I-95 tunnel would have to be shut. Shut down the tunnel, and the Interstate highway must be closed. Close down a section of I-95, and traffic along the entire Eastern Seaboard snarls to a halt. 
"So how would you defend against frogmen blowing up half the harbor?" I asked McClaskey. 
The sergeant shrugged uneasily. "Honestly," he confessed, "I don't think it's possible." Like most law enforcement officers in this country, McClaskey has been trained to catch crooks, not to stop submerged suicide bombers. Imagining doomsday possibilities is one thing; we've all become good at it these past 18 months. Coming up with counterterror solutions is another story, often beyond the scope of our imaginations. But while that expertise may not yet exist in the United States, it's out there, if you know where to look. 
"Sonar," replied Rear Adm. Amiram Rafael, when I put the same question to him 6,000 miles away in Israel, perhaps the one place in the world where terrorism is as much a part of daily life as commuter traffic. "It can distinguish between humans and large fish by mapping movement patterns and speed." Rafael spent 28 years protecting Israel's coastline from terrorists and now consults for foreign clients. "If the alarm sounds, rapid response units in fast boats are dispatched," he said. "They're equipped with underwater concussion grenades."
"To stun the divers?" I asked. 
"No," Rafael said, flashing a fatherly smile. "To kill them." 
Until recently, the United States and countries like Israel occupied opposite ends of the security spectrum: one a confident and carefree superpower, seemingly untouchable, the other a tiny garrison state, surrounded by fortifications and barbed wire, fighting for its survival. But the security gap between the U.S. and places like Israel is narrowing. Subways, sewers, shopping centers, food processing and water systems are all now seen as easy prey for terrorists. 
There is no clear consensus yet on how to go about protecting ourselves. The federal government recently concluded a 16-month risk assessment, and last month, the new Department of Homeland Security was officially born, with an annual budget of $36 billion. Big money has already been allocated to shore up certain perceived weaknesses, including the $5.8 billion spent hiring, training and equipping federal airport screeners and the $3 billion allocated for "bioterrorism preparedness." All that has been well publicized. Other measures, like sophisticated radiation sensors and surveillance systems, have been installed in some cities with less fanfare. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. is carrying out labor-intensive tasks that would have seemed a ludicrous waste of time 18 months ago, like assembling dossiers on people who take scuba-diving courses.
This marks only the very beginning. A national conversation is starting about what kind of country we want to live in and what balance we will tolerate between public safety and private freedom. The decisions won't come all at once, and we may be changing our minds a lot, depending on whether there are more attacks here, what our government tells us and what we believe. Two weeks ago, Congress decided to sharply curtail the activities of the Total Information Awareness program, a Pentagon project led by Rear Adm. John Poindexter and invested with power to electronically sift through the private affairs of American citizens. For the time being, it was felt that the threat of having the government look over our credit-card statements and medical records was more dangerous than its promised benefits.
Congress didn't completely shut the door on the T.I.A., though. Agents can still look into the lives of foreigners, and its functions could be expanded at any time. We could, for instance, reach the point where we demand the installation of systems, like the one along the Israeli coastline, to maim or kill intruders in certain sensitive areas before they have a chance to explain who they are or why they're there. We may come to think nothing of American citizens who act suspiciously being held without bail or denied legal representation for indeterminate periods or tried in courts whose proceedings are under seal. At shopping malls and restaurants, we may prefer to encounter heavily armed guards and be subjected to routine searches at the door. We may be willing to give up the freedom and ease of movement that has defined American life, if we come to believe our safety depends upon it.
For the better part of a generation now, Americans have gone to great lengths to protect their homes -- living in gated communities, wiring their property with sophisticated alarms, arming themselves with deadly weapons. Now imagine this kind of intensity turned outward, into the public realm. As a culture, our tolerance for fear is low, and our capacity to do something about it is unrivaled. We could have the highest degree of public safety the world has ever seen. But what would that country look like, and what will it be like to live in it? Perhaps something like this.

Electronic Frisking Every Day on Your Commute
As a homebound commuter entering Washington's Foggy Bottom subway station swipes his fare card through the turnstile reader, a computer in the bowels of the mass transit authority takes note. A suspicious pattern of movements has triggered the computer's curiosity.
The giveaway is a microchip in the new digital fare cards, derived from the electronic ID cards many of us already use to enter our workplaces. It could be in use throughout the U.S. within a couple of years. If embedded with the user's driver's license or national ID number, it would allow transportation authorities to keep tabs on who rides the subway, and on when and where they get on and off.
The commuter steps through the turnstile and is scanned by the radiation portal. These would be a natural extension of the hand-held detectors that the police have started using in the New York subways. A cancer patient was actually strip-searched in a New York subway station in 2002 after residue from radiation treatments tripped the meters. But this doesn't happen to our fictitious commuter. The meters barely flicker, registering less than one on a scale of one to nine, the equivalent of a few microroentgens an hour, nowhere near the 3,800 readout that triggers evacuation sirens. 
Imagine a battery of video cameras following the commuter's progress to the platform, where he reads a newspaper, standing next to an old utility room that contains gas masks. Cops in New York already have them as part of their standard-issue gear, and a fully secure subway system would need them for everybody, just as every ferryboat must have a life preserver for every passenger. Sensors, which are already used in parts of the New York subway system, would test the air around him for the presence of chemical agents like sarin and mustard gases.
The commuter finishes reading his newspaper, but there is no place to throw it away because all trash cans have been removed, as they were in London when the I.R.A. used them to plant bombs. Cameras show the commuter boarding one of the subway cars, which have been reconfigured to drop oxygen masks from the ceiling in the event of a chemical attack, much like jetliners during decompression. The added security measures have probably pushed fares up throughout the country, maybe as much as 40 percent in some places. 
The commuter -- now the surveillance subject -- gets off at the next stop. As he rides the escalatorup, a camera positioned overhead zooms in for a close-up of him. This image, which will be used to confirm his identity, travels through fiber-optic cables to the Joint Operations Command Center at police headquarters. There, a computer scans his facial features, breaks them down into three-dimensional plots and compares them with a databank of criminal mug shots, people on watch lists and anyone who has ever posed for a government-issue ID. The facial-recognition program was originally developed at M.I.T. Used before 9/11 mainly by casinos to ferret out known cardsharps, the system has been tried by airport and law enforcement authorities and costs $75,000 to $100,000 per tower, as the camera stations are called. 
"It can be used at A.T.M.'s, car-rental agencies, D.M.V. offices, border crossings," says an executive of Viisage Technology, maker of the Face-Finder recognition system. "These are the sorts of facilities the 19 hijackers used." 
Almost instantly, the software verifies the subject's identity and forwards the information to federal authorities. What they do with it depends on the powers of the Total Information Awareness program or whatever its successors will be known as. But let's say that Congress has granted the government authority to note certain suspicious patterns, like when someone buys an airline ticket with cash and leaves the return date open. And let's say the commuter did just that -- his credit cards were maxed out, so he had no choice. And he didn't fill in a return date because he wasn't sure when his next consulting assignment was going to start, and he thought he might be able to extend his vacation a few days.
On top of that, let's say he was also indiscreet in an e-mail message, making a crude joke to a client about a recent airline crash. Software programs that scan for suspect words are not new. Corporations have long used them to automatically block employee e-mail containing, for instance, multiple references to sex. The National Security Agency's global spy satellites and supercomputers have for years taken the search capability to the next level, processing the content of up to two million calls and e-mail messages per hour around the world. 
Turning the snooping technology on Americans would not be difficult, if political circumstances made it seem necessary. Right now, there would be fierce resistance to this, but the debate could swing radically to the other side if the government showed that intercepting e-mail could deter terrorists from communicating with one another. Already, says Barry Steinhardt, director of the A.C.L.U. program on technology and liberty, authorities have been demanding records from Internet providers and public libraries about what books people are taking out and what Web sites they're looking at.
Once the commuter is on the government's radar screen, it would be hard for him to get off -- as anyone who has ever found themselves on a mailing or telemarketers' list can attest. It will be like when you refinance a mortgage -- suddenly every financial institution in America sends you a preapproved platinum card. Once a computer detects a pattern, hidden or overt, your identity in the digital world is fixed. 
Technicians manning the Command Center probably wouldn't know why the subject is on a surveillance list, or whether he should even be on it in the first place. That would be classified, as most aspects of the government's counterterrorist calculations are.
Nonetheless, they begin to monitor his movements. Cameras on K Street pick him up as he exits the subway station and hails a waiting taxi. The cab's license plate number, as a matter of routine procedure, is run through another software program -- first used in Peru in the 1990's to detect vehicles that have been stolen or registered to terrorist sympathizers, and most recently introduced in central London to nab motorists who have not paid peak-hour traffic tariffs. Technicians get another positive reading; the cabdriver is also on a watch list. He is a Pakistani immigrant and has traveled back and forth to Karachi twice in the last six months, once when his father died, the other to attend his brother's wedding. These trips seem harmless, but the trackers are trained not to make these sorts of distinctions.
So what they see is the possible beginning of a terrorist conspiracy -- one slightly suspicious character has just crossed paths with another slightly suspicious character, and that makes them seriously suspicious. At this moment, the case is forwarded to the new National Counterintelligence Service, which will pay very close attention to whatever both men do next.
The N.C.S. does not exist yet, but its creation is advocated by the likes of Lt. Gen. William Odom, a former head of the National Security Agency. Whether modeled after Britain's MI5, a domestic spy agency, or Israel's much more proactive and unrestricted Shin Bet, the N.C.S. would most likely require a budget similar to the F.B.I.'s $4.2 billion and nearly as much personnel as the bureau's 11,400-strong special agent force, mostly for surveillance duties. 
N.C.S. surveillance agents dispatched to tail the two subjects in the taxi would have little difficulty following their quarry through Georgetown, up Wisconsin Avenue and into Woodley Park. One tool at their disposal could be a nationwide vehicle tracking system, adapted from the technology used by Singapore's Land Transport Authority to regulate traffic and parking. The system works on the same principle as the E-ZPass toll-road technology, in which scanners at tollbooths read signals from transponders installed on the windshields of passing vehicles to pay tolls automatically. In a future application, electronic readers installed throughout major American metropolitan centers could pinpoint the location of just about any vehicle equipped with mandatory transponders. (American motorists would most likely each have to pay an extra $90 fee, similar to what Singapore charges.) 
When the commuter arrives home, N.C.S. agents arrange to put his house under 24-hour aerial surveillance. The same thing happens to the cabdriver when he arrives home. The technology, discreet and effective, is already deployed in Washington. Modified UH-60A Blackhawk helicopters, the kind U.S. Customs uses to intercept drug runners, now patrol the skies over the capital to enforce no-fly zones. The Pentagon deployed its ultrasophisticated RC-7 reconnaissance planes during the sniper siege last fall. The surveillance craft, which have proved their worth along the DMZ in North Korea and against cocaine barons in Colombia, come loaded with long-range night-vision and infrared sensors that permit operators to detect move-ment and snap photos of virtually anyone's backyard from as far as 20 miles away. 

A Government That Knows When You've Been Bad or Good
In the here and now, an aerial photo of my backyard is on file at the Joint Operations Command Center in Washington, which, unlike the N.C.S., already exists. The center looks like NASA, starting with the biometric palm-print scanners on its reinforced doors. 
The center has not singled me out for any special surveillance. My neighbors' houses are all pictured, too, as are still shots and even three-dimensional images of just about every building, landmark and lot in central D.C. 
The technology isn't revolutionary. How many times a day is the average American already on camera? There's one in the corner deli where I get my morning coffee and bagel. Another one at the A.T.M. outside. Yet another one films traffic on Connecticut Avenue when I drive my wife to work. The lobby of her office building has several. So that's at least four, and it's only 9 a.m. 
There are few legal restraints governing video surveillance. It is perfectly legal for the government to track anyone, anywhere, using cameras except for inside his own home, where a warrant is needed to use thermal imaging that can see all the way into the basement. Backyards or rooftops, however, are fair game.
There is a growing network of video cameras positioned throughout the capital that feed into the Joint Operations Command Center, otherwise known as the JOCC, which has been operational since 9/11. The experimental facility is shared by several government agencies, including the Metropolitan Police Department, the F.B.I., the Secret Service, the State Department and the Defense Intelligence Agency. Agents from different law enforcement bodies man the JOCC's 36 computer terminals, which are arrayed in long rows beneath wall-size projection screens, like the Houston space center. The wall screens simultaneously display live feeds, digital simulations, city maps with the locations of recently released felons and gory crime scene footage.
"From here we can tap into schools, subways, landmarks and main streets," says Chief Charles Ramsey of the D.C. Police, with evident pride. Theoretically, with a few clicks of the mouse the system could also link up with thousands of closed-circuit cameras in shopping malls, department stores and office buildings, and is programmed to handle live feeds from up to six helicopters simultaneously. Ramsey is careful to add that, for now, the majority of the cameras are off-line most of the time, and that the police aren't using them to look into elevators or to spy on individuals.
But they could if they wanted to. I ask for a demonstration of the system's capabilities. A technician punches in a few keystrokes. An aerial photo of the city shot earlier from a surveillance plane flashes on one of the big screens. "Can you zoom in on Dupont Circle?" I ask. The screen flickers, and the thoroughfare's round fountain comes into view. "Go up Connecticut Avenue." The outline of the Hilton Hotel where President Reagan was shot materializes. "Up a few more blocks, and toward Rock Creek Park," I instruct. "There, can you get any closer?" The image blurs and focuses, and I can suddenly see the air-conditioning unit on my roof, my garden furniture and the cypress hedge I recently planted in my yard. 
The fact that government officials can, from a remote location, snoop into the backyards of most Washingtonians opens up a whole new level of information they can find out about us almost effortlessly. They could keep track of when you come and go from your house, discovering in the process that you work a second job or that you are carrying on an extramarital affair. Under normal circumstances, there's not much they could do with this information. And for the time being, that is the way most Americans want it. But this is the kind of issue that will come up over the next few years. How many extra tools will we be willing to grant to the police and federal authorities? How much will we allow our notions of privacy to narrow?
Because if domestic intelligence agents were able to find out secret details of people's lives, they could get the cooperation of crucial witnesses who might otherwise be inclined to keep quiet. There is more than a whiff of McCarthyism to all this, but perhaps we will be afraid enough to endure it. 
The JOCC is also studying the effect of large-scale bombs in Washington. A three-dimensional map of all downtown buildings allows technicians to simulate bomb blasts and debris projections. They can also tap into the weather bureau for real-time data on wind speeds and directions to determine which parts of the city would have to be evacuated first in the event of a radiological or biochemical plume. Programmers are now working on an underground map of the capital that would show water and gas distribution and power grids. 
Efforts are under way to establish facilities similar to the JOCC in big urban centers like Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta and New York. One benefit of the JOCC's is that they are relatively cheap to set up, particularly since most major cities already have surveillance equipment positioned in places like tunnels and bridges. Each command center would likely cost around $7 million to build, with an additional $15,000 charge for every camera installed. 
There is also talk of connecting all the facilities together so that officials in different parts of the country could coordinate response efforts to terrorism. "Attacks will likely occur in different cities simultaneously," Chief Ramsey says. And as for those civil libertarians uneasy with the notion of blanket national surveillance, Ramsey just shrugs. "We can't pretend we live in the 19th century. We have to take advantage of technology." 

The Mall Guard Who Carries a Machine Gun
Imagine a wintry scene: snowdrifts and dirty slush and a long line of people muffled against the cold. This is a line to get into the mall, and it is moving frustratingly slowly. What's the holdup? There is no new blockbuster movie opening that day, or any of those "everything must go" clearance sales that might justify standing outside freezing for 20 minutes. Customers are simply waiting to clear security.
Shopping in an environment of total terrorist preparedness promises to be a vastly different experience from anything ever imagined in America. But for millions of people who live in terror-prone places like Israel or the Philippines, tight security at shopping malls has long been a fact of life. "I was shocked when I first came to the States and could go into any shopping plaza without going through security," says Aviv Tene, a 33-year-old Haifa attorney. "It seemed so strange, and risky."
It took me just under eight minutes to clear the security checkpoint outside the Dizengoff Center in downtown Tel Aviv. But that was on a rainy weekday morning before the food courts and multiplex theater had opened.
The future shopping experience will start at the parking-lot entrance. Booths manned by guards will control access to and from lots to prevent terrorists from emulating the Washington sniper and using parking lots as shooting galleries. Cars entering underground garages will have their trunks searched for explosives, as is the practice in Manila. It has also become common outside New York City hotels. This will guard against car or truck bombs of the type that blew up beneath the World Trade Center in 1993.
No one will be able to drive closer than a hundred yards to mall entrances. Concrete Jerseybarriers will stop anyone from crashing a vehicle into the buildings -- a favored terrorist tactic for American targets overseas -- or into the crowds of customers lining up. Screening will follow the Israeli model: metal barricades will funnel shoppers through checkpoints at all doors. They will be frisked, and both they and their bags will be searched and run through metal detectors. Security would be tightest in winter, says a former senior F.B.I. agent, because AK-47's and grenade belts are easily concealed beneath heavy coats.
What won't be concealed, of course, are the weapons carried by the police at the mall. Major shopping areas will not be patrolled by the docile, paid-by-the-hour guards to whom we're accustomed, but -- like airports and New York City tourist attractions -- by uniformed cops and soldiers with rifles.
What will it be like to encounter such firearms on a regular basis? I lived for years in Moscow, and after a short time, I rarely noticed the guns. In fact, I tended to feel more uncomfortable when armed guards were not around; Israelis traveling in the United States occasionally say the same thing. But despite the powerful presence of guns in popular culture, few Americans have had much contact with the kind of heavy weapons that are now becoming a common sight on city streets. Such prominent displays are meant to convey the notion that the government is doing something to ward off terrorists, but they can have the reverse effect too, of constantly reminding us of imminent danger.
Even more mundane procedures might have the same effect -- for example, being asked to produce a national identification card every time you go into a store, much the same way clubgoers have to prove they are of age. The idea of a national identity card, once widely viewed as un-American, is gaining ground in Washington, where some are advocating standardizing driver's licenses throughout the country as a first step in that direction. Though perhaps reminiscent of Big Brother, these cards are not uncommon in the rest of the world, even in Western Europe. In Singapore, the police frequently ask people to produce their papers; it becomes so routine that people cease being bothered by it. How long would it take Americans to become similarly inured? 
The new ID's, which are advocated by computer industry leaders like Larry Ellison of Oracle, could resemble the digital smart cards that Chinese authorities plan to introduce in Hong Kong by the end of the year. These contain computer chips with room to store biographical, financial and medical histories, and tamper-proof algorithms of the cardholder's thumbprint that can be verified by hand-held optical readers. Based on the $394 million Hong Kong has budgeted for smart cards for its 6.8 million residents, a similar program in the U.S. could run as high as $16 billion. 
Among other things, a national identity card program would make it much harder for people without proper ID to move around and therefore much easier for police and domestic-intelligence agents to track them down. And once found, such people might discover they don't quite have the rights they thought they had. Even now, for instance, U.S. citizens can be declared "enemy combatants" and be detained without counsel. Within a few years, America's counterterrorist agencies could have the kind of sweeping powers of arrest and interrogation that have developed in places like Israel, the Philippines and even France, where the constant threat of terrorism enabled governments to do virtually whatever it takes to prevent terrorism. "As long as you worry too much about making false arrests and don't start taking greater risks," says Offer Einav, a 15-year Shin Bet veteran who now runs a security consulting firm, "you are never going to beat terrorism."
In years past, the U.S. has had to rely on other governments to take these risks. For example, the mastermind of the 1993 W.T.C. bombing, Ramzi Yousef, was caught only after Philippine investigators used what official intelligence documents delicately refer to as "tactical interrogation" to elicit a confession from an accomplice arrested in Manila. In U.S. court testimony, the accomplice, Abdul Hakim Murad, later testified that he was beaten to within an inch of his life.
In Israel, it is touted that 90 percent of suicide bombers are caught before they get near their targets, a record achieved partly because the Shin Bet can do almost anything it deems necessary to save lives. "They do things we would not be comfortable with in this country," says former Assistant F.B.I. Director Steve Pomerantz, who, along with a growing number of U.S. officials, has traveled to Israel recently for antiterror training seminars.
But the U.S. is moving in the Israeli direction. The U.S.A. Patriot Act, rushed into law six weeks after 9/11, has given government agencies wide latitude to invoke the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and get around judicial restraints on search, seizure and surveillance of American citizens. FISA, originally intended to hunt international spies, permits the authorities to wiretap virtually at will and break into people's homes to plant bugs or copy documents. Last year, surveillance requests by the federal government under FISA outnumbered for the first time in U.S. history all of those under domestic law. 
New legislative proposals by the Justice Department now seek to take the Patriot Act's antiterror powers several steps further, including the right to strip terror suspects of their U.S. citizenship. Under the new bill -- titled the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003 -- the government would not be required to disclose the identity of anyone detained in connection with a terror investigation, and the names of those arrested, be they Americans or foreign nationals, would be exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, according to the Center for Public Integrity, a rights group in Washington, which has obtained a draft of the bill. An American citizen suspected of being part of a terrorist conspiracy could be held by investigators without anyone being notified. He could simply disappear.

The Face-to-Face Interrogation on Your Vacation
Some aspects of life would, in superficial ways, seem easier, depending on who you are and what sort of specialized ID you carry. Boarding an international flight, for example, might not require a passport for frequent fliers. At Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, "trusted" travelers -- those who have submitted to background checks -- are issued a smart card encoded with the pattern of their iris. When they want to pass through security, a scanner checks their eyes and verifies their identities, and they are off. The whole process takes 20 seconds, according to Dutch officials. At Ben-Gurion in Israel, the same basic function is carried out by electronic palm readers.
"We start building dossiers the moment someone buys a ticket," says Einav, the Shin Bet veteran who also once served as head of El Al security. "We have quite a bit of information on our frequent fliers. So we know they are not a security risk."
The technology frees up security personnel to focus their efforts on everybody else, who, on my recent trip to Jerusalem, included me. As a holder of a Canadian passport (a favorite of forgers) that has visa stamps from a number of high-risk countries ending in "stan," I was subjected to a 40-minute interrogation. My clothes and belongings were swabbed for explosives residue. Taken to a separate room, I was questioned about every detail of my stay in Israel, often twice to make certain my story stayed consistent. Whom did you meet? Where did you meet? What was the address? Do you have the business cards of the people you met? Can we see them? What did you discuss? Can we see your notes? Do you have any maps with you? Did you take any photographs while you were in Israel? Are you sure? Did you rent a car? Where did you drive to? Do you have a copy of your hotel bill? Why do you have a visa to Pakistan? Why do you live in Washington? Can we see your D.C. driver's license? Where did you live before Washington? Why did you live in Moscow? Are you always this nervous?
A Russian speaker was produced to verify that I spoke the language. By the time I was finally cleared, I almost missed my flight. "Sorry for the delay," apologized the young security officer. "Don't take it personally." 
El Al is a tiny airline that has a fleet of just 30 planes and flies to a small handful of destinations. It is also heavily subsidized by the government. This is what has made El Al and Ben-Gurion safe from terrorists for more than 30 years.
Getting the American airline system up to this level would require a great deal more than reinforced cockpit doors and the armed air marshals now aboard domestic and international flights. It would require changing everything, including the cost and frequency of flights. Nothing could be simpler, right now, than flying from New York to Pittsburgh -- every day, there are at least a dozen direct flights available from the city's three airports and countless more connecting flights. Bought a week or two in advance, these tickets can be as cheap as $150 round-trip.
Making U.S. airlines as security-conscious as El Al would put the U.S. back where the rest of the world is -- maybe a flight or two a day from New York to Pittsburgh, at much higher costs, and no assurance whatsoever you can get on the plane you want. Flights would take longer, and landings might be a little more interesting, because pilots would have to stay away from densely populated areas, where a plane downed by a shoulder-launched Stinger missile could do terrible damage. 

Kayaking in the Wrong Place Is a Federal Crime
In a state of full readiness, American cities would be a patchwork of places you couldn't go near. At first, most people wouldn't even notice when no-sail zones were instituted around all 50 major industrial ports in the country. Maybe they would find out when they went to a local marina where they occasionally rent a small outboard to go water-skiing and found that it had been closed and relocated. Or maybe they went kayaking up near the Indian Point nuclear plant on the Hudson and spent an afternoon talking to the Coast Guard after they got a little too close. 
There may be a lot of places private boats will be unable to go, like anywhere near a shipping channel used by oil and gas freighters. Infrared and video optronic systems that can detect small boats, and even inflatable rubber craft, may be deployed to enforce the no-sail zones. "We invented it after terrorists rode a freighter to within 10 miles of Tel Aviv," says Rafael, the former Israeli rear admiral, "and used inflatable boats to attack beachfront hotels." 
Each optronic installation costs $2 million, and four or five of the units would be needed to protect the approach to any major harbor, Rafael says. The system would thus cost around $500 million.
"I'm always amazed at how lightly defended your industry is compared to most other countries," says Hezy Ribak, another Israeli intelligence expert, who runs a security consulting firm. "In Israel, we treat security at our industrial facilities the way we do borders. The stakes," he adds, "are just as high, higher if you consider the damage terrorists can do if they infiltrate a nuclear power plant or blow up a gas reservoir."
The P-Glilot natural gas reservoir near Tel Aviv is a good example of what security experts like Ribak have in mind for the U.S. From a distance, P-Glilot doesn't seem all that different than similar installations in New Jersey, Ohio or Texas. The massive storage tanks are even painted with quaint butterflies and birds. But just off the highway, watchtowers dot the landscape. If you drive closer, the complex takes on the feel of a military garrison, with high walls and electric fences bristling with sensors and cameras, and notices posted in Hebrew, English and Arabic warning: "No Photography." Pull off the road and park by the perimeter fence for a mere 15 seconds, and a metallic voice sounds from an unseen loudspeaker, calling out your license plate number and telling you to move on. 
"Security," Einav says, "is about layers, creating buffer zones." On the ground, that means changing the way industrial sites are guarded. Security precautions in the U.S. are concentrated around the core of the targets -- be they reactors, pumping stations or chemical plants -- rather than the perimeter. "Security at the main buildings might stop environmental protesters or the lone crazy, but it doesn't help in the case of a truck loaded with explosives, because the terrorists have already reached their objective," Ribak says. "Why give yourself so little room? There should be as big a buffer as possible between the first line of defense -- the perimeter of the property -- and the target, to give yourself early warning."
Perimeters, Ribak says, will need to be equipped with vibration sensors; thermal and infrared cameras; buried magnetic detection devices that can distinguish between humans, animals and vehicles; and several rows of old-fashioned razor coil to delay intruders, giving guards time to respond to alarms.
In the U.S., where many industrial facilities are concentrated in dense urban areas, such security measures would necessitate the rerouting of highways and possibly the relocation of neighborhoods that are just too close. In New York City, power plants sit right in the middle of residential neighborhoods, like the one at 14th Street and Avenue D in the East Village. It is across the street from Stuyvesant Town and a public housing project, home to tens of thousands of people. Israeli security officials shake their heads in astonishment at such "crazy" U.S. practices, but then again who ever thought that putting an airport next to the Pentagon was a security risk?
Securing dense, mixed-use urban neighborhoods could not only complicate housing markets and commuting patterns, which are typically a disaster in most cities already, but could also come at tremendous expense. Consider the Donald C. Cook nuclear power plant in Berrien County, Mich. It has two Westinghouse reactors and sits on a relatively cramped 650-acre plot. Just to provide a three-mile buffer around the plant would run $76 million, according to U.S.D.A. statistics on the average price per acre of land in Michigan. For the Indian Point plant in Westchester, the cost would be exponentially higher. Add to that the $3.5 billion to $7 billion estimated by a recent Princeton University study to safeguard spent fuel pools from air attack, the roughly $3.5 million price tag of new perimeter sensors and the $160 million that Raytheon charges for a Patriot missile battery capable of knocking out airborne threats, and multiply the total by the 103 nuclear power stations in the country.
Now factor in the 276,000 natural gas wells in the U.S., the 1.5 million miles of unprotected pipelines, the 161 oil refineries, 2,000 oil storage facilities and 10,400 hydro, coal and gas-fired power generating stations, and you get a sense of the costs involved.

Every Day Is Super Bowl Sunday
But you probably won't be thinking about any of that when you go out to dinner or to the movies or to a ball game. By then, it could all be second nature. The restaurant attendant will go through your purse and wave a metal-detector wand over your jacket, as they do in Tel Aviv. The valet parker will pop open your trunk and look through it before dropping your car off at an underground garage, just as in Manila. 
If you take the family to a Dodgers game, you'll be able to tell your kids how, back in the day, they used to have blimps and small planes trailing ad banners over stadiums. The flight restrictions, started at Super Bowl XXXVII in 2002, would not permit any planes within seven miles of any significant sporting events. Fans would have to park at least five miles from the stadium and board shuttle buses to gates. Spectators would be funneled through airport-style metal detectors and watched over by a network of 50 cameras installed throughout the stadium. Air quality would be monitored for pathogens by the type of portable detectors brought in by the Army at last year's Olympics.
Even people with no interest in sports who live in high-rises near stadiums would know whenever game day came round. "Tall buildings near stadiums are also a risk," says Col. Mena Bacharach, a former Israeli secret-service agent who is one of the lead security consultants for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. "They would have to be swept for snipers or R.P.G.'s." R.P.G.'s? Those are rocket-propelled grenades, another term that could become an American colloquialism.
It's still too early to tell what all this would mean to ticket prices, but, in a sign of the changing times, the security allocation alone for last month's Super Bowl was $9 million -- the equivalent of $134 for every one of the 67,000 fans in attendance.
Of course, public awareness programs could help to significantly cut down counterterror costs. In Israel, televised public service announcements similar to antidrug commercials in the U.S. warn viewers to be on the lookout for signs of suspicious activity. The messages are even taught to schoolchildren, along with other important survival tips, like how to assemble gas masks. "I was out with my 7-year-old granddaughter the other day," recalls Joel Feldschuh, a former Israeli brigadier general and president of El Al. "And she sees a bag on the street and starts shouting: 'Granddaddy, granddaddy, look. Quickly call a policeman. It could be left by terrorists.' "

What Is Your Security Worth to You?
It is commonly held that a country as big and confident in its freedoms as the United States could never fully protect itself against terrorists. The means available to them are too vast, the potentially deadly targets too plentiful. And there is a strong conviction in many quarters that there is a limit to which Americans will let their daily patterns be disturbed for security precautions. Discussing the possibility that we might all need to be equipped with our own gas masks, as Israelis are, Sergeant McClaskey of Baltimore assured me it would never happen. "If it ever reaches the point where we all need gas masks," McClaskey said, shaking his head with disgust, "then we have lost the war on terror because we are living in fear."
What does it really mean, however, to "lose the war on terror"? It's as ephemeral a concept as "winning the war on terror." In what sense will it ever be possible to declare an end of any kind? 
One thing that makes the decisions of how to protect ourselves so difficult is that the terrorism we face is fundamentally different from what other governments have faced in the past. The Israelis live in tight quarters with an enemy they know well and can readily lay their eyes on. Terror attacks on European countries have always come from colonies or nearby provinces that have generally had specific grievances and demands. Americans don't know exactly who our enemies are or where they are coming from. Two of the recent thwarted terrorists, Richard Reid and Zacarias Moussaoui, were in fact Europeans.
The United States also lacks the national identity that binds Israel and most European countries and helps make the psychic wounds of terrorism heal faster. In Israel, hours after a bombing, the streets are crowded again -- people are determined to keep going. Immediately after 9/11, that's how many Americans felt, too, but it's not at all clear how long this kind of spirit will endure.
Nor is it clear how we will absorb the cost. An adviser to President Bush estimates that as much as $100 billion will have to be spent annually on domestic security over the next 10 years, if you factor in all the overtime accrued by police departments every time there is a heightened alert. There are many who believe, as General Odom does, that the money is "insignificant." "At the height of the cold war we used to spend 7.2 percent of G.D.P. on defense and intelligence," he says. "We spend less than half that now." 
Outside of defense and some of the entitlement programs, however, domestic security will dwarf every other kind of federal spending: education, roads, subsidized housing, environmental protection. More than that, the decisions we make about how to protect ourselves -- the measures we demand, the ones we resist -- will take over our political discourse and define our ideas about government in the years to come.
One significant argument against the creation of an American security state, a United States that resembles Israel, is that even there, in a society rigorously organized around security, the safety of its citizens is far from guaranteed. But what keeps Israelis going about their daily lives -- and what might help Americans do the same despite the fear of violence here -- is the conspicuousness of the response and the minor sacrifices that have to be made every day. The more often we have to have our bags searched, the better we might feel. Sitting in the kind of traffic jam that would have normally frayed our nerves might seem almost comforting if it's because all the cars in front of us are being checked for bombs. We may demand more daily inconveniences, more routine abrogations of our rights. These decisions are not only going to change how we go about our days; they're also going to change our notion of what it means to be an American. How far do we want to go?
"Security is a balancing act," says Einav, the former El Al security chief. "And there are always trade-offs. Give me the resources, and I can guarantee your safety. The question is, What are you willing to pay or put up with to stay safe?"

HEADLINE: Repress Yourself 

BYLINE:  By Lauren Slater; Lauren Slater is the author of "Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the 20th Century," to be published by W.W. Norton in 2004.

 BODY:
You've been in therapy for years.You've time-traveled back to your childhood home, to your mother's makeup mirror with its ring of pearl lights. You've uncovered, or recovered, the bad baby sitter, his hands on you, and yet still, you're no better. You feel foggy and low; you flinch at intimate touch; you startle at even the slightest sounds, and you are impaired. Hundreds of sessions of talk have led you here, back to the place you started, even though you've followed all advice. You have self-soothed and dredged up; you have cried and curled up; you have aimed for integration in your fractured, broken brain. 
 This is common, the fractured, broken brain and the uselessness of talk therapy to make it better. A study done by H.J. Eysenck in 1952, a study that still causes some embarrassment to the field, found that psychotherapy in general helped no more, no less, than the slow passing of time. As for insight, no one has yet demonstrably proved that it is linked to recovery. What actually does help is anyone's best guess -- probably some sort of fire, directly under your behind -- and what leads to relief? Maybe love and work, maybe medicine. Maybe repression. Repression? Isn't that the thing that makes you sick, that splits you off, so demons come dancing back? Doesn't that cause holes in the stomach and chancres in the colon and a general impoverishment of spirit? Maybe not. New research shows that some traumatized people may be better off repressing the experience than illuminating it in therapy. If you're stuck and scared, perhaps you should not remember but forget. Avoid. That's right. Tamp it down. Up you go. 
 The new research is rooted in part in the experience of Sept. 11, when swarms of therapists descended on New York City after the twin towers fell. There were, by some estimates, three shrinks for every victim, which is itself an image you might want to repress, the bearded, the beatnik, the softly empathic all gathered round the survivors urging talk talk talk. "And what happened," says Richard Gist, a community psychologist and trauma researcher who, along with a growing number of colleagues, has become highly critical of these debriefing procedures, "is some people got worse. They were either unhelped or retraumatized by our interventions." Gist, who is an associate professor at the University of Missouri and who has been on hand to help with disasters from the collapse of the Hyatt Regency pedestrian skywalks in Kansas City, Mo., in 1981 to the United Airlines crash in Sioux City, Iowa, in 1989, has had time to develop his thoughts regarding how, or how not, to help in times of terror. "Basically, all these therapists run down to the scene, and there's a lot of grunting and groaning and encouraging people to review what they saw, and then the survivors get worse. I've been saying for years, 'Is it any surprise that if you keep leading people to the edge of a cliff they eventually fall over?"'
Based in part on the findings that encouraging people to talk immediately after a trauma can actually emblazon fear more deeply into the brain, researchers began to question the accepted tenets of trauma treatment, which have at their center the healing power of story. In Tel Aviv, three researchers, Karni Ginzburg, Zahava Solomon and Avi Bleich, studied heart-attack victims in an effort to determine whether those who repressed the event fared better in the long run. "Repression" is a word that radiates far beyond its small syllabic self; it connotes images of hysterical amnesiacs on magic mountains or mist-swaddled Viennese streets. But in experimental psychology, as opposed to psychoanalysis, repression has far more mundane meanings; it is used to describe those who minimize, distract, deny. Is it possible that folks who employ these techniques cope better than the rest of us ramblers? In order to address this question, Ginzburg and her collaborators followed 116 heart-attack patients at three hospitals in Israel with the aim of assessing who developed post-traumatic stress disorder and who went home whistling. Ginzburg's team was particularly interested in exploring the long-term effects of a repressive coping style; some earlier research demonstrated that those who deny are, in fact, better off in the short term. But there remained the larger questions: What happens to these stern stoics over time? Do they break down? Do memories and symptoms push through? Ginzburg's team assessed its subjects within one week of their heart attacks and then seven months later. During the first assessment, the team evaluated, among other things, the patient's general coping style using a series of scales that reflect the tendency to avoid and to deny. The researchers defined repressors as those who exhibited "a specific combination of anxiety and defensiveness" as measured on the self-reported scales.
They found that those patients who had high anxiety and low defensiveness -- in other words, those patients who had a lift-the-lid approach to their experience, thinking about it, worrying about it, processing it -- had a far poorer outcome than their stiff-lipped counterparts. Specifically, of the stiff-lipped stylers, only 7 percent developed post-traumatic stress disorder seven months after the infarction, compared with 19 percent of the voluble ones.
The Israeli study hypothesizes at one point that repression may work as a coping style because those who ignore have a uniquely adaptive perceptual style. Repressors, others posit, may be protected by their presuppositions regarding -- and subsequent perceptions of -- stressful events, meaning that where you see a conflagration, they see a campfire, where you see a downpour, they see a drizzle. Still other researchers suggest that repressors are good at repressing because they can manipulate their attention, swiveling it away from the burned body or the hurting heart, and if that fails, they believe that they can cope with what befalls them. They think they're competent, those with the buttoned-up backs. Whether they really are or are not competent is not the issue; repressors, Ginzburg suggests, think they are, and anyone who has ever read "The Little Engine That Could" knows the power of thinking positively when it comes to making it over the mountain.
George Bonanno, an associate professor of psychology at Columbia University Teachers College, has found similar results in his many inquiries into the role of repression and avoidance in healthy coping styles. And, unlike the Israeli researchers, Bonanno has used scales that go beyond self-report to determine who's repressing what and how that person fares. For instance, in a study of bereaved widows and widowers, Bonanno used a technique called verbal autonomic association. He had people talk about their loss while he looked at autonomic arousal (heartbeat, pulse rates and galvanic skin responses). What he saw: a subgroup of mourners who consistently said they weren't distressed while displaying high heart rates. "These are the repressors," Bonanno says. "And these people, the ones who showed this pattern, had less grief over time and had a better overall life adjustment, and this has been consistent across studies." Bonanno has recently completed a study involving adolescent girls and young women who are sexual-abuse survivors. "The girls who chose not to talk about the sexual abuse during the interview, the girls who measured higher on repression scales, these were the repressors, and they also had fewer internalizing symptoms like depression and anxiety and fewer externalizing symptoms like hostility and acting out. They were better-adjusted." 
Bonanno pauses. "I've been studying this phenomenon for 10 years," he says. "I've been deeply troubled. My work's been in top journals, but it's still being dismissed by people in the field. In the 1980's, trauma became an official diagnosis, and people made their careers on it. What followed was a plethora of research on how to heal from trauma by talking it out, by facing it down. These people are not likely to believe in an alternative explanation. People's intellectual inheritance is deeply dependent upon a certain point of view."
George Bonanno works in New York City, while Richard Gist works in Kansas City; the doctors have never spoken, but they should. They share a lot. Gist told me: "The problem with the trauma industry is this: People who successfully repress do not turn up sitting across from a shrink, so we know very little about these folks, but they probably have a lot to teach us. For all we know, the repressors are actually the normal ones who effectively cope with the many tragedies life presents. Why are we not more fascinated with these displays of resilience and grace? Why are we only fascinated with frailty? The trauma industry knows they can make money off of frailty; there are all these psychologists out there turning six figures with their pablum and hubris."
Gist, who speaks with a Midwestern twang and knows how to turn a rococo phrase, also insists on plain figures to back up whatever he says. According to Gist, meta-analyses of debriefing procedures, a subset of trauma work that encourages catharsis through talk, simply do not support the efficacy of many of the interventions. Both Gist and Bonanno say they believe that the accepted interventions, like narrative catharsis, remain in use for pecuniary, political and historical reasons, reasons that have nothing to do with curing people.
And the history of these reasons? The trauma field is broad and might have begun at any of a number of points: there was Freud, who originally believed that female hysteria was caused by childhood sexual abuse, only to abandon the idea later in favor, perhaps, of something less jarring to Victorian sensibilities; even before Freud, there was Jean Martin Charcot, who posited his patients' fits of hysterics to be somatic expressions of buried traumatic memories. But for modern-day purposes, the trauma industry seems to have started sometime in the early 1980's, when the women's movement asserted that post-traumatic stress disorder did not belong to Vietnam veterans alone; it belonged also to the legions of women who were abused in domestic situations. Mostly middle-class, well-educated women seeing private therapists began to whisper their stories, stories that contradicted the dominant belief in most psychiatric textbooks that incest occurred in one family per million. And yet here were Ph.D.'s and Ed.D.'s and Psy.D.'s and L.C.S.W.'s hearing that no, it happened here, and here, and here, behind this bedroom door, in this dark night, under the same shared suburban sky where we do not live safely. Thus, from their very inception, incest accounts were subversive stories, and their telling became acts of political and personal rehabilitation. Silence, as far as sexual abuse was concerned -- and this quickly radiated out to all forms of trauma -- was tantamount to toxic conformity. Only speech would save. 
It makes sense, therefore, that the tools deployed to help survivors were largely verbal and emphasized narrative reconstruction. Trauma (the word means "wound" in Greek) is seen as a rupture in the long line of language that constructs who we are. The goal of treatment has traditionally been, therefore, to expand the story so that it can accommodate a series of unexpected scenes. By the early 1990's, neurological models of broken narratives were being developed. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, for instance, hypothesized that repressed trauma has very specific neural correlates in the brain. The event -- say, the rape, the plane crash -- is isolated, flash-frozen in a nonverbal neural stream, where it stays stuck, secreting its subterranean signals of fear and panic. The goal of trauma treatment has been to move memories from nonverbal brain regions to verbal ones, where they can be integrated into the life story. 
This, to my mind, is a beautiful theory, one that blesses the brain with malleable storage sites and incredible plot power -- but whether it's true or not, no one knows. More to the point, whether it's true for all people, no one knows. While storying one's life is undoubtedly an essential human activity, the trauma industry may have overlooked this essential fact: not all of us are memoirists. Some of us tell our stories by speaking around them, a kind of Carveresque style where resolution is whispered below the level of audible language. Then again, some of us are fable writers, developing quick tales with tortoises and hares, where right and wrong have a lovely, simple sort of sound. If we are all authors of our experience, as the trauma industry has so significantly reminded us, we are not all cut from the same literary cloth. Some of us are wordy, others prefer the smooth white space between tightly packaged paragraphs. Still others might rather sing over the scary parts than express them at all.
Here's the question: at what cost, this singing? Jennifer Coon-Wallman, a psychotherapist based in Lexington, Mass., asks, "By singing over or cutting off a huge part of your history, aren't you then losing what makes life rich and multifaceted?" I suppose so, but let me tell you this. I've had my fair share of traumas -- I'm sure you have, too -- and if I could learn to tamp them down and thereby prune my thorny lived-out-loud life a little, I'd be more than happy to. Go ahead. Give me a lock and key. 
Girvani Leerer of Arbour-H.R.I. Hospital in Brookline, Mass., doesn't necessarily agree with my lock-and-key longings. "Facing and talking about trauma is one of the major ways people learn to cope with it. They learn to understand their feelings and their experiences and to move out, beyond the event." On the one hand, Gist told me, referring to the work done in Israel, "Ginzburg's study, despite its limitations, is right on and has done us a great service." On the other hand, Dr. Amy Banks, a faculty member at the Jean Baker Miller Training Institute at Wellesley College, says: "Ginzburg's study is interesting, but it's weak. It's saying repression is useful for repressors. Is repression useful for those of us with different styles? I doubt it. I think it's probably harmful." 
Banks's sentiments ultimately win out with doctors and patients, professionals and lay people. "The Courage to Heal," a book by Ellen Bass and Laura Davis about trauma and talk, has sold more than 700,000 copies. Dr. Judith Herman, the director of training at the Victims of Violence Program at Cambridge Hospital, in her updated book "Trauma and Recovery," continues to advocate narrative and catharsis. And a quick scan of trauma Web sites shows that plebeians like you and me are still chatting up a brutal bloody storm.
Beyond the general reactions, there are some specific methodological criticisms clinicians have with the Ginzburg study, one of which is its implicit comparison of sexual-abuse survivors to heart-attack victims. Banks says: "Trauma that happens at the hands of another human being has a much greater psychological impact than trauma that happens from a physical illness, accident or even natural disaster. There's a bigger destruction in trust and relationships. And to further complicate things, sexual abuse usually happens over time, in a situation of secrecy, to what may be a preverbal child. A heart attack is a public event that involves fully verbal adults who have so much more control over their world." Yes and no. Certainly, sexual abuse has an element of shame that medical events don't tend to carry. But as Ginzburg notes at the start of her study, a heart attack is "a stressful life-threatening experience." The death rate is high, the rate of recurrence higher still, and if that doesn't do it for you, consider the symbolic meaning of the heart, that central valentine in its mantle of muscle. Consider the fear when it starts to fibrillate, and then the pain, and afterward, you'll never trust that tired pump again. In both sexual abuse and devastating medical events, the sense of self is shattered, and this commonality may unite the disparate traumas in essential ways.
And yet clinicians still resist the relevance of the Ginzburg findings. Bononno says, "We just don't want to admit they could be true," and that's true. The repression results appear to insult more than challenge us, and this feeling of insult is almost, if not more, interesting than the findings themselves. We are offended. Why?
Alexis de Tocqueville might know. In 1831, when he came to this country, he observed as perhaps no one has since its essential character. Tocqueville saw our narcissism, our puritanism, but he also saw the romanticism that lies at the core of this country. We believe that the human spirit is at its best when it expresses; the individualism that Tocqueville described in his book "Democracy in America" rests on the right, if not the need, to articulate your unique internal state. Repression, therefore, would be considered anti-American, antediluvian, anti-art and terribly Teutonic. At its very American best, the self is revealed through pen and paint and talk. Tocqueville saw that this was the case. So did Emerson and Thoreau and of course Whitman, who upheld the ideas of transcendentalism, singing the soul, letting it all out.
But the resistance to repression goes back even further than the 19th century. Expression as healing and, consequently, repression as damaging can be found as far back as the second century, when the physician and writer Galen extended Hippocrates's theory that the body is a balance of four critical humors: black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood. Disease, especially emotional disease, Galen suggested, is the result of an internal imbalance among these humors, and healing takes place when the physician can drain the body, and soul, of its excess liquid weight. Toward this end, purging, emetics and leeches were used. Wellness was catharsis; catharsis was expression. It's easy to see our current-day talking cures and trauma cures as Galenic spinoffs, notions so deeply rooted in Western culture that to abandon them would be to abandon, in some senses, the philosophical foundations on which medicine and religion rest. 
To embrace or even consider repression as a reasonable coping style is a threat to the romantic ideals so central to this culture, despite our post-modern sheen. Postmodernism, with its pesky protestations that there is no ultimate history or total truth, inadvertently ends up underscoring just these things. We're still all Walt Whitman at heart. Our response to the research illuminates this.
And of course, practically speaking, there are real reasons why we would not want to embrace the current findings. Our entire multimillion-dollar trauma industry would have to be revamped. There are in this country thousands of trauma and recovery centers predicated upon Whitman-esque expression, and sizable portions of the self-help industry are devoted to talking it out. While there wouldn't be a countrywide economic crash if repression came back into vogue, there would be some serious educational, political and medical upheavals. Federally financed programs would go down. Best to avoid that. Best to just repress the thought.
What would therapy look like if repression came back into vogue? Here's Dusty Miller. She lives and works in Northampton, Mass. She's well into her 50's, with blue eyes and moccasins. Her office is small and spartan. On the wall there is a picture of Audre Lorde and the words "When I dare to be powerful -- to use my strength in the service of my vision -- than it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid." Miller knows this to be true.
Before Miller was a psychologist, she was a patient. Before she was a patient, she was a victim, visited nightly by her father, who she says physically and sexually abused her, and this for years and years. At Cornell, where she was an undergraduate, Miller went into therapy, first to be told in the early 1960's that her memories were wishes and then to be told in the 1980's that they were true and that her job was to be Nancy Drew, shining a flashlight into all the dark places.
Which is what Miller did in the 1980's. She went back over and over the memories of trauma and got sicker and sicker. "After many therapy sessions I'd be a quivering ball, and then I'd leave the office and take my credit card and go out and spend $500 on clothes I didn't need." A year or so into her recovered-memory therapy, Miller developed chronically aching joints and a low-grade fever. She could barely move, she was so fatigued. Months passed. Snow fell. Skies cleared. Miller knew she had to make a change. She had gone back to her memories for healing and wound up with a chronic disease. "You know that saying 'It has to get worse before it gets better'?" Miller says to me. "Well, I used to believe that, but I don't anymore. That just leads you to fall apart. And you know the saying 'It's never too late to have a happy childhood'? Well, guess what? It is."
So she quit her Nancy Drew therapy. One day, she told her therapist, "I'm not coming back anymore." Then what did she do? Among other things, she took up . . . tennis. 
Yes, tennis. Keep your eye on the ball, stay inside the bright white lines and hit hard. "Tennis was so grounding and taught me so much grace and helped me to regulate my anxiety. It was tennis, not talk, that really helped."
Miller's own self-styled "cure" fueled her work as a clinician. She began to consider directing her clients away from their traumas and toward the parts of their lives that "gave them more juice." She found that it worked. With trauma survivors, Miller now never begins a group session by asking, "How are you feeling?" "Oh, my God, that would just be a disaster," she says. "All I'd get was, 'Terrible, fearful, awful.' Instead I say, 'What strengths do you need to focus on today?"' In one session, Miller hands out paper dolls and bits of colored paper. Trauma survivors are told to glue the colored paper onto body parts that hurt or have been hurt, "but then," Miller says, "we don't stop there. We turn the dolls over, onto a fresh side, and participants use the same bits of paper to design a body of resilience." 
Miller's form of psychotherapy emphasizes doing, not reflecting. The actions at once block and dilute memories. She, along with other colleagues, has started a trauma resource treatment center in western Massachusetts for low-income women and their children, predicated in part upon the virtues of repression. At the center, there is a kitchen full of utensils, so women can stir and chop instead of sitting and talking, a computer room where women can type up resumes and query letters and, maybe best of all, an attic full of professional clothes so if a job interview is landed, the woman can don a second skin, a sleek suit, a pair of pumps. It's exhilarating.
Miller tells me: "I worked with this woman named Karen, who said she was a sexual-abuse survivor and a schizophrenic. She had been in so much therapy and told her story so many times, and it reinforced her feelings of being sick. She'd been terribly infantilized by the mental health system, a system that tells women to recover by walking around clutching teddy bears and crying." Miller pauses. "With this woman, we never asked her about her past. We saw it would be bad for her. Instead, we put her right on the computer. And then, when she'd learned the computer, we had her do some research work for us, interviewing. And it was incredible." Miller stares up at the ceiling, recalling. "Karen did so well with the work we gave her. She learned to send e-mail, and that thrilled her." Consider this: teaching a schizophrenic sexual-abuse survivor how to press a button and hurl the self through space with cyber-specificity. Who wouldn't feel empowered?
"And then," Miller says, "the feds came out to inspect our program like they do every year or two, and everyone had to go around the room and say, you know, like, 'Hi, I'm Dusty Miller, psychologist.' And when it was Karen's turn, instead of saying, 'Hi, I'm Karen, I'm a schizophrenic sexual-abuse survivor,' she said, 'Hi, I'm Karen, and I'm the lead ethnographer for the Franklin County Women and Violence Project.' I was so proud of her. We got her to stop telling her story, and she improved. There were tears in my eyes."
And today? Karen is feeling better several years later. She has earned enough money at her part-time job to buy a "used used car," and she sings in a community chorus. "I think she sings mostly peace songs," Miller tells me, and what are peace songs, really, but pleas and wishes, pictures of perfection, the wreckage wiped away. Karen, schizophrenic, sexually abused, rarely discusses her memories anymore; she looks to her future, not to her past. Who wouldn't be happy to hear that? And yet, who wouldn't worry as well? Will the trauma treatment of the future be something simplistically saccharine, down by the riverside, or maddeningly upbeat? Or will the trauma treatment of the future be done in small square rooms where no tears are allowed, where the ceiling is lidlike, the walls the color of clamp?
Within the expression-versus-repression debate lurk ancient, essential questions and the oldest myths. In the fifth century B.C., Socrates claimed that an unexamined life was not worth living. Score one for the trauma teams. Around the same time, however, Sophocles described how a raging Oedipus, on a quest for knowledge, gouged out his own eyes when he finally learned the terrible truth; he would have been better off never asking. Score one for the Ginzburg findings. Who's to say which side is right, and when? There are times when a person would be better off diverted; just get a job, for God's sake, we want to say to the endless explorer who keeps reliving and revising the painful past. But then there are those folks with mouths as stern as minus signs, their faces like fists; they could use a little expressive therapy, for sure. In the end, we may need to parse repression, nuance it, so that we understand it as a force with potentially healthful and unhealthful aspects. Freud once defined repression quite benignly as a refocusing of attention away from unpleasant ideas. Of course there are times, in an increasingly frantic world, when we need to do that; repression as filter, a screen to keep us clean. So turn away. But run away? Therein lies the litmus test. 
If you're breathless, knees knocking, and life is a pure sprint from some shadow, I say go back. Slow down. Dwell. As for the rest of us, let's do an experiment and measure the outcome. Let us fashion our lids; let us prop them proudly on top of our hurting heads.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
Awaking to the Nightmares of His Youth

BYLINE:  By DAVE KEHR 

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
THE wallpaper was very important," David Cronenberg said. "There is a lot of wallpaper in this movie."
 And so there is -- wallpaper of a distinctively scratchy, smoke-stained variety, with bilious undertones of green, gray and yellow, all characteristic of the immediate postwar period in Britain. 
 This is the postwar Britain where George Orwell wrote "Nineteen Eighty-four" and from which he drew many of the drab details of his nightmarish vision of the near future. It is the postwar Britain of David Lean's "Brief Encounter" (1946) and Carol Reed's "Fallen Idol" (1948), a drab, forlorn, nearly lifeless landscape where the great hopes that accompanied the end of hostilities have collapsed under the reality of economic stagnation. 
This is also the Britain where "Spider," Mr. Cronenberg's latest film, is set. A harrowing, stylized psychological drama, "Spider" climbs inside the tortured memories of the title character, a jittery young man (Ralph Fiennes) who has been released from a mental institution into this harsh, unaccommodating new world. The film will open on Friday in New York and Los Angeles, and then nationally on March 14.
"In fact, things in England were worse than what had come before," Mr. Cronenberg said over coffee in September at the Toronto International Film Festival, where "Spider" had its North American premiere. "They had lost their empire, which is something I think they're still recovering from."
Though Mr. Cronenberg, 59, was born and raised in Toronto (where he continues to work), his father was a British journalist who steeped him in Anglophilia. "I went to England when I was very young," he remembered, "I mean, in my early 20's. And I've been going there for a long time. So I had a real feel for it physically as well as artistically. I slept on floors with the heater burning your face and the rest of you freezing. And the moldy, damp wallpaper was a very important part for me, because you need to feel all that stuff. You can feel the itchiness of the clothes." 
The sense of loss and disorientation, of a world turned upside down and inside out, is central to "Spider." Adapted by the English author Patrick McGrath from his own 1990 novel, the film opens with the newly released Spider Cleg feeling his way through an eerily deserted industrial London in search of the halfway house where he is to live.
The institution, supervised by the compassionate Mrs. Wilkinson (Lynn Redgrave), turns out to bear a strong enough resemblance to Spider's childhood home that it plunges him into a series of hallucinatory flashbacks. He sees himself as a child, reliving the traumatic incident that set off his mental illness.
We never learn how much of Spider's memories is true and how much invention. But what we see as the adult Spider looks on, sharing the frame with his younger self (portrayed by Bradley Hall), is a bizarre Oedipal drama in which his alcoholic, abusive father (Gabriel Byrne) seems to murder Spider's long-suffering mother (Miranda Richardson) and move a cockney prostitute into her place in the family home. The prostitute, Yvonne, is played by Ms. Richardson as well, a device that blends the ancient archetypes of mother and whore into a frighteningly ambiguous figure.
"I think he's someone who has harbored a particular vision of his childhood and embellished it," Mr. Fiennes said of his character, speaking in Toronto last fall. "And he comes out into this halfway house, and he revisits the precise locations of his childhood, which are catalysts for his crystallizing these fantasy memories, as if to keep away the real truth of what happened."
When he talks about his character, Mr. Fiennes reflexively drops his gaze and mumbles into his chest, much as Spider does: "Sometimes Spider revisits the scenes of his childhood and remembers exactly what happened, like the brushing of the mother's hair or watching the meals being served. And then he takes these moments of basically healthy memory into this other area where he revisits the panic of his emerging sexuality, as he sees it in his mother. And that creates Yvonne. 
"And in his head what is fantasy memory and what is ordinary memory becomes very confused," Mr. Fiennes said. "When he's watching the boy, I think that it's really happening. But when the boy isn't present, like the scene on the canal where Miranda gropes Gabriel Byrne, I think that's what they call infected memory, thoughts that didn't really happen."
The psychological drama of "Spider" might seem at first a departure for Mr. Cronenberg, whose reputation rests on more overt horror films like "Scanners" (1981), "The Fly" (1986) and "Dead Ringers" (1988). But since "Naked Lunch" in 1991, Mr. Cronenberg has been moving into less clearly charted territory, exploring worlds in which reality bleeds into fantasy and vice versa, sometimes inspired by traditional drugs (like the heroin use in "Naked Lunch"), sometimes by new ones (like the video game of 1999's "Existenz") and sometimes by the timelessly intoxicating qualities of sex and violence, as in Mr. Cronenberg's notorious 1996 "Crash," about sexual outlaws turned on by car wrecks. In the meantime, the special effects that once dominated his work have diminished into occasional touches.
"Some people have said to me, 'Well, it's not like your other movies, where there are body effects and stuff,' " Mr. Cronenberg observed. "And I said, 'No, for me special effects is nothing -- I mean, no different from lighting or costume or makeup.' It's just a tool that you have and you use it when you need to and you don't when you don't. But the character Spider is very body-centered. He's obsessed with his body; he feels things are emanating from it. But it's all in his head."
For Miranda Richardson, the postwar period of "Spider" was a place she had already visited, in the 1985 film that first brought her to attention, "Dance With a Stranger." "Certain elements were probably still there in my head from 'Dance,' " she remembered. "Everybody wanted a party -- that being the main phrase I remember -- after the war. But of course, not everybody got one. Hence, all the pubs and little clubs springing up and all the after-hours drinking. And of course, Yvonne is part of that. Let's all have a good time, you know, despite everything."
In such a stylized film, does an actor reach for a stylized performance? "No, I sincerely hope not," Ms. Richardson said. "I was trying to play for the truth of each character. It gets a bit more heightened when Yvonne takes over Mrs. Cleg and wears her clothes and takes on the domestic goddess role. I did kind of up it a bit then. I think Yvonne became a bit more considered in what she was saying, because she's got a different responsibility now. She's gone up in the world. She's not on the street." 
A British-Canadian co-production, "Spider" matched exterior scenes photographed in London with studio sequences shot on a Toronto sound stage. "It didn't start out as formally expressionistic as it ended up being," Mr. Cronenberg said. "And it did end up being quite expressionistic, I think.
"The streets of London have never been that empty, not even in the 40's. We had period cars ready to go. We had extras dressed in period costumes. But whenever we would put them in the frame, my cameraman and I and everybody else, we would say that's not right. What's wrong? I'd say, well, let's get rid of that guy, let's get rid of that car, let's get rid of that pushcart. And the more we took away, the better it was, until it was just Spider alone on the street.
"It became obvious that it was really Spider's solitude and his disconnection that we were expressing," Mr. Cronenberg added. "And that's why the streets had to be empty and the rooms had to be so empty."
That approach was something that developed during the actual shooting, according to Mr. Cronenberg. Despite the complex visual effects his films sometimes require, Mr. Cronenberg said, he resists the process known in the trade as storyboarding, in which each shot is sketched out comic-book style before the filming begins.
"I don't want to impose a rigorous external, preconceived idea on a movie when in fact I have wonderful collaborators and I have the opportunity to respond to the actual event of shooting the film," he said. "It's a very sculptural and tactile process for me, making a movie." 
For all of the density and ambiguity of "Spider," Mr. Fiennes said, in the end he came to appreciate his character's lucidity. "I felt he had a very clear take on his fears and his apprehensions," he said, "on his anxieties about where he was and who he was with. In fact, it was a great role for that reason, because I could just look and react. And there was a lot to react to. That's why not having many lines didn't really matter. There's a lot going on in this man's head."

HEADLINE: SPRING THEATER; 
Where You and I Become Us

BYLINE:  By WENDY WASSERSTEIN; Wendy Wasserstein is writing the libretto for a forthcoming show, "Pamela's First Musical," with music and lyrics by Cy Coleman and David Zippel.

 BODY:
THE Red Meat Club meets approximately every quarter. For the last 20 years, Carole Rothman, the artistic director of the Second Stage Theater, Heidi Ettinger, the Tony Award-winning set designer, and I have released our inner carnivores at steak joints, where we devour man-size slabs of beef, washed down with tumblers of Chianti.
 But the real purpose of our gathering is not to compete with the eating habits of Fred Flintstone. We meet informally to assess our parallel lives in the theater. Two weeks ago, however, the tone was different. Even before we ordered, Carole, who has the calm and chipper demeanor of a veteran producer, leaned in seriously: 
 "You know no one's going to the theater. And I'm not just talking about mine!" Carole was adamant. "People are not going out! It's freezing, the economy stinks and there's an orange terror alert. Who in their right mind would run out to see a show?"
Producers like Carole don't tend to be alarmists; there are too many daily vagaries, each with the potential for disaster. Carole was being realistic. With the combination of armed guards flanking Times Square, the 24-7 cable news networks constantly predicting the unpredictable, and weather conditions conducive only to polar bears, abominable snowmen and the Norwegian Olympic luge team, potential theatergoers are hesitant to leave the comforts of their warm and duct-taped homes.
Maybe producers as well as audiences need to be reminded that attending the theater is an inimitably life-affirming experience, especially during difficult times. In England, for instance, most of the theaters famously remained open during the Blitz. In 1941, Noel Coward wrote "Blithe Spirit" in a week, and it ran longer than any of his previous plays. There is nothing like a catharsis in times of high anxiety. There is also nothing as humane as sharing a laugh with strangers in the dark.
Obviously, in uncertain times, paranoia and fear pervade. This is especially true when we are being advised to stock emergency kits with iodine pills. People I know whose seafaring experience was limited to the Staten Island Ferry are suddenly searching the Web for inflatable Navy Seal rafts. Perhaps a better way to temper rampant imagination is to return to the theater. The loneliness of speculation can be eased by the orderliness and cumulative power of a play.
"Unlike reading a book, or watching a television show, theater is communal," Jack Viertel, creative director of Jujamcyn Theaters, explains. "If I can walk into a theater with a thousand people and we can collectively embrace the world of a doomed August Wilson hero and the triumph in 'Hairspray' of a chunky Baltimore girl, and we can break our hearts as Uncle Vanya's illusions about romantic love come crashing down -- if we can share the emotional life of every one of those worlds, we're acknowledging that we're all made of the same stuff."
New Yorkers are born and bred theatergoers, and so are many of those who come to the city. For many of us, taking in a show is the most extraordinary ordinary thing. At a luncheon recently, the television personality Phyllis George mentioned to me that she was staying in New York that night to see "Man of La Mancha."
"My kids said to me: 'Why are you doing that? It's not safe,' " she confided. "But I said, 'As long as Brian Stokes Mitchell and those actors are performing, I'm going.' I mean, we can talk about leaving the city, but those kids on Broadway are there eight times a week. And if they're there, I'm there, too."
In tentative and isolating times, it is grounding to embrace an art form that is fundamentally based on collaboration. Moreover, the fervor with which theater people believe that the show must go on, even in dire straits, is contagious. Performing is an act of craft, courage and continuity that is ultimately reassuring both to those who practice it and to those who appreciate it. The art of theater is the moment of interplay between an artist and an audience. When revisited, those same moments serve as touchstones to illuminate everything from our own personal history to national character.
During a recent sold-out revival of "South Pacific," directed by Molly Smith at the Arena Stage in Washington, I was once again reminded of how Ensign Nellie Forbush from Little Rock, Ark., defined love, valor and even freedom from prejudice to an entire generation of post-World War II Americans.
Forbush, a nurse at a South Pacific naval base, unabashedly insists she doesn't care if everyone says the world's coming to an end: she can't help being optimistic. Immediately afterward, she breaks into the song "A Cockeyed Optimist." 
Fifty years later, audiences facing the possibility of an imminent war can still look to Nellie and her contemporary counterparts in the American theater for a reflection of their own indomitable spirit. 
Walking into a theater, I always feel a civility and profound anticipation of things to come. That civility is crucial in the best and worst of times.

HEADLINE: SPRING THEATER: STATE OF THE ART; 
Fabulous? Certainly. An Invalid? Maybe Not.

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
THE fabulous invalid may have reasons to moan this season: a suffering economy, slumping tourism, plunging temperatures and, above all, a public anxious about war and terrorism. But Broadway -- and New York theater in general -- perseveres. Even more, it is showing signs of unexpected vitality, both on stages and at construction sites where new theaters are rising.
 How to explain it? 
 "I think the impulse to produce theater is so strong that it flies in the face of economics," said Virginia P. Louloudes, executive director of the Alliance of Resident Theaters, known as A.R.T./New York, which represents more than 400 nonprofit theaters and related arts groups in the city. 
The public has seen an unusual abundance of vibrant theater in New York this season. There have been Broadway hits like "Hairspray," "Movin' Out," "La Boheme" and "Frankie and Johnny." There have been critical successes like "Def Poetry Jam," "Medea" and "Tartuffe." Off Broadway, a number of productions have received critical acclaim, including David Lindsay-Abaire's "Kimberly Akimbo," Neil LaBute's "Mercy Seat" and Caryl Churchill's "Far Away."
"We were in the confluence of events, in the souls of our community," said James C. Nicola, artistic director of New York Theater Workshop, which produced "Far Away" and, before that, Tony Kushner's "Homebody/Kabul." "These artists spoke to the fears in our hearts."
Still to come are several much-anticipated productions, including revivals of Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night," with Vanessa Redgrave, Brian Dennehy, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robert Sean Leonard; "Gypsy," with Bernadette Peters; and "Nine," with Antonio Banderas and Chita Rivera.
At the half-price ticket booths in Times Square and Lower Manhattan, sales are up 15 percent over last year, despite the drop in tourism, which suggests that local residents are seeing more shows even as they are trying to spend less. "I'm surprised by the activity at the windows, considering what we've been through," said Jim Gatens, the head treasurer of TKTS.
To be sure, Broadway box-office grosses dropped more than 11 percent from the last week of January to the first week of February -- two months in which theatrical doldrums occur every winter -- and a few shows, including "Oklahoma!" and "Metamorphoses," decided to close. But grosses for the month of January were up 41 percent from last year and 28 percent from January 2000.
The League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade association for the commercial theater industry, sees the numbers as better than expected. It says that weekly Broadway grosses are averaging about $15 million, compared with $10 million last year. Total audiences are averaging 230,000 people a week, compared with 160,000 a year ago and 127,000 in 1992. More shows opened in 2002 than in any other year over the last decade. 
"Broadway is always going to be a roller coaster," said Jed Bernstein, president of the league. "But we seem to be in a time when the mass appeal of it is remarkably strong, given the soft economy."
And according to Philip J. Smith, president of the Shubert Organization, "We don't have enough theaters for all the shows." 
But some theater veterans are more wary. "There's so much uncertainty in the air now because of the general economy and the imminence of war that unless you have a big hit, it's very scary to know what the financial prospects really are," said Todd Haimes, artistic director of the Roundabout Theater Company, which produced "Tartuffe" and "Cabaret."
Mr. Haimes said a drop in advance ticket sales after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has been particularly troublesome. Although tickets purchased the day or week of a performance have been making up for the decline, producers have found themselves unable to plan for the future the way they once could.
But advance sales, too, have improved recently. Typically, 50 percent of the audience buys tickets 30 days or more in advance. That figure reached a low of 15 percent after the terrorist attacks. It is now up to 38 percent.
The work onstage has also been innovative, challenging long-held beliefs that Broadway is hospitable only to traditional fare. "La Boheme" is an Italian opera. "Movin' Out" is an all-dance piece by Twyla Tharp set to the music of Billy Joel. "Def Poetry Jam" (with strong reviews but disappointing sales) offers young poets in impassioned performances and music by a disc jockey.
"These are all atypical for the Broadway we've known over the last decade," Mr. Bernstein said. "It shows some vitality and risk-taking." 
Perhaps, Ms. Louloudes said, Broadway has been freed to create more boldly because of current events. "It may be," she said, "that when times are tough, people say, 'If I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it the way I want to do it.' "
Margo Lion, the lead producer of "Hairspray," said she was so taken with Stephen Adly Guirgis's play "Our Lady of 121st Street," directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, that she joined the board of the Labyrinth Theater Company, which produced it. The play opens on March 6 at the Union Square Theater after a run last fall at Center Stage/NY.
Other highlights of the season have included revivals of "Burn This" and "Fifth of July," both by Lanford Wilson; Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen's "Exonerated," about the death penalty; and the pairing of two Donmar Warehouse hits, "Uncle Vanya" and "Twelfth Night," directed by Sam Mendes, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Lately, buzz has been building about "Radiant Baby," the musical at the Joseph Papp Public Theater about the artist Keith Haring, which opens next Sunday. With that and "Caroline or Change," a musical in the works for next season by Tony Kushner and the composer Jeanine Tesori -- both shows are directed by George C. Wolfe -- the Public is percolating, even as it tries to eliminate a deficit. "The art is the good news here," said Mara Manus, the theater's executive director.
Despite a weak real estate market, building projects are also proceeding, including a first Broadway home for the nonprofit Manhattan Theater Club, in the old Biltmore Theater on West 47th Street.
Theater Row, on West 42nd Street from Ninth Avenue to Dyer Avenue, has been transformed. The Theater Row complex alone houses five new Off Broadway theaters. Down the block, the Little Shubert Theater, a $12.5 million, 499-seat space, opened in December. 
Between these two is Playwrights Horizons, which even before the $32 million construction on its space had been completed was presenting concert versions of three musicals it originated -- "Falsettos," "Violet" and "Floyd Collins" -- all of which sold out. 
Tim Sanford, the artistic director, said he could not explain how the theater pulled that off: "It's sort of like you just got married. There is no time to be exhausted." 
The Zipper Theater on West 37th Street in the garment district has also opened. And nearby, at 520 Eighth Avenue, between 36th and 37th Streets, A.R.T./New York has opened a new office complex for arts groups and related organizations. In addition to offices, the 32,000-square-foot space includes two rehearsal studios and a room that can be used for meetings, conferences or rehearsals.
A building on East 59th Street, to be called 59E59, is to open next January with three new theaters, one with 199 seats, where Primary Stages, now based on West 45th Street, will become the resident company.
Most of those projects were started several years ago, when the economy was considerably stronger, and it will be harder for theaters that want to expand to raise the money now. New York Theater Workshop, for example, is searching for a second performance space to add to its current East Fourth Street home. 
Nevertheless, Ms. Louloudes pointed out, there are 450 nonprofit theaters in New York today, compared with 150 a decade ago. That growth, she said, spanned the last recession and is a sign of the resilience and resourcefulness of New York theater.
Evidence of that is the fact that while four out of five Broadway shows fail to recoup their investments, producers have been coming back for more. Many shows were expected to close in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, and a few did. But Broadway bounced back so quickly that it ended up returning $1 million of the city's $2.5 million emergency aid package.
Richard Greenberg, whose well-received play "Take Me Out" opens on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theater on Thursday after an earlier run at the Public Theater, said he saw evidence of theater's resilience shortly after Sept. 11. It came during a dress rehearsal of the Broadway revival of Strindberg's "Dance of Death," adapted by Mr. Greenberg.
"There was a palpable sense of relief, something it would be wrong to call festive but weirdly valiant and positive, about it," Mr. Greenberg said. "I don't like to get sentimental about theater, but there is something that seems perpetually alluring and unexpectedly strong about its power."

HEADLINE: America Most Beautiful 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH SIANO and MARJORIE CONNELLY; JOSEPH SIANO is an assistant to the editor of the Travel section of The Times. MARJORIE CONNELLY is an editor in News Surveys for The Times.

 BODY:
OF the factors keeping American travelers closer to home these days, the threat of war with Iraq seems just part of a more general set of anxieties over terrorism and anti-American sentiment, according to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll. Most Americans have already narrowed their travel horizons for the next six months, the poll shows, with the uncertainties over Iraq alone not a deciding factor for most of them. 
 Of the 747 adults nationwide who were surveyed by telephone Feb. 10 to 12, 55 percent replied that they would not travel overseas in the next six months, regardless of available vacation time or money. Of those, 5 percent said the chance of war with Iraq was the reason for not going beyond North America. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
 Only 3 percent said that they had canceled a vacation because of the threat of war; 17 percent said that it would make them less likely to fly -- less than half the proportion (36 percent) who responded that way in a Times/CBS News poll completed within two weeks of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Even without the turmoil over Iraq, the poll indicates, Americans have anxieties about traveling abroad. Among the 55 percent who said they weren't going overseas any time soon, 21 percent said they were generally afraid to do so or thought the world is just too unsettled. Eighteen percent of that majority specifically cited concerns about terrorism; and 7 percent thought that it simply was not safe for Americans to leave North America. 
"It just seems as if Americans are a target," said Beulah Metzler, 73, a retired school secretary and power-company employee in Tooele, Utah. 
Mrs. Metzler, speaking in a follow-up telephone interview, said that she had felt this way for some time -- even before Sept. 11. Also, her age and the inability of her husband, Jack, to travel long distances are keeping her closer to home. But none of these factors will keep her from flying with her daughter and granddaughter to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, later this year to celebrate the latter's high school graduation. 
"My biggest fear would be the threat of terrorism," said Pete Feeney, 36, an engineer with the Merchant Marine who lives in Bowdoinham, Me. "I would travel abroad as business dictates. I just wouldn't make a vacation out of it." Mr. Feeney and his wife, Nanette, have an 11-month-old daughter. As for flying, "I really don't have a problem with it," he said, expanding on his poll responses. "There's a risk, but the risk is so broad based on the number of flights."
Michael Lynn Scott, 48, the superintendent of water treatment in his hometown of Princeton, Ill., said that what he characterized as the tough tone of President Bush's foreign policy is making him afraid to visit faraway countries. 
"I don't think I'd venture anywhere but Mexico or Canada because it's not real popular to be an American right now," he said. "I'd fly anywhere in the United States because I think the security is good."
In an indirect way, a potential war with Iraq has Cynthe Dumler, a 27-year-old registered nurse in Lincoln, Neb., worried about being stranded far from home. "I have two uncles in the military, and if something happens and they get shipped out, I want to be at least within a rental-car drive from home so I can say goodbye," she said. 
Twenty-six percent of those who said they weren't planning to travel abroad said they had no desire to do so or preferred to stay closer to home. "I've never been anywhere outside the United States or had an inkling to do so," said Kimberly Jones-Hamm, 39, a secretary with the General Services Administration who lives in Martinsburg, W.Va., with her husband, Donald, and their son, James. "I guess the United States is more trustworthy. You don't have to worry about anybody else." She has lots of company: the poll shows that 55 percent of Americans have never been overseas. 
Mrs. Jones-Hamm said her parents visited Europe in the late 1970's. "When they went, it was still cool," she said. "There wasn't a Taliban or a Saddam Hussein threatening the United States."
Still, 43 percent of those surveyed said that they would be willing to vacation overseas in the next six months, and Europe was the main choice among that group (61 percent), with Britain leading the wish list. 
Klain Robinson, 21, of Mobile, Ala., has just received a degree in graphic design, and like many other young people, he says, "If I had the money, I would go to Europe because there are so many places there I want to see." He is not worried about flying, he says, because "security is so good now."
John Fortini, a 39-year-old restaurateur in Buffalo, would like to visit relatives in Sicily. "I don't change my life style because of what's going on," he said. "If you show weakness by changing what you are going to do, the people attacking you win."
That attitude, according to the poll, is likely to be more prevalent among younger or wealthier individuals. A total of 58 percent of respondents younger than 30 said they would be willing to travel abroad in the near future, compared with 27 percent of those 65 or older. And 65 percent of people in households with a median annual income over $75,000 were willing to fly overseas soon.
Regardless of age or income, most Americans soon will be taking a break from their routines, the poll indicates, with 70 percent of respondents saying that they planned at least one vacation in the next six months. Of those, 33 percent saidthat they planned to go by car and 27 percent expected to fly. A similar question in a May 1993 Times/CBS News poll (when 67 percent said they were planning to vacation within 1,000 miles of home) brought the response that 45 percent were going by car and 17 percent would fly.
Although there are no Times/CBS News polling results to show how popular flying might have been between these two surveys, the 1993 poll was conducted at a time when there were no lingering worries about terrorism and a trip through airport security did not require the wearing of presentable hosiery. So why are significantly more American vacationers ready to fly today than almost a decade ago?
Perhaps economics override security jitters. The sampling of bargain air fares in the Travel section of The Times in May 1993 turned up such round-trip fares as $388 from New York to San Francisco, and $228 from New York to Miami. A check last Monday, for travel beginning March 26, found a $238 round-trip fare on the New York-San Francisco route and $184 New York to Miami. The lowest New York-Paris round-trip fare in a May 1993 Travel section survey was $598; last week, one of the lowest fares was $269. The more recent fares do not include the security fees added post 9/11. But the comparison suggests that even without adjusting for inflation, some air fares are as attractive as ever.

HEADLINE: In Utah, Nature's Skyline 

BYLINE:  By By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
THE Girl Scout inside me, the one who by age 11 had earned nearly a dozen merit badges related to the outdoors and hiking, was locked in battle with my inner city slicker. But the city slicker was winning. Driving last October on Scenic State Highway 12 in southern Utah -- which winds for 120 miles through rugged deserts, multicolored cliffs and mountainsides blanketed with flame-yellow aspens -- I was one unhappy camper.
 Into Day 2 of a planned six-day road trip through this region, one of the wildest and most remote in the continental United States, I had not had what I considered a decent meal since touching down at the little airport in St. George, Utah, and picking up my rental car. 
 There was the trout with almonds at the restaurant of the Parry Lodge in Kanab, my first night's stop. Over the years, the lodge, an old-fashioned white clapboard motel built in the 1920's, has played host to a star-studded list of Hollywood actors shooting westerns on location in Kanab, almost on the Arizona border. Their names, painted in script, grace the door frames of about half of the little motel rooms, tomark those they stayed in. 
But I wondered whether John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Don Knotts had also been subjected to the restaurant's dry, overcooked trout.
When I arrived the next day at Bryce Canyon National Park, my gloom deepened as I drove through the tacky-looking gauntlet of motels and two "family style" restaurants that line the road leading into the park. For the sake of convenience -- the next-nearest motels to Bryce are 11 miles farther down the road in Tropic -- I checked into the Bryce View Lodge, a pre-fab motel, which unlike the others, was set far back from the road and had a view of trees. I resigned myself to my fate of jaw-dropping vistas accompanied by salads composed entirely of iceberg lettuce.
If my inner city slicker was grumbling about my stay at Bryce Canyon, my lungs and heart sealed the deal that afternoon, as I tried to get a bit closer to its natural wonders than just driving up to the parking lots that adjoin the overlooks of the park's broad canyon, or amphitheater. Down in the canyon, spreading in every direction, are thousands of tall, knobby red limestone pillars called hoodoos, the result of hundreds of millions of years of earthquakes, water and soil erosion, and a host of other geological factors unique to the region. All was explained thoroughly in the park brochure, but I couldn't quite seem to keep it straight as I was reading it.
Why was my brain fogging over? Why did my thighs feel like petrified wood and my heart pump wildly during what seemed to be a relatively easy hike on the Navajo-Queen's Garden Trail down into the amphitheater and back up again? Referring back to that brochure, I noticed that Bryce Canyon lies between 8,000 and 9,000 feet above sea level. Not yet adjusted to the altitude, I decided that further hiking in Bryce would be a miserable slog.
So I got up early the next morning and hit Scenic Highway 12, headed with high hopes for the twin beacons of Capitol Reef National Park (elevation 5,000 to 6,000 feet) and the town of Torrey.
Burning up the two-lane highway, I soon noticed that cows ruled this part of Utah. They lazed along the shoulders of the road, occasionally strolling out to take a peek at the tourists. Their presence was not surprising, since raising cattle has been a mainstay of the local economy since the 1840's, when Mormons walked over the Rockies into southern Utah, pushing their possessions in handcarts. 
And unlike in neighboring Wyoming and Colorado, where cattle barons and corporations eventually took over the cattle trade, the Utah ranches and their cows remained in the hands of these hardy Mormon families. Thinking about these settlers and their precarious way of eking out a living from a dry, almost extraterrestial landscape made me feel guilty. What was a little iceberg lettuce compared to life on a 19th-century ranch, with supplies few and far between, and even water a luxury?
And I thought of the other famous -- well, notorious -- inhabitants of wild southern Utah, the gang of Butch Cassidy. From around the 1870's to the 1890's, they rampaged through the small towns of the area, first stealing cattle, then graduating to banks and trains, then retreating in a flurry of pistol fire to hideouts in these lonely, lunar-rock canyons. Holed up in a remote canyon with their loot, they had to rely for months on accomplices to slip them basic supplies. 
But then, at least according to the fascinating 1938 account by Charles Kelly ("The Outlaw Trail: A History of Butch Cassidy and His Wild Bunch") that I had picked up in a little bookstore in Panguitch, on my way to Bryce, the gang would get cabin fever and burst out of hiding. With a thunder of hoofbeats and a fusillade of pistol shots, they'd descend on a little Western burg, spend their stolen dough and paint the town red.
One of those towns was Torrey. I revved the car engine a little in memory of those days as I reached Torrey's main drag, which was gloriously lined with cottonwood trees that had turned brilliant gold. Counting not just one but three restaurants that looked as if they had potential, I pulled into an inviting little courtyard with a few cabins and a two-story motel made of logs.
This was Austin's Chuckwagon Inn, where a warm welcome from the owner, Randy Austin, and an unusually big, spotless motel room with two queen beds took the edge off my bad mood. (The price, as at the other places I'd stayed in so far, was around $50.) I soaked the rest of it away in the Chuckwagon's outdoor hot tub, looking up at the sunset glinting off the red rock cliffs in the distance.
That night, as the sun's last light turned the clouds orange-pink, I treated myself to a superb dinner at the hilltop restaurant recommended by Mr. Austin, the Rim Rock Restaurant -- filet mignon prepared perfectly, a salad actually containing mesclun, and a delicious baked stuffed squash.
There were still more happy surprises waiting in Torrey. The next morning, after two cups of fresh brewed coffee at Robbers Roost, the sunny, cozy bookstore on West Main Street named for one of Cassidy's hideouts, I headed down the road eight miles to Capitol Reef National Park.
I'd read that Capitol Reef was a relatively undiscovered jewel of the national park system (it gets about 700,000 visitors a year, as opposed to the 1.36 million who went to Bryce last year), and it did not disappoint. The 10-mile scenic drive that runs through the main part of the park winds through tall red cliffs and rock formations that while not as much of a blockbuster as Bryce's amphitheaters, were as strange and wonderful in their own way. Best of all, the road was almost empty, with no tour buses in sight.
Later, after consulting with a helpful ranger at the visitor center, I began exploring some of the park's numerous trails, and began to understand why Capitol Reef gets such high marks. The park's trails are unusually varied, not just in difficulty, but in terrain. And with a good number of them only three to three and a half miles round trip, you can do several short hikes a day, adding to the variety.
One afternoon I explored spooky, narrow Cohab Canyon, so named because it served as a hideaway for the plural wives of local Mormon patriarchs during the 1880's, when Federal officials often raided nearby towns looking for violators of the polygamy statute. Strewn with black rocks, the canyon was lined with steep, slick walls of stone pockmarked with holes like driftwood and veined in every shade of red, brown and orange imaginable. Hiking the mile-long trail, I couldn't imagine spending a single night, much less several weeks, holed up in this truly eerie place.
Another morning, I climbed about 500 feet up a steep switchback to a cliff ridge that overlooks one of Capitol Reef's most famous features -- an eerie, skyscraperlike sandstone tower called Chimney Rock. Holding my breath, I strolled carefully along a precipice that reminded me of those in the Road Runner cartoons and spotted the white speck of my rental car far below.
There was time afterward to poke around the remains of Fruita, a former historic settlement of a Mormon colony that sits within thepark boundaries. I slipped into one of the still-functioning fruit orchards that had a sign outside, "U-Pick-Fruit," and grabbed some tiny apples for my afternoon trek of about a mile to the Hickman Natural Bridge, a golden-toned arc of rock that dramatically spans a dry creek.
I would have been happy to stay in Torrey for a week, hiking during the day, eating steaks and lazing in the hot tub or at the bookstore in the evening. But I had a plane to catch back in St. George and a very demanding 300-mile drive that I didn't want to do in one day. 
Which turned out to be not a bad thing, for on the return trip, I found my way to Kodachrome Basin State Park, a nearly deserted area about 16 miles southeast of Bryce. Kodachrome was mapped and explored in the 1940's by a team from the National Geographic Society, who'd named it after their preferred type of film. The area's most dramatic feature is a double-arched natural bridge, Grosvenor Arch (named after the society's president, Gilbert Grosvenor), which rises abruptly on a flat, lonely plain about 10 miles south of the park entrance. The Kodachrome Basin region is also home to hundreds of curiously shaped sandstone towers, thought by geologists to be petrified geysers.
I rented a pretty heated cabin for two nights at the park from Myra Lee Ott, a rancher and descendant of the original Mormon settler families; the price was $65 a night, a bit more than I'd been paying, but for two double beds, refrigerator and private bath (shower only), it was worth it. 
Mine was the only occupied cabin in the row of six; so when Ms. Ott closed up her next-door trading post and went back to the ranch, I was alone for the night with the coyotes, foxes and a front porch view of the Grand Parade. This stunning formation of sandstone and granite outcrops spreads like nature's skyline on the distant horizon. In the hush of the last light of the day, I watched the huge rocks turn red and pink, then black.
It was time for dinner, but too dark and too far a drive to the nearest restaurant, nine miles away. No matter. On the way to Kodachrome, I'd bought some cheese, nuts and cherry tomatoes. Alone, and surrounded by Utah's rocks and wildlife, food was the last thing on my mind.

The bottom line
I spent an average of $137.50 a day during six days in southern Utah, including a rental car and gas, motels, food and park fees. 
Spring and fall are ideal times to visit; summer is hot and winters can be cold and snowy.

Getting There
I booked a round-trip ticket from J.F.K. to St. George, Utah, via Los Angeles, with an added leg to Palm Springs, Calif., on United Airlines, (800) 864-8331, www.ual.com. The price was a decidedly unfrugal $1,146, but I had little flexibility in my schedule and made reservations only seven days in advance. A recent search on United's Web site found a round-trip from New York to St. George in mid-March, without the Palm Springs leg, for $383. 
My midsize car from Avis , (800) 331-1212, www.avis.com, at the St. George airport cost $246 for six days, including taxes.

Where to Stay
The 89 rooms at Parry Lodge, 89 East Center Street, Kanab, (888) 289-1722, fax (435) 644-2605, www.parrylodge.com, are standard courtyard motel fare -- two full beds or one queen, bathrooms with shower, and air-conditioning. But outside, there's atmosphere -- the white clapboard motel dates from 1926 and once played host to Hollywood actors, whose names grace the room's doors. My room cost $62.02, including tax. When it reopens March 1, rates will be $52 to $73, including full breakfast, though the restaurant is discontinuing other meals. 
Bryce View Lodge, 991 South Highway 63, Bryce; (435) 834-5180, fax (435) 834-5265; and www.bryceviewlodge.com, is one of the few lodging options just outside the entrance to Bryce Canyon National Park. My room at the boxy, pre-fab motel came to $55 with tax (I got a discount for staying on the second of the motel's two floors). The room was typical motel style, with two queen beds and a bathroom with tub and shower. It reopens April 1; doubles from $52. 
Austin's Chuckwagon Lodge, 12 West Main Street, Torrey, (800) 863-3288, fax (435) 425-3434, www.austinschuckwagonmotel.com, offers 25 rooms with more comfort, cleanliness and character than the typical roadside lodging. My room was unusually spacious and had a separate dressing area with vanity sink, toilet and shower. The motel, set in a pretty courtyard with trees and flowers, has an outdoor heated swimming pool and hot tub. My room cost $53.84 with tax. When it reopens March 15, doubles will be $64.
The Trailhead Cabins, Post Office Box 180076, Cannonville, (435) 679-8787, after April 1 (435) 670-8536, fax (435) 679-8888, www.brycecanyoninn.com, are inside Kodachrome Basin State Park. The six tidy modern log cabins each have two double beds, bath with sink, toilet and shower, heat and air-conditioning, refrigerator and outdoor charcoal grill. The owner, Myra Loy Ott, runs the adjacent general store, and is quite helpful with information about park trails and activities. The cabins, which open April 1, cost $65.

Where to Eat
Torrey is the culinary oasis of this part of the state. My meal at Rim Rock Restaurant, 2523 East Highway 24, Torrey, (435) 425-3388, was delicious, well prepared and presented -- filet mignon, with sides of baked squash and greens, and a mesclun salad. Dinner, with a glass of red wine and a yummy dessert of fresh berries and ice cream, came to $35. It is set dramatically atop a bluff overlooking Capitol Reef park; closed January and February. 
At Cafe Diablo, 599 West Main Street, Torrey, (435) 425-3070, www.cafediablo.net, an ambitious, if somewhat precious, Southwestern restaurant, I ate a spinach salad (which arrived, like most of the dishes I saw, held upright inside a tortilla), and an entree of trout encrusted with pumpkin seeds sitting atop a pancake of cornmeal and wild rice. Dinner, with a shot of premium tequila, came to $35. Opens April 16. 
The Capitol Reef Cafe, 360 West Main Street, Torrey, (435) 425-3271, makes great breakfasts. My Mexican-style omelette with coffee and juice came to $6. Open March 28 through October all day.

What to See
I bought a National Parks Pass for $50 at Zion National Park in Springdale, (435) 772-3256, to avoid paying the $20-per-vehicle fee (good for a week). The pass gives a year's admission to all national parks. Information: www.nps.gov.
A single admission to Bryce Canyon National Park, (435) 834-5322, is also $20.
Capitol Reef National Park, just outside Torrey, (435) 425-3791, has no admission fee, but charges $5 for the scenic drive.
Kodachrome Basin State Park, near Cannonville, (435) 679-8562, www.stateparks.utah.gov/parks/www1/koda.htm, has a $5 day-use fee. DAISANN McLANE

At Rentals Upscale and Modest, More Amenities

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY apartment buildings are increasingly adding the sort of amenities that were almost unheard of west of the Hudson a mere five years ago.
 At the new Crystal Ridge Club in Watchung, for example, there is not only a "state of the art" fitness center, as all gyms seem to be described by marketers these days, but also an indoor half-court basketball court. And a "great room" with a "gourmet coffee bar." 
 At the Independence on the Hoboken waterfront -- two new 13-story buildings that are part of a development called the Shipyard -- there are a swimming pool and hot tub on the landscaped rooftop deck, yoga and kickboxing classes at the fitness center, a children's cafe and a play center with a pirate ship to climb on.
Horizon at Franklin Lakes, a rental community for older adults, offers free cultural programs, a lending library with weekly poetry readings, a video club, an arts and crafts center, a card players' room and shuttle service to local stores and malls. 
These three apartment communities, built by Ginsburg Development, the Applied Development Company, and the Kushner Companies, respectively, are what developers invariably refer to as "luxury" residences, which charge top rental rates for their communities. 
The basic monthly rate for a one-bedroom apartment at the Franklin Lakes development is $1,700, said Kushner's chief operating officer, Stuart Epstein, and $2,200 for a two-bedroom unit.
Michael I. Barry, president of Applied's property management division, said rents average about $2,200 for a one-bedroom unit at the Independence and at the Palisades, another Applied building on the riverfront in Fort Lee. Rents for two-bedroom apartments start about $2,750, he said.
Apartment developments at the top of the scale are not the only ones adding creative amenities. At several lower-income rental buildings in its portfolio, the Lightstone Group, a diversified real estate company in Lakewood, has financed tenants' organizations that decide on extra services that are put in place, said Samuel Z. Moerman, the director of property management. 
At Lightstone's Aspen River Park Apartments in Newark, which provide federally subsidized apartments for seniors, an organization of residents has set up visits by a social worker and a Portuguese interpreter, free computer training and a room for playing cards and dominoes, and it also encourages residents to garden in the courtyard within in a wall around the building. 
At its Somers Estates property in Somerset, Lightstone helped to finance construction of a modular unit housing several classrooms, where children can do homework with the aid of a tutor. Halloween parties and distribution of food from charitable programs are also held there, Mr. Moerman said.
Lower-cost housing developments do not have to compete for tenants, Mr. Moerman noted, because there is always more demand than supply. "Extra amenities only serve to keep people happy and a community stable," he said.
At the top of the rental housing scale, however, there is often intense competition to provide the most desirable array of amenities in order to fill empty units. There have been large new buildings opening continuously for several years now on the Hudson waterfront; meanwhile, the economy has slowed down, and the number of layoffs has skyrocketed.
"But New Jersey is still a deal for New Yorkers," said Mr. Barry of Applied, "because rentals run about 30 percent higher in Manhattan. If you can get Manhattan-style amenities at the lower price, then that's really a deal." He noted that almost a third of the tenants at the Palisades moved to the Fort Lee apartments from New York City.
THE developers of an apartment complex for those 55 and over in Livingston intend to draw renters from that affluent town and its neighbors. To do so, they are stressing what Howard Rappaport, vice president of Continental Properties, the developer of what is to be called the Enclave at Livingston Country Club, calls "ultraluxury" levels of service and amenities. 
Mr. Rappaport said the Enclave's 146 apartments, which will be for active adults, not be available until next year and the rents have not yet been set.
"Our prospective residents have enjoyed a high standard of living," Mr. Rappaport said. "Many will be moving out of existing single-family homes in Livingston, Chatham, Short Hills and other communities in the area. Many also probably have second homes on the New Jersey shore or Florida, and our market research indicates they want the services they would expect if they were on vacation."
A concierge will provide residents with services that will include making dinner and travel reservations, getting tickets to shows, arranging pet watching and mail pickup. The Enclave will not be the first to offer concierge service. Several buildings recently added it, including Kushner's River Club in Edgewater, but in New Jersey, such service is still an unusual amenity.
The Enclave will also have a "lifestyle director" on its staff, said Mr. Rappaport, to set up excursions to Atlantic City or museums or lectures.
The gated three-building rental complex will feature a putting green, a pool with resort-style fountains and Jacuzzi and tennis courts. In the freestanding clubhouse, there will be a kitchen, a grand ballroom, a cafe with an espresso bar, a beauty salon and a "wellness" room, where doctors may make appointments to see patients or offer health screenings.
Mr. Rappaport said Continental was negotiating with a "leading" salon in the Short Hills area to operate the Enclave beauty salon and would make arrangements with massage therapists to be available for appointments in the massage room.
Each of the three buildings at the Enclave will have a fitness center, with cardiovascular and weight-training equipment. The Enclave will also house a library and a business-services center, equipped with office machines, available to all residents.
Other amenities are being grouped along gender-interest lines. One apartment building is to feature a "mah-jongg room," designed for game-playing women, and a children's play center; another is to offer a billiards and card room, intended to appeal to men. 
The Crystal Ridge Club, a 15-building apartment development that is about half-complete, is to have 334 one- and two-bedroom units. The upscale development was conceived as a community that would have had some of its buildings age-restricted and some not, said Melissa Zotti, the community manager, but New Jersey fair housing laws prohibit such a mixed arrangement.
And so the amenities span the ages at Crystal Ridge, ranging from the basketball court and business center to a tot lot and wading pool. The clubhouse, Ms. Zotti said, has become a popular gathering spot for tenants young and old drawn to parties, games and sports events on the big-screen television with surround sound.
Horizon at Franklin Lakes recently added a media room to the property, where movies are scheduled each week. Residents can arrange to have guests in the movie theater or in a community room with table seating for 15 to 20 people. An at-home beauty service, providing hair styling and manicures, was also added at the complex, which opened last year.
Certain amenities do not emerge until the weather warms, of course. In Newark, while the Aspen River Park residents are once again getting their hands dirty in the garden, Horizon at Franklin Lakes will be opening "a peaceful water garden, complete with bubbling fountain and private sitting area," Mr. Epstein said.
At Crystal Ridge, the indoor basketball league will move outdoors to the new full-size court. At the Shipyard, weekly concerts will resume in the small park at the center of the development, according to the property manager. The boathouse at the end of the pier will start selling beach balls and sunblock again, and residents will again be able to sun themselves on the lawn planted in the pier park, perhaps performing some yoga exercises learned over the winter at the fitness center.

HEADLINE: ADDED VALUE; 
A Meteor of a Magazine

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
THE recent spate of books about the dot-com bust have often been busts themselves -- particularly the first-person accounts. How many people remember "A Very Public Offering: A Rebel's Story of Business Excess, Success and Reckoning," by Stephan Paternot, or "dot.bomb: My Days and Nights at an Internet Goliath," by J. David Guo?
 Unfortunately, James Ledbetter's new book, "Starving to Death on $200 Million a Year: The Short, Absurd Life of The Industry Standard," (Public Affairs, $26) may not break the trend. 
 Mr. Ledbetter, an accomplished journalist, chronicled the technology industry for The Industry Standard, the once-highflying magazine that folded in August 2001; he was its New York bureau chief and later its founding European editor. But his book doesn't deliver the insider's story on how the magazine, which began in April 1998, fell so quickly.
He does provide some detail of the excess during the magazine's heyday that isn't commonly known: the $1 million spent on a New York office that was never occupied and the $8 million on customer relations software that never worked. But with the collapse of the Internet economy now an old story, such revelations no longer seem so astonishing.
Mr. Ledbetter's biggest problem is that he was hardly an insider at all. He was on the magazine's payroll and held fancy titles, but he was based in New York and London. The magazine, and all the important action, were based in San Francisco.
Much of the book revolves around his own experiences thousands of miles from the scene. While the book offers a glimpse into the workings of ambitious dot-com companies, the story is no different from that of many of the other collapses. Indeed, after trying to argue that The Standard was somehow not like other fallen Internet outfits, Mr. Ledbetter backtracks by concluding: "We fell prey to the rocket-fueled ambition and hubris of the dot-com companies we covered, and in short order we crashed with the rest."
Mr. Ledbetter tries to set up a conflict, pitting the magazine's founder, John Battelle, against the International Data Group, the owner, but never gets inside the room to answer the first question he poses: "Did The Standard cause its own demise, through lavish overspending and poor financial management? Or did the death of the publication come about because a onetime partner, I.D.G., decided that if it couldn't own The Standard then no one would?"
Unfortunately for Mr. Ledbetter, the answer is not clear -- at least, if like his, your only access to the action is by speakerphone.

Breaking Into Sports, Weights Optional

BYLINE:  By Steven Greenhouse 

 BODY:
WHEN New Yorkers think about jobs in sports, they usually focus on the 25 players on the Yankees or Mets, the 12 on the Knicks or Nets and the 53 on the Jets or Giants. But sports jobs in New York go well beyond the Derek Jeters and Chad Penningtons, because the city is by far the nation's No. 1 sports metropolis.
 New York has more than 5,000 year-round, sports-related jobs, from $20,000-a-year entry-level marketing assistants all the way up to team owners like George Steinbrenner. And that does not include all the part-time vendors, ticket-takers and security guards at game time. The New York metropolitan area not only has more sports teams than any other American city, but is also the home of league offices, sports agents, players' labor unions and many law firms, public relations firms and advertising agencies that do sports business. 
 "New York is the worldwide epicenter for sports business activity," said Keith Bruce, general manager of 361 Degree Sports, a consulting firm. 
When Alan G. Hevesi was city comptroller, he did a study that found that sports has a $10 billion annual impact on the metropolitan area. The 1996 study found that horseracing had a $786 million impact, the Yankees $372 million and tennis's United States Open $300 million. 
With this money comes jobs, lots of them. Major League Baseball and the National Football League have 450 full-time employees apiece in New York, while the National Basketball Association has nearly 1,000. These workers do marketing and finance, make videos, sell overseas rights and oversee field operations. The Jets and Giants have full-time staffs of 85, while the United States Tennis Association, based in White Plains, has 250. During the tennis open, its employment swells to 9,600 workers. 
Officials from several teams and leagues said they were flooded with applicants for entry-level jobs, like marketing or operations assistant. Beginning positions in sports usually pay $18,000 to $25,000 a year, with many teams having only a handful of executives earning six figures.
"When you start out in the sports industry, one of the first things they'll tell you is the only people who get rich in sports are players," said Dan Migala, president of Team Marketing Report, a consulting firm. His guide to sports-related employers found 175 such companies in New York, more than twice the number in Los Angeles.
People interested in sports jobs often do not realize how grueling those jobs are. "I refer to the double L's -- long hours, lousy pay," said Lonn Trost, chief operating officer for the Yankees. "We're in at 9 in the morning, and during the season, you don't leave until 90 minutes after the game. There are few, if any, holidays. You have to love what you're doing."
Landing an entry-level sports job is often hard. The best selling point is experience. Dennis Robinson, the N.B.A.'s senior vice president for league and team operations, said: "While you're in college, try to get as much sports-related experience as you can. If you understand the game, that's helpful, but more importantly try to understand the business by working in the sports information bureau or helping put on special events or volunteering to help stage a marathon."
Many sports executives recommend internships. That gives job seekers and sports enterprises a chance to get to know each other. 
Michael Mokwa, chairman of the sports marketing department at Arizona State University, which places many graduates in sports jobs in New York, said: "I suggest people find internships, even if it's volunteer work, and when they do their internships try to find a way to do some impressive things very well to differentiate themselves. Far too many students go into internships and just grab coffee or soft drinks for people, sweep out the stadium at night, but never think about differentiating themselves."
The range of sports jobs is immense. Some people make video highlights for the N.F.L and N.B.A., or specialize in selling season tickets to corporations, while operations people oversee ground crews at Yankee Stadium. Not all jobs pay well; the better-paying ones are in revenue-generating fields like marketing.
"Most of a team's money goes to the athletes, and then you have a little bit left over for people to generate all the money needed to pay the athletes," said Buffy Filippell, president of Teamwork Consulting, an executive search firm. "But the people have a great time doing it."

'Free Agents' Find Too Much Free Time

BYLINE:  By EILEEN P. GUNN 

 BODY:
AS an independent consultant, Thomas W. Allen doesn't get pink slips. But at times, he says, he has felt a lot like the more than two million workers whose jobs have been cut in the last two years.
 "It was easy to wonder sometimes if the phone would ever ring again," said Mr. Allen, 59, of San Francisco, whose last big assignment, as interim chief financial officer for a professional services company, ended in early 2002, when the company shut down. He said he immediately started cycling through his Rolodex to drum up business, "but the market was dead, and absolutely nothing was happening." 
 The economic expansion of the 1990's brought increasing numbers of so-called free agents like Mr. Allen, professionals who left their steady jobs to become independent contractors and who often had enough lucrative projects coming in to turn work away. 
It's difficult to gauge how many people are independent contractors, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that about 6.5 million Americans were self-employed when the economy peaked in 2000; the current total, it says, is about 6.2 million. With the economy now weak, many free agents are trying to find their way through a nebulous zone that isn't quite unemployment, but is still nowhere near the full-time business they once had.
Projects have become smaller and less frequent than they were two years ago, said Robert Steir, the founder of MBA GlobalNet in New York, a network of management consultants who bid jointly on projects. 
At Dice.com, which lists freelance assignments for technology professionals, contract job listings fell 14 percent in 2002, after declining 28 percent in 2001, said Thomas Silver, a senior vice president.
According to the Labor Department, the number of self-employed people working full time, or at least 35 hours a week, declined 5 percent in 2002 from 2000, while the level of self-employed people working part time rose 9 percent.
"It's similar to being on unemployment," said Dr. Jo Ann Brusa, a counselor and psychologist at Oak Consulting, a human resources consulting company in Lisle, Ill. "You're dealing with loss in your business and anger and possibly depression."
There are ways to get through this down cycle, which some career experts and consultants expect to continue through this year. But solo professionals also need to be at least a little creative when it comes to marketing themselves and networking for leads.
The biggest challenge is financial. Free agents don't have unemployment checks or severance pay to fall back on when work stops for a few months.
Some independent consultants have had to take other jobs outside their fields to carry them until business picks up. Todd Smith, 32, a consultant in Jacksonville, Fla., who helps small companies develop and execute business plans, hit a 10-month dry spell in 2002. Only two years out of graduate business programs at the University of California at Los Angeles and Thunderbird, a graduate school of international management in Glendale, Ariz., and still carrying big student loans, he had no time to build a financial cushion.
Fortunately, he had a real estate license, received in 1995. He put it to work recently for the first time, helping clients buy and sell property in the Jacksonville area and investing in houses with partners who could provide most of the cash.
The plan was to fix up the properties for rent or resale. But with no money to hire contractors and with plenty of extra time, Mr. Smith said he "spent most of 2002 building decks and walls, drywalling, tiling, carpeting and painting."
He periodically checked in with U.C.L.A., MBA GlobalNet or freelance Web sites like Guru.com for new work leads. In the meantime, income from the rentals and one or two quick sales helped make ends meet.
And the work got him out of bed in the morning. One of the hardest things about being underemployed, or unemployed, is figuring out how to be productive while also staying optimistic about marketing your talents. That's why some free agents have decided that when they cannot sell their skills, it may be worthwhile to give them away.
Mr. Steir of MBA GlobalNet is also the director of outreach for a nonprofit group, MBAs4NYC. He connects experienced management consultants who want to do pro bono work with small-business owners in Lower Manhattan who have yet to rebuild after the Sept. 11 attacks. The volunteers help business owners cut costs and develop marketing ideas, new products and new business channels.
"A lot of the volunteers are people who aren't working," Mr. Steir said. "But helping people energizes them instead of decreasing their energy. And it gives them something that they're doing in their line of work to talk about," and to possibly include on their resumes.
Jennifer Mullens, 30, a freelance public relations consultant from San Francisco, follows that strategy. "I never feel like I have nothing to do," she said. "And volunteering lets me sharpen my skills and develop new ones."
Working by herself gives her little opportunity to be a team leader or manager, but last December, she took a lead role on committees organizing two big fund-raisers.
Volunteer work also lets professionals meet people in their fields or related sectors, which can lead to paying work.
"People I've met through volunteer gigs have approached me about contract opportunities," Ms. Mullens said.
Julian E. Lange, an associate professor of entrepreneurial studies at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. and a privateconsultant himself, agreed that people who work alone need to make extra effort to look outward when business slows.
"It's easy to get lulled into being very introspective and focusing entirely on your problems," he said.
He said he encouraged both students and clients to talk to customers and peers, asking them how the economy's twists and turns have permanently changed their business. "If you use that free time to rebuild your business around what they're telling you, you're ready to expand in the right direction when the economy rebounds," he said.
It was such a course that snapped Mr. Allen out of his funk. "After a period of denial, I realized this was a wake-up call that the world had changed," he said. He said he did some research and decided that while his consulting services were still marketable, he needed to change the way he turned up business.
He gave up trying to find the one or two people in his Rolodex who happened to know of work that would interest him. "It's a random way to connect with people," he said.
Instead, he joined a support group for senior executives and a business development network, where people exchange work leads. And he started the Bay Area Consulting Group, a firm in which he and five partners work together from separate offices. The firm also sponsors a monthly networking meeting for other consultants.
"It's a more focused and purposeful way to network," he said. "You meet lots of people at once and get good ideas from them." 
The group networking is yielding ideas, and an encouraging amount of work. "I have a project I'm working on," he said, "and several proposals I'm working on with other people that I think will come through."

Places to Turn In the Interim

HERE are suggestions from experienced free agents for enduring a dry spell in business:
* Be prepared to dip into savings periodically to carry you from project to project. Keep part of your nest egg handy for this.
* Think about secondary skills you can put to work if gaps in assignments stretch beyond a few weeks.
* Seek volunteer work that will keep your skills sharp and lead to new business contacts.
* Join professional associations and peer support groups for more networking.
* Keep in touch with your clients even when their business is slow, so you can anticipate their needs when their business picks up.

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
There's More to Trading Oil Than Handicapping a War

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
AS the world braces for potential war in Iraq, oil prices are at their highest in more than two years, and the profits of big oil producers and refiners have been rising along with them. But the lagging prices of oil-company stocks illustrate just how tricky it can be to speculate in the energy sector.
 Professional oil traders place such bets every day, but few individual investors have been tempted, even as the drumbeat for war has grown louder. The New York Mercantile Exchange tried to attract more small investors last summer, when it introduced scaled-down versions of its main oil and natural-gas futures contracts, but those products "haven't really taken off yet," said Nachamah Jacobovits, a spokeswoman for the exchange. 
 On average, just 709 of these "mini" oil contracts and only 232 of the smaller natural-gas contracts change hands daily, Ms. Jacobovits said. She said individual investors seemed more inclined to bet on gold, a traditional hedge against inflation and economic upheaval. Trading in gold futures at the exchange is at a record, she said, with average daily volume of more than 61,000 contracts, up 60 percent from last year.
Oil trading is considerably more complicated than the gold market because oil prices are affected by so many forces of supply and demand. Lately, investors have been factoring in labor strife and disruptions in Venezuela and Nigeria, as well as an explosion on Friday at an Exxon Mobil fuel facility in New York.
According to the prevailing view among big investors, any war will probably be short and will be followed by a flood of new Iraqi oil that could halve the price of oil, now $35.58 a barrel, said John S. Segner, manager of the $275 million Invesco Energy fund. That expectation, he said, has been holding back the stocks of major oil companies the fund owns, like ChevronTexaco, BP and TotalFinaElf of France.
ChevronTexaco's stock, whose dividend yield is a healthy 4.37 percent, is down about 30 percent from its 52-week high of $91.60. BP, which yields 4.17 percent, is about 26 percent below its 52-week high of $53.98.
"The valuations of the companies don't reflect $35-a-barrel or even $25 crude, more like $19," said Mr. Segner, adding that he is bullish on big oil and skeptical about a quick and sharp increase in postwar supply. "I don't think it's going to be near as dramatic as that," he said. "The only way I see oil going below $20 is some unforeseen, dramatically negative economic event."
Too many investors are looking back to the Persian Gulf war as a guide, he said, but conditions are quite different now than in 1990. Most notably, he said, the inventory of oil is much lower than it was then, and the United States economy is coming out of a recession, instead of entering one.
Mr. Segner said he expected that a brief, successful war with Iraq would push oil prices back down to around $25 a barrel. At that level, efficient producers should continue to make a lot of money, he said. Unfortunately, he added, the returns on energy stocks diminish when oil prices spike as they have in the last few months. "They don't pay you when the prices get this high," he said.
DESPITE the boom that energy companies have been enjoying in recent months, funds like Invesco Energy have not thrived. The fund lost about 4.3 percent of its value last year, and it has lost almost 1 percent more so far this year.
Although those numbers are relatively strong for mutual funds that specialize in energy stocks, Mr. Segner characterized the flow of money into the fund as "not really going up, not really going down."
Rather than spending time speculating on the short-term direction of oil prices by buying or selling futures contracts, individual investors would be better served by studying the factors that will drive supply and demand, he said. As soon as the war in Iraq -- if there is one -- is over, oil drillers and refiners will face the challenge of finding and storing enough oil and natural gas to last the year.
"We're going to be struggling all year long just to refill to get ready for next winter," he said.

HEADLINE: Are You Hot? Not If You're A Sitcom Writer 

BYLINE:  By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
STACIE LIPP remembers the golden age of comedy in Hollywood. It was 1990, when a Harvard degree and a few clips from the Lampoon landed you a job as a writer for the hottest television sitcoms.
 All it took for Ms. Lipp was a friend's tip that "Married . . . With Children" wanted a woman for its writing staff. Within a week of the interview, she was moving from New York to Los Angeles, where she settled in, at 22, for a six-year gig with the Fox hit. 
 From there it was an easy leap to "Roseanne" and "The King of Queens," and a salary in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Success stories like Ms. Lipp's became a national cliche. A 1993 Newsweek headline read: "Go to Harvard. Write Jokes. Make $$$." 
But these are the days of voted-in relationships, humiliated talent and bug-eating heroes on prime time. At a moment when America wants to watch Lorenzo Lamas ask, "What's your breast size, because it's hard to see your breasts in that dress?" -- as he has done on ABC's newest reality series "Are You Hot?" -- comedy is no longer king.
Ms. Lipp's last show was canceled three years ago just as "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" ushered in the reality show craze -- and ushered out her era of easy, funny money. In a case of terrible timing, she pitched one of her ideas to CBS the morning after the first "Survivor" finale. She might as well have been rejected by a good-looking bachelor with a wavy mane and no money.
"Nobody listened," she remembered. "They were buzzing. It could have been the best sitcom ever, and we were doomed." 
This year, Ms. Lipp is pitching to cable.
"A grim reaper looms over the business right now," said Bill Martin, a veteran of "Third Rock From the Sun" and "In Living Color" and currently executive producer of "Grounded for Life," a family comedy on WB. 
The number of new comedies on the networks has sunk steadily in recent years, from 62 in 1997 to 35 this season, according to the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University. 
Networks are furiously signing up shows like "Are You Hot? The Search for America's Sexiest People." And some comedy writers are turning into straight men and doing the unthinkable: signing up for reality. "We've kind of dumbed down, not by intention -- the system demands it," said Bill Diamond, an executive producer with "Murphy Brown" in the mid-1990's.
First came the popularity of hourlong dramas. Then came network belt-tightening, which dried up development deals, cutting into writing staffs and salaries. And now the tidal wave of reality television has come. Mr. Diamond, who has worked in development since 1997, said the huge ratings for reality shows demonstrated the viewing public's boredom with "cookie cutter" and "setup punch line" laugh-track-type comedies that have populated television. 
An executive with a major production studio, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said writers made themselves vulnerable because they did not figure out what the public wanted to see these days. Networks still have a great appetite for comedies, the executive said, but nobody is creating hits, and thus reality shows have become a quick fix.
"We have not found a breakout comedy on the order of 'Friends,' " the executive said. "The breakout seems to be dramas like C.S.I."
The executive concluded: "Maybe comedy writers are not funny anymore."
The Writers Guild of America said that the increasing hours devoted to reality shows had reduced jobs for the more than 5,600 members who write for television.
Even in better times, the field was so competitive that half or more of all television writers were looking for work on any given day.
Matt Selman, co-executive-producer of "The Simpsons," arrived just in time for a taste of the good times. When he moved to Hollywood in 1994 as a 23-year-old fresh from the campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the town was crawling with graduates looking to make fast money writing comedy.
"It was a gold rush of overeducated, greedy people like myself who considered themselves funny," he said. He took the best of three quick job offers, writing for "Seinfeld" in 1995. Though he was dismissed within a year, he was hired by "The Simpsons," which has just broadcast its 300th episode and remains a rock in stormy waters.
"Now a lot of people who got in when I got in are unemployed or semiemployed," Mr. Selman said.
The proportion of writers to jobs is so out of whack that some agents are no longer taking on new writing clients. Others are telling clients with jobs to sit tight, or are steering them into more than one project to supplement incomes that have fallen 10 to 30 percent below established salaries, according to some writers' agents.
"The people who are working are not going hungry -- it's getting the job that's hard," said Ian Greenstein, a partner in the Genesis Literary Agency, in Los Angeles.
As a result, some writers are seeking refuge in cable, turning to animation, abandoning the field altogether or taking jobs on reality shows, even if by definition these shows make their title obsolete.
Perry Dance, a comedy writer who also came to Hollywood during the golden years, is still golden -- on reality television.
After freelancing scripts for "Roseanne" and "A Different World," then teenagers' sitcoms like "Sweet Valley High" and "Saved by the Bell," he switched to drama, and finally, with real reluctance, "Making the Band," an ABC reality series now on MTV about people vying for spots in a music group.
"What would I do in it?" he said he asked himself.
There was an answer: sit through hours and hours of unedited tape to pick out usable bits while working for half the pay (with no residuals from syndication). 
Even "Girl Next Door: The Search for a Playboy Centerfold," which Mr. Dance also worked on for Fox, needs someone to structure the scenes to tell a story. But instead of making up jokes in a room full of sitcom writers, as he once did, Mr. Dance now sits alone in his office waiting for the jokes to come to him, in the form of contestants' natural slip-ups.
The nuggets he lives for now, he said, are moments like this: A hopeful on "Joe Millionaire" said she wanted to do charity work because she was a "mercenary," when she meant "missionary." 
The worst part of the job is "when you have three-quarters of what you need for a great story, and there's no tape to give you that last quarter," he said. "There's no making it in reality. On a scripted sitcom, you would have resolved it."
He has, at least, tasted blockbuster success -- as story editor on Fox's "Joe Millionaire," whose finale last Monday drew more than 40 million viewers. 
"Reality is not 'Frasier,' " he conceded, "but you don't feel too humiliated on 'Joe Millionaire' when it's going to be the No. 1 show that week." 
There are also opportunities in dramas, feature films and sitcoms on cable, but in the world of comedy writing, networks are considered the gravy trains. The average pay starts in the low $100,000 bracket, but after five years writers can easily be making more than $500,000 a year, writers and agents said. At the executive producer level, the income can exceed $1 million a year.
A decade ago, Ben Dougan, a senior at Harvard and past president of The Harvard Lampoon, would have been a shoo-in for a network job. He would love to land a job with "Saturday Night Live" or a television sitcom where "the comedy is the most important thing," but he admits that he may have a better shot in the realm of what he calls the "inadvertent comedy" of reality television. 
Anyone with television ambitions is almost resigned to start out their career helping the lovelorn, the narcissistic and the tacky win contests rather than writing the next "Seinfeld."
The lucky ones with sitcom jobs have worries, too. 
Bill Martin and Mike Schiff, both writers and producers on Fox's "Grounded for Life," said their comedy was playing its own version of "Survivor." The show started out on Fox in 2001 but was squeezed off the schedule by Fox's own reality shows. 
"Our slot is now a piece of "American Idol," Mr. Martin said. The show later found another home, on WB.
"People tune in to reality shows by the millions," Mr. Schiff said. "One reason I don't get depressed is that they can't go past naked people having sex. What else can they do?"
In the cyclical world of television, those who keep the faith said, the next comedy heyday is just around the corner. All that is needed is that breakout hit.
There can be only so many reality shows, and despite their cheaper production costs and explosive ratings, there's no syndication afterlife -- where productions make the big money -- for them, many in the industry said.
"The sky is not falling," said Charles Slocum of the Writers Guild. But for now, the people the world of television once laughed with, revered and celebrated get mostly commiseration.
If the truth be told, many writers are reality fans.
"I wanted to watch 'American Idol' to despise it, and I became another viewer," Mr. Martin of "Grounded for Life" admitted. "No! I can't believe they didn't pick her!"

These Days, Gold Earns Its Shine

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
GOLD has had an impressive run during the last year. Can individual investors, eager for diversification, still make money on gold stocks, stock funds or bullion, on the theory that it's better late than never? Or has the window of opportunity passed?
 Gold has long been considered a highly risky asset class because of its volatility and, in some cases, lack of liquidity, but even some conservative investment advisers are now advising clients to put a small portion of their assets in gold. 
 Last year, the price of gold jumped nearly 25 percent, to $348.20 an ounce, and some gold funds soared more than 70 percent. Few money managers expect a repeat performance in 2003, but many say investors can expect some return on their money during the next few years, unless the American economy makes a spectacular recovery. 
Gold continued its surge early this year, climbing by more than $30 an ounce, to $379.90, by Feb. 4, only to slide back to $351.80 last week.
The decline underscored gold's inherent risk: it is more a vehicle for currency traders than for traditional investors. Gold peaked at $875 an ounce in January 1980 and has been well below that in the last 15 years.
Historically, war fears have broadened gold's appeal. Political instability usually breeds economic difficulties, prompting investors to seek a haven. But even if a war with Iraq is avoided, weakness in the American economy will probably buoy gold's value, gold bugs say.
"The slowing economy has eliminated the fear of inflation, but it has raised concerns about deflation," said Loyd J. Stegent, president of Stegent Equity Advisors in Houston.
"Since lower interest rates, have been slow to the rescue, the Fed has had to take additional steps to prevent the deflationary abyss that occurred during the Great Depression," he said. "So they have turned on the printing presses in an effort to reinflate the economy and have been buying Treasuries."
Gold, of course, is always a hedge against inflation, the end result of printing money. To Mr. Stegent, the federal budget deficit also weakens the already slipping dollar sending more people to precious metals like gold as the haven of choice. He is telling clients to put 10 percent to 25 percent of their assets in gold mutual funds.
Virginia Gerhart, a financial planner who runs her own firm in San Rafael, Calif., has favored a small allocation -- about 5 percent -- in gold since 1979. But, she says, picking individual stocks is a "burden."
Investors have, for example, punished Barrick Gold, the world's third-largest gold producer, because management hedged part of its production just as gold prices were soaring. Last year, Barrick shares fell 3 percent; in contrast, Newmont Mining, the largest gold producer, climbed 52 percent. So far this year, shares of Barrick have edged up 3.18 percent, to $15.90, while Newmont's stock has slipped 5.24 percent, to $27.51.
Ms. Gerhart prefers gold-oriented mutual funds, especially First Eagle SoGen Gold, which was up 107 percent in 2002 and off 0.4 percent this year through Thursday. Others that have done well, she said, are Monterey OCM Gold and Gabelli Gold. Last year, Monterey rose 93.3 percent and Gabelli by 87.2 percent. So far this year, Monterey is down 0.85 percent; Gabelli is off 0.9 percent.
Investors can buy gold bullion, though it does not provide dividends and costs money to store. Contemporary coins like the American Eagle and Canadian Maple Leaf offer a pure gold investment without storage costs.
Carmen M. Petote, president of Allegiance Financial Advisors in Pittsburgh said rare gold coins were another possibility. "There is a pretty good market if they are truly rare," he said, "but you have to know about coins, and the field is somewhat unregulated." 
With the dollar and stock prices down, Charles Stevenson, who runs Navigator Partners Ltd., a hedge fund based in New York, is betting that gold will continue to rise.
"Once a party starts, it attracts other players," he said. "That is why bull markets turn into manias and end in busts."
He added, "Whether the current rise will attract a party remains to be seen, but I think the stage is set because we are massively in deficit and the government has to fund its obligations by printing money."
 MONEY could move into the Japanese yen or the euro, but Jean-Marie Eveillard, who manages the First Eagle SoGen funds, does not see either of those currencies as a smart bet. "The Japanese economy is in a rut," he said, and "the European economy is flat on its back." Consequently, he is optimistic about gold, despite the euro's rise in the last two years.
Like Mr. Eveillard, Ceasar Bryan, the manager of Gabelli Gold, which has $190 million under management, suggests that central banks may well turn to increasing the money supply, leading to inflation.
They cite a recent speech by Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, signaling that the Fed would go to great lengths to prevent deflation.
Gold has its detractors. Harold Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla., considers gold a disaster hedge, not an inflation hedge. "It has not done particularly well in any era aside from a serious panic," he said. "If we are going into a bad era, my solution is an intelligently diversified portfolio."
James Hedges IV, who runs LJH Global Investments, which advises clients on hedge fund investments, is also bearish. "Gold is confused as a financial asset, but it is a commodity whose price is almost always driven by supply and demand, with the rare exception of panic periods when people want market safety," he said.
Because gold tends to spike on fears of inflation, then plunge when the fears subside, gold investors need a good sense of timing. That's difficult, especially because the market is relatively small. Mr. Petote cautions that gold is not for most investors. "Unless you are trading in and out, there is no reason to own it," he said.

HEADLINE: Sun, Again, Bets Against the Odds 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
SCOTT G. McNEALY, the chief executive of Sun Microsystems, was pacing the stage in San Francisco two weeks ago, working hard to stir up enthusiasm in the crowd for his company's new products. The litany of offerings was long and impressive -- data serving computers of all kinds, graphics workstations, storage networks, software. The implicit message was clear: Sun, though battered by the high-technology slump, is still churning out new products and new ideas.
 Dressed in blue jeans and a khaki shirt, Mr. McNealy, ever blunt and informal, was helpfully translating the benefits of Sun's wares in plain terms. He gestured toward one of Sun's zippy small server computers. "Think of these as piston rings," said Mr. McNealy, who grew up in suburban Detroit, the son of an auto executive. 
 Increasingly, Sun's customers, mostly corporations, do indeed think of computers as if they were piston rings. And that is precisely Sun's problem. 
No established company rode higher on the Internet wave than Sun, whose sales nearly doubled, to $18.25 billion, in the three fiscal years ended in June 2001. Sun created the Internet programming language Java and made the hot boxes -- the leading server computers -- that powered so many corporate networks using Internet technology and Web sites. Sun computers, the company's advertising proclaimed, "put the dot in dot.com." Sun's machines were pricey, but customers didn't much care during the good times.
Today, things could scarcely be more different for Sun and its customers. No new-economy chic clings to any computer maker anymore. Cost-cutting is the order of the day for corporate customers. And servers based on low-cost technology from the personal computer world -- Intel-compatible microprocessors -- are eating into Sun's business. 
Sun's quandary is that its business appears to be alarmingly dependent on high-cost, proprietary hardware at a time when technology trends and customers seem to be headed in the other direction -- toward inexpensive, PC-based hardware that is more like an industrial commodity, the computer equivalent of a piston ring.
Sun relies on its own microprocessor design and its Solaris software, the leading version of the industrial-strength Unix operating system. Rival low-cost Intel-based servers run Microsoft's Windows operating system or Linux, a variant of Unix that is distributed free and constantly improved by a network of programmers. 
Linux poses the more imminent threat to Sun because both Sun's Solaris and Linux share the Unix heritage, easing the way for companies to move to Linux and the inexpensive hardware on which it runs. Two years ago, for example, weather.com, the Web site of cable television's Weather Channel, ran on 80 Sun servers. Today, the data center for weather.com is filled with 123 Intel-based servers running Linux -- and Sun was sent packing. The savings on hardware were $2.3 million, according to Dan Agronow, vice president for technology at weather.com, who added that maintenance costs were lower, too.
As Laura Conigliaro, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, put it: "Everyone acknowledges that Sun has some of the brightest minds in technology, but right now, Sun seems to be egregiously mispositioned for where the market is and where the market seems to be headed."
Many industry experts say the trend toward commodity-like computer hardware is unstoppable. The profitability in computing, they say, will move to software and services, the direction I.B.M. has charted and Hewlett-Packard has begun following. Hardware, they add, will be a brutal business, with the main winner likely to be Dell Computer, a hyperefficient packager and distributor of technology.
"The migration in revenue and profit dollars away from hardware is inexorable," A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote in a research report this month. 
The challenge, he added, "is most acute for Sun." Mr. Sacconaghi estimates that 60 percent of Sun's profits come from hardware, and that most of its services business comes from maintaining that hardware.
On Wall Street, the interest in Sun these days comes mainly from "value"investors, who believe the stock price is so beaten down that it may be attractive. The shares closed at $3.41 a share on Friday. In September 2000, Sun shares traded at more than $64.
But at Sun's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., it is believers -- not pessimists -- who walk the halls. Over the years, Sun has earned a reputation as an iconoclastic innovator, finding success by going its own way. In the early 1990's, when Sun mostly made scientific and engineering workstations, its demise was widely predicted, under pressure from Intel-based workstations running Windows. But Sun moved increasingly into the server business and thrived through the 1990's.
THE Sun management team is betting that it can beat the odds again. And at a two-day conference starting tomorrow in San Francisco, Mr. McNealy and his team plan to present its software strategy to financial analysts -- a strategy intended to build on Sun's technology strengths and give it an advantage against its main rivals, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft.
Sun intends to aggressively use its Solaris operating system to hold onto existing customers and generate growth in new markets. First, Sun plans to bundle into the Solaris operating system increasing amounts of the software that corporate data centers need as they try to automate more operations and communications with suppliers and with employees. These engine-room software programs -- usually sold as separate products, costing up to many thousands of dollars each -- include e-mail, calendar software, Web serving, directory management, identity management, multimedia streaming and employee Web portals. For all these extras, Sun may charge a fee for each user, but the idea is to charge far less than other software suppliers.
The second step in the plan calls for a hard push to promote Solaris on inexpensive Intel-based computers as well as on Sun machines that run on its Sparc microprocessor.
"Solaris is an extraordinary hidden asset, and we're going to put it on a growth path," declared Jonathan I. Schwartz, the executive vice president of Sun's software group. "We're going to try to light the industry on fire."
Sun executives see their company as neither a hardware nor a software maker, but as a "systems" producer. They pride themselves on understanding the yin and yang of computer software and hardware, and how they work together. Sun servers are sold with the Solaris operating system, and those dollars all fall under the "hardware" category on the company's financial statements.
"When I go to win a deal, I don't care where I get the revenue from," Mr. Schwartz explained.
Accordingly, Sun executives regard Wall Street's critiques of Sun as a hardware company as simple-minded and wrong, a failure to grasp Sun's essence. "Our systems platform -- the hardware and software together -- is how we express our innovation to customers and to the marketplace," said Gregory M. Papadopoulos, Sun's chief technology officer.
That systems ethos explains why Sun says it makes sense to still spend nearly $2 billion a year on research and development, or 15 percent of revenue, to pursue hardware and software innovations. This week, Sun will also show analysts its new microprocessor road map. 
Industry analysts question whether Sun is stretching itself too thin -- competing against Intel in chips, Microsoft and I.B.M. in software and I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Dell in the corporate data center market.
Yet Sun says it still has the resources and the smarts to innovate across a range of technologies and regain a leadership position. And despite the current technology slump, Sun is betting its future that computing is not a mature industry.
"If you think real innovation is going to slow down and things are just going to get cheaper, then we've got a really bad model," Mr. Papadopoulos said. "But this is not like the automobile industry yet."
In step with the times, Sun is promoting itself as a low-cost supplier of technology to corporations -- not that it has the cheapest boxes, but that its systems can do more. As a result, Sun contends, it solves problems with products instead of with people, in contrast to I.B.M. in particular, which added to its already huge services business last year with the purchase of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting. 
Against Microsoft, Sun positions itself as a champion of Java and a more emphatic advocate of other industry-standard technologies. Sun portrays Microsoft as irredeemably wedded to a strategy of trying to lock customers to Windows and extend its monopoly from the desktop PC business into corporate data centers.
Still, I.B.M.'s business has done remarkably well during the technology slump, bolstered by its services arm, and Microsoft's revenue has grown steadily, helped by its strong sales of server software. By contrast, Sun's revenue fell to $12.59 billion in the year ended last June, from $18.25 billion the previous fiscal year.
The erosion in Sun's business is slowing. Revenue declined 6 percent last quarter, to $2.9 billion. Sun reported a record $2.5 billion loss for the quarter, but most of that was for write-offs on high-priced acquisitions made during the bubble years. 
Sun has tightened its belt during the slump, trimming its work force by 20 percent, cutting inventories by more than half and sharply reducing its operating expenses. The company continues to generate positive cash flow from operations, and its gross profit margins rose 4 percent last quarter. 
"Our operational strength has kept us a viable company short term and long term," said Marissa Peterson, Sun's executive vice president for operations.
Yet Sun badly needs new sources of growth, which is why the software effort is vital to its future. The plan to bundle more and more software in the Solaris operating system, if successful, could shake up the corporate software business, analysts say. The other step, trying to push Solaris on Intel-based servers, is an even more ambitious, and uncertain, move. Sun introduced a line of Intel-based machines last year that come with both Linux and Solaris operating systems. 
In a bit of contrarian thinking, Sun wants to capitalize on the rise of Linux. "Linux has validated Unix on Intel-based chips," Mr. Schwartz said, insisting that opens the door to a big market for Solaris on Intel hardware. Sun plans to offer Solaris-on-Intel servers at prices well below Intel machines running Microsoft's server software, hobbling Microsoft's assault in the data center market. Yet, analysts say, it may be too late for Solaris to flourish on Intel because its Linux has the momentum.
These new chip and software strategies will move into the marketplace, step by step, over the next year or two. Knowing that regaining leadership in the industry won't be easy, Mr. McNealy, 48, met with his senior managers last year and asked each for a commitment to stay for five years. Shortly afterward, a handful of senior executives announced they were leaving, led by Edward J. Zander, the president.
YET if the road back promises to be difficult, that does not mean it is cannot be done. "The conventional wisdom is that Sun is finished, washed up," observed Anthony E. Scott, the chief technology officer for information services at General Motors. "I don't believe that for a minute."
Sun has some formidable assets, including nearly $5 billion in cash, a corps of gifted engineers, an installed base of nearly one million servers and 12,000 software applications that have been written to run on Sun systems. 
Sun also has loyal customers who find the company's strategy appealing. Verizon Communications, a big regional Bell company, has a few thousand Sun servers in its telecommunications network. Given the rapid rise in the complexity of computing, said Shadman Zafar, a senior vice president for technology at Verizon, "we need to move more to a system that works out of the box, and Sun is leading the way on that."
And no one questions the resolve of Sun's leader. Most people who know Mr. McNealy say watching him play hockey is a window onto his temperament. "Scott is best when he's cornered, fighting for the puck," said Eric E. Schmidt, a former Sun executive and now chief executive of Google. "People love working for Scott. And I can assure you, he gets up every day and fights like hell for Sun."
Even so, Google, the Internet search engine founded in 1998 and seeded with money provided by Andreas Bechtolsheim, one of Sun's founders, runs on Linux.

HEADLINE: Spanish Harlem on His Mind 

BYLINE:  By ED MORALES; Ed Morales's most recent book is "Living in Spanglish: The Search for Latino Identity in America," to be published this month in paperback by St. Martin's/Griffin.

 BODY:
EL Barrio. In my childhood its mere mention conjured all kinds of feelings, from a kind of reverence for proud beginnings to my parents' wariness of its slow descent into hard times. It was a magic Spanish phrase that fell easily from my father's lips, a reference to a place that curiously seemed to belong to us, even though New York didn't belong to us. As more of us moved to various corners of the Bronx, El Barrio increasingly became the source of authenticity, like the bacalaitos (codfish fritters) on 116th Street that were the closest thing to what you could get on the island. 
 As I grew older and the neighborhood's mean streets became even meaner, I was still in awe of its self-assured Latin style. Even in my feeble Santana fan worship I knew that what "Oye Como Va" talked about ultimately went back to Tito Puente and the streets of El Barrio. 
 Sharkskin-suit-wearing mambo men spinning leggy lace-draped women at the Park Palace on 110th and Fifth Avenue lurked in my subconscious. Multicolored Latin men standing their ground against turf invaders, wearing T-shirts and pegged pants, with an angry curled lock of defiance spilling onto their foreheads, haunted me in my exiles in the Bronx, New England and the Lower East Side. I could almost hear the slow boleros from rooftop parties, the anomalous screech of roosters on fire escapes, holding me in the grip of the peculiar alchemy created by tropical people shivering in poorly heated tenements.
 The late theater director and promoter Eddie Figueroa, who lived in the projects at 114th and Lexington Avenue, once declared that wherever he called home was the embassy of the Spirit Republic of Puerto Rico, and for the first time I understood El Barrio as a sanctuary of an idea, an identity. It was an imaginary homeland that I shared with countless other displaced souls, U.S.-entrenched Puerto Ricans in search of being Puerto Rican.
 Today, although Puerto Ricans are still the city's most populous Spanish-speaking group -- of the 2.2 million Latinos, 830,000 are Puerto Ricans -- we can sometimes feel like an afterthought in the Latin New York we all but created.
 WHEN the Metro-North trains come rumbling like massive conga drums out of the Park Avenue tunnel at 96th Street and toward the northern viaduct, they draw attention to one of the enduring symbols of racial and class division in New York. It's as if they're saying: Welcome to East Harlem, where hip-hop and salsa trump classical, and prime real estate gives way to inner city. The architectural necessity of the viaduct, built in the 1840's, is the primordial source of the real estate mantra: "Manhattan below 96th Street."
 But now, whispered buzzwords of gentrification like Upper Yorkville, Carnegie Hill North and SpaHa (for Spanish Harlem), are creeping up from the south. The specter of new luxury high-rise developments with tony names like the Monterrey and Carnegie Hill Place are pushing back the ghetto flavor. The Spanish Harlem of the mind, dotted with the world's greatest cuchifrito stands (fried Caribbean snacks), stickball clubs and old-school piragueros, men who sell flavored ices from pushcarts, is threatened with extinction.
 The changing face of East Harlem is due not only to the real estate charge from south of 96th Street, but also to a surge of Latino immigrants. That new presence is personified by Valente Leal, a 14-year-old immigrant from Mexico who has lived in East Harlem for the past eight years. 
 Valente has a bushy spiked punk haircut, likes hard rock bands like Korn and Slipknot, is an occasional painter and wants to be a doctor. And Valente's got a theory about why so many people from south of 96th Street are moving in. "Ever since 9/11 there's all these people from downtown around here," he said, wide-eyed. "I think they got scared or something."
So, as the strip on Lexington between 104th Street and 96th morphs from Barrio to boho periphery, a loose confederation of mostly Puerto Rican politicians, activists and residents is trying to make a stand to preserve the area's Latino identity. Rafael Merino, a graphic designer who grew up on the Lower East Side and recently moved from Williamsburg, thinks what's happening uptown is bigger than mere nostalgia. 
 "It's not about Latinos losing El Barrio, it's about New York City losing El Barrio," said Mr. Merino, who lives on 116th Street. "This is one of those diverse gems that makes the city what it is." 
 ALL of this flux, all of these questions -- about gentrification, about the future, about whom El Barrio truly belongs to -- sent meback to the neighborhood's streets, where the ambivalent dance of development is played out.
 For me, the son of Puerto Rican parents who came to Manhattan during the late 1940's, East Harlem, or El Barrio, as we called it, stirred mixed emotions. It was where my parents suffered the early indignities of American dream-searching, a grimy tenement-land they escaped for the relatively pastoral Castle Hill in the Bronx in the 1960's. But even as I left the Bronx for the East Village and, finally, Brooklyn, El Barrio had an undeniable allure for me.
 I craved the memories of the smells and sounds of then-exotic Caribbean vegetables at La Marqueta, the indoor market at 115th Street and Park Avenue, and the salsa jams throbbing from the Casa Latina record store on 116th Street. Six years ago, when I went to the funeral for my uncle Angel Luis, one of the last of my relatives to still live there, I felt as if I had a claim to El Barrio's mythology.
 The Barrio of bodegas, botanicas and bomba y plena (traditional Puerto Rican folk music) came into being in the 1950's, when the Puerto Rican migration peaked. The neighborhood went into a steep economic decline and depopulation in the 1970's, and East Harlem's Latino identity began to take on an ephemeral quality. 
 "Some of us, if they were lighter skinned, gravitated to a white identity," said Aurora Flores, a publicist and community activist. "Those who were darker gravitated to a black identity, so it's become important to us to define our identity." 
 Ms. Flores is the M.C. of a weekly Thursday gathering called Julia's Jam, held at the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center at 105th and Lexington Avenue. Recitations by single mothers and schoolchildren take precedence over slam poets, and the evening culminates in a free-form jam session by the bomba y plena group Yerba Buena. 
 Administered by the arts organization Taller Boricua, the de Burgos Center is part of a "cultural crossroads" envisioned by a Taller co-founder, Fernando Salicrup, a painter and a Barrio homeowner. Born and raised in the neighborhood, Mr. Salicrup is a mentor to an emerging group of young artists, writers and musicians who are moving back to the neighborhood. "I learned to be Puerto Rican in this community," Mr. Salicrup said. "I didn't learn it in Puerto Rico." 
 On any night, El Barrio, a true cultural crossroads, comes alive. And while it still holds on to a Puerto Rican identity, it is also infused by new blood. 
 As I tool around Lexington, I can run into Erica Gonzalez or Melissa Mark-Viverito, co-founders of Women of El Barrio, a political group, or Mariposa, a poet, scribbling away in her notebook. When I slide into a booth at La Fonda Boricua (Boricua is an affectionate name for a Puerto Rican) on 106th Street, surrounded by paintings by Latinos, and feast on rice and beans, I feel as if the Latino renaissance that could have happened in the East Village 15 years ago is happening here. 
 But Tato Torres, a founding member of Yerba Buena and conscience of the area's cultural renaissance, warns me: "This art thing is a double-edged sword. It's easy to become the exotic Latino-flavored thing and make the place chic for outsiders. There's already been some animosity between Barrio natives and recent arrivals like me." 
 I ponder his words, and remember how artists were the leading edge of a rent escalation that displaced thousands of Puerto Ricans east of Avenue A as I head further down Lexington, to the intersection of the new and old East Harlem, to Galeria de la Vega, run by a local artist. 
 James de la Vega is a hybrid between a street kid and an Ivy League-educated guerrilla performance artist. He surfs among the personas of mayor of the block, eccentric artist and entrepreneur with relative ease. Because he has run tours of El Barrio for outside agencies, scrawls incendiary slogans on the sidewalks and occasionally flaunts a huge Afro wig and black leather pants, he is the focus of some controversy. 
 "I have a love-hate relationship with this place," said Mr. de la Vega, who grew up in the neighborhood the son of Puerto Ricans. "Some of the things I write on the sidewalk are a little tough for the people here." And he admits that he likes to provoke people with phrases like "We walk amongst each other in a deep dream committing small acts of violence against one another." 
 Some people in the neighborhood have taken such offense to Mr. de la Vega's act that they have painstakingly defaced most of his murals scattered around East Harlem. "As much as I like to promote the concept of this being Spanish Harlem, I also feel that we have to connect with the world in a bigger way," he said. "But there's an element here that doesn't feel I'm doing the right thing, so I'm forced to rethink myself sometimes."
 A quick stroll west, under the stone arches of the northern Park Avenue viaduct and through the projects on Madison, brings me to El Museo del Barrio, which has been challenged by a local group called Nuestro Museo Action Committee that feels the museum, founded by local Puerto Rican activists in 1969, has neglected the neighborhood to focus on the high art of Latin America.
 Tony Bechara, the museum's chairman and a painter from Puerto Rico but not El Barrio, gave me a thorough tour, beaming with pride about last summer's wildly successful show of the Mexican painters Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera and the permanent exhibition about the Taino Indians, the ancient indigenous people of Puerto Rico. 
 "Our direction has been toward inclusivity," he said, explaining that the museum's limited space restricts the number of community artists they can show. Next month, El Museo will feature the Puerto Rican artist Rafael Tufino, but the Nuestro committee continues to lobby for local representation on the board.
 Tato Torres of Yerba Buena recently sent an e-mail message to committee members including a Web page from Citysearch.com, which listed El Museo with the pull quote (since changed): "This little museum isn't just for Boricuas anymore." It seems a harmless sentiment, but it represents an attitude that makes Puerto Ricans angry. In the larger world of Latinos we (and to an extent Dominicans, who dominate Washington Heights) are underdogs in the Latino identity game, easily marginalized by swanky displays of cultural capital that Mexicans and South Americans can summon. 
 But, as Mr. Torres says, El Barrio's Mexicans don't necessarily profit from Kahlo chic, and are crucial to the future of the neighborhood: "In El Barrio we have to find those threads that bind. We have to find what will unite us, whether we're Colombians, Mexicans, Dominicans or Puerto Ricans."
 MY father, who lived on First Avenue near 114th Street in the early 1950's, likes to tell the story of a friend from his hometown in Puerto Rico who came to visit him after immigrating to Chicago. "He adopted some of the Mexican customs they have over there and came to New York wearing a flashy zoot suit," he said. "He was late, so when I went to check on him, I found him bloodied in the hallway. The Italians had beaten him up." 
 Forty years later, the Mexicans truly began arriving, and after enduring their own beatings from local groups, they settled in to become hard-core residents of El Barrio. The main drag of 116th Street offers several Mexican restaurants, record shops blaring mariachi and rock en Espanol, and a store filled with futbol jerseys. 
 Leaders of both the Puerto Rican and Mexican communities fall all over themselves to express solidarity, but there is little overt interaction. 
 On the surface, the differences are clear: the jukebox in El Paso Taqueria favors Mexican corridos and cumbias over salsa and merengue, and the street kids align themselves in camps that prefer the Mexican rockers Jaguares or the Puerto Rican rapper Fat Joe. But in the public schools, the teenagers are creating a new Latino melting pot. Alberto Medina, a Puerto Rican classmate of Valente Leal's, says: "I play soccer. I eat tacos, my uncle married a Mexican and my other uncle married a Dominican." 
 The Mexicans bring such a feeling of new energy that they give some locals the incorrect impression that they are the new majority Latino population, though they are third after Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, with a population of 196,000. The neighborhood also contains sizable populations of African-Americans and Italian-Americans. 
 Mark Alexander, who runs Hope Community, a development corporation that manages 1,400 housing units and oversees $125 million worth of real estate, points out that "many of the Latino residents of the past have moved out."
 "Last summer we had six free concerts in our garden," Mr. Alexander said. "The biggest hits were mariachi bands."
 Although many of Mr. Alexander's tenants are Latinos and his organization has commissioned work by local muralists like Mr. de la Vega, he doesn't see a Latino-centric future for East Harlem. "Gentrification is happening, regardless of what we do," Mr. Alexander said.
 So, whose casa will El Barrio wind up being?
 The political activist Erica Gonzalez insists that "unless you actually make a commitment to create a permanent home here, you're looking at being pushed out." But these good intentions, coupled with the untamed forces of real estate, could displace even more people in the end. 
 Perhaps the sprawling projects, which literally slice and dice the neighborhood, will make it hard to gentrify, and buy time for East Harlem to reshape itself in a way closer to its self-image: a place where conga drums and commerce can coexist. But it's going to take awhile, and the current economic slowdown will only reinforce what everyone in El Barrio knows, that things move a little more slowly in their neighborhood.
 Maybe these are just the ramblings of a nostalgia-obsessed migrant of the new Latino diaspora. But when I sit at a table at La Fonda Boricua with a plate of bistec encebollado (onion steak) with fried plantains, I feel as if I have found the center of my universe. And as I make fleeting eye contact with new and old acquaintances, and total strangers who look like cousins, aunts and grandfathers I've never met, I know I'm part of something that will never completely disappear. 
 El Barrio is where strangers will still say hello to you on the street, where people are trying to hold onto a sense of melody and rhythm that has defined them for half a century. I can hear it echoing on these streets -- it's a song that calls me back, like a sailor to his old home port. 
 It's the song of Harlem, Spanish Harlem.

The Bronx Has Got a Lot, But Not a Grand Hotel

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
The Bronx has colleges and universities: Fordham, Lehman and Manhattan, to name a few. It has major health care institutions like Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. It has the Yankees. It has the Zoo. 
 But it has no hotel. 
There are a few motels and motor inns here and there, many of which, local residents believe, are centers of prostitution and drug trade. And there was the storied Concourse Plaza Hotel. But that became a welfare hotel in 1968 and, in the early 70's, the city bought it and turned it into a residence for the elderly. 
 Now, a community organization that has long tried to attract a replacement hotel is reviving the idea. Jesse Hamilton, president of the group, the South Bronx Resurgence Corporation, originally dreamed up the plan in the early 80's while writing a thesis on South Bronx redevelopment. 
 "My whole concept was, how do you bring a borough close together?" Mr. Hamilton said. "Where is the central place where events take place?" 
 The poor economy is a large obstacle, but the effort got a lift last month with a new architectural plan, by the renowned firm Philip Johnson/Alan Ritchie Architects, that shows a 25-story hotel with 300 to 350 rooms. The plan is revised from one made in 1989, before Mr. Johnson joined the firm. The hotel would be in Mott Haven, over the Metro-North tracks on 149th Street, near the courts and Yankee Stadium.
 "It's a great location, where the train comes together," said Mr. Ritchie, referring to the 2, 4 and 5 stops and Metro-North lines. "This could really be a hub for development and growth of the Bronx." 
 Mr. Hamilton and other supporters, including Raul Russi, the executive director of a nonprofit drug treatment organization and a commissioner of probation in the Giuliani administration, met last week with a Marriott vice president. But the company has taken no position on the idea.
 There are other hurdles. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which owns the air rights above the tracks, is not actively considering the proposal. The biggest question: who will pay at least $200 a night to stay in the Bronx, at least when the Yankees aren't in the World Series? Sequestered jurors and visitorsto the universities and hospitals would be a start. But no market study has been done.
 Still, the planners are optimistic. "People are afraid to think big," Mr. Russi said. "But in New York, you've got to think big."

More Than a Little Bit Country

 BODY:
The nation's musical tastes seem focused on rap, at least when it comes to album sales.
 "The Eminem Show" was the No. 1 album in the United States last year, selling 7.6 million copies, followed by "Nellyville," by the rapper Nelly, which sold 4.9 million copies. 
Rap in general has fared well against albums from other musical genres, placing third over all in sales, with 84.5 million albums sold last year, according to Nielsen SoundScan, which tabulates record sales. First was rhythm and blues, or R&B, with 161.9 million albums, followed by alternative rock, 126.3 million. Rounding out the top five were country western, which sold 76.9 million albums, and heavy metal, with 74.6 million.
 But while rap albums are high on the sales charts, country music rules the airwaves. More than 2,100 radio stations, or nearly 20 percent of the total, had a country music format last year, according to Inside Radio, which tracks the radio industry.

For a 2nd Week, the Market Pushes Higher

BYLINE:  By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
Perhaps investors have become as tired of falling markets as of the winter snows and are ready to bask in even slender rays of hope. They saw a few on Friday, and for the second consecutive week, all three major market averages pushed ahead, after declining the previous four weeks. 
 Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin Ramadan, said on Iraqi television on Friday that his country was "ready for dialogue with the American administration to build economic ties and cooperation" if it dropped its plans to invade. That eased fears of war. 
 Earlier, a Federal Reserve governor, Ben S. Bernanke, said that the economy was doing decently and that a short war should have little effect on it. A third ray of hope was a report that the Consumer Price Index rose just three-tenths of 1 percent in January.
 Another buoying factor was the expiration of stock options and stock index options. But perhaps traders are just casting aside some of their recent skittishness.
The Nasdaq composite index climbed 3 percent for the week, or 38.85 points, to 1,349.02. The Dow Jones industrials were up 109.31, or 1.4 percent, to 8,018.11, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 13.28 points, or 1.6 percent, to 848.17. JAN M. ROSEN

HEADLINE: Deficit Spending, Fashionable Again 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Embracing Deficits to Deter Spending" (Economic View, Feb. 9) described how conservative economists, once the advocates of balanced budgets, now support deficits as a tool for keeping government spending in check. 
 To some of them, it's now O.K. to increase government debt by offering tax cuts for wealthy Americans. 
 Needless to say, this undermines the credibility of conservatives in and out of the Bush administration regarding their real goals about existing and proposed tax cuts that favor the wealthy. Apparently, they are not so much concerned about creating jobs and growth for the rest of us as they are about curtailing the size of government, no matter how badly people need help.

Don't Worry, Be Ready: Chicken Soup for the Anxious Soul

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: EASTCHESTER, N.Y. 

 BODY:
WHAT does Tom Ridge want from us?
 He counsels us to live yellow in an orange world. But it is not so simple. The homeland band blares dirges one day, easy listening the next. "Don't be afraid," was last week's mood-altering statement from Mr. Ridge, the secretary of homeland security. "Be ready." 
 No wonder so many see Mr. Ridge as the boy who cried duct. But then there are those citizens trying to answer the call -- confusing as it may be -- to get ready for the unthinkable, indefinable, whatever.
Eastchester has Vicki Ford. A local councilwoman, Mrs. Ford commands a citizens' group aiming to whip this Westchester County town into shape.
She is compiling a disaster preparedness booklet with important phone numbers, a map for quick evacuation and a checklist of items for a "Grab-and-Go Ready Kit," with everything from tissues to a signal flare.
In the glass showcases at the town clerk's office, she has replaced artifacts commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Village of Tuckahoe with a display of ingredients for the prepared household: bottled water, batteries, flashlights, blankets, toothbrushes, Swiss Army knife, hand gel and, of course, duct tape. Next month, there will be a one-week course here in first aid, biological and chemical hazards, CPR and more.
There may eventually be neighborhood captains. "I think each four-block area should have an individual they can look to for information," Mrs. Ford said.
This is a whole new world anda whole old world wrapped in one. Mrs. Ford, 65, said her mother was a "blackout warden" during World War II, who inspected their neighborhood in St. Paul, Minn., after air raid sirens sounded to make sure no lights were visible. She saved tin cans for the war effort, as well as bacon drippings, which contained glycerin, used in making explosives. Later, her stepfather, a retired military officer, had a demonstration bomb shelter in the basement.
Civil defense has become emergency management, a true service-economy label, and there are early signs it is becoming a hot commodity on the suburban landscape of soft targets.
If McMansions offer a room for every mood, and S.U.V.'s allow you to traverse every terrain, a smattering of emergency management can help you weather any ill wind, whether from Al Qaeda or El Nino.
Terrorism is the immediate impetus, but purveyors of preparedness are selling it as chicken soup. Whatever's ailing you, it can't hurt.
That's why Dick Breining, a Morgan Stanley financial adviser in New Jersey, was one of 31 people Thursday night at the first of a nine-part emergency preparedness course sponsored by the Paramus Office of Emergency Management. "I want to know what's going on," he said. "I want to protect my family, my home, my neighbors."
KNOWLEDGE may be an antidote to anxiety, but a little bit of emergency preparedness is a scary thing. The highlight of Thursday night's class was a long video of house-tossing tornadoes and hurricanes. Terrorism was hardly the only concern.
"I have a gas pipeline down the street from my house," said Tim Murphy, a salesman in the import-export business. "If it blew up, what would happen? If a plane going into Newark explodes and parts come down, who would I call? You have to be prepared for anything."
This is boot camp for post-9/11 suburbia. The course teaches about search and rescue, fire suppression and emergency communications equipment, among other subjects. The idea, promoted by President Bush, is to form Citizens Corps Councils, which can help the professionals when the going gets tough.
There has hardly been a stampede to join Ridge's Regiment. In Middletown, N.J., where so many victims of 9/11 lived, just 20 people volunteered to take an emergency management course.
"You teach them how to use a hammer and saw and put out a fire," said the local emergency coordinator, Charles Rogers. "You run into so many people today who don't know how to do a doggone thing."
Most people have volunteered only to worry, although about 60,000 people have signed up with citizen councils around the country.
But fatalism is still trumping preparedness. Even, and perhaps especially, among the professionals.
Come what may, said Steven Mehl, the emergency management director in Paramus: "I'm going to do the best I can. And if that's not enough, that's it."

North Korea's Need for Electricity Fuels Its Nuclear Ambitions

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: ONJUNG-RI, North Korea, Feb. 16 

 BODY:
The restaurant receptionist was shivering. The waitresses wore long underwear. Then, during a dinner of spicy dumplings and cold noodles, the lights went out three times.
 "North Korea's No. 1 problem is electricity," Kim Young Il, a South Korean businessman, said, sighing, as the gas flames of a Korean barbecue burned blue into the Saturday night gloom. 
 "We try to deal with goods that can be produced without power like sun dried fish," he said, as the lights flickered back on. "Because there is no heat in hotels, I generally only travel in the country from May to October."
Behind the standoff between North Korea and the world over its nuclear weapons crisis is a power crisis. 
Almost a decade ago, North Korea agreed to stop construction of Soviet-designed power plants that produced plutonium that could be used for nuclear weapons. In return, a United States-led consortium was to build three nuclear power plants designed to be proliferation proof. Although the first plant under the agreement was to be ready this year, the project is years behind schedule.
The deal collapsed last fall after North Korean officials were said to have admitted to an American envoy that they were cheating on the accord and pursuing a second secret nuclear weapons program. Just as winter started, the United States ended fuel oil deliveries to North Korea that had been stipulated under the agreement.
"The U.S. stands between us and electricity," said Kim Dae Sung, a 35-year-old park guide, voicing a government-approved view that most of North Korea's shortcomings are the fault of the United States. Bitter that she never knows whether she will watch television after work or read by candlelight, she said, "Why do the Americans keep making problems with electricity?"
To visit North Korea today is to visit a country that has regressed into a preindustrial past.
Electric wires go from house to house, but at night entire villages disappear into darkness. During the day, residents trudge through the snow, carrying stacks of firewood on their backs. Without the power to mine coal or the fuel to deliver it, most rural households have reverted to cooking and heating with wood.
North Korea has become a nation of walkers and bicyclists as there is little gasoline for cars and buses. The railroad station here features a huge portrait of Kim Il Sung, the founder of this Communist state, with an inspirational slogan. But pedestrians use the tracks as a walkway, because no electric trains have run through here in years. Near here, the lighthouse at Kosong harbor is no longer lighted at night.
"The country was fully electrified before the crisis began in the 1990's," said Timothy Savage, who surveyed North Korea's energy needs in 2000 for the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainable Development, a California-based group. "They have appliances, radios, televisions, and in some cases refrigerators." 
But because of a lack of maintenance, North Korea's hydro and fuel oil plants were working at only 30 percent of capacity, and 30 percent of production was lost as a result of leakage, the Nautilus survey found.
The survey calculated that this nation of 22 million people was limping along on 2 gigawatts of energy, less than the amount of power consumed by an American city of one million people. 
"Energy is at the root of all of North Korea's economic problems, including the famine," Mr. Savage continued, referring to severe food shortages in the mid-1990's that killed as many as two million people, or 10 percent of the population.
Without power, electric pumps could not irrigate fields, electric threshers could not thresh grain and factories could not make fertilizer or parts for North Korea's ancient fleet of tractors. 
Last year, the United Nations World Food Program helped to feed about one-third of the population here. But two of the largest donor nations, Japan and the United States, have suspended food shipments for North Korea, partly because of the nuclear weapons program and partly because of the invective heaped daily on both countries by North Korea's state-controlled media.
Calling for "desperate measures," North Korea's director of energy, Kim Jae Rok, was quoted this week in The Sunday Telegraph as saying that his nation now plans to build four nuclear power plants.
"This will enable us to meet the urgent need for electricity supplies in our country," Mr. Kim was quoted as saying. 
Partly because of energy shortages, the number of South Korean companies interested in investing in North Korea has dwindled. The number of new projects approved by the South Korean government fell to 3 last year, from 13 in 1998. 
Here at the Mount Kumgang resort project, easily South Korea's largest investment in North Korea, the Hyundai Asan Corporation solved the energy problem by importing three 1,000-kilowatt generators and diesel fuel to power them.
"Sometimes only two or three days a week, you see lights in the village," Kim Young Hyun, the resort manager, said of Onjung-ri.
Even Pyongyang, the nation's showcase capital, has been subject to blackouts, forcing people to climb stairs in high-rises and to store water in case water pumps stop.
"Energy supplies are very unreliable," said Lee Sang Man, a South Korean economist visiting here. Power shortages once closed for seven months a factory that Mr. Lee had invested in and was overseeing. The factory produced electric light bulbs.

HEADLINE: Departing Chief of L.I.R.R. Sees Progress and Concerns 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
The Long Island Rail Road is entering a new and uncertain era. It is merging with Metro-North, riders face proposed fare increases as high as one-third, another shipment of new cars is to be put into service, and now its president is leaving and a successor is being sought.
 Kenneth J. Bauer ends his three-year stint as chief of the railroad, the nation's largest commuter line, on March 3 to become chief financial officer at Railworks Corporation, a private transportation-services company in White Plains. 
 He is leaving to generally favorable reviews. 
"I want to thank you for making a difference," one passenger, Joan Nemarich, said as Mr. Bauer made a farewell appearance Thursday night at the L.I.R.R. Commuters Council in Manhattan. "You put the emphasis on putting the customers first."
But the railroad is well known for its glitches and hitches, so there were also complaints about a track fire that shut down Pennsylvania Station for hours on Feb. 14 and the widespread delays after the Washington's Birthday blizzard.
"This winter has been unbelievably long and arduous," Mr. Bauer said. But he added that the arrival of the new M-7 electric cars would enable the railroad to better withstand future winters. "The reliability should be a lot better," he said.
On a typical weekday, the railroad provides 290,000 rides, connecting Nassau and Suffolk with Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. The system has about 6,000 workers.
Among his successes, Mr. Bauer pointed to last year's on-time performance of 94.7 percent, a record. That was achieved despite the railroad's antiquated fleet and lack of spare cars. Three-fourths of the trains are 33 to 35 years old and are overdue for replacement, but improved maintenance helped keep them running, Mr. Bauer said.
A big headache for the railroad has been correcting the problems in the 134 cars and locomotives of its new diesel-electric bilevel trains. They suffered from structural cracks, air-conditioning that was too cold, recordings that announced the wrong stations and brake hoses that kept separating during last week's snowstorm.
The bilevel cars were designed and ordered before Mr. Bauer took over, and he was determined to avoid a replay with the M-7 all-electric trains that will replace most of the rest of the fleet.
M-7 prototypes underwent grueling tests, as the railroad hoped to detect flaws and make corrections before going into full production. Four M-7 trains, about 40 cars, are now in service, and the rest of the 678-car fleet will be phased in at the rate of a couple of trains each month for the next few years.
If Mr. Bauer's testing strategy works, the railroad should be running even better after he is gone, with its fleet modernized from one of the oldest in the nation to one of the newest. Topping Mr. Bauer's list of unfinished business is the "East Side Access" plan to bring the railroad into Grand Central Terminal, and the extension of the railroad's track system. "The railroad has not grown since 1898, and look what's happened to Long Island," he said.
But getting money for these and other projects is a major hurdle, especially with the stumbling economy, Mr. Bauer said. He hopes the federal government will pay half the costs but conceded, "That's going to be tough to do."
As for the merger, he said some functions, like purchasing, might be done better. But the trains of the two systems are not mechanically interchangeable, and the labor contracts at the Long Island are more costly, he said.
Mr. Bauer also wondered whether the sole aim of the merger was to save money, adding, "You don't want to hurt either railroad."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW/From Stratford; 
What Lies Beneath? 300 Years

BYLINE:  By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
FOR the last 12 years, Gerald Sawyer of Stratford has been conducting archeological digs relating to African slavery throughout New England and New York. He has taken part in Mayan digs in Guatemala, Mexico and Belize, and at ancient sites in Northern Ireland and Scotland. 
 Now, however, Mr. Sawyer finds himself working closer to home. 
 During the last few weeks, he has been leading dozens of local history buffs and archeology students on a search for artifacts under the floors of two rooms at the oldest house in Stratford. 
The goal of the dig is to find artifacts that can help piece together the puzzle of what life was like for the dozen different owners of the saltbox style house that was built by the town's first shipbuilder, Benjamin Beach, around 1690. 
Owners of the house not only included shipbuilders and merchants, but also blacksmiths and clergymen.
The project is part of an effort to transform the house, known as the William Perry Homestead, into Stratford's first visitors and tourism center. The house, named after a merchant who owned it in the mid-1800's, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Turning the house into a visitors center has recently gained approval from several town commissions. Local historians and town officials envision the project as a gateway to the Historic District and town center.
Mr. Sawyer, an adjunct professor of archeology at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain and at Brooklyn College in New York, said conducting a dig inside a home presented a rare challenge. 
"This is really an amazing opportunity to conduct a dig at a place that still exists," he said. "Most digs are out in the open field when don't know that we'll find much of anything."
Mr. Sawyer said there had been some intriguing surprises. Artifacts, like a small Native American tool that could be a thousand years old, and pieces of pottery, plates and handmade nails were uncovered beneath the parlor and kitchen areas.
"It's allowing us to do two important things: to look at a house that has been standing for nearly 300 years, and gain a better understanding of how a house changes over that period of time," he said.
"It's also helping us figure out how these artifacts ended up underneath the house. Were they deposited there during the life of the house or before, and if so, how and why? 
Christopher Collier, the state historian, said: "It's an interesting approach that is not done too often. But these historic houses went through many alterations and this is what needs to be done to piece together the puzzle of not only who lived there and how they lived, but what kinds of people roamed those grounds long before that." 
With the floor boards removed revealing crude, long and sturdy floor beams made of chestnut tree trunks and mounds of dirt below, it may seem hard to imagine wealthy shipbuilders and merchants from previous centuries entertaining guests in the front parlor room.
"This kind of dig can add to the understanding of not just the town's history, but of the state's history as well in so many ways," Nick Bellantoni, the state archeologist, said. "By digging underneath the actual house, items can be found that provide vital information about the social histories of the families who lived there, and also about the histories of peoples from long, long ago." 
On recent Saturdays, more than 25 men and women, their faces covered with white paper masks, were coated with the dirt and grime that comes from hours of digging with shovels and picks several feet under floor boards.
They said discovering fragments of pottery, sea shells, nails and animal bones made it all worthwhile.
"It's hard work, but I love history and the possibility of finding something hundreds or even thousands of years old is fascinating to me," said Stephen Winchell, 16, a junior at Bunnell High School in Stratford. "I'm really having a good time and have found some pieces of pottery and oyster shells."
The town has owned the house for about two decades, but it has been vacant since 1997, when it was last used for apartments.
Mr. Sawyer said among the biggest surprises were the large number of butchered animal bones discovered, and the Native American tools that were probably used to scrape the hides of deer and other animals. 
He pondered whether the tools were brought into the house by Native Americans, or the owners, or their guests, or whether they were left in the ground long before the house was built.
Mr. Sawyer said such questions would have to be answered in the laboratory during the next few months, adding that it may be impossible to determine how some of the items got there or how old they are.
Randy Wills, 29, of Rocky Hill, who has worked on archeological digs in Mexico, Italy and Spain, said working on a dig inside an old New England home "allows us to literally peel back the layers of history and find all kinds of historical items that were left behind."
Pointing to part of a newspaper from 1931, he said it revealed some truth in the cliche about history repeating itself: the page told of the economic crisis still facing the nation following the big stock market crash of 1929.
Mr. Sawyer said the experience was like solving a mystery.
"You have a number of clues, and when you get them all together you let the clues tell you the story of the house," he said. 
The story will not be complete, Mr. Sawyer said, until he returns in the spring to lead a dig outside the house, in the well and in the backyard.
"Those are traditional areas where people from the colonial era threw out their garbage, so we expect to find a lot more about the families' histories when we do the outside dig later on," he said. 
The Stratford Town Historian, Lewis Knapp, said what struck him was looking out the windows of the house and watching cars coming off Interstate 95 racing past a grassy green area where colonial town events were once held.
"It intrigues me to think that when the house was built no one could have possibly imagined it would still be here in the 21st century, and that as people dug under the floor boards there would this gigantic turnpike with cars speeding right by every second," he said.

HEADLINE: In the Hood: Jobs for the Poor 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
STEVEN SANCHEZ, a shy 22-year-old from the Bronx, raised on welfare, with a ninth-grade education, was doing nothing when his older sister said: "You can't just be hanging out. Come to Greyston. You can get a good job there."
 Greyston is a cramped factory in rough southwest Yonkers that hires unskilled workers to make cakes in flavors like whiskey pistachio, Venetian wine and dense chocolate named lotus-in-the-mud. The products are sold in specialty-food departments in Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus and at Manhattan restaurants where they are priced at $10 a slice. The bakery also makes brownies, which are used in Ben & Jerry's ice cream, and what Zagat calls the best cheesecake in Westchester. 
 Greyston is, as well, an experiment begun began 20 years ago by an American Zen master. Its mission: to hire the lowest of the low -- the homeless and felons and former drug addicts -- teaching them to work and giving them a livelihood. In the process, the bakery aims thto make a profit and to do it all with style, with flair. 
Improbably, it seems to be working.
"I had a whole vision -- housing, child care as well as the bakery," said Bernard Tetsugen Glassman, a Zen master from Brooklyn and a former aeronautics engineer who wrote handbooks for a NASA flight to Mars before taking up studies to be a Buddhist priest. "But the bakery was the most concrete, and I hoped it would have spiritual value, in helping people to see the interdependence of life."
Today, the Greyston Foundation, which includes the bakery, is one of the largest private providers of low-income housing in Yonkers. It runs a day care center open to the community and a home with a medical clinic for impoverished people with AIDS. Also, in partnership with a neighborhood Episcopal church, it has restored the rundown but historic Philipsburg Hall to elegance, while turning the upper floors into subsidized apartments for artists.
In April, a new $9.4 million bakery is scheduled to open , with four times the capacity of the current one. Designed by Maya Lin, the architect for the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, it was financed with municipal bonds, bank loans and $1 million from the Environmental Protection Agency to cover the reclamation of the polluted lot or brownfield on which it is situated. 
"I wanted to make a great bakery, top of the line," Mr. Glassman said. "And I wanted to do it working with folks our society thinks are throwaways."

'We Will Hire Anybody'
Wednesday is open-hiring day at Greyston. "And we seriously mean open hiring," said Barbara Wood, who oversees training and counseling at the foundation. "We have a policy that we will hire anybody from the neighborhood. We don't check on prison or drugs. We don't ask for resumes or references."
The applications are numbered. When a job opens up, the person at the top is called. New hires may be felons, people who don't speak English, drug addicts or those without job experience of any kind -- and they often are.
When Mr. Sanchez got a call to fill in on the night shift, he showed up on time, did the job and did not skip out early. He did not start fights or push people around. The next time he was called, he went in again. At Greyston that was enough to make him stand out. 
In October, he got a chance on the day shift. That meant getting up at 6:30, five days a week. His friends, who either sold drugs or did nothing, objected.
"They be calling me up," he said. "But I tell them I can't go out. I got to get up really early."
He started at $5.50 per hour. Every two weeks he was evaluated for attendance, punctuality and attitude; after each satisfactory evaluation, his hourly pay rose 25 cents. In January, after three months, he was hired permanently, at a salary of $7 per hour with benefits and two weeks' paid vacation.
Mr. Sanchez, it seems, is succeeding. The vast majority of new hires do not. Four out of five are gone in a week or two, Ms. Wood said. A few start fist fights or are unduly argumentative and are fired, she said, but most disappear as soon as they get their first paycheck. Many return when it is spent, asking for another chance. But by then, Greyston will have moved on to the other applicants. 
"Some people are worth working with," said Crystal Williams, 34, a soft-spoken bakery supervisor who came to Greyston as the homeless mother of two sons. "And some people aren't. You can't help everybody; that's what I've learned here. But there are some people you can help. That's my goal to help those employees."

Zen Master and Maverick
Even in the rarefied company of Zen Buddhist masters, Mr. Glassman -- or, to use his religious title, Roshi Glassman -- is known as a maverick. Very few teachers of Zen, a famously inward-directed religion with a tradition of monastic meditation, get involved with antipoverty efforts. Let alone with conservative Republican mayors, federal low-income housing grants and poor African-American Christians whose initial response was unalloyed suspicion.
"Bernie had a dream,"' said Angelo R. Martinelli, a Republican who was the mayor of Yonkers from 1974 to 1987 and an early supporter of Mr. Glassman who says he was responsible for bringing him to Yonkers. "To build a company that would make a profit and do good works."
Mr. Glassman, born in Brooklyn, became an aeronautical engineer for McDonnell Douglas in 1959, where he wrote handbooks for the flight to Mars scheduled in 1974 (and which finally took place in 2001.) He and his wife, Sandra Jishu Homes, studied Zen Buddhism with Taizen Maezumi, one of the first Zen teachers to settle in the United States.
"What Zen brings is a realization of the interdependence of life," said Mr. Glassman, who left Greyston, though he is still on the board, to create the international Zen Peacemaker Order, a faith-inspired peace and social action organization. "We all have different works to do. With Zen, you do whatever you do the best you can. Phil Jackson was an athlete; he brought Zen to his basketball coaching. I'm from a very liberal Jewish family. Social service was something my family was very involved with. So I brought that to Zen."
He left McDonnell Douglas, completed studies to be a Zen master and opened a small monastery in Riverdale, sending some of his students to the San Francisco Zen center, which is famous for its cooking, to learn to bake. Back in the Bronx, they opened a little cafe and sold cakes to nearby specialty-food shops, to support the monastery.
And under a different Zen master, things might have continued that way: with the high-end cakes supporting the more-or-less high-end spiritual seekers. 
But Mr. Glassman, according to those who know him, has a way of pushing when life threatens to get comfortable. 
"He had a good thing going," said Julius Walls Jr., the chief executive of the Greyston Foundation for the last seven years who met Mr. Glassman through the cocoa business he used to work in. "He had a wonderful mansion overlooking the Hudson. And he turned his world upside-down."
Mr. Glassman said the issue "that grabbed the Zen students was the plight of the single-parent, homeless family."
"We decided we would start working with single-parent families," he said.
In the late 1980's, at the founding meeting of Social Ventures Network for socially minded corporations, Ben Cohen of Ben and Jerry's agreed to buy brownies from Greyston for fudge-brownie ice cream. "That's what got it to take off," Mr. Martinelli said.
Mr. Glassman wanted to hire the homeless to bake and apply the profits to build the Greyston Family Inn, a subsidized long-term residence for homeless families. But first he had to figure out how to make satisfactory brownies in large quantities. 
"They made mistakes," Mr. Martinelli said. "Believe me."
The factory's landlord reneged on a handshake deal. Residents of southwest Yonkers rallied successfully to block the sale of a vacant public school to renovate for the inn. "They were not welcomed at all," said Mr. Martinelli. "It was fear. They heard it was Zen Buddhist. Bernie was very, very shaken and downhearted. He said, 'I come to Yonkers and this is what I get.'
"But they learned a lesson. They had no black people on the board. They brought in people from the neighborhood."
Under Charles G. Lief, the departing president and a real-estate lawyer, Greyston now runs 175 units of subsidized housing, acquired with money raised through grants, foundations and the government. Zen and the art of luxury baking, along with Mr. Glassman himself and celebrities like Ellen Burstyn and Bonnie Raitt have given it the sheen of glamour that is so useful in attracting private donations.
After 20 years, Greyston has become a major player in the civic life of Yonkers, and not just for the poor.
To the Yonkers business community, Greyston is a real business," said Steven Whetstone, the city's commissioner for planning and development. "It works very diligently with an eye on the bottom line. I think there's a lot of respect for that. They're creating jobs. They're adding a lot to what we're trying to do: redevelop downtown Yonkers."

Intangible Advantages
Mr. Martinelli said every organization in Yonkers made sure to include Greyston officials on its guest lists for ground-breakings, ribbon-cuttings, anniversaries and holiday parties.
"They are loved today and you know why?" he said. "When they go, they bring their cakes and believe me, there is no better cake. Take the opening of the new public library. What do they serve? Greyston's lemon mousse cake and chocolate mousse cake, and those cakes are heaven."
The luxury cakes are, perhaps, not strictly necessary, Mr. Walls said. The bakery could probably produce more standard doughnuts, for example, and still adhere to its mission of employing the unemployable while making a profit.
But there are certain intangible but real advantages to producing Westchester's best cheesecake in a factory staffed by the once-homeless and imprisoned, he said. It boosts the employees' morale. It makes Yonkers proud. It means that there are always superb snacks around the workplace. And though he does not exactly say this, it gives him moments of unmitigated glee.
"Most of our customers had zero awareness of what Greyston was," Mr. Walls said. "They just thought we made great cakes. We don't tell them at first or they'd have a bias against us. Poor people eat doughnuts, right?
"As soon as they become aware of our program, their faces drop. Chefs at upscale restaurants say: 'You've got to be kidding! THOSE people! Are making THESE?"
Until 1998, the factory was running in the red. Mr. Walls called a meeting with all factory workers.
"I said: 'We need to make a profit or we're not going to be a success and you're not going have a job anymore. What do you need to do that? How can we reduce waste? How does each action impact the production?' And they thought, 'Wow, they care about what I think.' We talked for a day and everybody got to share. It got personal. It went from pure traditional business conversations to 'Why am I here and what do I want?'
"People said jaw-dropping things. One janitor was in a homeless shelter and sat by the phone all day to get our call and ironed his pants for the interview by putting them between two mattresses. People said they'd been in prison for drug dealing and stealing. They said: "I need to make money. I've got to keep this job."' 
Employees worked overtime. Waste was reduced. The factory made its first profit that fiscal year and has been running in the black and expanding, producing $4.5 million of baked goods today.
Greyston offers its employees unusual amounts of practical supports, like subsidized housing and day care, and counseling for personal problems and referrals for mental-health counseling, drug rehabilitation and education, from G.E.D. to college and trade school. For those who seek it out, there is also, by many accounts, emotional support.
"When I had my G.E.D. tests," Ms. Williams said, "Julius called and said, 'Are you ready?' He marked his calendar. He called that night and said, 'You thought I forgot, right?' "
When she passed in October, Mr. Walls and Mr. Lief sent letters congratulating her. She still carries them in her purse.
"This is love work," said Mr. Walls, who is from Bedford-Stuvesant in Brooklyn and who once created his own chocolate bar, Sweet Roots, to sell in African-American neighborhoods. . "We believe in these people. Hell, I grew up in the projects. I'm not doing this for the money. I saw what was going on here and I got geeked on the energy of love. People here sincerely believe it."
Now that she is a supervisor, Ms. Williams says she gives pep talks from her heart. She knows how repetitive and grueling the work is even for those who have advanced beyond the cleaning detail: lifting 100-pound bags of flour and sugar, wheeling 250-pound bowls of brownie mix, moving heavy baking pans from ovens to cooling racks. The pace is fast. There is also the difficulty of handling the routine of a job for the first time
"I remind them that I'm just like them," Ms. Williams said. "I know when they're tired and stress-up and like 'I can't take it anymore.' I try to keep their spirits up when they're arguing and fussing."
She would pull Mr. Sanchez over, she recalled: "I tell him: I know your friends are saying: 'Don't go to work. Come over. Hang out.' I tell him: 'Don't let them distract you.'
"One girl, I talked to her every day. I said: 'You're not here to make friends. You're here to support your two girls."'
Her path, from homelessness and helplessness to becoming Greyston's first female night supervisor, was difficult, she said. "The guys wouldn't pay me no mind," she said. "They thought I was just a woman."
But after long talks with Ms. Woodand Mr. Walls, she gained confidence. For months, at supervisors' meetings, she sat far in the back. Then, she began to get there early and take a seat up front. Now, she said, she always sits in the very front. Her seat is sacrosanct, she said. "This is my seat at the table."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
Play Finds Time Is An Enemy

BYLINE:  By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: CROTON FALLS 

 BODY:
SURELY there are still Janie Blumbergs and Harriet Cornwalls out there, but does anybody care?
 It has been more than 20 years since "Isn't It Romantic," Wendy Wasserstein's popular breakout play, made these two best friends emblematic of feminist issues among bright, career-driven, upper- and "very upper" middle-class women on their own in Manhattan, pushing 30 and, alas, single. 
 It's anybody's guess why the Schoolhouse, which tends to avoid the mainstream, especially a mainstream from years gone by, is having a go at this play -- and a slow go it is.
Too overexposed to remain a stock staple and too recent to revive, Ms. Wasserstein's play now seems a tepid rehash of ethnic stereotypes (Janie is Jewish; watch out: a pushy mother lurks), and issues that have either become more complex or just plain non-issues. 
"Isn't it Romantic" has aged and none too flatteringly. Funny for an agenda play, it was once considered original in its exploration of identity, relationships and values. It's not that living is easier, society more expansive or conflicts better resolved these days. Indeed, it's all quite worse, but so inseparable from a wrecked economy and a panicked nation that the concerns of these privileged young women of the 80's could hardly be less consequential. Should Janie marry the doctor who calls her "monkey"? Should Harriet marry the man she has been dating for two weeks, now that she has broken off with a married lover who calls her "beauty"? 
Although Ms. Wasserstein's slickly glib style sounds formulaic and ineffectual here, the playwright's sense of the absurdity of alternatives is a saving grace. Still, there is little a director can do to move the play along.
The task of the director, Mary McGinley, is alleviated by the effervescence and quick wit of the classy Sarah K. Lippmann as Harriet and aggravated by the tedious Janie of Kate Sandberg, who appears more controlled and blase than unkempt and dizzily smart as the character is meant to be. Ms. Lippmann is especially endearing and poignant when she observes how tiresome it is to have to "work at everything," relationships, in particular. As Marty, who spares nothing in trying to land Janie as life partner, Benjamin Bauman's sweet affection is so genuine, his performance so sensitive, that Janie seems quite the fool for turning him away. The causes of feminism, self-fulfillment and independence are ill served by such oddly imbalanced casting. Then there is Charles F. Wagner IV who plays Paul, Harriet's smarmy fling who matter-of-factly sets the parameters of their relationship, no questions asked, no strings. The man is a creep. How is it that Mr. Wagner's layered performance suggests, emphatically, that there is far more complexity in Paul than is customarily acknowledged? The tally for a cast of eight: three surprises, (two good, one bad ) one splendid turn (Ms. Lippman); the others will do.
Paradoxically, Ms. Wasserstein writes plays of contemporary concerns that date quickly, perhaps because they are of the moment. Her work is often vastly entertaining at the expense of depth, settling for a smattering of valid perceptions ("It doesn't take strength to be alone; it's much harder to be in love with someone"). 
Characteristically, the quest for commercial appeal wins over passion and risk, which may be just why Ms. Wasserstein is the most popular and visible female playwright in decades. As this Schoolhouse staging, and the enemy, time, prove glaringly, a pop playwright needs to be presented with all the trimmings. Pizzazz and glamour are essential for maintaining the illusion of substance.
"Isn't It Romantic" by Wendy Wasserstein. Schoolhouse Theater, 3 Owens Road, Croton Falls.Through March 9. Tickets: (914)277-8477.

 BODY:
VALERIE BORNSTEIN still sounds wistful when she talks about the 12.7-acre horse boarding farm that her family once owned here. "My parents bought the property in 1945," Ms. Bornstein recalled. "In about 1955 we had a horse and then sometime around 1970 or so we added another 16 stalls. In Bergen County, people who bought a horse got a boarding stable. We always had a huge waiting list. We bred thoroughbreds, one a year." 
 As the stables grew, however, so did the town around them, until the farm was an agricultural oasis, abutting train tracks, set amid ranch houses and near a shopping strip. After the death of her father and repeated complaints around the neighborhood about dust and noise from the stables, Ms. Bornstein and her mother sold the land to a developer in 1999. They received $2 million and one of the townhouse condominiums to be built there, with an appraised value of $425,000. The town had already rezoned the area, to settle a suit brought by a developer. 
 The decision to sell was made reluctantly, Ms. Bornstein said. 
"You've brought back a lot of memories," she said to a reporter. "I was thinking about all the backyard horses there used to be. This town's changed a lot." 
These are turbulent times for horse owners throughout New Jersey who are facing ever-tougher economic and environmental obstacles. Medium-size and smaller farms that board horses and give riding lessons are being forced out in some counties because of restrictive zoning, development and neighborhood complaints. The recreational horse owners who keep animals in their backyards have virtually disappeared in some areas; some refused to comment for this article for fear of alerting neighbors that horses were being kept nearby. 
The New Jersey horse industry is old and proud, one of the most active and developed in the nation. It encompasses races, breeding, horse shows, rodeos, clinics and trail rides as well as recreational and handicapped riding and 4-H programs that are one of the few areas of growth in the industry. The largest livestock-based agricultural industry in the state, it employs nearly 6,000 people and generates $650 million in annual revenue, according to the state Department of Agriculture. More than six million people attend horse races and other events in the state each year. New Jersey is also home to the United States Equestrian Team, based in Gladstone. The state animal is, in fact, the horse.
Still, the number of horses is decreasing. A 1988 survey by the Department of Agriculture counted 60,000 equine animals - horses, mules, ponies and donkeys - while 49,000 were counted in 1996. Equine-related acres in the state numbered 120,000 in 1988; in 1996, there were 81,000, a loss of 33 percent. (The department is considering a new survey for next year, and the 1996 data are the latest available.)
The background is familiar: The most densely populated state in the nation, New Jersey has lost half its farmland since the 1950's. State agricultural statistics show that the number of dairy farms alone has fallen by more than half, to 250 in 2001 from 584 in 1987. 
Much of the land once devoted to farming is taken by new housing, attracting newcomers who are often intolerant of the dust, noises and smells that are part of keeping horses. 
Complaints from just two people about one farm can create a lot of problems, said Margie Margentino, who oversees the state's 4-H program.
"I'd rather smell a little horse odor than when the ChemLawn people come and spray the lawns," she said. "When I was growing up we all had horses in our backyard. It didn't matter if you had half an acre or two acres. We all had horses. We didn't have odor, noise problems or any of that stuff." 
Vikki Karcher Siegel, owner of Snowbird Acres Farm in Long Valley and a director of the New Jersey Horse Council, an industry group, blames immigrants from urban areas.
"They like the rural atmosphere, but then they try to change it to be the city," she said. They like the look of horses, "but they don't want flies, they don't want manure, they don't want a loose horse running in their yard, which of course is going to happen."
Most good barns do not problems with flies, she said, or with manure. "We deal with it because we wouldn't want the horses to suffer," she said. ""We're not doing anything that will seep through to the aquifer."
Some townships have worked hard to keep their horse farms, believing them to be economically viable ways of maintaining open space.
Dianne Gallets, township administrator of Washington Township in Morris County, said the county had preserved 4,231 acres on 63 farms under the state's Farmland Preservation Program. Under the program, established in 1983, farmers can sell or donate easements for development of their land to the state or a county agricultural development board, municipalities or nonprofit organizations. The sale price is based on the difference between what a developer would pay for the land and what it is worth for agriculture.
Morris County was the first to be approved for the program. These days there are many horse farms in the area, and few neighborhoodcomplaints.
"The horse farms keep the area looking country," Ms. Gallets said. "I think the people around here appreciate having areas of open space where they can just ride by and peek at the horses munching away."
The preservation program isn't for every farmer, however. James Fairclough, who has won world championships with the United States Equestrian Team and owns a 197-acre farm in Newton, said the preservation program in Sussex County did not offer him enough to make it worthwhile to sell his development easement. "I can cut mine into mini-farmettes and get three or four times that value," he said.
Though he plans to try again to sell his easement under the preservation program, Mr. Fairclough said: "At some point I'm going to get stepped out or pushed out. As a horseman you don't want to have your farm in the middle of a growing urban world. You want to have that peace of mind."
Ms. Siegel said of the preservation program: "On the surface it seems like a great idea, and if you need quick money, it's wonderful. But if you plan to stay, it doesn't make sense." She said that if restrictions made farming impossible, a farmer's children "aren't going to want to pay taxes on something they can't use."
According to a survey published last September by the Rutgers Equine Science Center, those in the horse industry say that, after the health of their animals, their biggest concern is the cost of doing business in the state, including property taxes and the cost and availability of farmland.The Equine Science Center is planning a meeting next month that it is calling a horse industry summit to discuss many concerns that showed up in the survey.
The economy, of course, has not helped. Dale Welk, general manager of Garden State Horse Sales based in Hanover, Pa., which handles large auctions, said prices of standardbred horses of lower pedigree had declined. However, the buyer base in New Jersey has not decreased as it has in other states, Mr. Welk said, and more horses are on the market, which could explain some of the price decreases. 
Outstanding racing horses seem to fetch top dollar no matter what the economic outlook. Dr. David Meirs, a semiretired veterinarian who raises standardbred horses at Walnridge Farm in Cream Ridge, said: "Buyers are going to say, 'To hell with the stock market, I did better with my racing stables last year.' Of course, it's more fun to go to the races than to watch your stocks every day."
The market for pleasure horses has different pressures. Karl Bauer, who breeds quarter horses and runs a training center in Pompton Plains, said horse sales had declined in recent years except for the very lowest-priced horses. "A lot of the horsemeat companies have closed down, so now we have an overload of very cheap horses that may have problems, whether they're lame or just bad attitude horses," he said. "So these horses are selling to the public, and that's hurting the market." 
In 2002 Governor McGreevey eliminated the state's supplement to thoroughbred racing purses, which had been as high as $18 million in 2001, significantly cutting the purses for the Meadowlands and Monmouth Park thoroughbred tracks. 
Chris McErlean, vice president and general manager of the Meadowlands Race Track, said: "You need sustained, incremental growth to get people to buy and race horses. But we feel we're racing too many days to sustain the level of purses we have right now, and that affects the quality of horses that we have, which affects the people who bet. Less money, lesser horses, less betting; it's kind of a vicious circle." 
Another big concern is environmental regulations. This spring the state is expected to announce how it will enforce new federal regulations on how agricultural operations that keep animals in close quarters handle waste. The rules are expected to require farms that keep a large number of animals to follow nutrient management plans. That includes evaluating what the animals are eating and their manure, conducting soil testing and proper fertilization, and adapting a manure disposal plan. The new rules are also expected to cover more smaller farms but to allow them to police their own handling of waste by using a checklist. 
Fines for violating a permit may range from $1,000 to $50,000 a day for each violation, with the amount depending on the farmer's conduct (was the violation willfull, for example?) and the seriousness of the effect on the environment.
Dr. Stephen P. Dey, a veterinarian who is a member of the state Board of Agriculture, said: "Farming is not making very much money as it is. To have this added on them, they're understandably concerned."
An industry that plays such a large part in the state's livelihood, full of centuries-old traditions and passionate animal lovers, is most likely to find ways to adapt, at least in the short term. Though the bigger farms are decreasing, anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of small operations on plots of three to five acres is increasing, particularly in mid-Jersey and South Jersey. 
"Monmouth County is losing farmland just as much as any other county in the state," said Richard Obal, an agriculture agent with Rutgers Cooperative Extension. "But there has been an upward growth in the number of farms that list equine, or horses, as their No.1 one use of the land."
Much land that was devoted to field crops like corn and soybeans now produces hay and forage crops to supply horse food. The county has about 11,500 horses, more than any other county in the state, and the number of horse farms there jumped to 1,250 in 1996, from 860 in 1988.
Though breeding and racing account for most of the industry's revenue, the number of horses kept for pleasure and sport in the state is increasing compared with those kept for racing.
Children seem to be just as fascinated with horses as ever, even when they don't have direct access to them. There has been a statewide increase in 4-H education events, like the Horse Quiz Bowl and the Model Horse Show, where the children, most of who don't have a chance to ride, paint and make equipment for plastic horses. 
"The pleasure horse industry and the youth development projects and the state 4-H office have become very strong," said Lynn Matthews, an equine specialist in the state Department of Agriculture. "The kids today are the future of agriculture, and to maintain a viable agriculture, we have to keep them interested." 
Bob Allen, who has a 30-acre farm in Moorestown that has been in operation for 40 years, says he teaches riding to about 250 students a week. 
"We've found our business has increased at least 10 percent with a lot of new homes being built," he said. "They're not apartment buildings, they're million-dollar homes, and those people are affluent enough for them to get involved in the horse industry and to teach their kids."
Mr. Allen's farm, which used to be surrounded by other farms, is the only one left "in the middle of a cute little town," he said, adding that though he welcomed the new business he felt isolated. 
Marianne Washienko, owner of Sport Horse Saddlery in Wyckoff, says her shop does more business now withparents than with farmers, a change she enjoys. "I can't tell you how many kids come in here," she said. "I can't tell you how excited and enthused they are about horses."
Others manage to buy large spreads, refusing to let a grand old way of life die.
Lisa Marie Post bought a horse farm on almost 20 acres in Perrineville three years ago and transformed it into the Chestnut Ridge Equestrian Center. She keeps 23 horses, 12 of which she owns and uses for lessons and shows.
Ms. Post jokes about buying "the last nice horse farm in Monmouth County" but says Millstone Township is doing its best to maintain the area's rural character. A piece of land abutting her farm was recently sold to a developer, and the township helped ensure a buffer zone of more than an acre between the Post farm and the new housing. She also had a few horse lovers on her side.
"One of the board members, his daughter took riding lessons here, so he was helpful making sure that everybody was happy," she said. "And the builder's sister rides horses, so he understood the flavor of the township."
Ms. Post has confidence in the future of her farm as well as her township. "I grew up in a suburban area and wound up doing this," she said. "People will always be interested in horses and always will want to ride. As we become more technical and mechanized, it's more and more important for people to get out and be with these animals, spend more time with nature. 
"I look at it this way: It's your goal and your job to pass this on so it doesn't die."

Hold Those Millionaire Farewells

BYLINE:  By JON SHURE; Jon Shure is president of New Jersey Policy Perspective, which conducts research on state issues.

 BODY:
AS momentum to raise the state income tax on those making more than $500,000 a year appears to grow, we are being warned: tax them more, and well-off New Jerseyans will up and leave the state. 
 Just imagine caravans of Lexuses and Mercedes-Benzes jamming the highways, with cases of Perrier and Grey Poupon strapped to their roofs in an upscale version of Oklahomans fleeing the Dust Bowl. Garden State emigres will abandon homes, friends, relatives and jobs rather than pay the extra two or three cents a dollar being proposed as a levy on part of their income. Better this than helping to lessen the effect of cutting programs and services in the face of a huge budget shortfall. 
 Taxing the most productive citizens out of New Jersey will leave the poor and middle classes to battle over crumbs while tumbleweeds blow down the avenues of Millburn and Alpine and squatters take over McMansions across the former wealth belt. 
That's what the scare scenarios say will happen. But does that really make sense?
Well, no, and there is proof. It turns out that the Internal Revenue Service keeps track of what it calls state-by-state migration data (and you thought it just collected taxes). Conveniently enough, the statistics go back to 1989, making it easy to see if New Jersey's last income tax increase, in 1990, caused the outflow that one would expect if state income tax rates played a big role in where people choose to live.
If today's doomsayers are right, there must have been a big spike in departures around 1990. But there was not. Indeed, when the income tax increase was in effect, the number of tax filers leaving New Jersey actually decreased, to 90,863 in 1993 from 106,712 in 1990. And when income tax cuts were phased in over three years, little changed. The number of departures decreased to 88,575 in 1994, increased to 91,714 in 1995 and then decreased again, to 90,520, in 1996.
In fact, in every year that data are available except two, if the number of people leaving the state went up so did the number coming in, and vice versa. This suggests that larger forces, like regional or national economic conditions, were at work.
Maybe examining where people who leave New Jersey go will reveal the role of taxes. Fed-up folks might choose New Hampshire, the nearest state with no income tax. But they don't. Year after year, only about a half a percent of people leaving New Jersey go to the Granite State.
What about Florida? It too has no income tax, and the weather is much nicer than in New Hampshire. People do go there -- but as many or more go to New York, where taxes are higher than in New Jersey. Florida and New York, along with Pennsylvania, are far and away the top destinations of people leaving New Jersey, accounting for about 60 percent of those who go. The other end of the scale remains pretty constant too: every year, North and South Dakota vie to be the least-favored destination for people leaving New Jersey.
The I.R.S. also tabulates income figures. Do they prove that rich people are just a tax hike away from folding their tents? Not hardly. 
The average income of New Jersey residents moving to New York is always higher than that of those who go to Florida or Pennsylvania. And, without fail, average incomes of everyone saying hello to New Jersey are higher than those saying goodbye. This would seem to make perfect sense, since a lot of people heading out are fixed-income retirees. But if income tax rates were the factor that some say they are, those numbers would certainly look different. Clearly, people choosing New Jersey are in their peak earning years, and an increase or decrease in the marginal state income tax rate doesn't influence their decision. 
Sure, some will go if the income tax rises. But a mass exodus or even a noticeable trend? It's just a myth.
The realities are these: Proposed tax increases would affect less than 2 percent of taxpayers. The pennies more per dollar they would pay are more than offset by what they have received back from state and federal tax cuts. 
Myths have a certain appeal, but in the end, reality is more compelling.

HEADLINE: A Genteel Nostalgia, Going Out of Business 

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
The store's front window told the story, all of it. 
 There was a blue crocheted shawl and framed needlepoint art of a lighthouse, two white hand-knitted baby sweaters and a handful of cream-colored antique bowls -- all reminiscent of a time when New Yorkers wore handmade clothes, drank more tea than lattes, and played with rag dolls. 
 But alongside these markers of an older, perhaps gentler New York, the store window had a new sign, more modern and increasingly familiar: "Going Out of Business."
The New York Exchange for Woman's Work, founded 125 years ago so that Civil War widows could earn a "proper" living by selling their hand-knitted scarves and mittens, will close at 149 East 60th Street in Manhattan on Friday. The model for dozens of similar enterprises across the country, the exchange survived the Great Depression, two world wars, and the 1970's economic crisis by selling everything from liquor and lingerie to crab cakes and sweaters for dogs. 
But now, high rent and overhead, coupled with tough economic times and a waning taste among consumers for handmade products, has forced the exchange to close.
"It's a shame," said Carmen Debono, who lives around the corner from the exchange and goes in once a month to shop. "It has the small-town feel." Yet even as she sifted through mittens for her children, ages 3 and 5, and tried on a woolen hat for herself, she also wondered aloud how the store had made it so far. 
The exchange was founded in 1878 by Candace Wheeler, an interior designer, and Mary Atwater Choate, a prominent New Yorker who also founded Choate Rosemary Hall, the preparatory school. Its first home was in the Choate parlor at 108 East 31st Street. The Civil War had made widows of a number of well-off women who needed to earn a living but who were too genteel to leave home for work. So the women baked and knitted to ward off poverty and sold their products through the exchange. 
Staying afloat by selling cookies and smock dresses was not always easy, though. Over the years, the exchange remained in business by using loans from the wealthy husbands of the women on its board and posting signs in Central Park advertising the store. 
The exchange made its name -- and some of its fortune -- with its restaurant, which opened in 1919 at its old site, 541 Madison Avenue. The restaurant sold bittersweet chocolate cake and home-baked crab cakes, codfish balls and wedding cakes. It became a place to eat well and inexpensively and to be seen. In 1934, after Prohibition ended, the exchange opened another famed spot, the Crinoline Bar, which served sidecars and Manhattans to women wearing gloves. 
Given its famous founders and Manhattan location, the New York Exchange for Woman's Work was the standard for exchanges across the country by the end of the 19th century, according to Kathleen Waters Sander, the author of "The Business of Charity: The Woman's Exchange Movement, 1832-1900." At least 75 similar exchanges had sprouted up in cities from Boston to San Diego by 1900. Only about a half-dozen of those exchanges will be in operation when the one in Manhattan closes. 
"You can't run a shop based on the small profits you make from selling smocks," Ms. Waters Sander said. 
So nostalgia is on sale now at the New York exchange. On a recent visit to the dimly lit ground-floor store, imitation Raggedy Ann dolls were slumped on the shelves with tags announcing 20 percent off their $87.50 price. Antique doll furniture and sterling silver sugar tongs were half off. A wooden Noah's Ark complete with Noah, elephants and zebras priced at $195 was 50 percent off -- as was a hand-crocheted "huggie coaster" that wraps around a soda can. It was $2.50. 
"It's nothing in our consignors' pockets, and our pockets," Dawn Miner, the store manager, said, adding that some consignors chose not to lower their prices. 
The store takes 40 percent of what an item is sold for and gives 60 percent to consignors, who number around 450 and now also include men. Consignors submit tax forms showing they have low incomes or other financial hardships to qualify for having their merchandise sold at the store. The shop's board members would not give the names of their consignors, citing rules of confidentiality. 
Among the things that killed the exchange are the simple laws of income and outgo. The store's monthly rent is about $11,000; tax returns for 2001 show that the store made about $275,000 but had only $115,000 left after paying consignors and buying merchandise. And that was not enough to cover the almost $308,000 a year needed for the rent and salaries for a staff of seven. 
Beyond that, the business of the handmade has changed, according to Catherine Dinehart, the store's former manager. When she began in 1989, she would meet with 20 prospective consignors twice a week. By the time she left about a decade later the number had dwindled to four or five consignors. 
"As the expenses of doing business have gone up so have the expenses of making things," Ms. Dinehart said. Materials like yarn for knitting have increased in price, she said. But it has been hard to pass that on to consumers. 
"One woman said, 'Your things are so expensive. I can get them at the Gap,' " said Manie Van Doren, a board member and a member of the well-known New York family. "What she didn't realize is that they're handmade."
The exchange tried to increase revenue by selling machine-made merchandise that fit with the illusion of the handmade, like handbags by the designer Vera Bradley -- but that meant spending money before earning it, Ms. Miner said. 
"The necessity for the handmades is not there," Ms. Miner said. "People are looking for a bargain.'
Another negative factor was the move from Madison Avenue to Third Avenue in 1991, changing the store's clientele from high-level executives and international tourists to neighborhood residents and workers from Bloomingdale's across the street, Ms. Dinehart said. Squeezed now between a pizzeria and a gourmet deli on East 60th Street off Lexington Avenue, the exchange doesn't get as many shoppers for its stock, ranging from wool sweaters for Upper East Side dogs, knit by Bolivian women, to a handmade door pillow declaring "Home Sweet Penthouse." 
The beginning of the end may have come in 1979, when the restaurant was required to become a for-profit establishment. It closed instead, ending an era of famous codfish balls and steady revenue for the exchange. 
The Brooklyn Women's Exchange at 55 Pierrepont Street is also struggling, said Grace Gutman, president of its volunteer committee. The store has cut back on buying machine-made merchandise and has brought in Brooklyn authors for book signings. Ms. Gutman said the 150-year-old shop also does well by being in a residential neighborhood with young families who shop for handmade baby clothes and toys. 
To survive, the exchanges must market themselves as a good cause, Ms. Waters Sander said. "Unless the exchanges get that message out there, they're just another shop on the block," she said.
But a recent visit to the store revealed that, worthy cause or not, shoppers were bargain hunting. Elizabeth Barbour, a retired housekeeper, admitted that the "Going Out of Business" sign brought her into the store. "I came in to see the Vera Bradley bags," she said, smiling. "But they were all gone."
Another shopper, dressed in a full-length fur coat and carrying a Bloomingdale's bag, asked if the crocheted stuffed animals were really 20 percent off. They were. 
"They're flocking in to buy everything we have," Ms. Miner, the store manager, said. "Too bad this wasn't happening a couple of months ago.'

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY IN THE EAST; 
Powell Seeks Asian Support for New U.S.-Backed Resolution

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sunday, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
Saying that the United States is entering into a period of "intense diplomacy" on Iraq, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that he had urged Japan's leaders to help the United States lobby members of the United Nations Security Council to support an American-sponsored resolution on Iraq.
 Mr. Powell made his comments following a series of meetings on Saturday night with Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi on the first leg of a five-day swing through Asia that will take Mr. Powell to Beijing later today and then to South Korea on Monday. 
 "We hope that the prime minister and foreign minister, because they have been supporting our efforts, will continue to support those efforts," Mr. Powell told reporters this morning. "I hope that once they see the resolution, they will find it the appropriate thing to do to show support for that and to contact members" of the Security Council.
American officials say that Mr. Koizumi has emerged as a potentially important ally for the United States in winning support from fence-sitting members of the Security Council in joining the United States and Britain's campaign to win passage of a second resolution endorsing the use of force to disarm Iraq.
Though Japan is not among the Security Council's 15 members, American officials contend it maintains good relations with several of the 10 nonpermanent members of the Council, in large part because of its foreign aid commitments. One of the countries Japan is thought to have particularly good ties with on the Council is Angola. 
"Japan, I think, has the potential to be very helpful in that effort," a senior State Department official said. 
But it remains unclear just how far Japan will be will to go to support the United States on Iraq. Though Mr. Koizumi has suggested that Japan would be willing to support the use of force to disarm Iraq, he has also indicated he would prefer that the United States first receive Security Council backing. 
In Japan, as in much of Europe, opinion polls show that the public opposes war with Iraq without United Nations backing.
American officials said they are hoping that Japan, in addition to lobbying members of the Security Council, will support military action against Iraq by providing fuel and warships. 
Japanese ships are currently assisting the United States in naval operations in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, but Japanese officials have indicated that they will need a vote of the Japanese Parliament to authorize the use of those ships in a military action against Iraq.
Mr. Powell said he also discussed strategies for resolving the standoff with North Korea with the Japanese leaders. Though Japan has urged the United States to talk directly with the north, Mr. Powell said that Mr. Koizumi and Ms. Kawaguchi agreed with the Bush administration that those talks should take place under the aegis of a "multilateral forum." 
The United States has proposed inviting North Korea to a meeting involving 8 other nations and the European Union. That would include the five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- plus South Korea, Australia and Japan. 
However, Pyongyang has rejected that idea, demanding that the United States meet with North Korea alone. Mr. Powell said the Japanese had offered another proposal for a forum, but declined to describe it. 
"It is not just a U.S.-D.P.R.K. problem," Mr. Powell said, referring to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. "That's what happened last time when we thought the problem was solved."
Mr. Powell also said that the United States was prepared to assist North Korea economically if it permanently abandons its nuclear weapons programs. Mr. Powell is expected to announce a continuation of American food aid to North Korea, which had ended in December, when he visits South Korea for the inauguration of the new president, Roh Moo Hyun, on Tuesday. 
"You can't eat plutonium," Mr. Powell said. Referring to North Korea, he added, "As long as you pursue those technologies, those who can help you grow the things that you can eat and develop an economy that will assist your people, can't help you."

Biotech: Golden Egg Or Wrong Basket?

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
SINCE 1995, when Governor Pataki committed the state to developing biotechnology on Long Island, the state has poured $95 million into turning the Route 110 area into a hot spot for the life sciences industry.
 One beneficiary has been a drug development company called OSI Pharmaceuticals, the anchor tenant of an incubator, a 53,000-square-foot building built by the state in 2000 on the campus of Farmingdale State University. OSI, which has a cancer drug now in the final stage of clinical testing, is often cited as a brimming-with-potential biotech company that represents the region's future. 
 The starting date of that future, however, is uncertain. Like most biotech companies, OSI fared poorly last year. The company posted a net loss of $218.5 million, more than 10 times its revenues. 
"People expect biotech companies to lose money," said Colin Goddard, the company's chief executive. 
OSI's troubles were not unusual for the industry. The Amex Biotechnology Index, a group of 17 stocks, dropped 40 percent in 2002, its second consecutive year of decline. Local biotech companies got not a single dollar in venture-capital investments in 2002, down from $3 million in 2001, according to Ernst & Young. Most analysts are not expecting this year will be much better.
Despite a $11.5 billion budget deficit, the Pataki administration continues to spend to develop a biotech sector on Long Island. A few weeks ago, administrators at Farmingdale State received notice from Albany that work would soon begin on a second $20 million incubator building in the fledgling biotechnology park.
A third and smaller incubator, as yet unbudgeted, is planned for the Farmingdale campus. When built, it will complete what is envisioned as a huge petri dish on the Suffolk-Nassau border, nurturing as many as 35 biotech start-ups.
"Scientists have a herding instinct, and you see biotech companies clustering together," said Bruce Stillman, the director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, which maintains close ties with the Farmingdale incubator. "Until you have a few of them inthe cluster, you don't see any. Instead of coming to Long Island, they go to New Jersey."
But could the state have put all its eggs in the wrong basket? 
Local business leaders and government officials say that regardless of current circumstances, the industry will one day generate thousands of new, high-paying jobs. Thomas R. Suozzi, Nassau's county executive, has cited biotech as central to the county's future, and on Tuesday he will deliver his State of the County address from Cold Spring Harbor Lab. 
"It can take 10 years or more, and more than $100 million, to get a new drug approved and on the market," said James A. Hayward, the chief executive of the Collaborative Group, a biotech concern in Stony Brook, and former chairman of the governor's task force on Long Island incubators. "But when the drug hits the market, the payoffs can be truly enormous."
Dr. Stillman said that the state's investment in infrastructure in Farmingdale had kept companies like OSI on Long Island and had also prompted other companies, including Forest Labs of Manhattan and Icon Laboratories of Farmingdale, to lease over 100,000 square feet of vacant retail space within walking distance of the incubator and convert it to laboratory use.
In general, incubators provide lower-cost laboratory and office space, specialized support services like water filtration and disposal of contaminated sewage, easy access to the resources of the surrounding campus, even a social calendar. 
Industry leaders say incubators also contribute to the impression that a region supports biotech development.
"When you see the incubators go up, and you hear the governor talk about biotechnology when he gives a speech on television, you feel the region is serious about attracting biotech companies," said Ron Cohen, president of the New York Biotechnology Association and a biotech entrepreneur in Hawthorne, N.Y. 
Incubators are especially prized in biotechnology because many start-ups struggle along for years without products to sell, burning investor dollars.
"We are in desperate need of that second incubator," said Greg Blyskal, the manager of the Broad Hollow Biosciences Park, which houses the incubator on the Farmingdale State campus. "We have been approached by half a dozen biotech companies looking for space. If we don't have space for them on Long Island, we run the risk that they'll move somewhere else."
OSI pays about $23 a square foot for space in the incubator and provides some maintenance services; Immuno-Rx and Helicon Therapeutics, its much smaller co-tenants, pay about $17 a square foot. Mr. Blyskal estimated that such space would cost $40 to $50 a square foot on the commercial market, and it is in short supply.
While tenants clearly benefit from subsidized space and convenient services, the host university benefits as well, advocates say. When an incubator opens, it attracts entrepreneurial tenants and integrates them into campus life. The tenants can enrich the overall academic environment by teaching courses, hiring faculty members for their special projects or long-term consulting arrangements and employing students as entry-level lab technicians. 
So far, none of that has happened at Farmingdale State. University officials say the reason is because the school lacks a biotech program, though in September it plans to introduce one for undergraduates, with an emphasis on manufacturing processes, officials said.
Advocates like the Long Island Life Sciences Initiative, a year-old consortium of regional biotech and related businesses, say that constructing incubators and other services for small biotech companies will allow the region to compete credibly with other leading biotech centers like northern New Jersey; Cambridge, Mass.; Research Triangle Park, N.C.; and San Francisco.
Proponents say the state's investment will allow the region to capitalize more fully on research advances made at institutions like Cold Spring Harbor Lab, the State University at Stony Brook, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and North Shore-Long Island Jewish Hospital.
In addition to the two incubators in Farmingdale, the Pataki administration has allocated $35 million for genome research at Cold Spring Harbor Lab, $16 million for biotechnology and electronics research at Stony Brook and $4 million for an magnetic resonance imaging center at North Shore-L.I.J.
The decision to anoint biotechnology as the region's technological forte, and to turn Farmingdale State into the academic nucleus able to attract investors, scientists and technical workers from around the world, was made mainly behind closed doors early in the Pataki administration, part of a $1 billion plan to manage technological growth throughout the state.
For Long Island, Governor Pataki pushed the life sciences ahead of various other technologies with equal or stronger claims on the economic future, including software engineering and wireless communications.
"The decision was made out of the governor's office, and not on any broad-based consensus" among business and political leaders, said Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. 
"In terms of anyone doing a comprehensive analytic examination, in terms of which technology would ultimately be more economically beneficial to the region, I have not seen any such study," added Dr. Koppelman, who participated in Dr. Hayward's incubator task force. "I had the impression it all came down amore or less unilaterally from Albany. Everyone seemed to accept it. The attitude on Long Island is that anything that comes from Albany is good. If it's money, you accept it."
Four calls to the governor's office for comment were directed to the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development agency, and were not returned. 
Since the policy's implementation, regional business, political and academic leaders have in general coalesced in support. Many recall participating in an unsuccessful effort a decade ago to convince Governor Pataki's predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, to take similar steps to stanch an exodus of scientists, trained assistants and intellectual property from the area's research institutions.
Much of the support on Long Island has been in terms of articulating an economic rationale for the governor's policy. In November the Long Island Association, the region's largest business group, published a report in Business LI, its monthly magazine, that depicted a rosy economic future for biotech on Long Island.
The report, which was sponsored by Farmingdale State, cited biotechnology as one of the "high-wage industries likely to spearhead Long Island's economic growth for the reasonable future." 
Pearl Kamer, the association's economist and the report's author, said, "It is clear that the sector has already become a major engine of growth on Long Island."
Joseph Scaduto, the executive director of Long Island Life Sciences Initiative, said: "Those of us who work in biotech are actually going to improve the quality of life. We are trying to cure disease here."
But the number of Long Island biotech companies that meet Mr. Scaduto's descriptionis actually rather small. A regional economic study released last year by the New York Biotechnology Association, which has its headquarters at Stony Brook, showed that Nassau and Suffolk are home to 23 biotech companies, employing some 4,000 people.
The numbers become much larger when the industry is redefined to include companies that make vitamins, cosmetics and medical devices. Using this extended definition, Dr. Kamer, the economist, estimated in her November report that in 2001, biotech companies supported some 34,800 additional jobs in service and supplier industries, creating a payroll approaching $967 million.
Biotech advocates say that despite the industry's current doldrums, biotech is likely to rebound, and the region's biotech investment is likely to pay off handsomely down the line. "Biotech by nature has a much longer road to profitability" than many other industries, said Robert Sturm, the managing partner for Long Island technology practices at PricewaterhouseCoopers office in Jericho.
"Investors are pretty tight with their wallets right now," he added. "When investors are prepared to take long-term risks, you'll see biotech coming back."

HEADLINE: Arts Groups Balk at Dancing To McGreevey Tune on Budget 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the largest arts organization in the state, Lawrence Goldman was among a handful of leaders in the arts recently invited to Governor McGreevey's office on the day before the governor went public with his proposed budget. Mr. Goldman knew that being summoned to Trenton could mean only bad news, but no one in the room knew how bad until the governor told the group that he would recommend eliminating all state funds for arts.
 The governor's plan would disband the state Council on the Arts and its 17 employees, discontinue $18 million in grants to 700 arts groups after this year, eliminate the state Historical Commission and $4.1 million in grants to historical sites, and stop giving $10 million a year to the state's Cultural Trust, a program established under former Gov. Christie Whitman to help arts groups build up endowments to carry them in tough fiscal times. 
 If the Legislature adopts the plan, New Jersey will become the only state in the nation without an arts council, thereby risking the loss of $2 million in federal grants. 
Once Mr. Goldman and his colleagues recovered from their collective shock, the next message from Governor McGreevey, according to Mr. Goldman and others at the meeting, was something to the effect of "now go out there and turn up the volume as loud as you can."
It is this mixed message that has many in the arts community questioning whether they can take Mr. McGreevey at his word -- either his latest word on these cuts or his word from last summer, when he appeared before dozens of arts organizations and promised to be the next arts governor.
"Two weeks ago, New Jersey was esteemed in this nation as one of three or four of the most enlightened states as far as arts funding goes," Mr. Goldman said. "Now, in one blow, we are the poster boy for the idea that as soon as the going gets tough, the arts are the first to go." 
Many New Jersey artists are wondering if the governor is counting on the state's vocal and well-organized arts community to serve as a pawn, forcing the Legislature to come up with money, possibly in the form of a tax increase.
"He's telling us, 'I cut your funding, now you go out and help me,"' said John Pietrowski, the artistic director at Playwrights Theater of New Jersey in Madison. "So we have to do the dance he's asked us to do, and for an artist, it's humiliating. We're creative individuals and don't like to be told how to dance."
A spokeswoman for the governor, Ellen Mellody, attributed the move to the state's overall budget difficulties.
"It's hard to justify hanging a picture on the wall when you can't put food on the table," Ms. Mellody said. "The budget crisis in New Jersey is the most severe it's been since World War II, and the governor has been forced to cut programs that are near and dear to his heart."
She called Mr. McGreevey "an ardent supporter of the arts."
Because of the state's financial woes, most arts organizations said they had expected cuts in line with the 10 percent to 15 percent reductions in other departments, or maybe even as much as 50 percent, as was the case 12 years ago in the last fiscal crisis. But no one expected complete elimination.
"He is telling the people that his value of the arts is zero, not 20 percent, not 10 percent, but zero," said John McEwen, executive director of the New Jersey Theater Alliance. "And this was after he repeatedly said he supported the arts."
Even Secretary of State Regena Thomas, whose department oversees most of the state's arts, history and cultural programs, said she was shocked at the severity of the cuts. As the arm of government most heavily involved in grant programs, the State Department stands to suffer the highest percentage of reductions, with the governor proposing to cut 109 grant programs in all. The department would lose $42 million of its $47 million budget. 
"Other departments were hurt; we died," said Ms. Thomas, who added that she spent the Sunday night before that fateful Monday meeting at the governor's mansion earlier this month begging him to reconsider his recommendations. As a member of the governor's cabinet, however, Ms. Thomas says she understands that the state, which is facing a $5 billion budget deficit, cannot spend money it does not have.
"I'm going to do the best I can to support the governor," said Ms. Thomas, who has told members of the arts community that she will be available to "hold their hands" but not much else.
"At the end of the day, we want to be considered as doing the right thing," she added. "We're treading water. Until I am drowned, I will continue to do so."
Kimber Craine of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies holds out a ray of hope for survival of the state arts council, especially in a state as culturally rich as New Jersey.
"It hasn't happened in the past," Mr. Craine said. "And given the past history, I think it would be very difficult. The arts have tremendous grass-roots support, these agencies are really very tiny, and eliminating them wouldn't make a dent in the state budgets." 
Two other states, however, are considering similar moves, the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies says. The governor of Missouri has recommended zero financing for that state's arts council, and a legislative panel in Arizona is considering a similar reduction. 
Ms. Mellody said Governor McGreevey had invited members of the Legislature to meet with Treasury Secretary John McCormac to "show him where the money can come from" for programs they want to support.
A decade ago, after Gov. James J. Florio cut the arts budget in half, to $10 million, about 20 arts organizations went out of business and 20 more were severely compromised, according to Ann Marie Miller, executive director of ArtPride New Jersey, a statewide arts advocacy group. This time, with a proposal for no state funds, and with a weak economy, Ms. Miller predicted that hundreds of arts, history and cultural organizations could end up closing.
In addition, arts advocates argue that the effect of the proposed cuts on the state budget is minuscule, with arts funds representing less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the overall state budget. Moreover, they point out, the governor would be eliminating one of the few resources that provide revenue streams to the state. (Also being axed in the governor's proposed budget are the Motion Picture and Television Development Commission and the statewide local tourism program.)
"From an economic point of view, it is a completely illogical move," said Sharon Harrington, the chairman of the State Council on the Arts. She pointed to a recent Rutgers University study that found that arts and cultural institutions generate $1 billion in revenue and $27 million in tourism and entertainment taxes annually for New Jersey. 
"It's disrespectful of our heritage," Ms. Harrington said.
Although it is the largest single donor to the arts, the state is hoping that the private sector will pick up the slack. But large foundations, corporate and private donors have also lost assets in the current economic climate, and in many cases that has already meant has meant reduced contributions to the arts. 
An exception, the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, will slightly increase its donations to New Jersey arts this year, with $4.4 million in grants slated. After the state, it is the largest contributor to the arts in New Jersey. Like other foundations, it says the value of its portfolio has decreased, by 20 percent in the last year, according to David Grant, the executive director. But rather than cut arts contributions, the foundation has reduced its support in areas like education and the environment.
Mr. Grant says it is unrealistic to expect the private sector to fill the void left by the state's retreat.
"We were feeling that the arts groups were already under stress and needed us even before this devastating news last week," he said. "We're already filling a gap, but we have no more money to fill."
The state Council on the Arts was established in 1967 as an outgrowth of the National Endowment of the Arts, created by Congress to ensure that every state had an agency to distribute federal funds for the arts to local institutions. Today, all 50 states and 9 territories have arts councils. By eliminating its arts program, New Jersey risks losing matching grants from the national endowment, which last year awarded more than $2 million to arts organizations in the state.
With an air of uncertainty surrounding their future, arts organizations throughout the state are moving cautiously with plans for theater seasons or exhibition schedules.
Mary Sue Sweeney Price, director of the Newark Museum, is anticipating layoffs and more pressure to charge admission to the museum, which now operates on a pay-what-you-wish system. The museum receives about 25 percent of its budget from the state, based on a contractual commitment from the Legislature to support the museum after the 1967 riots. Crediting the museum not only with educating more than 500,000 people a year but also with aiding the rebirth of downtown Newark, Ms. Price said she feared the governor's plan would hurt the cities the most.
"In Newark in particular, the momentum is going to be impacted when the arts are shackled in this way," Ms. Price said. "We are the wealthiest state in the union. It is inconceivable to me that we are not going to support our arts." 
Not ones to sit on their hands, members of the arts community have sprung into action in the last three weeks to fight the proposed cuts. ArtPride, which received 1,500 e-mail messages within the first 24 hours of the governor's announcement, is organizing an editorial and letter-writing campaign. Demonstrations and marches are being planned for the months leading up to the Legislature's vote on the new budget, which must be in place by July 1.
"The governor has sent a message to us that the arts don't matter, that they are expendable and that the public is going to let this slip away," Ms. Miller said. "My response is, 'You're wrong and we want to make sure you know it."'
The day after the governor presented his budget, Jeffrey Norman, the vice president of public affairs at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, appeared on stage before a performance of "Some Like It Hot" in Prudential Hall to ask the audience to help fight the proposed cuts. Other theaters throughout the state are planning similar entreaties to their audiences.
"Anyone who comes here knows we hardly ever make curtain speeches," Mr. Norman said in an interview later. "But now we have to be vigilant. When do we stop devaluing the arts?"
The Performing Arts Center, which last year received $1.4 million from the state, will also call on its board members -- heavy-hitters like Raymond Chambers, an owner of the New Jersey Nets; Arthur F. Ryan, chief executive of Prudential; and former Gov. Thomas H. Kean -- to reach out to their friends in Trenton.
"Often times the messenger is as important as the message," Mr. Norman said. "These are people who, when they speak, people listen. They're communicating with politicians on a regular basis, so for them to say on the side 'Hey, I care about the arts' is an important message."
Governor McGreevey, himself a frequent member of the audience at the Performing Arts Center and at the New Jersey Symphony, posed recently with his wife and daughter before a wall of paintings in the State House. The photograph was to be used for the next phase of the advertising campaign called Discover New Jersey Arts. Given the recent turn of events, the governor's spokeswoman said, the ad has been placed on hold.

HEADLINE: Croatia Waiting for a European Balkans Plan 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL SIMPSON 

DATELINE: ATHENS, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
Croatia's application to join the European Union has challenged Western Europe to devise a strategy for admitting countries from the Balkans, which after a decade of wars were all promised membership one day.
 The Croatian prime minister, Ivica Racan, submitted the application on Friday during a visit to Greece, which holds the European Union's rotating presidency for the first half of this year. 
 Greece has urged its fellow member states to increase development assistance to its Balkan neighbors.
But calls from Athens for additional commitments from the European Union have met with resistance in Brussels and other Western European capitals, where some policy makers still question the decision last year to let 10 countries -- mostly former Communist states -- join the European Union in 2004. 
As the United States cuts back its commitments across the volatile Balkan peninsula, the European Union is under increasing pressure to develop more detailed plans for economic and political development than its current promise that all southeastern European countries can join eventually if they reform.
Croatia's application will be put aside for now. But the Greek foreign minister, George Papandreou, said it would stimulate debate on the broader questions involved, which will be the focus of a European Union summit meeting in Salonika, Greece, in June.
"This is a sign of the growing bond between the E.U. and the southeastern part of Europe," Mr. Papandreou said after meeting Mr. Racan. 
But officials from other member states were less enthusiastic. Even though Croatia is economically more advanced than Romania and Bulgaria, which are already candidates for European Union membership, it still has much to do to convince the outside world that it has overcome the nationalist legacy of its war of independence from Yugoslavia. 
"When they hand over the application for membership, they should also consider handing over some war criminals," a European diplomat said.
Some Balkan policy makers are concerned that a growing focus on the region's problems, from cooperation with the United Nations war crimes tribunal to the prevalence of organized crime, is distracting officials from addressing underlying economic and political issues that make these problems worse.
"Why should it be a question of focusing on one or the other?" said Alex Rondos, Mr. Papandreou's chief adviser. "Surely you can do both. The more reassuring Europe is, the easier it will be to deal with war crimes issues and other problems." 
In an effort to remind European officials that there is more to Croatia than its location and turbulent recent history, Mr. Racan submitted his official one-page application with an accompanying multimedia CD-ROM. Along with facts about the country, there were also pictures of its scenic Adriatic coast and its most famous athletes. 
The title, "RE: member Croatia," reflects a widespread sense in the Balkans that these countries have disappeared off Europe's radar screen now that they all have democratically elected governments and that open hostilities have ceased.
Aid from the European Union, which has run into billions of dollars since conflicts ripped apart Yugoslavia in the early 1990's, is scheduled to taper off in the next few years, even though the region's recent comparative stability is far from entrenched. 
Noting this fact, reports from several international research institutes have emphasized the need to increase financial assistance and to develop better incentives to encourage reforms alongside existing penalties for noncompliance.
"There's an understandable feeling in the Balkans that you only get money out of the E.U. if you start a war or you're already a candidate for membership," said a senior European Union official. "We have to do something to dispel that but we can only work with what's available."
Five Balkan presidents are meeting next month to develop a common negotiating position for the summit meeting, but with European attention focused on Iraq, major policy changes are unlikely.
"The problem," one European diplomat said, "is that the Balkans are now in the hands of middle-ranking bureaucrats who aren't decision makers and don't cut it analytically."

Raising a Glass (and Doing Some Math)

BYLINE:  By TED LOOS 

 BODY:
FOR students at Harvard Business School, accustomed to number-crunching and case studies, it may have sounded like the ultimate field trip: three days at "Cakebread U." in the Napa Valley.
 Over their winter holiday break, 10 aspiring M.B.A.'s -- all members of the school's Wine and Cuisine Society -- headed west with five friends. Jack Cakebread, the founder of Cakebread Cellars, a winery in Rutherford, Calif., had promised an introduction to the wine industry, complete with tastings and fine meals. 
 Mr. Cakebread held forth on the romance of the grape, but also on bottling and cellars. A "meet the experts" panel featured two vice presidents of American AgCredit bank, who talked about loans. 
"I expected it to be more on the wine appreciation side," said Vikram Punwani, 27, a member of the class of 2004. "But we got a lot more than that. Jack's idea was to really show us the business side in depth."
Cakebread U., which convened for the first time last month, grew out of the proprietor's hobby. For five years, Mr. Cakebread has been traveling -- to Harvard, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, Duke, Columbia, Northwestern and elsewhere -- to deliver seminars at business schools. The idea, he said, "is to entice these brilliant young people to come into the wine business."
The notion to reach out to business schools came up during a conversation in 1997 with Chuck Palombini, president of Kobrand, the company that distributes Cakebread. "At the time, the dot-commers were riding very high," Mr. Cakebread recalled. "Hundred-dollar bottles of wine were fairly frequent, and there was a great interest in wine all over."
While he does not have an M.B.A. himself, Mr. Cakebread is a member of the Napa Valley's old guard. He started his own winery for $2,500 in 1973, after running his father's auto repair shop and working as a photographer. His wines now sell for $30 to $100 a bottle.
Even in a slow economy, Mr. Cakebread's wines sell out every year. His business-school seminars have been almost as successful.
"Other than celebrities like Jack Welch, Jack's one of the top draws," said Mark Zmijewski, the deputy dean of the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business.
Mr. Cakebread, now 73, is still the chairman and chief executive of Cakebread Cellars. But several years ago, he decided he wanted to cut back on traveling, including the trips to deliver his business seminars. "I'm sitting on the plane one day," he said. "And I thought, 'Why don't they get their young bones out to my university?' "
For students, Mr. Cakebread's entrepreneurial history appears to be just as appealing as the age-old allure of wine. '
"He puts himself out in front of his product," said Aliceson Robinson, 24, also from the class of 2004.
Mr. Cakebread said he might do four programs a year, all by invitation. The next session, for students from Yale and Duke, will start on March 10. The students pay for transportation, lodging and tuition, which is $295. Mr. Cakebread said the fee did not cover all his costs.
In January, Mr. Cakebread began the class with a guided tour, a primer on how wines are made, and a panel of experts on marketing, sales, distribution and finance.
"The second day was really fun," Mr. Punwani said. "We split up, and they gave us some barrel samples. We had to blend them together and design our own wine."
After coming up with a blend -- Mr. Punwani's group named theirs Meadow Merlot -- they had to devise a business plan.
Mr. Cakebread is no softie. He found the plan of one group lacking, and said so.
"We asked how they were going to finance it," Mr. Cakebread recalled. "They said, 'Borrow $5 million from Cakebread Cellars. We'll also use Cakebread Cellars' winemaker, and its distribution system.'
"I told them: 'I think you guys failed this one. Try again.' "

HEADLINE: Twilight Of the CD? Not if ItCan Be Reinvented 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
TONIGHT in Manhattan, rock stars, divas and rappers will descend en masse on Madison Square Garden, arriving at the Grammy ceremonies in a parade of glamour and attitude. But the excitement they create will only mask the growing anxiety in the recording industry about the future of its fundamental product, the CD, which is threatened with the same obsolescence that it long ago foisted on the LP and then the tape cassette.
 Introduced in the United States 20 years ago, the CD is losing its allure. From 2001 to 2002, some 62.5 million fewer of them were sold -- a decline of 9 percent to 649.5 million, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Online swapping of songs is growing at a crippling rate, forcing almost every corner of the music industry to try to divine exactly what role, if any, the CD will play in a future dominated by Internet delivery and competition from popular new technologies like the DVD. 
 Most analysts and industry executives agree that selling music online is the future. But they say it will take at least two years for companies to devise a business plan for it that makes financial sense. In the meantime, the CD will remain the biggest source of revenue for both music retailers and recording companies, who will try to squeeze as much profit as they can out of each and every sale. 
As a result, the CD is being rethought, repackaged and, in some cases, repriced. 
Experiments to resuscitate this ailing product are growing. In January, Bon Jovi created a compact disc, with eight previously unreleased songs, exclusively for Target stores. Priced at $6.99, it was intended to help bolster sales of other Bon Jovi albums, including the newest, "Bounce."
Best Buy, the No. 1 electronics chain in the country, is selling prepaid cards good for 10 downloads that allow consumers to create compilations to play either on discs or on computers. And last year, the Interscope recording label gave a DVD to the first million buyers of "The Eminem Show" as an incentive to buy the CD.
All this is happening as the economic underpinnings of the CD continue to deterioriate, endangering the music business altogether. With the rising popularity of online music, much of it available free, technology-wise teenagers, the industry's most voracious buyers, can easily use CD-burning technology to make bootleg copies and sell them at school for as little as $1.
Companies are showing signs of cracking. Two industry veterans have recently lost their jobs: Thomas D. Mottola, the head of Sony Music Entertainment, which lost more than $132 million last year; and Jay Boberg, president of MCA Records. The music retailer Wherehouse Entertainment announced in January that it was filing for bankruptcy protection, partly because of lackluster sales. And the EMI Group, based in London, the only major music company that is not a part of a media conglomerate, is struggling with debt and is believed by analysts to be considering merger prospects.
"Large companies tend to wait until they feel pain to act," said Dan Hart, chief executive of Echo, a recently formed consortium of retailers that hope to sell music online. "Now they feel pain."
DOUG MORRIS, chief executive of the Universal Music Group, said: "We are definitely in the middle of a transition. It was always a packaged-goods business, but that is changing. We are slowly moving forward."
Compact disc sales have slipped for several reasons, not all of them related to piracy or online music swapping. Critics complain that there is a dearth of blockbuster acts these days and that those with hits, like Britney Spears, often have short-lived careers. And with the average price of a compact disc at $14.21, they contend that music is simply too expensive for frequent purchases.
But Hilary B. Rosen, chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, countered that a recent study by the association found that only 3 percent of the consumers polled said they were buying less music because prices were too high.
Still, there is no question that other activities are taking up listeners' time, thanks to the growth of electronic games and multichannel cable and satellite television. Perhaps most threatening is the popularity of the DVD, which emerged in the mid-1990's. By 1999, DVD players had gained mass-market appeal, and they now cost as little as $50, about the same price as a portable boom box. In some retail stores, DVD sales have surpassed those of CD's.
"The DVD is moving into the bedrooms of the next generation of young kids," said Gary L. Arnold, senior vice president for entertainment at Best Buy, which announced in January that it was closing 107 stores. The next generation of young people has no affinity for the compact disc. For them, he said, "it's about gaming and PlayStation."
TO thwart online swapping, several music companies, including Sony and Universal, have experimented with copy-protected compact discs, much to the ire of paying consumers, who complain that they cannot listen to some of those discs on their computers. The industry does not use a standard copy-protected format, so consumers do not know what kind of disc they are buying. Fearing a consumer backlash, the industry has slowed down those copy-protection efforts.
Software makers are trying to come up with alternatives that address the needs of both consumers and recording companies. At a recent music conference in Cannes, France, Microsoft said it had developed technology to allow music companies to record two sets of identical songs on a compact disc, one that could be played on a home or car stereo and the other, called second session, that could be copied to a personal computer. The second-session songs would have limitations, perhaps barring consumers from sharing files or copying songs onto another disc.
Recording companies probably placed too much hope on super audio CD's, which are said to have superior sound compared with regular CD's. The technology, introduced two years ago, has not taken off because super audio CD's cost nearly four times as much to buy as regular CD's -- and they require a special machine to experience the full impact.
And super audios, championed by Sony and Philips, are not alone in offering sound quality that surpasses that of the typical CD: a dueling new technology in DVD audio, supported by Panasonic and Pioneer, is setting up a battle reminiscent of the VHS-Betamax wars.
Until all these new technologies are sorted out, recording companies and retailers are betting on promotions and marketing deals to increase sales. Bruce Kirkland, a member of Bon Jovi's management team, said the album that Bon Jovi put together for Target had also increased sales of the "Bounce" album in its stores. In the first week of the promotion, Target's share of the market for "Bounce" for all retail stores jumped to 26.1 percent from 15.9 percent, he said.
"I think the onus is on the retailers to take care of this because the recording companies always shoot themselves in the foot," Mr. Kirkland said.
Mr. Arnold of Best Buy said he believed that DVD's could well replace the CD in the future because they play not only music but also video images. In the last 12 months, sales of DVD's have surpassed those of compact discs at Best Buy, he said.
But before they can become a new industry standard, he added, they will have to more adeptly meld music and video.
 MUSIC distributors and retailers, battered by the slump in compact disc sales, are embarking on their own efforts to give consumers more and easily accessible music. Last month, six music retailers, including major outlets likeBest Buy, Wherehouse and Tower Records, said they would form the Echo consortium to sell music on the Internet through their retail Web sites. As recently as a year ago, that would have been unthinkable, as retailers and music companies were at odds about how best to tackle online distribution.
In another joint effort, Anderson Merchandisers, one of the largest magazine and music distributors in the United States, bought technology from Liquid Audio, an online music pioneer that distributes 350,000 songs through retailers, in the hope of exploiting the growth in digital music.
"It has not been the norm that retailers should be the ones helping us rethink our business," said John Esposito, president of United States distribution for the Warner Music Group. "But retailers are telling us the current model does not work."
Best Buy has been one of the most active retailers in this regard. It recently began testing a program in 30 stores that allowed consumers to buy a card with a preset value that could be used to buy downloads to a computer or disc. Scott Young, vice president for digital distribution at Best Buy, said the experiment had had limited success and was under review. 
Mr. Hart of Echo said retailers would primarily seek to sell downloads over their Web sites that consumers could call up from their homes. But as well as selling digital downloads, partners of Echo are likely to explore several options, including the use of store kiosks where consumers can make personalized compact discs.
Such a venture, like any in the digital music world, is fraught with risk. In 1999, Sony Music Entertainment tried a similar strategy but consumers did not respond, analysts said.
There are, of course, other problems facing distributors and retailers, most notably acquiring the rights to distribute whole catalogs of music online. The music companies faced that issue early on, when starting their own Web sites. Competing companies declined to offer all their music on both PressPlay, a joint venture of Sony Music and Universal Music, and MusicNet, which was formed by Warner Music, EMI and BMG. It took months for them to begin sharing music, leaving consumers disillusioned and frustrated. 
For all of these ventures, companies will still have to grapple with why consumers would pay for music they can easily get free. One major retailer, according to a music executive, has suggested to several recording companies that it might put a cap on the price of any compact disc it sold in its stores. Only a store like Wal-Mart would have the strength the pull that off, he added.
"I think the biggest problem is, the industry doesn't know how to get started and take steps where you get an incremental gain," said Phil Leigh, a digital media analyst at Raymond James & Associates in Tampa, Fla. "If compact disc sales continue to drop and there is no increase in online sales, then artists will be mad and your bosses are mad, too. There is an old expression that pioneers are the ones with arrows in their backs. The one thing executives don't get paid for is rocking the boat."

What Should America Pay to Protect New York?

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AS ominous as the recent nationwide terror alerts are, New York City officials hope there is a silver lining.
 The confusion that has ensued may help the state's lawmakers and officials bolster the case they have been trying to make for months: that the city remains vulnerable and that the federal government is not doing enough about it. 
 Most of last year's debate in Congress over homeland security focused on how to rearrange the federal government to respond to terrorism. Now, lawmakers will be consumed with the thorny task of deciding where federal money for homeland security will go, as cities complain that previous promises have not been met. 
"We took a hit here for America," said New York's police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, referring to the World Trade Center. "As far as protecting for the future, so far we're going it alone."
The Democrats say the 2003 spending bill recently approved by Congress and signed by the president shortchanged the national homeland defense budget by as much as $9 billion. Up to now, according to the United States Conference of Mayors, cities have already spent more than $2.6 billion on homeland security since Sept. 11, 2001, without receiving any federal money for the effort.
Among officials in New York and the District of Columbia -- the cities that the F.B.I. said were specific targets -- the fear is that members of Congress will now be so focused on getting a share of the pie for their districts and states that they will not give enough to the places where the threat is perceived to be greatest.
"You know how things work in Washington," one New York official said. "If you give money to New York, then people in Wyoming will want the same, even though the biggest terror scare they'll experience is when Tom Ridge announces another color code change."
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York did not put it so bluntly. "It is a national problem," she said, "but there is no doubt that New York needs more than anywhere else." (On the other hand, her critics have noted that her own proposals include money for upstate communities like Poughkeepsie as well as New York City. Her office says the money would be used for security.)
Although Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg are Republicans, New York's heavily Democratic delegation in Congress finds itself in a grim position, marginalized by Republican leaders in both houses and down two seats as a result of last year's redistricting. Not only that, a stereotype of New Yorkers as greedy and pushy still seems to persist in Washington.
Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, seemed to echo that sentiment last year when he said New York politicians were engaged in a "money-grubbing game" for demanding federal aid to help New York rebuild.
But Amy Call, a spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, said that President Bush is mindful of New York City's situation, and that he followed through on his pledge to provide the city $20 billion in disaster relief aid after the terrorist attacks. 
Still, New York does bear a larger part of the continuing security burden than anyplace else. Additional security in New York during the recent terrorism alert is expected to cost the state alone at least $1 million a week. This comes during a city and state fiscal crisis that many New York officials attribute in large part to a recession induced, or at least deepened, by the terrorist attacks.
Mayor Bloomberg's administration says it expects the 2003 budget plan recently approved by Congress to provide the city with only a fraction of the $900 million that it requested for domestic defense programs.
The list of what the city says it needs is long: $100 million to train the Police Department, Fire Department and other local "first responders"; $200 million to enhance counterterrorism programs and protect landmarks like the United Nations, the New York Stock Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank; $187 million to improve security at places like police precinct stations and hospitals; $189 million for emergency response equipment; and $223 million to improve emergency communications in high-rise buildings, tunnels and the subway.
Meeting those needs is not all that New York City officials insist they have to worry about. The 2003 federal budget plan sets aside $3.5 billion in counterterrorism money for police and fire departments nationwide. But Democrats point out that a large chunk of the money is drawn from existing law enforcement and public safety programs that largely benefit big cities like New York.
"They're robbing Peter to pay Paul," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from New York. But Brian Roehrkasse, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman, responded that the package allows local governments more flexibility in how they spend the money.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Europe's Highs and Lows Depend on Where You Stand

BYLINE:  By NIALL FERGUSON; Niall Ferguson, a professor at the Stern Business School of New York University, is author of the forthcoming book, "Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power" (Basic Books).

 BODY:
"DE haut en bas" -- from high to low, or from the lofty to the lowly -- is a signature phrase of French culture. The Parisians seem to know better than anyone else in the world how to look down their noses, but when President Jacques Chirac of France poured his scorn on the governments of Eastern Europe last week, he did so from a greater than usual height.
 "Their behavior is rather irresponsible and not very polite," Mr. Chirac declared, referring to the leaders' support of the American position on Iraq. "They missed a good opportunity to keep quiet." 
 "De haut en bas," indeed. On one side, somewhere up in the Euro-stratosphere, was the president of France, one of the European Union's six founding members. Among those far beneath his gaze were the 10 Eastern European countries that technically remain mere "candidates" for membership in the European Union next year. 
And beat this for Gallic hauteur: "If they wanted to diminish their chances of joining Europe, they could not have found a better way." 
That an expression of support for the United States could provoke such an intemperate French reaction says as much about the European past as it does about European attitudes toward the future of Iraq. For centuries Western Europeans have tended to regard their Eastern neighbors with a mixture of indifference and contempt. 
If Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, delighted to find American backers in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest, makes a distinction between "new Europe" and "old Europe," Mr. Chirac sees only "haute europe" and "l'europe-bas" -- high Europe and low Europe.
In one respect, this West-East divide is based on reality. Economically, the East has long lagged behind the West, since the countries with an Atlantic seaboard discovered the joys of ocean-going commerce. As long ago as 1870, per capita incomes in Western Europe were more than double those in the East. 
History has only widened the gap. Ever since the 18th-century partition of Poland by Austria, Prussia and Russia, the Eastern Europeans have continually found their interests ignored, sacrificed or simply trodden underfoot by the wealthy West.
The prime example is the fate of Czechoslovakia in 1938 -- sold out by the Western Europeans at Munich and gobbled up by Hitler the following year. But Munich is only one chapter in a long and sorry history. 
The French love to remind the world of their sufferings in the wars of the 20th century; rather illogically (since the European Union has little to do with conflict prevention) they see the preservation of peace as the main reason for the European Union.
Yet as heavy as French casualties were in World War I -- some 3.4 percent of the prewar population -- the proportionate losses of some Eastern European countries were higher still. In the case of Serbia, for example, the figure was 5.7 percent. Romania fared as badly as France. What's more, many Eastern European countries became embroiled in the war involuntarily, as provinces of the Russian, Austrian or German Empires.
The Poles had repeatedly tried to throw off the Russian yoke, long before it took a Communist form. But time and again -- in 1830, for example, and again in 1863 -- the Western Europeans simply looked the other way. In the end, the Easterners were freed in 1917 and 1918 not by Western action but by the collapse of the empires that ruled them. 
After World War I, the Eastern Europeans sought to band together to preserve their independence with alliances like the Little Entente binding Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia in 1920. But without serious Western European military commitment, the Little Entente was about as much use against Hitler as duct tape against a dirty bomb.
The difference between East and West was even more marked in World War II. Needless to say, the French went down with scarcely a fight in 1940: mortality amounted to less than 1 percent of the prewar population. But Eastern Europe bore the brunt of total war. In Poland, nearly 19 percent of the prewar population died. In Yugoslavia the figure was close to 11 percent.
One explanation for this large difference was that in Eastern Europe defeating Hitler was left to an equally callous totalitarian regime and its Communist allies. By 1944 it was Stalin's turn to treat the Eastern Europeans as vassals. Apart from Austria and Greece, half a continent was consigned to nearly a half-century of misery behind the Iron Curtain. When Soviet tanks rolled through Budapest, Prague and Warsaw, the silence from the Western capitals was deafening. It is clear that if Mikhail S. Gorbachev had changed his mind and crushed the 1989 risings in the Eastern bloc, the Western Europeans would have done little more than murmur. 
The strangest element of last week's fracas and, in fact, of the whole trans-Atlantic rupture, is that the Western Europeans, especially the French, have the most reason to be pro-American. After all, an Anglo-American decision to treat vanquished France as one of the victors in 1945 gave the French their seat on the United Nations Security Council. Jean Monnet set about rebuilding France and uniting Western Europe with American blessings and dollars.
The world had become a very different place by the late 1980's, when the current generation of Eastern European leaders came of age. Those who dreamed of freedom found little support from the leaders of France and Germany, who were all too ready to be conciliatory toward the Communist regimes in the name of detente. It was Ronald Reagan, not Francois Mitterrand, who urged Mr. Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, just as it was Thatcherite conservatives, not German trade unionists, who rallied to the banner of Solidarity in Poland. 
Nonetheless, Americans should not make the mistake of assuming that the "new" Europeans will be uncritically pro-American. That would be to fall into the French trap of equating "new" with deferential.
There is, in fact, no shortage of popular opposition in Hungary and the Czech Republic to an Iraq war: 82 percent of Hungarians oppose it, and 47 percent of Czechs. There is also generally more support for reformed Communists in the former Eastern bloc than for advocates of the free market.
As they prepare to join the European Union, the Czechs, Hungarians, Poles, Slovenes, Slovaks and Balts are singing not "Ode to Joy," but something more like "Won't Get Fooled Again." They understand how the European Union works: as a system of agricultural protectionism and income redistribution which transfers resources from rich Germans to poorer Europeans (especially farmers). With incomes ranging from a half to a quarter of the European Union average, the Easterners would be crazy not to want to join.
But when it comes to security, Eastern Europeans look not to the European Union but to the American-led NATO. It is no coincidence that the three countries who first lined up against France last week are the new recruits to NATO: Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Nor is it surprising that the countries who followed their example a few days later were the "Vilnius 10," all of whom have applied to join NATO.
Whatever the French may say, more than one club is worth joining in Western Europe. That is why the days of "high" and "low" Europe may be ending. So profoundly has Europe been changed since 1989 that the Rumsfeldian old-new distinction is now much closer to the mark.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Welfare Wars; 
Are the Poor Suffering From Hunger Anymore?

BYLINE:  By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
THE Bush administration and Congress are giving almost every poverty program the once-over, pushing changes that will affect everything from Medicaid to housing assistance. But two programs are receiving unexpected scrutiny: food stamps and subsidized school lunches.
 Advocates for revamping those programs argue that both of them too often serve people who don't need help, and that even among those who do need help, food stamps can encourage dependency. 
 In tough economic times, limiting food aid could be a politically unpopular move. Americans typically do not regard free food as a form of welfare, and other attempts to limit it have met with mixed reactions. 
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan proposed cutting lunch portions and famously tried to have ketchup classified as a vegetable. Both ideas died after a storm of protest. (He was partly successful in reducing federal subsidies to middle-class students.) And one of the most contentious provisions in the 1996 law that overhauled welfare -- denying food stamps to noncitizen immigrants -- was largely repealed last year, with White House support.
Nevertheless, many Republicans including Representative Bob Goodlatte of Virginia, the chairman of the House Agricultural Committee, say it is now important to reconfigure the food-stamp program, which he contends is rife with fraud and ripe for innovation. There is also rising criticism from conservatives outside the administration that food programs encourage recipients to overeat.
"We are feeding the poor as if they are starving, when anyone can see that the real problems for them, like other Americans, is expanding girth," said Douglas J. Besharov, director of the American Enterprise Institute's Project on Social and Individual Responsibility. 
Food stamps are facing the most significant changes. Earlier this month, the House passed legislation with White House support that would give states more autonomy. Up to five states would be allowed to administer the programs as they saw fit, almost free of federal standards, in exchange for a freeze on financing from Washington.
Under current law, any family with an income that falls below 130 percent of poverty level is entitled to food stamps; a family of four can get as much as $465 a month, but the average grant is $185 a month. And unlike welfare, no time limit exists on how long they can collect. While the Agriculture Department says it does not track how long participants stay in the program, the conservative Heritage Foundation says its analysis of government surveys shows that half stay for extended periods, longer than eight years.
The White House says the new legislation would give states the ability to streamline disparate poverty programs. And conservatives outside the administration say food stamps have become an escape hatch for those who can, but will not, work. 
"Food stamps and cash welfare are two halves of a whole," said Robert E. Rector, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. "All the things about cash welfare that discouraged work and marriage, and encouraged long-term dependence, apply identically to food stamps." 
But opponents say Congress and the administration are using the rubric of flexibility to disguise a move to cut costs.
"Right now if the economy goes down, the federal government picks up the cost," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal Washington research group. "Under a block grant, states would get a set amount and if there are a bunch of layoffs locally the state is stuck with the bill. And if it doesn't want to pay, it can cut back on what it spends. Over time you squeeze down on what the federal government spends for the poor."
The Bush administration is also trying to tighten enforcement of the National School Lunch Program. In its budget, the administration proposes to enforce the income eligibility rules for free meals more strictly. The program has grown from serving 7.1 million lunches in all of 1947, the first year it operated, to serving 28 million students a day at a cost of $7 billion a year.
STUDENTS are eligible for a free lunch if their households earn only 130 percent of poverty level. Other children are eligible for heavily subsidized lunches if their family's income falls below 185 percent of the poverty line, or $33,400 for a family of four. The Food and Nutrition Service, which administers the lunches, estimates that as many as a quarter of children getting free lunches may come from households with incomes too high to qualify.
The administration says enforcement is a matter of fairness. "Because the information collected for school lunch eligibility is also used to allocate a wide array of federal, state and local education dollars," the budget proposal read, "errors in certifying children for school lunches can lead to a diversion of funds away from the lowest-income schools." 
In recent pilot programs in which families were asked to document household income, approval for free lunches fell by 21 percent and by 8.8 percent for reduced-price lunches. There is no estimate on how much might be saved through tighter enforcement, but the department says savings will be plowed back into other nutrition programs.
Food advocates counter that new barriers will discourage poor families from applying, and that in any case, few middle-class students are freeloading. "If it is anyone, it is people marginally above the line," said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. "It is not like you have Donald Trump's kids getting lunch."
While the Bush administration is fighting these battles, some on the right are venturing an even more delicate justification for revamping the food programs: obesity. 
In a new book, Mr. Besharov, for example, criticized the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, which provides generous food packages and nutritional counseling to seven million low-income women and children. Republicans and Democrats have praised the 30-year-old program, and the White House's new budget proposes increasing its financing by $43 million, to $4.77 billion. 
But WIC packages, Mr. Besharov says, are heavily tilted toward high-calorie foods like enriched fruit juices, cereals and peanut butter. School meals, too, he says, are heavy on starches and meat. He advocates more money spent on nutrition education -- and on fresh fruit and vegetables. 
Advocates of the poor acknowledge that obesity is a problem, but say that Mr. Besharov's formula is too simple. 
"Hunger in the U.S. is not what it was 40 years ago," concedes Jim Weill, president of the Food Research and Action Center, an advocacy group based in Washington. "Poor people are rarely hungry for 25 days a month, but resources are such that they are hungry for at least a few days." 
According to self-reported census data, 33 million Americans live in households the government identifies as "food insecure," because they occasionally miss meals and feel hungry. "The result of this insecurity," Mr. Weill said, "is that poor households can engage in binge eating and rely on high-caloric foods." 
But in that language may lie a lesson. No longer are advocates for the poor discussing "hunger," with its dire implications, but "insecurity," a more nuanced, less compelling justification for help. If conservatives have got food advocates to concede this much, perhaps they have already won Round 1 of the battle.

HEADLINE: Policy Shapers, Well Known and Little Known 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
The cast of officials who help to shape President Bush's environmental policies spans a wide range, from a former New Jersey governor whom environmentalists see as their closest ally to a former Colorado attorney general who was a protege of James Watt, the Reagan-era interior secretary.
 It also includes figures little known to the public, like James L. Connaughton, the chairman of Mr. Bush's Council on Environmental Quality. A Washington lawyer whose practice focused on environmental matters, Mr. Connaughton now acts as Mr. Bush's top White House adviser on the environment, and is a coordinator whose job in part is to referee disputes among the federal agencies. 
 Christie Whitman, the former governor turned administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, is the best known among the group, in part because as early as the mid-1990's, her reputation as a rising star in the Republican Party earned her frequent mentions as a potential vice presidential candidate.
Mrs. Whitman has frequently been overruled by more conservative voices in the administration, most notably over policies on global warming, but she has dashed speculation that she might resign in protest, saying she remains proud of Mr. Bush's environmental record. More recently, she has begun to call attention to fights she has won. For example, she has said that she headed off an effort by others in the administration that could have led to a much broader scaling back of Clean Water Act protections for wetlands.
Gale A. Norton, the interior secretary, worked under Mr. Watt early in her career, and like him is an ardent champion of the view that the wisest use of public lands includes using them to extract natural resources. As interior secretary, she oversees one-fifth of the territory of the United States -- including, as she pointed out in an interview, the land that produces one-third of the country's energy. She has been the administration's most outspoken advocate for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling.
Unlike her mentor, however, Ms. Norton is also an outdoors enthusiast, and she portrays herself as both a conservative and a conservationist.
"We think we can get beyond the minimum standards enforced by punishment if you actively involve people in becoming citizen stewards," Ms. Norton said. "We really want to see people active in helping our public lands and in encouraging conservation on private lands."
The principal players include several others, among them Ann M. Veneman, the agriculture secretary. Ms. Veneman oversees the Forest Service, whose policies on road building, fire prevention and logging have been at the center of several disputes. Another important figure is John D. Graham, a senior official of the Office of Management and Budget with responsibility for federal regulations.
Though less visible than the others, Mr. Graham has wielded increasing influence by scrutinizing environmental regulations to ensure that the benefits they bring can justify their cost to the American economy. A former Harvard professor, Mr. Graham is seen by environmental groups as a particular threat because his arguments have in the past provided an intellectual rationale for the weakening of environmental regulations.

HEADLINE: Power and Leadership; 
The Real Meaning of Iraq

 BODY:
The debate over Iraq has exhausted everybody. Many people now think an American invasion is inevitable; many more are desperate just to get whatever happens over. There's nothing less satisfying than calling for still more discussion.
 But that's right where this page is. More discussion is the only road that will get the world to the right outcome -- concerted effort by a wide coalition of nations to force Saddam Hussein to give up his weapons of mass destruction. We need another debate. Another struggle to make this the United Nations' leadership moment. 
 Right now, things don't look promising for those of us who believe this is a war worth waging, but only with broad international support. The United States has an invasion force in place, and the military's schedule seems to demand that it attack within a few weeks before spring brings on withering desert heat. Washington has some support among other nations, but many of them are newcomers to the world of high-stakes diplomacy and few have much to offer in the way of troops or financial support. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, America's only strong and consistent ally among the world's other major military powers, is facing fierce opposition at home and ridicule abroad for his allegiance to the Bush administration. Turkey, another important ally, held out for more money as it considered whether to allow American invasion forces on its soil. The size of the Turkish demands made the anti-Iraq forces look less like a serious coalition than a diplomatic version of "Let's Make a Deal."
Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, has been skillful at providing the pretense of progress to international inspectors without seriously cooperating. Iraq has drawn the United Nations into a game of find the handkerchief, in which the burden is on the inspectors to track down mobile laboratories or sniff out hidden weapons. All this puts an enormous weight on what Iraqi behavior Hans Blix, the chief U.N. inspector, chooses to stress -- whether he dwellson Iraqi resistance or points to areas of cooperation. In the United Nations, the equivalent of a C-minus for effort on a Blix report can be taken as an argument for peace, while a D-plus can be seen as a call to war. The inspectors should never be put in the position of deciding international foreign policy.

A Case for Action
While the possibility of Mr. Hussein experiencing a last-minute conversion seems minuscule, there is one quick way to test whether it's possible. Iraq has Al Samoud 2 missiles, weapons it built at great expense and effort. Mr. Blix has already stated that they are too powerful, able to travel too far to fit under the limits set by the United Nations after the Persian Gulf war. On Friday, Mr. Blix told the Iraqis to start destroying them by March 1.
This week the Security Council should reaffirm Mr. Blix's order and tell Mr. Hussein he must get rid of his missiles immediately, or outside forces will do it for him, with the support of the international community. That clear message would resolve the most frustrating problem for those who want the United Nations to nail down its position as the arbiter of world crises -- how to get France and its supporters to define their own bottom line rather than simply criticizing Washington's.
Saddam Hussein is nobody's hero in this story. Although many Americans are puzzled about why the Bush administration chose to pick this fight now, it's not surprising that in the wake of Sept. 11, the president would want to make the world safer, and that one of his top priorities would be eliminating Iraq's ability to create biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. Of all the military powers in the world, Iraq is the one that has twice invaded its neighbors without provocation and that has used chemical weapons both on its military foes and some of its own restive people. North Korea may be a greater danger, but North Korea has not been told by the United Nations to disarm and stay disarmed. And, although the administration is careful to steer clear of this argument, the very fact that North Korea has the international community in a bind is a cautionary tale for making sure that no other despotic governments run by irrational adventurers get hold of nuclear arms.

A Game of Chance
Many foreigners, and large numbers of Americans, wonder whether this administration is capable of dispassionate judgment as it relentlessly pushes for war. All too often, American officials have undermined their own case by demonstrating reckless enthusiasm for a brawl, denigrating allies who fail to fall in line or overstating their case against Iraq, particularly when it comes to a link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda. But to his credit, President Bush worked hard to achieve the unanimous support of the Security Council for Resolution 1441, and more broadly to make his case before the United Nations and the world. This may be an administration intent on making war, but so far it has also shown itself willing to give the United Nations both time and space to make up its mind.
It seems clear to us that the United Nations should enforce its own orders and make Iraq disarm, even if that requires force. But in the end, sometime in March, the United States may have to decide whether it should do the job on its own.
When that happens, the arguments on both sides are sure to be couched in the highest moral principles. But the real calculations will be entirely about the odds of succeeding. If military victory over Iraq is swift, and if it can be accomplished without extensive casualties toAmerican soldiers or Iraqi civilians or damage to neighboring countries or the area's oil fields, Mr. Bush's popularity will soar. If occupation forces unearth proof of a large nuclear program, stockpiles of terrifying biological weapons and real evidence of serious collusion between Saddam Hussein and international terrorists, many of the international leaders who are riding the crest of anti-Americanism now will start looking very foolish.
But things could go terribly wrong, very quickly. The war could be brutal and protracted, especially if Mr. Hussein unleashes biological or chemical weapons against Israel or American troops. He may also succeed in setting fire to his oil wells, or disabling those in neighboring countries, crippling the world economy. And if he is destroyed, there is every possibility of a vicious struggle for the lucrative spoils among the disparate clans and ethnic groups in Iraq, drawing in Turkey, Iran and others. In the chaos, the weapons of mass destruction Americans went to war to eliminate could wind up being ferried out of Iraq and sold to the highest terrorist bidder. And just as the American military's presence in Saudi Arabia during the gulf war precipitated the growth of Al Qaeda and Sept. 11, the long-term occupation of Iraq will create resentment in the Muslim world that could lead to more, not less, terrorism.

The Long Haul
All those risks, we repeat, are worth taking in the context of a broad international coalition, and some might even be diminished if the world acts together. The country is still traumatized by the discovery on Sept. 11, 2001, that we live in a world of unimaginable danger. Some of our traditional allies knew that already, from long and terrible experience. Some are still trying to face up to it. But the rational response is to work together to make the world safer, not to ignore obvious dangers in hope that the likely will not become inevitable.
Our own guess, when we calculate the odds in Iraq, is that the war is likely to go well in the short run, but that the long run will be messy, difficult and dangerous. If America acts virtually on its own, it is hard to imagine either the Bush administration or the American people having the staying power to make things right. Washington may be counting on Iraq's oil revenue to pay for rebuilding the country after the war, but the oil wells could be damaged in the fighting. It seems certain that an administration that will not give up tax cuts to pay for the war itself is not going to inflict economic pain at home to pay for the cleanup. And while Americans have always shown themselves willing to risk anything, even their own children, for a critical cause of high purpose, their support for this particular fight is thin as a wafer and based on misapprehension that Iraq is clearly linked to terrorism.

Our Bottom Line
When all the odds are calculated, people will have their own particular critical concerns that add weight to one side of the scale or the other. For some, it is the belief that rogue nations can be deterred -- a certainty that if they use their worst weapons, the United States and its allies will pay them back, double. While the evidence that Saddam Hussein has used chemical weapons in battle with Iran, and against his own Kurdish population, is strong, the fact that he has not used similar weapons in other situations, including the gulf war, suggests that deterrence should not be dismissed.
For others, the bottom line will come down to saving face. The United States has assembled its forces for invasion,and to back down now, many argue, will be to show a weakness that will encourage our enemies. We don't think the world's only surviving superpower should be making war to avoid embarrassment.
Our own overriding concern runs in the other direction. The United States is, and seems likely to remain, a nation whose military might and economic power so outstrip any other country that much of the world has begun comparing it to ancient Rome. The test now is whether we will find a new way to exercise our power in which leadership, self-discipline and concern for the common good will outweigh our smaller impulses. An invasion of Iraq that is not supported by many traditional allies, or those powers that we need to be allied with in the best possible future, will send a message that we can do whatever we want. But it is not going to make the rest of the world want to root for us to succeed. The real test of American leadership is only incidentally about Iraq. It is whether we will further split the world into squabbling camps, united only by their jealousy of our power, or use our influence to unite it around a shared vision of progress, human rights and mutual responsibility.

HEADLINE: Governors, Hurting Financially, Ask Washington for Assistance 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
Leaders of the National Governors Association, experiencing fiscal problems unmatched since World War II, cried out today for help from the federal government as they opened their winter meeting here.
 Gov. Paul E. Patton of Kentucky, a Democrat who is chairman of the association, said that even after making cuts in many programs, states still faced a $30 billion gap between their revenues and their spending commitments this year. Governors, he said, anticipate a shortfall of $82 billion in the coming fiscal year, which starts in July for most states. 
 Since most states are forbidden to run deficits, Mr. Patton said, they have begun to cut services, and some have raised taxes, even as President Bush tries to stimulate a sluggish economy by cutting federal taxes.
"When states stop spending and increase taxes," Mr. Patton said, "it goes directly counter to the administration's effort to stimulate the economy by increasing spending and cutting taxes."
Explosive growth in health costs are a major reason for the states' fiscal problems. Mr. Bush recently asked Congress to revamp Medicaid, to give states more freedom to limit costs, benefits and eligibility for some recipients. 
Gov. Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, a Republican who is vice chairman of the association, said, "I am encouraged by the administration's proposal to reform Medicaid and give states more flexibility." Mr. Kempthorne said federal officials had invited governors to "help design the reforms," suggesting that the administration would not insist on all the details it set forth in the last three weeks.
Mr. Kempthorne advocated two changes that would give states more fiscal relief than anything proposed by Mr. Bush. Medicaid is financed jointly by the federal government and the states, so, for example, if Idaho cuts state Medicaid spending by $1, the federal Treasury saves about $2.
Governor Kempthorne said that if states find ways to save money in Medicaid, they should be allowed to keep the federal money that would otherwise have been spent on their Medicaid recipients.
In addition, Mr. Kempthorne and other governors said the federal government should, through Medicare, assume the entire cost of providing health care to low-income elderly people on Medicaid. More than six million people are eligible for both programs. 
Governors said their fiscal problems had forced them to freeze or cut many programs, including spending for schools, colleges and prisons. 
Governor Patton said he had prematurely released 900 felons from state prisons, reduced services for some Medicaid beneficiaries and cut the state budget for elementary, secondary and higher education.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: INSIDE BASEBALL; 
An Audience for 31 Years of Fulminations

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Updating the age-old question about a tree falling in the forest, if no one ever listened to or quoted George Steinbrenner on his critical comments about his players, would anyone miss them?
 In his 31st year in Major League Baseball, Steinbrenner has commanded everyone's attention this winter by resurrecting a tactic he employed regularly before the Yankees ran off four World Series championships in five years. He has singled out one of the Yankees' star players for criticism. 
 This is not a new act. Derek Jeter is not the first player who cashes Steinbrenner's hefty paychecks to feel the sting of the owner's public barbs. But winning had deprived Steinbrenner of a target for his act as Phineas T. Bluster. Hence, the overreaction to his Jeter jaunt. 
It is something like this era's hitters. They have grown up without pitchers throwing inside to them and are therefore unaccustomed to those pitches, so when the exception to the rule fires a high hard one, or even a middle hard one, the batter takes offense and instantly lashes out at the pitcher by screaming at him or charging the mound.
Jeter has had a charmed career, playing shortstop for the Yankees only during their current championship era. He is too young to have experienced the verbal abuse Steinbrenner heaped upon his predecessors, Reggie Jackson, for example, in 1981, and Dave Winfield throughout his nine years in New York.
Not that they and their fellow targets refrained from reacting to Steinbrenner's criticism, but when they did, they were in the early stages of his practice. In 2003, this Steinbrenner shtick is old. It should be ignored.
If Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, saw that his attacks were disappearing into a verbal void, he might abandon them and develop a new act. The problem is, players won't ignore his comments because they gain widespread dissemination. 
This veteran of the Steinbrenner era knows that the news media find him and his comments irresistible. One obscure moment from Steinbrenner's Yankees history is telling.
On Dec. 6, 1983, baseball executives and owners were gathered in Nashville at the winter meetings. Steinbrenner wasn't there yet, but his arrival was eagerly anticipated. 
Billy Martin was the reason. Uncharacteristically, Steinbrenner had procrastinated about Martin's managerial future, and the baseball world was waiting to learn what he would do. Speculation was rampant that Yogi Berra would replace Martin. If it happened, it would be Martin's third departure as the Yankees manager in less than six years.
Word of the estimated time of Steinbrenner's arrival spread throughout the press corps, whose members began massing in the lobby well before he was expected to walk through the revolving door of the Opryland Hotel.
Given Steinbrenner's routine, it was virtually certain that he would say nothing about his manager when he arrived. Yet no one left the lobby.
The plane was delayed, but the large group of reporters waited and waited and waited. Nothing was going to budge them. They waited this long; they would wait longer. Finally, shortly before 10 p.m., Steinbrenner walked through the revolving door. He went to the desk to get a key to his room -- he had been checked in -- and as soon as he turned to walk away from the desk, he was mobbed. Without pausing for even an instant, he walked through the crowd and said: "I'm not going to have anything to say. I'm too tired. I've had a rough day."
Nothing would have been lost then if no one had waited for Steinbrenner, and nothing would be lost now if no one listened to Steinbrenner's criticism of his players. 
Jeter initially said he would not respond to the owner's remarks, then changed his mind. He responded first nationally to The Associated Press, then held a news conference on Monday.
Not everyone has been overcome by the Steinbrenner-Jeter exchange, hanging on their every word.
"It's crazy," a longtime Yankees fan said. "It's nothing. It's a nonstory."
But plenty of people are still listening.

Hollow Words of Confidence
As long as people are paying attention to George Steinbrenner, on the other hand, they should note what he said about Joe Torre's job as manager: "He's as safe as any manager in baseball."
Now that statement should make Torre feel pretty good, right? Well, maybe not as good as his three-year, $16 million contract -- he's in the second year. But since the manager likes his job, he should welcome Steinbrenner's words. On the other hand, recall these famous last words uttered by Steinbrenner.
Speaking about Bob Lemon before the 1982 season: "There will be no change this year. I wouldn't care how the team is doing."
Lemon was fired 14 games into the season.
Speaking about Yogi Berra before the 1985 season: "Yogi will be the manager this year. I said the same thing last year; I'm saying it again this year. A bad start will not affect Yogi's status."
Berra was fired 16 games into the season.

Umpires vs. Computers
In one of a series of meetings today, umpires will have a briefing on the results of a study made by their lawyers and independent scientists of the QuesTec computerized system by which baseball says it will evaluate umpires and their ball-and-strike calls. The umpires intend to fight that plan.
"The difference between this year and last," Larry Gibson, one of the umpires, said, "is last year umpires suspected the system wasn't reliable; now they know it isn't reliable. It's not against technology. It's bad technology."
But some umpires believe there are worse problems than QuesTec. "QuesTec is a machine," Jerry Crawford, the last president of the old union, said. "They were looking for accountability. They're using that as an outlet for accountability."
What concerns Crawford more, he said, is the absence of a relationship between the umpires and baseball officials.
"No matter which side you're on," he said, "you have to have a relationship with baseball. If you don't contact them, you won't have any relationship. Whatever the relationship was between baseball and Richie Phillips, Richie always maintained contact no matter what the situations were."
Phillips was the old union's lawyer and chief negotiator. He lost his position when a dissident faction of umpires, dissatisfied with his leadership, won a certification vote. The leaders of the new union thought they would have a more harmonious relationship with baseball officials, but it hasn't worked out that way.
The relationship is as contentious as it ever was under Phillips.
"You have people you're supposed to be dealing with and I don't think right now the leadership is dealing with them," Crawford said.
The final meeting on today's schedule is aimed at trying to bring together the two groups of umpires: the 45 union members and the 23 nonmembers.

Miller Is a Candidate
Billy Martin, Whitey Herzog, Dick Williams? Walter O'Malley, August Busch Jr., Charles O. Finley? Marvin Miller, Bowie Kuhn?
How many of these managers, owners and executives, if any, will be voted into the Hall of Fame when the results of the voting by the newly constructed veterans committee are announced Wednesday?
These eight candidates are among the 15 on a composite ballot of nonplayers. The players ballot has 26 candidates. Any candidate who receives 75 percent of the votes cast will be inducted into the Hall next summer.
Miller, who made a huge impact on the game as the players' labor leader, is the most intriguing one on the ballot because in the 20 years since he retired as executive director of the players association he had never been considered for the Hall.
Assuming all 84 voters cast ballots, 63 votes will be needed for election. Of the 58 Hall of Fame members on the committee, 41 played after Miller became the union chief. If all 41 voted for Miller, either because of his impact or what he did for their bank accounts, he would need 22 other votes from the remaining 17 Hall of Famers, who include four managers who benefited economically from Miller's efforts, and 26 other committee members.
Miller at one time scoffed at the thought that he would one day be in the Hall of Fame, but he has acknowledged since being nominated that he would be delighted to gain entry.

HEADLINE: On Environmental Rules, Bush Sees a Balance, Critics a Threat 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
For two years, it has come in bursts, on issues from arsenic to wetlands: the unfolding of what President Bush, as a candidate, promised would be a new era of environmental protection.
 Whether rejecting a treaty on global warming, questioning Clinton-era rules on forest protection or pressing for changes in landmark environmental laws, Mr. Bush has imposed a distinctive stamp on a vast landscape of issues affecting air, water, land, energy and the global climate. 
 What has emerged is an approach similar to President Ronald Reagan's. It seeks to tie environmental protection to other goals that are not always complementary, like economic growth, protection from regulation, increased energy production and deference to local control.
"Our approach is to maximize the quality of life for America," said James L. Connaughton, chairman of Mr. Bush's Council on Environmental Quality, "and that means balancing the environmental equation with the natural resource equation, the social equation and the economic equation." 
Much of what Mr. Bush has done has the potential to be far-reaching, including some significant rethinking of laws that date as far back as the Nixon administration and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.
He has proposed new flexibility in the enforcement of the 1972 Clean Air Act to allow old coal-fired power plants, the country's biggest polluters, to modernize without meeting present-day standards and to trade the right to pollute among themselves.
He has opened more public land to energy explorationand is seeking to open more, particularly in Alaska, because of the view that federal lands are underused as a source of natural resources, and that increased American oil and gas production is the best way to ease dependence on foreign supplies.
And in the arena of global warming, Mr. Bush has ruled out mandatory controls on American emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, the man-made component of climate change, in favor of voluntary measures that he says can address the problem without imposing a crippling economic cost.
Many of these policies are being put into effect not by changing laws but through the less visible realm of regulation. 
Mr. Bush and his senior advisers say they are demonstrating that it is possible to have the best of two worlds -- that "strong economic growth and strong environmental protection go hand in hand," as a White House report put it last fall.
But much of what the White House has called progress has been labeled by critics, Republicans as well as Democrats, as examples of significant retreat. The White House proposals, given names like Healthy Forests and Clear Skies, have been derided as promoting exactly the opposite of what they proclaim.
"Across the board," said Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont independent who until recently was the chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, "we would be better off doing nothing than doing what the Bush administration wants to do, which will make things worse than they already are." 
Mr. Connaughton of the environmental council dismissed such critics as "one-note Nellies of regulate, litigate, re-regulate, litigate," adding, "We came into office saying we have a much broader toolbox of policy tools to use."
Protecting the environment is an important issue to the suburban swing voters whose allegiance is sought by both political parties, so it is not surprising that the White House takes pains to cast its actions as environmentally friendly.
But the disconnect between this administration's claims and those of its critics has been particularly profound. Some environmental organizations regularly denounce the president's actions as representing the biggest setback in a generation.
The Natural Resources Defense Council, for example, described Mr. Bush's policy on the environment in a recent report as a "fundamental threat more sweeping and dangerous than any since the dawn of the modern environmental movement in 1970."
How, then, to sort out the rival assessments on issues so complicated that they are commonly referred to in shorthand, by names like Kyoto, Superfund and ANWR?
By one gauge, which would see the federal government as the environment's policeman, the Bush administration has fallen short of its predecessor, with enforcement actions and fines down by at least 30 percent. 
By another, measuring fealty to landmark laws like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, the administration has not held the past sacrosanct, proposing or enacting changes that would, at the very minimum, make existing standards more flexible.
But administration officials, including Christie Whitman, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, reject these measures as inappropriate and inconsistent with the administration's approach. The only fair test, Mrs. Whitman said in a recent interview, would ask: "Is the air cleaner, is the water purer, is the land better protected?"
On that score, the picture is not yet clear. The most objective gauges are not always up to date. Some of the administration's most important proposals have not yet been enacted, and some changes are too recent to have had a measurable impact.
But in five major areas of environmental protection -- air, water, land, energy and global climate -- it is possible to summarize the major changes during Mr. Bush's two years in office, and to compare that record with the administration's own declared standard of how it should be judged.

The Air
Nontraditional Ideas, Mixed Responses
In combating air pollution, the Bush administration has in some ways picked up where its predecessors left off, further tightening rules under the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants.
The diesel engines that power big trucks and off-road vehicles will become subject to ever stricter pollution control regulations in the next decade, under rules the Bush administration made final, thus closing loopholes that had left some of the country's dirtiest vehicles less regulated than ordinary automobiles.
In his approach to pollution from power plants, however, Mr. Bush has proved less traditional -- and, not surprisingly, more controversial.
In one of his most closely watched decisions, Mr. Bush would allow electric utilities to upgrade old, dirty, coal-fired power plants without having to install costly new state-of-the-art pollution control devices. That stand, proposed as a federal rule, would affect a part of the Clean Air Act known as new source review, which was intended to accelerate the phase-out of the old plants.
A separate plan, known as Clear Skies, would seek to cut emissions of three major pollutants from all power plants 70 percent by 2018, but would not impose the standard uniformly, allowing operators to trade "pollution credits" -- the right to pollute -- among themselves.
The White House cites the Clear Skies proposal as the prime example of an innovative approach, one that it said last fall would "bring cleaner air to Americans faster, more reliably and more effectively than under current law." But the response to both approaches has been mixed.
The existing new source review rules require that modifications to old power plants and other industrial sites include upgrades to modern antipollution standards. Even the most ardent environmentalists concede that those rules are flawed, and have left power plant operators with little incentive to clean up their oldest, dirtiest facilities. And the shift under the Clear Skies plan toward a market-based approach to cutting power plant emissions, instead of one that depends solely on inflexible regulations, has won praise from some environmental groups.
But Senator Jeffords and other critics say they are convinced that the two initiatives would ultimately lead to more pollution, not less. They say the best way to reduce air pollution would be to hold polluters to the strict terms of existing laws, not change them.
Nine Northeastern states have filed lawsuits in an effort to block the new rules on power plant upgrades.
"You're carving a big hole in the Clean Air Act, and history has shown that given the option to avoid spending the money on pollution control, these old coal-fired plants will take the step of evading those controls," said Gregory Wetstone, director of advocacy for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Is the air cleaner? Probably. By most broad measurements, air quality across the United States is better today than at any time in the last three decades.
The White House and its critics attribute that result to the Clean Air Act, which the administration says it is merely trying to improve.
"The air, along with every other aspect of the environment, is getting cleaner," said William L. Kovacs, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, which represents business interests and has been broadly supportive of Mr. Bush's environmental record. "I think that has been a true statement for the last 30 years, and it will continue to be. I think Bush has been continuing along that path."

The Water
Defining Wetlands And Other Challenges
One enduring impression of the Bush administration's approach to clean water was left by its decision, in its early days, to scrap a standard proposed by the Clinton administration that imposed a strict new limit on arsenic in drinking water.
The decision set off a political furor, and Democrats seized upon it as evidence that the president was insensitive to public health. Ultimately, the Bush administration reinstated the Clinton standard, after determining that it met cost-benefit tests. But the example became the fodder of late-night talk shows and an early political embarrassment for the White House. 
Administration officials nonetheless say their stance reflects a willingness to challenge orthodoxies in considering when and whether environmental regulation is justified.
"You can't ignore cost-benefits," Mrs. Whitman said in the interview. But, she added: "The difficulty starts with the fact that the environment evokes such emotion in people. There's one group for whom you can never do enough, and another group for whom any time you put out a regulation, you're getting in the way of progress."
Across the broad spectrum of water issues, the administration's environmental policies have met with both kinds of criticism.
Most significantly, the administration decided last month to address a 2001 Supreme Court decision by beginning its own effort to redraw the definition of what constitutes a federally protected swamp, marshland or other wetland area. The review could open up vast swatches of land for development, resulting in a 20 percent shrinkage of federal wetland acreage.
Administration officials have called the action a necessary and measured response to the court ruling, which said a previous interpretation of what land was protected under the Clean Water Act had overreached.
But critics have said the approach could undermine an important provision of the act. They particularly fear that the administration may use the Supreme Court's decision as an excuse to give up authority over tens of millions of acres of wetlands and streams that the decision did not raise questions about.
"A lot of what can be phrased as flexibility is just saying that industry or states can do whatever they want," said Tim Searchinger, a senior lawyer with Environmental Defense, an advocacy group.
In one notable environmental effort, in the Hudson River, the administration bucked an industry lobbying campaign and has pursued an orthodox approach to pollution. It forced General Electric to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to clean waters it had fouled, one of the largest industrial cleanups in American history. 
The administration has also declined to endorse several large Army Corps of Engineers projects that critics see as particularly destructive to the environment.
More broadly, however, the main thrust has been in pursuit of a flexibility that the administration says will result in greater cost savings and efficiency but that critics say might simply move pollution around. 
A water quality trading program introduced last year by the Environmental Protection Agency and aimed at cleaning up rivers, lakes and streams would allow states, tribes and companies to buy and sell pollution credits for water, in a market-based approach that the agency has used successfully in the effort to combat acid rain.
Is the water purer? On that front, the picture is unclear. The agency's most recent water quality report, issued in 2000, the year Mr. Bush was seeking the presidency, showed that the percentage of assessed waters that were polluted had increased to 45 percent in 2000 from 40 percent in 1998, and there is no clear indication of whether this has been reversed.

The Land
Easing Barriers To Development
On issues affecting land, the main thrust of the Bush administration's approach has been to emphasize that conservation should not bar use.
In its policies on forests, endangered species and energy exploration, the administration has generally sought to scale back barriers to logging, drilling, mining and other kinds of development. It argues that previous administrations had put too much public land off limits for reasonable purposes.
"We are managing our lands for the needs of the American public; part of that is managing for environmental protection," Gale A. Norton, the interior secretary, said in a recent interview. At the same time, she added, "We also need to look for those things that serve the American public."
Some of the notable examples of this approach have occurred in regard to the national forests, where the administration strongly resisted a sweeping Clinton administration action putting millions of acres of forests off limits to road building. The road building ban was reinstated late last year by a federal appeals court, but the administration's lack of support has left those protections vulnerable to efforts by Congress to narrow their scope.
Separately, in proposed legislation known as Healthy Forests, now before Congress, the administration has pressed to ease barriers to logging as a method of fire prevention. The central purpose of the initiative -- thinning overgrown Western forests that are prone to catastrophic fire -- has broad support from environmentalists and from the timber industry. But the environmentalists say it allows too much latitude for the removal of large trees that provide important habitat.
At the same time, in several little-noticed court cases brought by developers, the administration has agreed to settlements that have significantly shrunk the areas that federal agencies had claimed as the critical habitats of endangered species.
In pursuit of energy, the administration has also opened the way to increased oil and gas exploration on public lands, particularly in Colorado and Utah. It has sought to do the same in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, known as ANWR, a proposal that has met fierce political resistance and that Congress has declined to approve.
Notably, though, the administration on two occasions scaled back drilling plans for offshore areas near the Florida coast, on the ground that local opposition (including that from Mr. Bush's brother Gov. Jeb Bush, who was running for re-election at the time) made the exploration unwise.
A broader and potentially more significant change is only beginning to take shape. In a series of directives and other initiatives affecting plans for logging, highway construction and other activities, the administration has sought to streamline the review process required under the National Environmental Policy Act.
The administration says those efforts are intended only to remove unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, but critics say they would weaken a main pillar of environmental law.
Is the land better protected? Across the board, the administration's proposals would allow greater access to public lands for the extraction of natural resources. The White House says that this is among the lands' many uses, and that its plans are environmentally sensible, while its opponents say the land would be despoiled.

Energy
Blueprint for Change With Many Critics
Mr. Bush said soon after taking office that his goal was to reduce the country's dependence on foreign oil, to increase domestic production and to make energy cleaner and more affordable for all Americans. None of these things has happened.
The country still imports nearly 60 percent of its oil, close to a record. American oil and gas production have remained flat, gasoline and heating fuel prices have been high, and renewable fuels still account for less than 4 percent of American consumption.
The White House argues that it deserves credit for trying.
With the National Energy Plan it released in the spring of 2001, it produced a broad blueprint for change, including the call for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But that proposal and others have not been acted on by Congress.
"We have worked to enhance traditional energy sources as well as to identify new sources," Ms. Norton said. "There's a long lead time in all of this, and the fact that it takes a while means that we are going about it responsibly."
Aides to Mr. Bush also call attention to his support for energy efficiency, in part through tightened federal standards for refrigerators and other appliances. 
Mr. Bush has proposed a modest increase in fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, which would be the first since 1985. In his most recent State of the Union address, he promised more federal money to promote production of hydrogen-powered cars. But that plan does not envision mass production until 2020.
The president's critics say he set his sights on the wrong goal. Instead of focusing on increasing domestic production, they say, he should have aimed at reducing American energy consumption through increased conservation.
The critics say the increase of 1.5 miles per gallon Mr. Bush has proposed in the corporate fuel economy standard is far too little -- particularly when more people are driving sport utility vehicles and reducing dependence on foreign oil is a national security consideration.
They say the White House should do far more to encourage a switch to renewable fuels, like wind power.
"The president simply hasn't been willing to cross his political backers and push hard for the rapid deployment of more fuel-efficient cars, cleaner power sources and more energy-conserving buildings," said Dan W. Reicher, an assistant secretary of energy in the Clinton administration.
More broadly, the critics argue that Mr. Bush's focus on energy production has caused him to pay too little attention to global warming and to the emission of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, its chief man-made cause.
In 2001, Mr. Bush based his decision to reject the Kyoto treaty, which called for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, primarily on economic grounds, saying that compliance with the treaty could stifle growth.
The voluntary measures he has proposed since then would aim only to slow the rate at which American emissions of greenhouse gases increase, rather than to reduce them or cap them at current levels, unless further revelations from research clarify the severity of the environmental risks.
In addressing another international climate treaty, Mr. Bush has also sought more latitude for American industry. The administration is requesting exemptions for 54 companies and trade groups that want to continue using a pesticide scheduled to be phased out by 2005 under the Montreal Protocol of 1987, a treaty intended to protect the ozone layer.
Administration officials defend these policies and others as reflecting the kind of balance Mr. Bush is determined to strike.
"The president does have a fundamental difference of opinion with some others," said Mr. Connaughton, the chairman of the White House environmental council, "and it is that you can't have the kind of environmental improvements that Americans now demand without a growing economy that pays for the improvements. "

GRAPHIC: STATUS: A district court in Idaho blocked the ban in May 2001, but a federal appeals court reinstated it in December 2002. GLOBAL WARMING March 13, 2001Reversing a campaign promise, President Bush says he will not regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Days later, the administration rejected the Kyoto treaty on global warming. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Regulating carbon dioxide would have been a mistake during a national energy crisis that caused electricity prices to soar. OPPOSITION VIEW: Reducing carbon dioxide emissions should be mandatory, not voluntary, with measures enacted in partnership with countries that have already signed the Kyoto treaty. There never was a national energy crisis; the surge in California electricity prices was the temporary result of a bad deregulation plan and market manipulation. STATUS: The administration has called for voluntary cuts in emissions until 2012; it will consider other measures if additional science finds higher risks. ARSENIC IN DRINKING WATER March 20, 2001The Environmental Protection Agency says it will abandon a Clinton-era rule that would have reduced the allowable amount of arsenic in drinking water to 10 parts per billion, from 50. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The E.P.A. administrator, Christie Whitman, said the standard should be less than 50 p.p.b., but the scientific indicators are unclear as to whether the standard needs to go as low as 10 p.p.b. Local water districts complained of the high costs of tighter standards. OPPOSITION VIEW: A 1999 study by the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the acceptable levels of arsenic be lowered as promptly as possible. STATUS: After a public outcry, the administration asked the academy for a new review, then reinstated the Clinton standard. ARCTIC DRILLING May 16, 2001The administration proposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: Drilling in the refuge could produce up to 16.5 billion gallons of oil without undue damage to the environment. OPPOSITION VIEW: The refuge has one billion to five billion gallons of economically recoverable oil -- a six-month supply. Exploration would inevitably do permanent damage to a pristine ecosystem. STATUS:Arctic drilling will probably be reintroduced as part of the energy bill in Congress this year. CLEAN AIR Feb. 14, 2002The president announces the Clear Skies Initiative, which would impose mandatory limits on three kinds of power-plant emissions but grant the plants flexibility in meeting those limits. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The plan replaces confusing, ineffective regulations that have led to a long cycle of litigation. OPPOSITION VIEW: The Clear Skies Initiative would allow more mercury, nitrogen oxide and sulfur pollution than current law does. STATUS: The plan will probably be introduced again in Congress. NUCLEAR WASTE Feb. 15, 2002President Bush picks Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the permanent repository for upto 77,000 tons of radioactive waste. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The waste will be much safer in one carefully designed repository. OPPOSITION VIEW: Moving nuclear waste along highways and railroads makes it more vulnerable to accidents or terrorist attacks. The General Accounting Office concluded it was premature to approve the project because of unresolved scientific questions. STATUS: Both houses of Congress voted to override the Nevada governor's veto of the project, allowing it to go forward. MOUNTAINTOP MINING May 3, 2002The E.P.A. reverses a Clean Water Act rule by making it legal for coal companies to dump mining waste into waterways and wetlands. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The change was necessary to save West Virginia's coal mining industry from shutting down for lack of an affordable way to dispose of mining waste. OPPOSITION VIEW: The destructive process of removing mountaintops for coal is made worse by allowing waste to be dumped in waterways and valleys. STATUS: A federal judge found the change illegal. The decision was overruled in January, allowing dumping permitsto proceed. ALASKA FORESTS May 16, 2002The administration announces plans to open part of the Tongass National Forest to logging and mining, and to designate part of the Chugach National Forest for protection. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The Forest Service said it was acting to protect wilderness while maintaining the availability of some of the Tongass for more intensive resource management in support of the economies of southeast Alaska. OPPOSITION VIEW: The decisions bode poorly for the protection of other wilderness and roadless areas. Too little of the Chugach forest would be protected, and the Tongass recommendation is a gift to the timber industry. STATUS: Development plans may be stymied by the reinstatement of the Clinton roadless rule. NATIONALENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT -- July 9, 2002The administration begins to streamline environmental review procedures under the act. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The goal is to modernize analysis and documentation under the act and improve coordination between government andthe public. OPPOSITION VIEW: The administration is trying to circumvent the cornerstone of environmental law, proposing that innumerable projects go forward with little or no environmental review. STATUS: A task force is reviewing public comments. FORESTRY Aug. 22, 2002The administration announces a plan toexempt millions of acres of national forestfrom environmental review to speed upprojects aimed at reducing fire risk. Logging companies would be allowed to cut large trees. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The initiative is about thinning forests, not logging them, to return overgrown forests and range land to their natural state. OPPOSITION VIEW: The plan allows more logging in the wilderness, far from homes and communities, under the guise of fire prevention. It enables the Forest Service to approve logging in old-growth forests with no environmental review. STATUS: The legislation died in Congress, but could be revived this year. SNOWMOBILES Nov. 12, 2002The administration delays a Clinton-era initiative that would have eventually banned snowmobiles from the Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: A compromise would lower the number of snowmobiles allowed in the parks on the busiest days. Cleaner, newer snowmobiles would be required by the winter of 2003-4. OPPOSITION VIEW: The compromise would still allow for an increase in the number of vehicles, to 80,750 from 64,000 in 2001-2. Newer snowmobiles are still noisy and pollute far more than automobiles. STATUS: The Clinton ban was lifted and snowmobiles are allowed in the parks. CLEAN AIR Nov. 22, 2002The administration issues regulations changing the Clean Air Act requirement that the oldest and dirtiest power plants and refineries install modern pollution controls whenever they make major repairs. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The requirement, known as new source review, has sometimes hindered emissions reductions. There is bipartisan consensus that the new source review needs to be improved. OPPOSITION VIEW: The changes weaken pollution control measures and undercut pollution-related lawsuits brought against 13 utilities by the Clinton administration. STATUS: A final rule was proposed on Dec. 31, 2002; nine Northeastern states have challenged it in court. DIESEL EMISSIONS Dec. 30, 2002The administration announces rules to cut diesel pollutants from construction, farm and mine equipment and other off-road vehicles. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The plan would prevent more than 8,000 premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of respiratory illnesses every year. OPPOSITION VIEW: The plan is laudable, as is the administration's strong support of a Clinton measure to cut pollutants from trucks, buses and other diesel-powered highway vehicles. STATUS: The rules will be fully in place in 2010. WETLANDS DEVELOPMENT Jan. 10, 2003The administration announces a review of its regulation of isolated wetlands, those not connected to other bodies of water. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The administration is inviting public comment on the rules and acting in response to a 2001 Supreme Court ruling limiting the scope of the Clean Water Act. OPPOSITION VIEW: Up to 20 percent of the nation's wetlands couldbe developed without obstacles if the Bush administration removes them from federal jurisdiction. STATUS: Public comment on the policy change is being sought. BANNED PESTICIDE Feb. 1, 2003The administration says it will help companies seek exemptions to a ban on methyl bromide, a pesticide that damages the ozone layer. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The exemptions are justified under the Montreal Protocol language because thereare no effective substitutes for methyl bromide, and businesses would be harmed. OPPOSITION VIEW: Exemptions will set back efforts to undo ozone damage by years and undermine the Montreal Protocol, which includes the ban and is widely seen as the most effective environmental treaty ever negotiated. STATUS: The administration has requested more than 50 exemptions for companies and trade groups.

ADMINISTRATION POSITION: While not announcing a position on the Clinton rule, the administration has not defended it against challenges from Western states and the logging industry. OPPOSITION VIEW: The ban on road-building is needed to protect vast stretches of undeveloped forest from logging and commercial development.STATUS: A district court in Idaho blocked the ban in May 2001, but a federal appeals court reinstated it in December 2002.

MOUNTAINTOP MINING May 3, 2002The E.P.A. reverses a Clean Water Act rule by making it legal for coal companies to dump mining waste into waterways and wetlands. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The change was necessary to save West Virginia's coal mining industry from shutting down for lack of an affordable way to dispose of mining waste. OPPOSITION VIEW: The destructive process of removing mountaintops for coal is made worse by allowing waste to be dumped in waterways and valleys. STATUS: A federal judge found the change illegal. The decision was overruled in January, allowing dumping permitsto proceed. ALASKA FORESTS May 16, 2002The administration announces plans to open part of the Tongass National Forest to logging and mining, and to designate part of the Chugach National Forest for protection. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The Forest Service said it was acting to protect wilderness while maintaining the availability of some of the Tongass for more intensive resource management in support of the economies of southeast Alaska. OPPOSITION VIEW: The decisions bode poorly for the protection of other wilderness and roadless areas. Too little of the Chugach forest would be protected, and the Tongass recommendation is a gift to the timber industry. STATUS: Development plans may be stymied by the reinstatement of the Clinton roadless rule. NATIONALENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT -- July 9, 2002The administration begins to streamline environmental review procedures under the act. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The goal is to modernize analysis and documentation under the act and improve coordination between government andthe public. OPPOSITION VIEW: The administration is trying to circumvent the cornerstone of environmental law, proposing that innumerable projects go forward with little or no environmental review. STATUS: A task force is reviewing public comments. FORESTRY Aug. 22, 2002The administration announces a plan toexempt millions of acres of national forestfrom environmental review to speed upprojects aimed at reducing fire risk. Logging companies would be allowed to cut large trees. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The initiative is about thinning forests, not logging them, to return overgrown forests and range land to their natural state. OPPOSITION VIEW: The plan allows more logging in the wilderness, far from homes and communities, under the guise of fire prevention. It enables the Forest Service to approve logging in old-growth forests with no environmental review. STATUS: The legislation died in Congress, but could be revived this year. SNOWMOBILES Nov. 12, 2002The administration delays a Clinton-era initiative that would have eventually banned snowmobiles from the Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: A compromise would lower the number of snowmobiles allowed in the parks on the busiest days. Cleaner, newer snowmobiles would be required by the winter of 2003-4. OPPOSITION VIEW: The compromise would still allow for an increase in the number of vehicles, to 80,750 from 64,000 in 2001-2. Newer snowmobiles are still noisy and pollute far more than automobiles. STATUS: The Clinton ban was lifted and snowmobiles are allowed in the parks. CLEAN AIR Nov. 22, 2002The administration issues regulations changing the Clean Air Act requirement that the oldest and dirtiest power plants and refineries install modern pollution controls whenever they make major repairs. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The requirement, known as new source review, has sometimes hindered emissions reductions. There is bipartisan consensus that the new source review needs to be improved. OPPOSITION VIEW: The changes weaken pollution control measures and undercut pollution-related lawsuits brought against 13 utilities by the Clinton administration. STATUS: A final rule was proposed on Dec. 31, 2002; nine Northeastern states have challenged it in court. DIESEL EMISSIONS Dec. 30, 2002The administration announces rules to cut diesel pollutants from construction, farm and mine equipment and other off-road vehicles. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The plan would prevent more than 8,000 premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of respiratory illnesses every year. OPPOSITION VIEW: The plan is laudable, as is the administration's strong support of a Clinton measure to cut pollutants from trucks, buses and other diesel-powered highway vehicles. STATUS: The rules will be fully in place in 2010. WETLANDS DEVELOPMENT Jan. 10, 2003The administration announces a review of its regulation of isolated wetlands, those not connected to other bodies of water. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The administration is inviting public comment on the rules and acting in response to a 2001 Supreme Court ruling limiting the scope of the Clean Water Act. OPPOSITION VIEW: Up to 20 percent of the nation's wetlands couldbe developed without obstacles if the Bush administration removes them from federal jurisdiction. STATUS: Public comment on the policy change is being sought. BANNED PESTICIDE Feb. 1, 2003The administration says it will help companies seek exemptions to a ban on methyl bromide, a pesticide that damages the ozone layer. ADMINISTRATION POSITION: The exemptions are justified under the Montreal Protocol language because thereare no effective substitutes for methyl bromide, and businesses would be harmed. OPPOSITION VIEW: Exemptions will set back efforts to undo ozone damage by years and undermine the Montreal Protocol, which includes the ban and is widely seen as the most effective environmental treaty ever negotiated. STATUS: The administration has requested more than 50 exemptions for companies and trade groups.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR PROGRAMS; 
Inspectors View Nuclear Work At Iranian Site

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
International inspectors visiting Iran this week were shown a network of sophisticated machinery to enrich uranium, spurring concerns that Iran is making headway in its suspected program to develop nuclear weapons, Western officials and international diplomats said today.
 The site in question is near the city of Natanz and was visited on Friday by Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who went to Iran to assess the status of its nuclear program. It was the first time that inspectors had visited the installation. 
 During the visit to the Natanz site, inspectors found that it included a small network of centrifuges for enriching uranium. The inspectors also learned that Iran had components to make a significant number of additional centrifuges.
American officials believe Natanz is part of a long suspected nuclear weapons program, an Iranian project that American intelligence believes has benefited from Pakistani assistance and that is far more advanced than the effort by Iraq.
The officials say Iran's goal is to mine or purchase uranium, process the ore and enrich it to a purity suitable for making weapons -- a process that would give Iran a largely indigenous capability to make nuclear weapons.
Iran insists that its aim is to make fuel for a civilian nuclear power program, and it maintains that it is opening its plant in Natanz to the atomic energy agency to demonstrate its peaceful intentions.
The new information on Iran's program comes at an awkward time for the Bush administration, which is making final military preparations for a potential American-led invasion to topple the government of Saddam Hussein, an action justified partly on grounds that Iraq is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. 
Noting that North Korea's and Iran's nuclear programs are far ahead of Iraq's, critics of the Bush administration have contended that it has focused too much on a lesser proliferation problem. Administration officials contend that it is important to act before Iraq becomes a nuclear power and say the United States is trying to devise strategies to try to head off North Korea's and Iran's weapons programs.
Dr. ElBaradei, who had planned to visit Iranian sites for three days, cut short his visit to Iran and left today. Two senior officials from the atomic energy agency plan to continue their work in Iran for several days.
The site near Natanz has long been of concern to American intelligence agencies, which had concluded that Iran was building a large gas centrifuge plant there to enrich uranium.
The plant under construction there has thick concrete walls and is being built underground, an apparent precaution against a military attack. After the work on the plant was disclosed by an Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, Dr. ElBaradei asked that it be included in his visit to Iran.
The agency also pushed for the visit because of Iran's announcement in September that it was proceeding with an ambitious nuclear power program, one that is planned to give it an indigenous ability to make and reprocess its own fuel. One objective of Dr. ElBaradei's visit was to ask Iran to adopt an additional protocol that would provide the agency with significantly greater access to sites in Iran and information about its nuclear program.
American and foreign intelligence services believe Iran's program would work as follows: Iran would mine natural uranium at domestic sites or buy it abroad. The uranium would then be taken to a facility at Isfahan, where it would be converted into uranium hexafluoride, a gas. 
The fuel would then be taken either to the centrifuge facility at Natanz or, perhaps, to some covert centrifuge plant. The progress that Iran has made in centrifuge technology, as documented by the inspectors, reinforces concerns that Iran is moving forward in this major area. 
Iran says Natanz will be used to produce low-enriched uranium for civilian power plants that it has yet to build. The plant that Russians are building at Bushehr would not need low-enriched uranium from Natanz because Russia is supplying the fuel.
Iran also says the Natanz facility will be under international safeguards, which means there will be monitoring equipment and regular inspections to make sure that no enriched uranium is diverted.
But American and British intelligence officials have several concerns. One is that if Iran is able to build a civilian plant in Natanz, it can develop a clandestine nuclear enrichment plant elsewhere. Another is that Iran might somehow divert material from Natanz and take it to a secret centrifuge plant for enrichment to weapons-grade material.
Still another concern is that Iran will complete the Natanz plant under international inspection but then withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which it is legally allowed to do with three months' notice. It could then reconfigure the installation to make weapons-grade uranium. A rule of thumb is that it takes 1,000 centrifuges of the type Iran is using to make a bomb's worth of fissile material per year.
An urgent question is whether Iran has run some uranium hexafluoride through the small network of centrifuges at Natanz. That would produce small amounts of low-enriched uranium but would be a violation of Iran's obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Those obligations require that the production of nuclear material be reported.
Asked to comment on the centrifuges observed at Natanz, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency declined to respond. 
"Iran will attempt to justify Natanz as part of its civilian nuclear power program, but it is actually an effort to develop a nuclear weapons breakout capability," said Gary Samore, director of studies at the International Institute for Strategic Studies and former expert on proliferation on President Bill Clinton's National Security Council. 
"It makes no technical sense for Iran to do this for civilian purposes because Russia has agreed to provide lifetime fuel services for Iran's only nuclear power plant under construction, the one at Bushehr," Mr. Samore added. "The Iranians will argue that they have plans to buy an additional four or five plants from Russia. But it would make more economic and technical sense for Russia to provide the fuel for those plants."
Natanz is just one Iranian plant that is of concern. According to American intelligence, Iran has been building a plant near Arak in west-central Iran to produce heavy water, which can be used to make plutonium. Iran has yet to build a reactor that could use the heavy water.
Earlier this week, the Iranian resistance group asserted that research and testing on centrifuge technology was being carried out at a front company near Tehran called the Kola Electric Company. Iran says the company is a watch factory.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE PEACEKEEPERS; 
Iraqi Kurds Are Wary Of a Turkish-Led Force

BYLINE:  By C. J. CHIVERS 

DATELINE: KOYA, Iraq, Feb. 20 

 BODY:
The guards at the walled compound here, in their blue berets and polished armored cars, are striking with their professional military air. Their uniforms are pressed. Their weapons look new. Their frames are mostly lean and fit. 
 They are members of the Peace Monitoring Force, a Turkish-led contingent that has been enforcing a cease-fire between rival Kurdish parties in northern Iraq since 1997. 
 The force has had many successes. The peacekeepers say they have never suffered an injury or been attacked. The Kurdish parties have stopped fighting, and after an adjournment of several years the joint Kurdish parliament began meeting again last fall.
But it is also a measure of the persistent distrust between Iraqi Kurds and their Turkish neighbors that these men in blue berets are shrouded in deep suspicion these days.
As the possibility of another war nears, this one a campaign to unseat President Saddam Hussein, several accusations can be heard. Kurdish political leaders accuse the peacekeepers of training ethnic Turkmen militias, of preparing to assist a Turkish incursion, and of spying.
A war against Mr. Hussein is likely to involve a northern front opening from Turkey, and Turkish troops will perhaps follow American soldiers at least part way into northern Iraq. The Kurdish officials say they worry that the peacekeepers may play an unexpected role, like guiding Turkish soldiers or providing logistics, military or intelligence support. 
Whether such fears ultimately prove justified, Kurdish leaders of parties that once fought each other, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, are asking that the peacekeepers' presence be reassessed. 
"Now that there is no problem between the P.U.K. and K.D.P., we think their mission is over, and we would welcome them to go back," said Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.
Dr. Barham Salih, prime minister of the eastern Kurdish zone, controlled by the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, also expressed concerns about the Peace Monitoring Force's mission. "With the closure of the peace process," he said, "the P.M.F. will no longer be required." 
The peacekeepers themselves describe the Kurdish accusations as baseless -- the stuff of a "comic strip," one of their officers said.
"We will keep to our mission," said Capt. Mehmet Emir, a Turkish company commander. "We are a peace mission. We will stay to that."
The peacekeepers, 400 strong, began full deployment as British and American diplomats mediated an end to a civil war that had killed an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 people.
They were to patrol the ground between the parties' militias, reporting violations of cease-fire agreements and making a restrained display of international will.
The force's formation represented a compromise. Although the peacekeepers are led by Turkish officers and sergeants, the rank and file is filled with local Turkmen and Assyrians, forming what former President Bill Clinton once described as a "neutral, indigenous" force. Washington underwrites part of its work.
Although the effort has shown signs of solidifying -- for example, the former combatants recently opened political offices in their respective capitals -- the peacekeepers say their role remains vital. 
"I wish for the two parties to agree and settle their differences, but I think it is their habit to be in conflict between themselves, and maybe in a year or so, they will get into disagreement again," Captain Emir said.
Many issues remain unsettled, including how to divide income from petroleum products smuggled into Turkey, territorial boundaries, and a few lingering personal feuds. 
Kurds say the peacekeepers want to stay because they have unseen agendas. A chief complaint is that the force, roughly 85 percent Turkmen, serves as a de facto training program for Turkmen militias. 
For example, the force's personnel policies include no enlistment contract, and fighters can leave any time, the peacekeepers say. About 10 fighters do so each month, and they are replaced by recruits who receive a month of training and then typically a year or two of professional, Westernized military life. 
Kurds say that this rate of turnover, roughly 120 soldiers a year for several years, has produced a startling result: hundreds of fighters who have left the force and are available to serve Turkmen parties, some of whom have tense relations with the Kurds. Kurds believe that the Turkmen minority in Iraq -- roughly 5 percent of the population -- is supported by Turkey and has plans to make land claims against the Kurds in the cities of Mosul and Kirkuk.
"I wonder if it is in the interest of the Kurdish people that inside the P.M.F. military camps, they turn our Kurdistani Turkmen brethren into commandos," one man wrote in a letter last year to Hawlati, an independent newspaper. 
Some officials also accuse the peacekeepers of directly arming or equipping a group of parties known as the Turkmen Front and of providing it with intelligence. Seven Turkmen Front members, including a senior security official, were arrested in Erbil on Feb. 12, accused by the Kurdistan Democratic Party of plotting to sabotage an Iraqi opposition conference planned for this week, a senior Kurdish official said.
The peacekeepers dismiss accusations of connections to the group.
"We have no links with the Turkmen Front," Captain Emir said. "We are not spies." 
Regardless of the Kurds' official desire, the peacekeepers -- and American officials -- say there is little chance of evicting them now. Any agreement to disband the force would have to involve the United States, Turkey and Britain.
An American official said a review of the mission wasa project for later, because for now Turkey considered Iraq as too unstable. "In the absence of a governmental authority in Baghdad, this is something the Turks are insisting on continuing," the official said. "But obviously, what transpires in Iraq could create a new opportunity to discuss this." 
While some civilians echo the Kurdish government's stand, others express misgivings about the prospect of the peacekeepers' departure.
Simko Karim, a meat vendor here, recalled the years of fighting and many of its attendant problems: the roadblocks, the idled economy, the ambushes on the outskirts. Many of his neighbors were wounded or killed.
"It was a continuous fight in Koya," he said. "It is not bad to keep peace between the two parties. If the P.M.F. was not here, I think the two sides might fight again."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE EUROPEANS; 
With Iraq Stance, Chirac Strives for Relevance

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
What drives Jacques Chirac? 
 As Mr. Chirac, the French president, leads resistance to American plans to use force if necessary to disarm Iraq, many French analysts are looking beyond this crisis to the man himself, and they identify a broader agenda. They see him bent on securing his place in history by forging a prominent role for France in the post-cold-war world. 
 "Chirac has a vision of how he'd like the world to be," said Pierre Lellouche, a conservative Parliament member who was Mr. Chirac's foreign affairs adviser in the early 1990's. "He sees a multipolar world in which Europe is the counterweight to American political and military power. In Europe, he sees a position of leadership for France. And he sees Europe as a bridge between the developing and developed world." 
For some political analysts, this might look like another exercise in nostalgia for lost French glory. But Mr. Chirac, it seems, sees France in a decisive struggle to assert its relevance in the new world defined by the end of the cold war, the emergence of the United States as the sole superpower and the changes wrought in Europe by both German unification and by the imminent expansion of the European Union.
France, many analysts believe, is now less sure of its place in the world than in the 1970's and 1980's when, with Germany, it routinely defined Europe's political direction. Today Germany no longer lives in the Soviet shadow and feels more confident politically. Many French, in contrast, view Europe's integration with growing skepticism.
"I think last year's elections convinced him that France was suffering an identity crisis," said Raphaelle Bacque, author of the political biography, "Chirac or the Demon of Power," published early last year. "So one traditional way of repairing the French identity is to make France exist vis-a-vis the United States, exploiting the undercurrent of anti-Americanism that has always existed here."
At age 70, four years from retirement, Mr. Chirac is in a hurry -- all the more since he wrecked his first chance of bringing change. After unsuccessful runs for the presidency in 1981 and 1988 and after 18 years as mayor of Paris, he finally reached the Elysee Palace in 1995. He quickly asserted French independence by resuming nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Two years later, however, he committed a blunder: he called early legislative elections, and the Socialist opposition swept into government. For the next five years, he lacked any real power and became embroiled in corruption cases dating back to his years as Paris mayor. When he ran for re-election last year, his main rival wrote him off as "aged, wasted, tired."
Yet last spring, he not only won re-election for a five-year term, but his neo-Gaullist party also seized control of both the National Assembly and the Senate. For some in his circle, it was as if a rejuvenated Mr. Chirac was starting his presidency anew. 
He appointed a little-known politician, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, to be prime minister with the job of running day-to-day government affairs. Then, confident of his clout as the West's most experienced political leader, Mr. Chirac turned to foreign affairs. He named his most trusted aide, Dominique de Villepin, once described by a government official as "the son Chirac never had," to be his foreign minister. According to political experts, Mr. de Villepin has further encouraged Mr. Chirac to give France a higher international profile.
For Mr. Chirac himself, the Iraqi crisis involves a fundamental principle: war should be the very last resort. But domestic politics also play a role. Polls indicate that over 80 percent of French are strongly opposed to both an Iraq war and any unilateral display of American military might.
Another political reality is that five million Muslims live in France. Mr. Chirac may fear "that a wave of anti-Americanism in the Muslim world will translate into a storm of anti-Westernism that will affect France," said one retired French ambassador who knows him well.
Mr. Chirac himself never misses a chance to reiterate his affection for the United States. Yet while he insists that the United States is better served by honest and frank friends than by sycophants, an all-powerful United States also stands in the way of his long-term vision for France and Europe. The American leadership's penchant for ignoring European views on such topics as global warming and an international criminal court has only underlined Europe's waning influence. 
As it happens, it was Germany, not France, that first distanced itself from the United States over Iraq when Chancellor Gerhard Schroder pledged during his re-election campaign last summer not to join any invasion of Iraq. But when the Bush administration stepped up its war plans in the fall, it was France that tried to stay the American hand in the United Nations Security Council, where as a permanent member it has a right of veto. Since then, it has become the leader of antiwar opinion. 
"I think Chirac would have preferred more dialogue," said Pierre Moscovici, minister of European affairs in the former Socialist government. "I'm not sure the confrontation pleases him. He's not a traditional Gaullist and he's not anti-American. But on Iraq, I believe he is convinced that war is not justified." 
Mr. Chirac's stance has provoked a furious anti-French backlash in conservative circles in the United States and Britain, but it has also brought dividends, not least support from many countries that also fear the American approach. This week, 52 African countries attending a French-African summit meeting in Paris endorsed the French position. 
But Mr. Chirac's effort to take a leadership role on Iraq has opened deep divisions within Europe, in part because France is suspected of having a hidden agenda to restore French-German domination of Europe. 
As a result, the battle within Europe over Iraq has also become the battle over Europe's future, and there Mr. Chirac's power play appears to have backfired. Not only have Spain, Italy, Portugal and Denmark followed Britain's lead in backing the United States, but 13 former Communist countries, including the 8 scheduled to join the European Union in 2004, have also supported Washington. 
On Monday, after a meeting in Brussels at which European leaders papered over their differences on Iraq, Mr. Chirac's frustration spilled over. He said the countries seeking European Union membership had "missed a good opportunity to remain silent." Those countries were shaken, but Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain quickly wrote to them expressing his admiration. That not only deepened tensions with Britain but also undermined further the idea of a common European foreign and defense policy. 
Even in France, Mr. Chirac's tirade did not go uncriticized. "Who 'missed a good opportunity to remain silent?' " wrote Patrick Sabatier in a signed editorial in the left-of-center daily Liberation. "Answer: Jacques Chirac." Mr. Sabatier said the president had treated the "other Europe" with the same disdain as Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had shown when he spoke of "old Europe." 
Within Mr. Chirac's party, there were also expressions of concern. "Chirac's approach presumes everyone shares France's view," one conservative leader said. "But the rest of Europe doesn't want France in the driver's seat." 
The more immediate question is how France will vote when the United States and Britain present a new resolution on Iraq at the Security Council. But some French politicians are also beginning to ask whether Mr. Chirac has prepared an exit strategy that will enable France to mend its ties with Washington and London as well as preserve France's political gains. Outside Elysee Palace, it is still anyone's guess how Mr. Chirac will next define French interests.

Bush Says Iraqi Missiles Are 'Tip of the Iceberg'
President Bush said that even if Iraq agreed to destroy all of its prohibited missiles, they are "just the tip of the iceberg" of its illegal arsenal. He asserted again that Saddam Hussein had no intention of disarming. The Bush administration wants to present a new resolution to the United Nations Security Council this week. 1

U.N. Inspectors in Iran
International inspectors visiting an Iranian nuclear site were shown a network of sophisticated machinery to enrich uranium. The United States considers the site part of a covert Iranian project to develop nuclear weapons that is far more advanced than the effort mounted by Iraq; Iran says it is to produce fuel for future reactor projects. 1

Troops Kill 2 Palestinians
Israeli troops killed two Palestinians in the West Bank, with a total of 33 Palestinians killed this past week. The Palestinian leadership supports a one-year cease-fire, but militant groups are demanding that Israel cease killing Palestinians before signing any deal. 8

Gunmen Kill Seven in Karachi
Gunmen opened fire inside a Shiite mosque in the southern port city of Karachi, Pakistan, killing at least seven worshippers. Suspicions immediately fell on a Sunni militant group, Laskhar-e-Jahngvi. 10

Finger-Pointing In Deadly Nightclub Fire
The finger-pointing over the fire that roared through a nightclub in Warwick, R.I., Thursday night intensified, as the authorities continued their investigation and struggled with the grim task of identifying the dead. 1

In the tragedies in nightclubs in Chicago and Rhode Island, officials found indications of familiar problems: one club was open despite inspectors' efforts to close it; another passed a fire inspection without having a sprinkler system. 21

Bush's Environmental Record
President Bush has ushered in a new era of environmental rules that seek to tie environmental protection to other goals that are not always complementary, like economic growth, protection from regulation and increased energy production. 1

A Possible War Can Leave Big Shoes to Fill

BYLINE:  By MARCI ALBOHER NUSBAUM 

 BODY:
SINCE the Sept. 11 attacks, one of the most valuable members of Jeffrey L. Wilson's staff at BAE Systems in San Diego has been called up twice to active military duty. The first time was from November 2001 until July 2002. Then, just before Thanksgiving, he was whisked off to a base in Kuwait.
 Filling the gaps has been a challenge, says Mr. Wilson, a director of information technology at BAE, the British military contractor. A month before the reservist's departure, Mr. Wilson doled out his responsibilities to his colleagues. Even so, "there is no way you're going to take everything he knows and distribute it," Mr. Wilson said. 
 "We constantly need him to fill in the blanks," he added.
The activated employee -- a Marine Corps colonel -- stays in touch with BAE through the company's computer network and e-mail system. "He usually responds to queries within 24 hours," Mr. Wilson said, though he acknowledged that the situation might change. "If he has time for us, we're happy to get his intelligence, but we recognize that the Marines are his No. 1 job."
For corporate America, economic uncertainty and market turmoil have not been the only tolls of the war threat. With more than 150,000 reservists and members of the National Guard already called up, and tens of thousands more expected to be, many small companies, as well as departments of big corporations, are staring at the prospect of a talent drain.
Even the most careful planning can't ensure smooth sailing. In 1999, when Eric J. Weinberg, a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve, and two partners with military backgrounds founded Hill Solutions, a lobbying and government-relations firm in Philadelphia, they knew it would be vulnerable to wartime dislocations. One of the other partners was also a reservist, and they figured that some future employees would be, too. 
First, the partners made sure that they didn't hire all their employees from the same military unit or branch of service. Then, immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, they arranged for a line of credit from a private equity firm to cover the company's expenses for the next calendar year if one or more partners were called up. "We decided that we'd go into debt, which we'd never done before, to allow us to meet our payroll and keep the company intact and continue to provide benefits to our employees," Mr. Weinberg said.
The firm also wrote to clients, explaining that although several firm members had military obligations, all commitments to clients would be met. Even so, Mr. Weinberg said, Hill Solutions lost several clients after he was mobilized for five months in 2002. "Our clients need a lot of hand-holding," he said. "If they don't get that, they go elsewhere."
It isn't just small companies that are vulnerable. "Every company of every size is being affected, and it is particularly difficult because in the current economy employees are being asked to do more with less," said Richard A. Chaifetz, chief executive of the ComPsych Corporation, a provider of employee assistance programs that is based in Chicago.
Even so, some large corporations say their size has kept damage to a minimum. William N. Brown, a marketing manager in Florida for Lockheed Martin, says he recently lost a star video producer to the National Guard for a year, but without much disruption. Mr. Brown said people with military training tend to be very good at sharing information with teammates and readjusting easily after an absence. "This ability to work flexibly is something taught in the military -- it's something they bring to us and something we value," he said.
SIMILARLY, David L. Carmichael, a senior associate at the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton in Falls Church, Va., limited the repercussions when all three members of a team he led on a research project for the Defense Department were mobilized by the Army. "I made arrangements to bring people from our Colorado Springs office to relocate for a few months," he said. "We basically did a little mobilization within the firm."
Smaller companies don't have that luxury. And for the smallest, the loss of a single crucial employee can spell big problems. It took help from an unexpected quarter to rescue the cellphone store in Elmhurst, Ill., owned by John T. Cammack and Nancy Knight-Cammack.
Ms. Knight-Cammack said that when her husband, a gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps Reserve, was activated in February 2002, she feared that the business would end up in bankruptcy. Though the two had run the business together for four years, she said she never understood some aspects of it.
Her first instinct was to sell the store to a competitor, Jeff Gott, who owned three nearby cellphone stores. Instead, when she approached him, he offered to coach her so that she could save it. "He didn't want me to sell because he wanted my husband to have something to come home to," Ms. Knight-Cammack said. It is even possible, she said, that Mr. Gott's own businesses suffered because of the attention he paid to hers.
The federal Small Business Administration offers disaster loans and loan-payment deferral to owners of small businesses if they or essential employees are called up. But, a spokesman said, there hasn't been a huge demand for this assistance. 
On the other hand, Mr. Chaifetz, ComPsych's chief executive, said the company had had a surge in requests from corporate clients on how to prepare for such employee absences. He offers this advice: Determine your potential loss, then do as much cross-training as possible and ask other members of the team for suggestions on ways to distribute the workload to alleviate colleagues' resentment.
Anthony P. Rider, a sergeant in the Marine Corps Reserve who owns two Mr. Goodcents restaurant franchises in Kansas City, is training his managers and his wife, Tracy, to take on his responsibilities if he is mobilized. He can also rely on the support provided by his franchise's corporate offices.
Still, he is prepared for a setback. "I'm very detail oriented," he said. "My wife has standing orders that if it becomes too difficult or stressful, she will just have to sell."

Officials From Rich Nations Discuss Efforts to Spur Growth

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 22 

 BODY:
Finance officials from the world's leading industrialized nations met here today to coordinate efforts to spur economic growth and gird the global economy against the shocks of a war in Iraq.
 But the meeting of the Group of 7, facing the same divisions over Iraq that have split other international institutions, skirted concrete plans that would deal with the negative economic effects of a war and issued instead a more general statement on how to address a sagging global economy. 
 "If the economic outlook weakens we are prepared to respond as appropriate," said a draft statement distributed to reporters in Paris, where the finance ministers from the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, Italy, France and Britain are meeting. "Geopolitical uncertainties have increased." 
The draft statement acknowledged that the world economy was weakening and proposed guidelines for supporting growth in the world's various economic regions. "We will continue to monitor exchange markets closely and cooperate as appropriate," the draft said.
But many European governments, constrained by European Union budgetary rules, have been critical of American reliance on fiscal stimulus like President Bush's proposed tax cuts to address economic weakness because it is something they cannot easily match.
The United States, which has already cut interest rates to the lowest levels in more than 40 years, is arguing for spending as a way to prime the economy. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow, attending his first meeting of the Group of 7, spent much of today explaining the merits of tax cuts and spending to spur growth.
Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, warned the group that uncertainty over a conflict in Iraq "remains a key concern for growth prospects" in Europe. He hinted that interest rates might be cut in Europe if the region's economic outlook is further threatened.
"We will not hesitate to act," Mr. Duisenberg said at a news conference today. But Mr. Duisenberg opposes any relaxation of European Union budget constraints to allow more government spending.
The Group of 7's draft statement also urged "all countries to implement and enforce laws to combat the financing of terrorism," and promised technical assistance to those countries without the ability to do so.

Pressure grows from states to restrict and tax a smoker's haven -- the Internet.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
ONLINE sellers of cigarettes have been in an enviable position -- until recently. As states steadily raised cigarette taxes in an effort to balance budgets and curb teenage smoking, more and more consumers turned to the Web, where cheap cigarettes abound.
 But such bargains may not be so easily found in the future, some analysts said, as states like New York prepare to outlaw online tobacco sales, while others crack down on cigarette buyers who do not pay taxes. 
 For now, the savings are significant. When a smoker in New York City, for instance, buys a carton of Marlboro Full Flavor Kings from a site like DirtCheapCig.com, the price is $35.18, including shipping. For the same carton in Manhattan, where customers pay an excise tax of $1.50 a pack to both the city and the state, taxes alone would amount to $30. 
The reason the Internet is a smoker's haven, analysts and state government investigators said, is that DirtCheapCig and hundreds of other Internet sites do not meet their legal responsibilities to report customers' names to the state taxing authorities, so that states can collect excise taxes.
Executives at DirtCheapCig.com, based in Paducah, Ky., did not return calls seeking comment, but a customer service representative said the site did not report sales to a customer's state. Rather, he said, it charges the Kentucky excise tax of 3 cents a pack.
According to Forrester Research, online bargains will help Web sites sell $2.2 billion worth of cigarettes this year, up from $1.2 billion last year. Forrester projects sales of $5 billion in 2005.
But those rosy figures could be in jeopardy, given the states' growing distaste for online tobacco merchants. New York, for instance, passed a law in 2000 barring the online and mail-order sale of cigarettes to its residents. After the law was initially struck down by the Federal District Court in Manhattan in 2001, it was upheld by a federal appeals panel earlier this month, and is likely to go into effect in the coming days.
The law was largely intended to curb under-age smoking, since many online cigarette sites do little, if anything, to verify the age of customers. But skeptics point to legislation in other states to enforce online cigarette tax collection, and say the law's true intent is to protect state coffers, not coughers.
"We all know this isn't about public health," said Joseph F. Crangle, a lawyer with Colucci & Gallagher in Buffalo, who has represented online cigarette sellers from Indian reservations in upstate New York. Mr. Crangle, who declined to identify his clients' Web sites, said traditional merchants lobbied Albany to protect the economic interests of both the state and the merchants, who have lost substantial sales to the online retailers. The states with some of the highest cigarette taxes have been among the most aggressive in their pursuit of Internet tobacco merchants.
California, which has a tax of 87 cents a pack, enacted two laws this year aimed largely at online cigarette sellers. The first requires online retailers to verify that customers are 18 or older, by, among other things, matching names, addresses and dates of birth to government records. Online sellers must also accept only checks or credit cards, in part because other methods of payment, like money orders, are more accessible to teenagers.
Laura Kaplan, a deputy attorney general for California, said the state had yet to prosecute a Web site under the law. That could change, though. "This is a very hot topic right now," she said.
The second new California law is aimed at tax evaders. It requires Internet and mail-order tobacco sellers who do not collect the state's excise tax at the time of a California resident's purchase to include on the outside of the shipping container a notification that the merchant has told the state about the sale, and that the customer is liable for taxes.
Those who work with the online cigarette sellers differ on how much the new laws will affect business. Robert Rubin, a Forrester Research analyst, said online cigarette retailers were likely to flout the law. "States can get tougher with the regulations, but their ability to police is limited," Mr. Rubin said. "It's so hard to police because these sites can pop up and go away so quickly. The anonymity of the Internet is great for this."
Enforcement of cigarette-related laws has long been a problem. A report by the General Accounting Office last year noted that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department were responsible for investigating and enforcing the Jenkins Act, the law requiring remote cigarette sellers to inform states when a purchase takes place.
But, the G.A.O. report said, neither the Justice Department nor the F.B.I. identified "any actions taken to enforce the Jenkins Act with respect to Internet cigarette sales." One problem, the report said, is that violations of the act are considered misdemeanors, and government investigators do not think such charges are worth pursuing.
Notably, at least 80 percent of online tobacco sellers are on American Indian reservations, according to Mr. Rubin, of Forrester. Although Internet sites on Indian reservations are exempt from state sales taxes, such sites must still comply with the Jenkins Act, as well as other laws on sales of cigarettes to minors. With 11 states now proposing laws to regulate the online sale of cigarettes, the profits of various merchants could be affected, said Mr. Crangle, who represents cigarette sellers on reservations in New York.
"To the best of my knowledge, my clients are complying" with laws requiring online tobacco merchants to verify their customers' age and to submit tax information to the states, Mr. Crangle said. But the New York law "will certainly hurt," he said, since his clients "get a significant amount of business from within the state." 
Likewise, Mr. Crangle said, the tightening of various state restrictions on age verification will be burdensome, given the limited resources of the Web sites. "There are other ways to ensure people who are under age don't receive cigarettes," he said, adding that his clients commonly ask new buyers to fax a birth certificate or driver's license.
But other companies have shied away from online selling, in large part because they feel such measures are not enough. Take the Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, a cigarette maker with about $150 million in annual sales. Richard M. Sanders, Santa Fe's chief executive, said that the company had long relied on a mail-order business simply because it could not compete with major tobacco brands for retail shelf space. Santa Fe was acquired last year by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, whose brands include Winston and Camel, but it is an independent subsidiary.
Although mail-order and Internet operations are nearly identical, Mr. Sanders said, his mail-order division is much better able to verify a customer's age because sales are handled over the phone. Santa Fe representatives request a copy of a government identification (with an address that matches the buyer's shipping address), and a signed form stating that the buyer is a smoker.
If the company made a similar request online, "it would make people very, very reluctant," Mr. Sanders said.
Mr. Sanders said he generally supported laws that require Internet sellers to verify the age of buyers and pass tax information to states -- but not enough to forfeit his own rights to sell via mail order. Santa Fe is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit that was overturned this month by the appeals court panel, paving the way for the reinstatement of the New York law banning mail-order and Internet tobacco sales. Mr. Sanders said the company would take "whatever course of action" required to overturn the law, including a petition to the United States Supreme Court.

HEADLINE: Ratings Agency Says It Erred In Measuring Web Site Use 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
ComScore Media Metrix, one of the leading companies that measure Web site audiences, has discovered flaws in the methodology that it introduced in October, and it has restated its measurements for the last three months of 2002.
 Web ratings services have faced questions about accuracy since they began trying to estimate audiences by projecting the behavior of a panel of presumably representative users. Despite their limits, ComScore's ratings, and those of its main competitor, Nielsen/NetRatings, are widely used by advertisers, investors, journalists and the Web sites themselves. 
 The biggest differences in ComScore's ratings, announced last week, come in its estimates of Web use at the workplace, always the most difficult to measure. Big companies in particular do not want employees to install the software that the ratings companies use to track Web site usage. When ComScore adjusted its formulas to account for the underrepresentation at big companies, its audience projections increased, in some cases sharply. 
For instance, ComScore now estimates that Primedia's sites, mainly those run by about.com, had 56 million users in the United States in December, rather than the 44 million counted under its previous formula, a 25 percent increase. EBay's audience was increased 19 percent, to 54 million. The estimate for Terra Lycos was increased 21 percent, to 51.6 million users. That change moved Terra Lycos to the sixth-most-visited site in December, from seventh under the previous numbers, putting it in front of Google.
As with any ranking, being placed at No. 1 is an invitation to gloat. WeatherBug, a fast-growing service of AWS Convergence Technology, has noted in news releases that it is "the No. 1 source for weather information on the Web, according to ComScore Media Metrix."
ComScore's restated data, however, shows WeatherBug second to Weather.com, the site run by the Weather channel, owned by Landmark Communications.
"There was some bragging rights associated with being No. 1," said Andy Jedynak, the general manager of WeatherBug. "To the extent we have lost those, we are disappointed."
WeatherBug's bragging, of course, did not go down so easily at Weather.com, which was still listed as the No. 1 weather site by Nielsen.
"It was annoying," the chief executive of Weather.com, Deborah Wilson, said, " I can't say that it undermined our sales efforts, but to have obviously bad data floating around was a nuisance."
The restatements result from the financial collapse last June of Jupiter Media Metrix, a company that combined Web audience measurement with Internet prognostication. As Jupiter was disassembled, it sold the Media Metrix business and its panel of Web users to ComScore, an upstart with a different technology that was created mainly to monitor products that Web users bought online.
However, the software program that Media Metrix had used to track Web audiences was not sold to ComScore but to Nielsen, ending a patent dispute between the two companies. 
ComScore very quickly had to start using its own monitoring technology. It also expanded the size of the Media Metrix panel of users at work, introducing in October what it called Media Metrix 2.0.
In response to complaints by its clients, the company has discovered some flaws in its new system. It decided to publish restated data for last fall rather than change its formulas from now on.
"We could have made these changes on a forward basis," Peter Daboll, president of ComScore's Media Metrix division, said. "We felt it was the right thing to do to make the changes to provide an accurate trend."
Marketers and adverting experts agreed that ComScore's approach ultimately improves the quality of the data available.
"It's kind of embarrassing to have to admit this," said Rex Briggs, the principal of Marketing Evolution, an online advertising research firm. "I applaud them for trying to make their measurements better." 
The impact of a restatement, even of this magnitude, Mr. Briggs added, is less now than it would have been a few years ago, when billion-dollar deals were made on the basis of Media Metrix ratings.
"Stock prices are no longer tied to the number of unique visitors you have," Mr. Briggs said. "Now investors have this little idea of being profitable."
Furthermore, these audience measures are not used to set Internet advertising rates, as they are in radio and television. Since broadcasters have no way to tell how many people are watching a given program, they must use Nielsen's television ratings to determine how much to charge advertisers. On the Internet, Web sites charge to display an advertisement a certain number of times. 
Still, some industry executives worry that the restatement will add further doubt about the online medium, which is still trying to establish its credibility with marketers.
"They have some explaining to do," said Geoffrey Ramsey, an analyst with eMarketer, a research firm that uses data from ComScore, Nielsen and other sources.
This uncertainty and potential undercounting of daytime audiences is especially problematic for news and information sites, which are used mostly by people at work.
"Daytime is prime time on the Internet," said Michael Zimbalist, executive director of the Online Publishers Association, a trade group. "The at-work numbers of the ratings companies are notoriously bad."
The biggest changes that ComScore made involved how it estimated work audiences. But there were other issues as well. For example, after the acquisition, ComScore changed its method for calculating how much time users spend on each site, in some cases cutting the numbers by far more than half.
Some publishers that boasted that their users spent an hour a month on their site, an unusually high amount of time, found the new system giving them credit for only 15 minutes. ComScore discovered that it had been allocating some of the time that users spend on some Web pages to the sites of advertisers rather than the Web publisher. Its revised system changes that.
Not surprisingly ComScore and Nielsen each insist that their methods are more statistically rigorous. ComScore says that its sample of people at work has 30,000 people, far more than the 7,000 claimed by Nielsen.
Nielsen, by contrast, says its work panel is chosen by placing phone calls to random telephone numbers, an expensive but methodologically superior method. ComScore uses various other methods to recruit its work panel, like sending e-mail messages to random names on lists it buys.
It does not help that Nielsen and ComScore are vastly different in their estimates of most sites' audiences. ComScore, for example, now says Yahoo had 107 million users in the United States in December. Nielsen counted only 81 million.
Some of that difference is because ComScore measures usage on college campuses and Nielsen does not. But the difference in the estimates of Yahoo's audience, 26 million users, far exceeds the total American dormitory population.
ComScore claims that its numbers are far closer to the internal counts generated by Web site operators. But William Pulver, chief executive of NetRatings Inc., the company that publishes the Nielsen/NetRatings measurements, argues that there are good reasons that a measurement service will count fewer people than a site's own computers.
"Just because numbers are higher doesn't mean they are more accurate," he said.
Many advertisers and publishers, however, say they are tired of such claims and counterclaims and want both rating services to submit to the sort of independent audits that are regularly conducted of the services that measure traditional media. Both ratings services have so far refused, saying the audits are expensive and apply standards that are not realistic for the Internet.
"There is no consistency over time or common guidelines applied to either of these services," Mr. Zimbalist said. "They need to be audited just like radio and television ratings."

British Businessman Seen In Formal Bid for Hotel Chain
Hugh E. Osmond, a British businessman who made a fortune running pizza and pub chains, is planning to make a formal offer this week for Six Continents, the world's second-largest hotel chain, that values the company as high as $9 billion, people involved in the talks said.
 A formal offer from Mr. Osmond would likely flush out other interested parties. The Hilton Group, a British company that owns the rights to the Hilton brand outside the United States, is considering its options, including buying some hotels from Mr. Osmond should his bid succeed, a person close to the company said. Hilton could also team up with a private equity firm to start a counteroffer. Page C3.

PERSON: Robert K. Merton 

HEADLINE: Robert K. Merton, Versatile Sociologist and Father of the Focus Group, Dies at 92 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Robert K. Merton, one of the most influential sociologists of the 20th century, whose coinage of terms like "self-fulfilling prophecy" and "role models" filtered from his academic pursuits into everyday language, died yesterday. He was 92 and lived in Manhattan.
 Mr. Merton gained his pioneering reputation as a sociologist of science, exploring how scientists behave and what it is that motivates, rewards, and intimidates them. By laying out his "ethos of science" in 1942, he replaced the entrenched stereotypical views that had long held scientists to be eccentric geniuses largely unbound by rules or norms. It was this body of work that contributed to Mr. Merton's becoming the first sociologist to win a National Medal of Science in 1994. 
 But his explorations over 70-odd years extended across an extraordinary range of interests that included the workings of the mass media, the anatomy of racism, the social perspectives of "insiders" vs. "outsiders," history, literature and etymology. Though carried out with the detachment he admired in Emile Durkheim, the French architect of modern sociology, Mr. Merton's inquiries often bore important consequences in real life as well as in academics. 
His studies on an integrated community helped shape Kenneth Clark's historic brief in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court case that led to the desegregation of public schools. His adoption of the focused interview to elicit the responses of groups to texts, radio programs and films led to the "focus groups" that politicians, their handlers, marketers and hucksters now find indispensable. Long after he had helped devise the methodology, Mr. Merton deplored its abuse and misuse but added, "I wish I'd get a royalty on it."
He spent much of his professional life at Columbia University, where along with his collaborator of 35 years, Paul F. Lazarsfeld, who died in 1976, he developed the Bureau of Applied Social Research, where the early focus groups originated. The course of his career paralleled the growth and acceptance of sociology as a bona fide academic discipline. As late as 1939 there were fewer than a 1,000 sociologists in the United States, but soon after Mr. Merton was elected president of the American Sociological Association in 1957, the group had 4,500 members.
Mr. Merton was sometimes called "Mr. Sociology," and Jonathan R. Cole, a former student and the provost at Columbia, once said, "If there were a Nobel Prize in sociology, there would be no question he would have gotten it." (Mr. Merton's son, Robert C. Merton, won a Nobel Prize in economics in 1997.)
Another of Mr. Merton's contributions to sociology was his emphasis on what he termed "theories of the middle range." By these he meant undertakings that steered clear of grand speculative and abstract doctrines while also avoiding pedantic inquiries that were unlikely to yield significant results. What he preferred were initiatives that might yield findings of consequence and that open lines of further inquiry. In his own writings he favored the essay form, "which provides scope for asides and correlatives," he said, over the more common and streamlined scientific paper.
He was often came up with clearly phrased observations that combined originality with seeming simplicity. Eugene Garfield, an information scientist, wrote that much of Mr. Merton's work was "so transparently true that one can't imagine why no one else has bothered to point it out."
One early example of such illuminating insight appeared in a paper called "Social Structure and Anomie" that he wrote as a graduate student at Harvard in 1936 and then kept revising over the next decade.
Mr. Merton had asked himself what it was that brought about anomie, a state in which, according to Mr. Durkheim, the breakdown of social standards threatened social cohesion. In a breakthrough that spawned many lines of inquiry, Mr. Merton suggested that anomie was likely to arise when society's members were denied adequate means of achieving the very cultural goals that their society projected, like wealth, power, fame or enlightenment. Among the spinoffs of this work were Mr. Merton's own writings on the ranges of deviant behavior and crime.
A tall, pipe-smoking scholar, Mr. Merton often used the trajectory of his life story, from slum to academic achievement, as material illustrating the workings of serendipity, chance and coincidence, which so long fascinated him.
Robert King Merton was born Meyer R. Schkolnick on July 4, 1910, in South Philadelphia; he carried that name for the first 14 years of his life. He was the son of immigrants from Eastern Europe and lived in an apartment above his father's milk, butter and egg store until the building burned down. As a teenager performing magic tricks at birthday parties, he adopted Robert Merlin as a stage name, but when a friend convinced him that his choice of the ancient wizard's name was hackneyed, he modified it, adopting Merton with the concurrence of his Americanizing mother after he won a scholarship to Temple University.
In a lecture to the American Council of Learned Societies in 1994, Mr. Merton said that thanks to the libraries, schools, orchestras to which he had access, and even to the youth gang he had joined, his early years had prepared him well for what he called a life of learning. "My fellow sociologists will have noticed," he said, "how that seemingly deprived South Philadelphia slum was providing a youngster with every sort of capital -- social capital, cultural capital, human capital, and above all, what we may call public capital -- that is, with every sort of capital except the personally financial." It is not difficult to see connections between such views and Mr. Merton's insights into the causes of anomie.
In a 1961 New Yorker magazine profile by Morton Hunt, Mr. Merton was described as displaying "a surprising catholicity of interests and a talent for good conversation, impaired only slightly by the fact that he is alarmingly well informed about everything from baseball to Kant and is unhesitatingly ready to tell anybody about any or all of it."
Indeed, what is Mr. Merton's most widely known book, "On the Shoulders of Giants," went far beyond the confines of sociology. Referred to by Mr. Mertonas his "prodigal brainchild," it reveals the depth of his curiosity, the breadth of his prodigious research and the extraordinary patience that also characterize his academic writing. The effort began in 1942, when, in an essay called "A Note on Science and Democracy," Mr. Merton referred to a remark by Isaac Newton: "If I have seen farther, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants." He added a footnote pointing out that "Newton's aphorism is a standardized phrase which has found repeated expression from at least the 12th century."
But Mr. Merton did not stop there. Intermittently during the next 23 years he tracked the aphorism back in time, following blind alleys as well as fruitful avenues and finally finished the book in 1965, writing in a discursive style that the author attributed to his early reading and subsequent rereadings of Laurence Sterne's "Tristram Shandy." Denis Donoghue, the critic and literary scholar, wrote of the book admiringly as "an eccentric and yet concentric work of art, a work sufficiently flexible to allow a digression every 10 pages or so." He admitted, "I wish I had written 'On the Shoulders of Giants.' "
More recently, over the last three and a half decades, Mr. Merton had been gathering information about the idea and workings of serendipity, and thinking about it in the same spirit in which he had written the earlier book, which he liked to call by its acronym, OTSOG. As he had done with all his investigations, he collated and pondered data he had entered on index cards. Most days he started work at 4:30 a.m., with some of his 15 cats keeping him company. During the last years of his life, as he fought and overcame six different cancers, his Italian publisher, Il Mulino, prevailed on him to allow them to issue his writings on serendipity as a book. And four days before his death, his wife, the sociologist Harriet Zuckerman, received word that Princeton University Press had approved publication of the English version under the title, "The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity."
In addition to Ms. Zuckerman and his son, Mr. Merton is survived by two daughters, Stephanie Tombrello of Pasadena, Calif., and Vanessa Merton of Hastings-on-Hudson; nine grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: In Picking Top Schools, Klein Trips on Urban Politics 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
The New York City school system has long served strikingly different constituencies: middle-class and poor, white and minority, have and have-not. Little wonder, then, that when Chancellor Joel I. Klein said he would choose about 200 schools to exempt from a new uniform curriculum, he found himself treading a minefield.
 With the "200 Club," as some parents and teachers have been calling the list of schools, Mr. Klein, a former prosecutor and business executive who has spent most of his adult life outside New York, has tripped over the highly charged politics of race and class that swirl around urban school systems and so often stymie change. 
 Now that Mr. Klein has released the list of exempted schools, parents who thought their schools should have made the list are resentful that their children will have to use the same curriculum as those in poor neighborhoods with failing schools. 
But if Mr. Klein had chosen only the highest performing schools for the list, as parents originally expected him to do, instead of a racially and economically diverse group that includes some striving but still mediocre schools in poor areas, he might have come under even more fire.
What possessed the controversy-averse Mr. Klein to stir up such a commotion? Some veteran New York educators and political consultants chalked up his decision to exempt certain schools from the curriculum to a stubborn insistence on doing what he thought was the right thing, without considering all the consequences.
"They tried to approach it on what they believed were the merits, which is always a danger," one longtime political operative said. "You never let your candidate be in a situation where they have to choose winners, because the only people who remember are the ones who lose."
Most of the people complaining belong to a constituency that the school system has long bent over backward not to alienate: educated, middle-class parents who could put their children in private schools or move to the suburbs, but have chosen the city school system. These parents select a school painstakingly, after concluding that they would be proud to send their children there.
Many of these parents prize racial diversity or unusual curriculums, and while they want their school to be good, they do not necessarily care if its test scores are not among the city's highest.
Mr. Klein sent many such parents reeling when he excluded dozens of relatively successful middle-class schools from his list. Some parents have panicked without considering that the prescribed curriculums are not so scripted as to strip teachers of creative license.
To some of these parents, it did not even matter if their children's school was already using the standardized program, as some schools in middle-class neighborhoods are. What mattered was that their school had not made Mr. Klein's list, which they saw as an all-important status symbol.
"There is always going to be a whole lot of emotion associated with how your school is labeled," said Ruth Cohen, the president of Pencil, an organization that works to increase corporate involvement in the New York City schools. "I don't know if there's any way it would have been palatable in New York."
Nobody disputes that Mr. Klein's intentions were good. He wanted to impose a uniform curriculum across the system to replace the patchwork of programs that had evolved over three decades of community control of the schools. He was trying to ensure that the many students and teachers who frequently switch schools had basically the same instruction wherever they went.
Yet Mr. Klein and his boss, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, also thought it important to let schools with winning records continue charting their own course. From their business-minded perspective, this meritocratic approach made perfect sense.
"These are corporate guys who are used to doing performance benchmarks," one education official outside the system said of Mr. Klein and Mr. Bloomberg. "They thought it was O.K. to say, 'Everyone who gets over an 85 on the test doesn't have to stay after school.' But they didn't take the race politics into account."
Many New Yorkers assumed that Mr. Klein would simply exempt the 200 schools that scored the highest on standardized tests. Those schools overwhelmingly serve white and Asian students in middle-class neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. But the idea of rewarding only the most affluent schools in a system that serves mostly poor, black and Hispanic students stirred an immediate outcry.
The main message that Mr. Klein wanted to send -- that a uniform curriculum would elevate the system as a whole -- got lost as lawmakers, parent advocacy groups and others with a stake in poor minority schools warned of a caste system. How could Mr. Klein allow white and Asian schools to do whatever they wanted while rigidly controlling black and Hispanic schools, they asked?
Realizing he had walked into a political morass, Mr. Klein quietly worked out a formula that would ensure that his list was racially, geographically and economically diverse. Although the list included only a few schools in the Bronx and none in poor neighborhoods like East New York, West Harlem or Ocean Hill-Brownsville, 55 of the 209 schools chosen serve mostly black and Hispanic populations. (Mr. Klein originally picked 208 schools, but added one last week that he had mistakenly passed over, Public School 130 in Bayside, Queens.) 
At some of those 55 schools, just over half the students passed standardized reading and math exams last year. Since schools serving middle-class students needed higher test scores to make the list than those serving poor ones, some parents and educators complained of a double standard. 
"I would not have chosen to grant an exemption based on anything other than academic achievement with a very standardized set of parameters," said Merryl H. Tisch, a member of the State Board of Regents from Manhattan. "Community leaders who advocated for certain schools need to search their souls about whether the kids in those schools who are not meeting standards are going to be well served by not having the standard curriculum."
Mrs. Tisch and others predicted that most of the high-performing middle-class schools that did not make the list would be added to it in the coming weeks, since Mr. Klein is allowing an appeals process. 
So, by doing this, Mr. Klein may end up appeasing the school system's middle-class constituency for now, though other challenges loom as he tries to give poor children the same educational opportunities as their middle-class counterparts.
For example, next year, to comply with a new federal law, Mr. Klein plans to allow students in schools labeled as failing to transfer to better schools anywhere in the city. The policy may curtail the number of middle-class students who are granted transfers into top schools, since children in failing schools would have priority. 
Middle-class parents may also fight the policy because they would not want children from poorer neighborhoods transferring to their schools. 
Some educators who support Mr. Klein's broad policy agenda said they feared his decision to include some schools on the list for the sake of diversity sent a message that he would buckle on other issues, too.
"What's been great up until now is that both Klein and Bloomberg have been immune from the very entrenched politics of different groups in this city," one education official said. "If people are perceiving a weakness in that armor, we are going to be in trouble. Their efforts can't be punctured by race or special-interest politics."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ANKARA; 
Turkey Expected to Vote On G.I. Presence Tuesday

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
The Turkish foreign minister said today that his country's Parliament would probably vote on Tuesday on whether to allow thousands of American combat troops to use Turkey as a base for attacks on Iraq. 
 Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis told Turkish television that American and Turkish negotiators were still trying to resolve several fundamental issues, including the exact role of Turkish troops in northern Iraq and the control of the country's oil fields there. But he said there was a "high probability" that a deal could be worked out in time to hold the vote on Tuesday. 
 Mr. Yakis spoke as Turkish and American negotiators continued their discussions in Ankara, the capital. 
Parliamentary approval would clear the way for the arrival of as many as 40,000 American troops, envisioned as the northern component of a two-pronged attack against Iraq. Turkey's leaders had been resisting American pressure, in large part out of fear that a war would wreck the economy. Last week, Turkish officials approved an economic assistance package worth as much as $15 billion in grants and loans or loan guarantees that is meant to cushion the economy if war comes. 
The remaining issues, discussed by Turkish and American negotiators today, involve the possibility of Turkish intervention in northern Iraq. In his interview today and in statements last week, Mr. Yakis outlined a Turkish vision for a role in northern Iraq that seemed at odds with that of the Bush administration. 
Mr. Yakis has suggested that his government intends to send tens of thousands of Turkish troops into northern Iraq to prevent the establishment of a Kurdish state. The Turkish government has fought a long-running insurgency against its own Kurdish minority, and is afraid that a Kurdish state in northern Iraq would revive similar desires here. 
The Americans are concerned that a large-scale Turkish intervention in northern Iraq could ignite age-old ethnic hatreds between the Turks and Kurds, and prompt a similar intervention in the region by the Iranian military. In interviews, American officials have said they want to limit any Turkish intervention to dealing with refugees. 
In the interview today on CNN, Mr. Yakis indicated that he wanted to ensure that the oil fields around the northern Iraqi cities of Mosul and Kirkuk did not fall into the hands of Kurdish fighters. Turkish officials fear that Kurdish possession of the oil fields would give the Kurds the economic power to form their own state. 
In the interview, Mr. Yakis indicated that the Turks preferred to have American forces take the oil fields.
"The formulation we are nearing agreement on is that those areas will be under U.S. control," he said.
Mr. Yakis said negotiators were also discussing the possibility of disarming Kurdish militias after a war. The main Kurdish groups have thousands of armed men under their leadership, and there is speculation that American commanders may give them more weapons before a war in Iraq. 
Mr. Yakis has expressed concern about any weapons, presumably artillery, that the Americans would give to the groups in preparation for a war. In an interview last week, he suggested that the Turkish government would not allow the Kurds to hold on to their guns. 
"If those weapons given to the Kurds would be pointed against us, this is something we cannot accept," he said in an interview on Friday. "This is why we insist that these weapons should be accounted for accurately as to whom they are given, when the time comes to collect them. 
"We should also prevent these arms from reaching undesired hands." 
A senior Kurdish official said this weekend that his forces would resist any Turkish attempt to disarm them. Barham Salih, prime minister of the eastern Kurdish zone, controlled by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, said the Kurds would not surrender their weapons until a democratic government was established in Baghdad. 
"Turkey has no business getting militarily involved in northern Iraq," Dr. Salih said. "Turkey's intervention would invoke latent historical sensitivities and invite other neighbors to intervene."
"This is a Pandora's box," he added. "It is better left alone."
The Anatolia News Agency reported that Turkish and American officials agreed today to oversee the arming and disarming of the Iraqi Kurds jointly. The report could not be confirmed. 
In his interview on Friday, Mr. Yakis also suggested that Turkish soldiers might be sent to protect the ethnic Turkoman population of northern Iraq. American and Kurdish officials worry that such a Turkish role could send their troops deep into northern Iraq. 
"The Turkomans don't need to be armed for protection; instead, soldiers could be located in their areas," Mr. Yakis said. "All we want is stability in the region. We won't be going into northern Iraq to fight either people living in this region or the Iraqis."
"Turkey will be there militarily only to prevent any kind of development that would harm stability," he said.

HEADLINE: Study Sees Signs of a Rise in Hospital Patients 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
As aging boomers and their elders submit in growing numbers to surgery for ailing hearts and aching joints, the number of patients in hospital beds each night in New York City has leveled off after more than a decade of steep decline, and is even showing signs of rising.
 The numbers, documented in a new report by the United Hospital Fund, mirror a national trend, but the change is especially striking in New York City, where the number of people staying in hospitals on an average day plummeted during the 1990's. Health care experts who not long ago were predicting continued declines at New York City hospitals now foresee years of slow but steady growth, as the baby boom generation reaches old age, requires more care and takes advantage of new surgical techniques. 
 The shift could have profound consequences for New York's hospitals, many of which are financially troubled.
"A long-term switch to growing rather than shrinking is going to have all kinds of serious effects, many of which we probably haven't even thought of," said James R. Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund, a nonprofit group that studies health care issues and finances health care projects. 
In the 1990's, New York State and insurance companies put heavy pressure on hospitals in the city to cut costs by downsizing, pointing to the drop in the number of patients they housed. That, in turn, helped spur a wave of hospital mergers and ward closings. A long-term turnabout in the trend could lessen the pressure on hospitals to shrink.
But with the economy stumbling, New York's hospitals are still being pressed hard by Albany, Washington and managed care companies to cut costs, and Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed significant cuts in state payments to hospitals.
One reason New York City's health care costs are higher than the national average is that there is a longstanding tendency to use hospitals for services that are provided in doctors' offices in other parts of the country. If hospitals become more crowded, that would add to the pressure on them to shift to more outpatient care.
Pamela Brier, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, said that increasing business for hospitals does not necessarily translate into better financial conditions for them.
"The patients we're seeing are, on the whole, much sicker than those we saw 10 years ago," she said. "That, combined with the continued pressure to cut costs, does not spell good news."
The number of patients in hospitals on an average night fell nationally during the 1990's, in part because of a boom in outpatient surgery that used to require hospital stays. In a way, that decline in the daily census was misleading, because the number of people admitted to hospitals actually rose a bit during the decade. But over the same period, managed-care restrictions and improved techniques cut the length of the average hospital stay by 30 percent. So, even as the number of hospital inpatients over the course of a year climbed, the number on any given day fell.
In New York City, the drop in the daily hospital census was accelerated by the ebbing of three great epidemics: AIDS, crack cocaine and violent crime.
Over all, New York City's hospital census peaked in 1987, when there were 30,000 inpatients on an average day, the study said, and then came a long, steep decline to about 20,000 in 1999. That 33 percent drop was more than double the 16 percent decline nationally in the same period.
"There were two conflicting sets of trends, one up and one down, but the downward trend lines were so dramatic that until they leveled off a few years ago, they really masked the upward ones," Mr. Tallon said.
One upward trend was the city's growing population. But the more pronounced one was a sharp increase in the number of surgical procedures, driven by the development of new techniques.
The number of people undergoing coronary angioplasty (the insertion and inflation of a balloon to open a blocked artery near the heart), nearly tripled in the 1990's. Knee and hip replacements rose by more than half. Fusion of spinal vertebrae, usually to treat injury or arthritis, more than doubled. Stomach bypass operations for obese people tripled. 
As the population gets older and heavier, and the success rate rises for those procedures, the demand for them will continue to climb, hospital officials say.
The number of people in New York City's hospitals each day rose slightly in 2000 and into 2001. The World Trade Center attack prompted a drop in hospital use in the city, as people postponed elective treatment and suburbanites opted for local hospitals. Even so, the study shows that the numbers for the first half of 2002, the most recent available, are about the same as those for 1999.
Anecdotally, officials at several hospitals say that more beds are filled now compared with a year ago, and that they now believe the underlying long-term trend is slightly upward.
Nationally, the hospital census rose 3 percent from 1999 to 2002, the first significant increase in two decades.

President Bush has begun an ambitious effort to reinvent Medicare and Medicaid. Combined with his earlier plan for Social Security, the proposals offer a fundamentally different vision of social welfare policy, many experts say. A1

More Are Seeking New Trials
The recent wave of death row exonerations, based on DNA and other evidence, has inspired more defense lawyers to seek to reopen death penalty cases. Many prosecutors are growing frustrated with these postconviction claims of innocence, saying that many of them are frivolous and impose needless emotional trauma on victims' families. A1

Families Grieve in Rhode Island
Law enforcement officials continued their round-the-clock investigation of last week's deadly nightclub fire as family members paid last respects before a blackened lot in West Warwick. Gov. Donald L. Carcieri announced that another body had been recovered, bringing the number of people killed to 97. A14

The first lawsuits have been filed in the Chicago nightclub stampede that killed 21 people a week ago, and it will not be long before similar suits are filed in Rhode Island. In some ways, the suits will face similar legal and practical challenges, legal experts said. A14

HEADLINE: The Future at Ground Zero 

 BODY:
Later this week we'll know which of the two designs for the World Trade Center site has been selected, the one by Studio Daniel Libeskind or the one by the Think team, which includes the architects Rafael Vinoly and Frederic Schwartz. But it's worth pausing to consider where we are and how we got here. The city will be the winner no matter which design is selected. It's not hard to see how either would transform Lower Manhattan. And the very process of arriving at this point has already changed the city. 
 At first, the clearing of what had become an almost consecrated mountain of rubble took place in ad hoc fashion. As time passed, the excavation progressed in a more systematic way, allowing the debris to be cleared away in less time and for less money than anyone had expected. The chaos of that first day gave rise to a meaningful and resourceful order. 
 This page hoped, as did many New Yorkers, that something similar would happen in the process of planning a new Lower Manhattan. The question wasn't just whether a design would emerge that would match the symbolic power of Ground Zero. It was also how the design would emerge. When it comes to development, this city is a maze of intersecting interests, and the potential for cronyism is enormous. Yet this was no ordinary real estate. It's safe to say that New Yorkers probably know more about these 16 acres, and about the leases and contracts that shaped them, than they do about any other place in the city. The tragedy of 9/11 gave the public a civic claim to that site, and the knowledge that has built up over time has given the public what it needed to use that claim wisely. That we are where we are -- about to learn which of these designs will move forward -- is the result of unprecedented public participation in urban planning.
None of this has been perfect. The effort to reach a consensus on these designs, even the effort to find designs worth consensus, has been a learning process. But the city will reach an important moment this week when it becomes clear which proposal has been chosen. That decision will speed the competition and planning for a memorial. To a certain extent, it will also ratify the openness of this process and the perhaps unexpected capacity of the major institutional players, like the city, the state, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority, to find common ground.
Things will get trickier when the money starts to flow and the contracts start to be doled out. But in a city as full of civil and commercial frictions as this one, in a time as financially difficult as the present, with the need to move forward rapidly pressing on all of us, we have nonetheless found our way to a set of choices that are far better than we might have hoped for through a process that was far more democratic than history would have led us to expect. That alone is a fine memorial.

HEADLINE: Outlawing Russia's Sex Traders 

 BODY:
With criminal ease, Russia's organized gangs use young people's dreams to lure them into the back rooms of the world. Work in tourism abroad, a well-dressed woman promises. Model for glamorous magazines in America, a smooth-talking man suggests. Then, all too suddenly, the struggling shop girl, the lonely young boy or the frantic single mother wakes up as a prostitute in a foreign country with no time for dreams and no way to escape. 
 Last week, the Russian parliament took a much-needed step toward cracking down on this brutal human trafficking. The Duma drafted a law that would require the government to warn Russians about the deceitful methods used to turn women and children into modern-day sex slaves. The bill, which needs to be approved by the Russian government and then enforced by police, would make trafficking in humans illegal. And it would require authorities to provide real help for those forced into servitude. Given Russia's crime-ridden society, it will not solve the problem. But without it, criminal gangs will be freer to earn an estimated $7 billion a year trafficking in unwilling prostitutes. Human rights groups have suggested that thousands of Russians are dragged away each year to underground brothels around the world. 
 Russia is not the only nation with a booming slave business, but its effort to change the laws comes at the right time. Under a law passed in 2000, Washington issues an annual list of nations that are "significant" contributors to this growing global problem. This year, the law allows President Bush to withhold aid or impose limited sanctions if countries like Turkey, Bosnia, Indonesia and Cambodia fail to make an effort to combat this scourge. That threat is an important tool to force governments like Russia's to lock up slave traders and help their desperate victims.

'Medicaid' As a Verb, Then a Crutch

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
GOV. GEORGE E. PATAKI wants New York to cut Medicaid. The country's Cadillac of Medicaid programs is just too expensive, says he.
 What he neglects to say is how the program got that way in the first place. Enrollment is rising (the recession) and the population is aging (it happens). But there is another factor: the governor's own policies. 
Mr. Pataki ran for his first term in 1994 pledging to tame Medicaid -- health insurance for the poor, elderly and disabled. But he learned. Following entrenched New York tradition, he did not cut Medicaid. He expanded it, offering coverage to more of the state's working poor and using Medicaid funds to finance salary increases for hospital union members whose leader, Dennis Rivera, then endorsed him. 
Mr. Pataki was so successful in expanding what he once pledged to shrink that now he is trying to return to his fiscally conservative roots.
His conduct should not surprise New Yorkers. Their governors have treated Medicaid like a political tool since its origins in the mid-1960's; Nelson A. Rockefeller realized that it provided a way to subsidize health services that the state and local governments were providing, and went after every last dollar. (Washington picks up half of Medicaid's costs, and in New York, the state and localities share the rest.)
"Medicaid became a verb -- to Medicaid," said James R. Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund, a health care policy and research organization. "We Medicaid things." It wasn't long before New York was using Medicaid to pay for new and expanded services. Better to get some federal dollars than none, went the thinking in New York, though many other states were wary of the financial burden. 
There are many reasons for New York's expensive Medicaid program, ranging from the ever-high cost of doing business in the state to the disproportionate number of elderly and disabled people who need long-term care. The large immigrant population is also a factor, as is New York's generous menu of Medicaid services.
But many economists say that the central reason for the cost is "Medicaiding," a way of political life. The state spends more of its money on only one thing, education.
Instead of cutting Medicaid, Mr. Pataki channeled Medicaid money to a program called Family Health Plus, which provides health insurance to adults who earn too much for Medicaid, and used the program to guarantee a raise to members of the politically influential hospital workers' union. 
Except for critics from the right, few would fault expanding health care to the working poor, especially with the growing number of uninsured people in the state. But with the budget so out of whack now, how to pay for this new program? Money from the large tobacco settlement helps pay the state's share. Now Mr. Pataki wants to use the tobacco money to help close the budget gap.
SO under his proposed budget, fewer New Yorkers could qualify for Family Health Plus.
There is no talk, though, of touching the union deal. A deal is apparently a deal and under it, the state raised the rates of payments to hospitals and nursing homes -- not to cover patient care, but to cover the salary increases. The state's share of the raises was to come from two sources: the conversion of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield to a profit-making insurance company from a nonprofit one, and higher Medicaid reimbursement rates that, despite broad warnings to the contrary, the governor counted on from Washington.
As many expected, those higher rates did not materialize. And as critics often note, the Blue Cross conversion could have financed the very kinds of health care services now on the chopping block. In other words, as in other states, the conversion money could have cushioned the recession's blow. 
Mr. Pataki, the off-again-on-again fiscal conservative, has imposed policies that leave him little option but to demand cuts in Medicaid. What he gave, he would now take away. He wants local governments to raise their Medicaid contribution to cover hospital stays and clinic visits, in exchange for the state picking up the cost of prescription drugs. Along with scaling back Family Health Plus, he would also reduce hospital reimbursement rates.
With his proposed cuts facing strong opposition, he is not likely to get everything he wants, but he will get some of it. That leaves those who might be hurt by the cuts to look to the future. For as sure as boom follows bust, the cycle will repeat itself some day in New York, proud and predictable home of "Medicaiding."

Secretary of State Colin L. Powell will try today to narrow sharp differences with China on the United States' two most important foreign policy goals: dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons programs and disarming Iraq.
 In meetings with President Jiang Zemin and his successor-in-waiting, Hu Jintao, the Communist Party secretary general, Mr. Powell will urge China to play a more forceful role in pressing North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs and meet with the United States in a "multilateral forum," American officials said. 
 "China has considerable influence," Mr. Powell said on Friday, noting that China is the principal supplier of food and fuel aid to North Korea. 
Speaking of the Chinese, a senior State Department official said today, "They can do more."
Mr. Powell is on the second leg of a three-nation Asian tour, having met with senior Japanese officials over the weekend. From China, he will proceed to South Korea for the inauguration on Tuesday of Roh Moo Hyun as president.
On Iraq, Mr. Powell is expected to encourage the Chinese not to veto a new United Nations resolution that the United States and Britain plan to introduce into the Security Council early this week.
China, along with France and Russia, opposes the use of military force to disarm Iraq, and all three are permanent members of the Security Council with the power to veto United Nations resolutions.
American officials are hoping that China can be persuaded to abstain on the Iraq resolution. Though China is uncomfortable with the United States projecting its military power across much of the globe, it also wants to maintain its improving relations with the United States, those officials say.
Mr. Powell predicted on Sunday that the Security Council would act on the new resolution soon after Hans Blix, one of the chief United Nations weapons inspectors, briefs the Council on his latest findings on March 7. 
He said the resolution would be "simple" and "to the point" in declaring that Iraq had failed to comply with past United Nations resolutions requiring it to disarm. The resolution would be viewed as authorizing military action to enforce disarmament, American officials said.
Mr. Powell also described the United States as entering a period of "intense diplomacy" on Iraq, and he urged Japan and other American allies to lobby members of the Council to support the Iraq resolution.
"It is time to take action," Mr. Powell said in a news conference in Tokyo. "The evidence has been clear. They are guilty."
On North Korea, Mr. Powell is looking for the Chinese to persuade the North Koreans to attend a "multilateral forum" where a side meeting with the United States could be arranged, American officials said. 
The United States has proposed inviting North Korea to a meeting sponsored by the European Union and the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China, South Korea, Australia and Japan. But North Korea has rejected that idea, demanding one-on-one talks with the United States that would cover a number of issues, including economic aid and a nonaggression pact. 
The Bush administration has said it will talk to North Korea only about permanently dismantling its nuclear programs, and only in a multilateral setting. Once North Korea "steps back" from its weapons program, the United States will be willing to discuss economic assistance and security agreements, American officials said. 
"You can't eat plutonium," Mr. Powell said in Tokyo, a reference to North Korea's urgent need for food aid and agricultural assistance. "As long as you pursue those technologies, those who can help you grow the things that you can eat and develop an economy that will assist your people can't help you."
In Japan over the weekend, Mr. Powell encouraged Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi to help persuade fence-sitting members of the Security Council to support the American-sponsored Iraq resolution.
American officials say that although Japan does not have a seat on the Security Council, it maintains good relations with several of the 10 nonpermanent Council members, in large part because of its substantial foreign aid commitments. 
"We hope that the prime minister and foreign minister, because they have been supporting our efforts, will continue to support those efforts," Mr. Powell said in Tokyo. "I hope that once they see the resolution, they will find it the appropriate thing to do to show support for that and to contact members" of the Council.
But it remains unclear how strongly Japan will press the United States' case on Iraq. Mr. Koizumi, who has supported passage of a new resolution, is also under pressure from some members of his own Liberal Democratic Party to avoid supporting a war.
In Japan, as in much of Europe, opinion polls indicate that there is strong public opposition to military action against Iraq. For that reason, Mr. Koizumi and his advisers have tempered their comments in recent days, saying their support for a new resolution does not constitute support for war. 
"We have yet to reach a stage in which we should make a decision on it," Ms. Kawaguchi said on Japanese television on Sunday when asked whether Japan supports going to war against Iraq.
American officials are hoping that Japan will eventually provide fuel and perhaps warships for a military strike against Iraq. 
Japanese ships are assisting the United States in naval operations around the Indian Ocean as part of American efforts to destroy remnants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. But Japanese officials have indicated that they will need a vote of the Japanese Parliament to authorize the use of those ships in a military action against Iraq.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: KOREAN PENINSULA; 
U.S. Approach on North Korea Is Straining Alliances in Asia

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
With little of the clamor generated by preparations for war with Iraq, the showdown between the United States and North Korea over that country's nuclear weapons program is severely testing Washington's oldest Asian alliances.
 In recent weeks, senior officials in officially pacifist Japan have spoken of mounting a "pre-emptive strike" against North Korea, if it appeared that the heavily armed Communist state intended to use its ballistic missiles against Japan. 
 "Our nation will use military force as a self-defense measure if they start to resort to arms against Japan," said Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba.
For many Japanese commentators, Mr. Ishiba's statement was meant to draw attention to the fact that Japan in reality has no strike ability. More than as a credible threat against North Korea, it was intended to influence a debate that has gathered momentum during the administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi over giving the country's armed forces, which face sharp constitutional limits on their action, a larger role in the country's defense, and in making Japan a player in international security again. 
When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrives here on Monday for the inauguration of Roh Moo Hyun as president of South Korea, he will try to narrow differences with a man whose response to tensions with North Korea has been virtually the opposite of Japan's and, if anything, even more radical.
Mr. Roh has given strong indications that he intends to accelerate South Korea's embrace of North Korea, even as the United States looks for ways to ratchet up pressure on North Korea.
To the dismay of Washington, Mr. Roh has spoken in recent weeks of establishing an economic community with North Korea, stepping up trade, aid and investment there, ruling out economic sanctions and military strikes against the country and even of personally "guaranteeing" North Korea's security.
The president-elect said he would replace the current armistice agreement with a treaty between the Koreas in order to ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula.
"It is better to struggle than to suffer deaths in a war," Mr. Roh said in a speech to the Federation of Korean Trade Unions. "Koreans should stand together, although things will get difficult when the United States bosses us around."
A senior South Korean diplomat said: "It looks like Roh is prepared to throw the alliance away and make common cause with North Korea. We don't understand why he seems to trust North Korea so completely."
While Japan looks nervously at North Korea and is beginning to explore ways to augment its alliance with the United States, South Koreans and experts in this country's affairs are contemplating the end of the five-decade-old alliance between the countries, at least as it has existed, with 37,000 American troops on the front lines here.
"The Japanese are on the spot because the U.S. alliance with South Korea is defunct, and there is no point in insisting on it any more," said Robyn Lim, a regional security expert at Nanzan University in Japan. "The U.S. alliance with Japan is integrally linked with the U.S. alliance with South Korea. Indeed, since the Korean War, the American presence in South Korea has been as much about protecting Japan as it was about South Korea."
Increasingly, the United States is on the spot in South Korea, as well. Mr. Roh, a liberal labor lawyer with almost no international experience, began appointing relatively conservative aides to his national security team today, in what appeared to be a bid to reassure Washington.
He has also distanced himself from the anti-American protests that occurred here throughout the December electoral campaign and seemed to favor his candidacy. Most important, after campaigning for a "more equitable" alliance with the United States, he has said that he sees a place for American troops in this country, even after the two Koreas are united.
There are already signs of a deep distrust of Mr. Roh in the Bush administration. American military officials here say plans are being drawn up to remove thousands of American troops from positions along the demilitarized zone between South and North Korea, and to close the headquarters of American forces in Korea at Yongsan, in the heart of the Seoul, as rapidly as possible.
In a private conversation here last week, a senior American military analyst here said there were profound doubts about what the new South Korean government would do if the United States struck at North Korea's nuclear facilities.
Referring to North Korea's leader, the analyst said: "Kim Jong Il would probably attack our troops on the DMZ and then pick up the phone to Roh and say: 'If the Americans retaliate, I will have to strike back again. We don't want to kill Koreans, but the Americans' Yongsan base is in the middle of your capital. You must do something to stop the Americans.' "
Under such circumstances, the analyst said, Washington would have little confidence in Mr. Roh, who has said he would never support the use of force against North Korea.
Just as the United States is rumored to be contemplating moving its military bases out of Germany, there has been a great deal of talk here, still unofficial but inconceivable even a few months ago, about a possible phase-out of the American military presence in this country.
"As both our forces have modernized, the possibilities for a new division of roles have grown," said the United States ambassador, Thomas C. Hubbard, in a recent speech here, in which he reaffirmed the American interest in retaining troops here.
South Koreans have paid close attention to the recent rift between Washington and its traditional European allies, Germany and France, and many complain that the talk of an American withdrawal is fed by the petulance of a United States that is not accustomed to Asian allies articulating a strong vision of their own security interests.
"Should the United States give up Korea so easily?" said Paik Hak Sun, director of Inter-Korean Studies Program at the Sejong Institute, an independent policy group. "An American rivalry with China is inevitable. Japan will always be a close ally of the United States, for fear of China, but the Korean Peninsula is a lot closer to China, and if the U.S. can keep its troops here it can counter China better and compete for the friendship of the Korean people."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Salomon Reviews Parts of Account

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
The Salomon Smith Barney division of Citigroup in New York has started a review for the creative and media parts of its account, which would proceed without the incumbent agencies, McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising and Universal McCann in New York.
 The creative part of the account had been handled by McCann-Erickson, and the media part by Universal McCann; both are divisions of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
A spokeswoman for McCann-Erickson, Susan Irwin, confirmed a report of the review in the online edition of Adweek. Ms. Irwin described the parting of ways as amicable, adding that the agencies had decided not to take part in the review. 
 The review comes four months after Citigroup announced that it would separate the global equity research and private wealth-management operations of Salomon Smith Barney from the corporate and investment banking operations.
Among other agencies that work for Citigroup are Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe, which said it would not take part in the review; and Merkley Newman Harty & Partners in New York, part of the Omnicom Group.
Ad spending by Salomon Smith Barney rises and falls with the fortunes of the stock market. It increased from $35 million in 1998 to $65 million in 2000, according to CMR, the division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending in major media, and then declined to $20 million in 2001, the last full year for which data were available.

HEADLINE: TV Networks Plan Flood Of Reality For Summer 

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
If you think network television is awash in reality shows now, just wait until summer.
 The four big networks are preparing to unleash at least two dozen reality shows from June to September, dwarfing the number currently on their schedules and more than doubling the number they broadcast last summer. 
 In "Roseanne," for example, camera crews will follow the comedian Roseanne Barr as she pitches a cooking show to cable networks and searches for men on a Jewish Internet dating service. "The Will" plans to enlist a rich benefactor to put his potential heirs through all sorts of tests to determine who will inherit his fortune. And then there is "The Simple Life," a reality-show version of the old situation comedy "Green Acres," in which a pair of privileged young women, the hotel heiress Paris Hilton and her best friend Nicole Richie, will move in with a hardscrabble farm family. 
Television executives originally embraced such limited-run reality shows as an inexpensive way to combat the glut of summer repeats that always advanced the erosion of their audiences by inviting viewers to flock to cable channels. But the summer months also increasingly serve as a petri dish for the networks' regular seasons; where the biggest summer reality hits, like "Survivor" and "American Idol," can be transplanted into in-season schedules. 
Over the last four years such moves have radically altered the competitive balance among the networks, and, for many younger viewers, have made traditional sitcoms, dramas or newsmagazine programs look dated -- and vulnerable. Aware of this track record, many television executives view this coming summer as the ultimate laboratory for a restructuring, if not outright reinvention of the business.
"The economics of television demand cheaper shows like this," said Michael Davies, the producer of the former prime-time hit "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," whose coming summer reality show "Wife Swap" will have families from different social strataexchange mothers for two weeks. 
"To exclusively have had expensive scripted dramas and comedies was perverse," Mr. Davies said. "You could not afford it. I think you're going to find the whole nature of the television season, with 22-episode cycles of scripted shows, changed."
Many viewers, especially those in the young adult groups that most networks and advertisers covet, have welcomed the transformation. Last week offered the starkest proof yet. Seven reality shows were among the 13-highest rated shows, topped by the 40 million who watched "Joe Millionaire" on the Fox Network pick his special someone and offer his hand in temporary stardom. Those ratings are comparable to an Academy Awards broadcast.
"I watch them all," said Traci Brandon, 25, a indexer at Corbis, a photo agency, in New York. "These real people, they're just crazy. They're a lot more interesting to watch than what writers are coming up with. And they're funnier, too."
Bibi Prival, 28, a special events coordinator at the Sense of Smell Institute in New York, said that because escapism is at the heart of these shows' appeal, intelligence need not be a crucial ingredient.
"When a scripted show isn't smart, it's bad; but when a reality show isn't smart, for some reason, it's entertaining," Ms. Prival said. "For some reason, you get off on the vapidity, sluttiness, stupidity and awkwardness of these shows."
All those qualities figure to be on ample display everywhere on television this summer. ABC, which has been the busiest network this season in the reality field, with shows like "The Bachelorette" and "Are You Hot?" will contribute up to six more entries this summer. Besides "Roseanne" and "The Will," the network has also scheduled a PG-rated version of the film "Indecent Proposal" called "Love for Sale," in which an unmarried couple is offered a large sum of money to have one of them go off on a vacation with a stranger of the opposite sex. ABC is also considering a show in which hopeful palooka boxers will work toward a Rocky-inspired match with Mike Tyson.
Fox plans another edition of "Temptation Island" along with "The Simple Life." Executives at the network are withholding details about other prospective titles, but acknowledge Fox could have as many as five entries this summer. 
CBS has announced three summer reality shows, including new seasons of "Big Brother" and "Amazing Race," and may add one or two more. Its main new entry: "Cupid," described by the CBS executive in charge of reality, Ghen Maynard, as "Blind Date" meets "American Idol." (Simon Cowell, the acerbic British judge on "American Idol" is one of the producers.) A young woman and her two best friends will form a panel to judge young suitors who must make an impression with their looks, talent or personality within 30 seconds. Ten finalists will then go on dates with the young woman, and the ultimate winner is chosen by audience votes.
No network, however, will be as aggressive this summer as NBC, which plans no fewer than 10 summer reality series.
NBC, unlike the other networks, has not created a blockbuster reality show, and, at least partly as a result, has seen its long-term dominance among younger adults falter over the last six weeks. Fox, fueled by "Joe Millionaire" and "American Idol," has surged ahead.
So NBC is packing its schedule, hoping one or more reality entries will become a success. The ideas include four talent contests similar to "American Idol" -- for movie action heroes, comedians and two categories of singers, children under 16 and so-called senior citizens. In the singular world of network television, "seniors" are defined as people over 35.
NBC will also have its dating division, including "Around the World in 80 Dates," a kind of international "Bachelor," who will add contestants from various countries to his planeload of available young women as the show goes along. The network has even scheduled "The Restaurant," a behind-the-scenes look at the start-up of a restaurant in Manhattan.
This assemblage from the big networks does not even count the plans of cable networks, many of which have their own plans for the genre, nor the efforts of the part-time broadcast networks, the WB and UPN, which plan competition shows featuring surfers and fashion models respectively. Between those channels and cable, 10 or more additional reality series could easily be added. 
In all cases, the shows will have short runs of 5 to 11 weeks, which many executives see as a key to the success of reality shows. "We've finally learned what the rest of the world has known for a long time: Telenovelas work," said Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC Entertainment, referring to the limited-run soap operas popular in Latin American countries and elsewhere. "You put on eight episodes, nobody has to make a long-term commitment."
Network executives acknowledge that their reality strategy contains risks, beginning with the possibility of oversaturation. "It scares me to death," one senior entertainment executive said. "If this bubble bursts and you've relied on this stuff exclusively, you're going to be dead."
Numerous executives cited the example of ABC's over-reliance on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" after it became the first of the explosive summer hits in 1999. ABC cut back on developing scripted series and when the ratings for "Millionaire" collapsed, the network's fortunes went with it. 
"This is all about balance and using your unscripted hits strategically," said Sandy Grushow, the chairman of Fox Entertainment. While Fox's surge in the last few weeks can be attributed largely to the strength of its reality hits, Mr. Grushow said the network has used the shows like "American Idol" to bolster the ratings of some existing scripted shows on its schedule like the highly regarded drama "24."
Many executives said the biggest unknown is how the possible outbreak of a war with Iraq might affect the audience's taste for these kinds of shows. "Every one of these felt wrong after 9/11, so we have to see," said Lloyd Braun, the chairman of ABC Entertainment. 
The summer glut is certain to weed out the lesser ideas, Mr. Zucker said. "The best programs will survive," he said. "We're in the middle of a frenzy now. But things will eventually recalibrate themselves." 
Still, he concluded, "It's going to be a wild summer."

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
Key to Domestic Agenda Could Be Victory in Iraq

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: CRAWFORD, Tex. 

 BODY:
For months now at the White House, it has been all Iraq, all the time. On Saturday at his ranch here, President Bush met with the prime minister of Spain to talk about Iraq. On Tuesday in the Oval Office, he will meet with the prime minister of Bulgaria to talk about Iraq. This past Thursday in Georgia, he gave a speech about the American economy -- and talked about Iraq.
 Administration officials readily acknowledge that Iraq has drowned out most of the discussion of Mr. Bush's domestic agenda. "There's not a lot of oxygen in the air," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. 
 But what administration officials and Republicans close to the White House also concede is that the president's ability to sell the public and Congress on one of the most ambitious domestic agendas in decades is linked to the outcome of the potential war in Iraq, with victory a turnkey to legislative success. A victory, they say, would give momentum to the president's plans to cut taxes and overhaul Medicare, which right now face objections even from some members of Mr. Bush's own party.
"If Saddam decided to leave the country tomorrow," a senior White House official said last week, "a lot of that uncertainty would be removed, and I think you would see salutary effects in a number of areas, including on the legislative and political fronts."
Officially, there is no linkage. Administration officials say publicly that they would be foolish to count on the political capital from a war that could, after all, go wrong. "Medicare needs to be modernized, and people deserve jobs regardless of what happens in Iraq," said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary. "We don't tie the two together." 
But if the war is protracted, with rising costs and increasing casualties, say some Republicans and centrist Democrats the White House is relying on, Mr. Bush's proposals will languish.
"If we get tied up in Iraq, it's going to make it more difficult to get a domestic agenda that costs a lot of money," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, who is regularly consulted by the White House. "If it goes well, obviously things can change dramatically."
It is hard not to ignore the obvious, which is that the domestic agenda and a possible war are moving forward in parallel time. The White House strategy is to push the centerpiece of the agenda, Mr. Bush's $670 billion package of tax cuts, into the legislative process now, so that the proposal will be up for debate on Capitol Hill this spring and summer -- when it is possible that the president will have emerged victorious on Iraq. That is a lesson learned, Republicans say, from Mr. Bush's father, who after the American victory in the 1991 Persian Gulf war had only a minor legislative agenda to offer Capitol Hill.
"He could have had anything he wanted from a Democratic Congress, but they never had a domestic Desert Storm to follow up," said David R. Gergen, a White House adviser in the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and Clinton administrations. "This group has been smart enough to know that if they have an array of proposals already fleshed out in the pipeline, with debate under way, with committees considering them, the president marching in with an 85 percent approval rating can push through far more than the normal political process will allow."
Other Republicans agree, up to a point.
"It's quite natural that if he would have a big international victory, it would help him," said Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the most influential senator on tax legislation. "But he shouldn't count on it."
As Mr. Bush headed back to the wintry landscape of Washington yesterday after a long weekend at his ranch, where he drove Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain through the greening fields in the presidential pick-up truck, he faced a meeting with the nation's governors on Monday, a session with his economic advisers on Tuesday and a speech to a Latino coalition on Wednesday.
But the reality underneath the domestic bustle is that Mr. Bush's week will be dominated by his battle for votes in the United Nations Security Council on a new resolution authorizing military force against Saddam Hussein.
The march toward Baghdad that started back in August is in a period of "final deliberations," Mr. Bush declared this weekend, signaling that Mr. Hussein may have only weeks before an American attack.
Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans say that for all practical purposes, Medicare, prescription drugs and Mr. Bush's proposal to eliminate the dividend tax, to name just his top domestic priorities, are waiting for Iraq.

Firing Leaflets and Electrons, U.S. Wages Information War

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
Even before President Bush orders American forces to loose bullets and bombs on Iraq, the military is starting an ambitious assault using a growing arsenal of electronic and psychological weapons on the information battlefield.
 American cyber-warfare experts recently waged an e-mail assault, directed at Iraq's political, military and economic leadership, urging them to break with Saddam Hussein's government. A wave of calls has gone to the private cellphone numbers of specially selected officials inside Iraq, according to leaders at the Pentagon and in the regional Central Command. 
 As of last week, more than eight million leaflets had been dropped over Iraq -- including towns 65 miles south of Baghdad -- warning Iraqi antiaircraft missile operators that their bunkers will be destroyed if they track or fire at allied warplanes. In the same way, a blunt offer has gone to Iraqi ground troops: surrender, and live. 
But the leaflets are old-fashioned instruments compared with some of the others that are being applied already or are likely to be used soon.
Radio transmitters hauled aloft by Air Force Special Operations EC-130E planes are broadcasting directly to the Iraqi public in Arabic with programs that mimic the program styles of local radio stations and are more sophisticated than the clumsy preachings of previous wartime propaganda efforts.
"Do not let Saddam tarnish the reputation of soldiers any longer," one recent broadcast said. "Saddam uses the military to persecute those who don't agree with his unjust agenda. Make the decision."
Military planners at the United States Central Command expect to rely on many kinds of information warfare -- including electronic attacks on power grids, communications systems and computer networks, as well as deception and psychological operations -- to break the Iraqi military's will to fight and sway Iraqi public opinion. 
Commanders may use supersecret weapons that could flash millions of watts of electricity to cripple Iraqi computers and equipment, and literally turn off the lights in Baghdad if the campaign escalates to full-fledged combat.
"The goal of information warfare is to win without ever firing a shot," said James R. Wilkinson, a spokesman for the Central Command in Tampa, Fla. "If action does begin, information warfare is used to make the conflict as short as possible."
Senior military officials say, for example, that the American radio shows broadcast from the EC-130E "Commando Solo" planes follow the format of a popular Iraqi station, "Voice of the Youth," managed by President Hussein's older son, Uday.
The American programs open with greetings in Arabic, followed by Euro-pop and 1980's American rock music -- intended to appeal to younger Iraqi troops, perceived by officials as the ones most likely to lay down their arms. The broadcasts include traditional Iraqi folk music, so as not to alienate other listeners, and a news program in Arabic prepared by Army psychological operations experts at Fort Bragg, N.C.
Then comes the official message: Any war is not against the Iraqi people, but is to disarm Mr. Hussein and end his government.
American commanders say they believe that these psychological salvos have, to some degree, influenced Iraqi forces to move their defenses or curtail their antiaircraft fire.
"It pays to drop the leaflets," Lt. Gen. T. Michael Moseley, commander of allied air forces in the Persian Gulf, said by telephone from his headquarters in Saudi Arabia. "It sends a direct message to the operator on the gun. It sends a direct message to the chain of command."
Deceptionand psychological operations have been a part of warfare for centuries, and American commanders carried out limited information attacks -- both psychological operations, or "psyops," and more traditional electronic warfare like jamming or crippling the enemy's equipment -- in the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and the air campaign over Kosovo in 1999, as well as in Afghanistan. But commanders looking back on those campaigns say their current planning is much broader and more tightly integrated into the main war plan than ever before.
"What we're seeing now is the weaving of electronic warfare, psyops and other information warfare through every facet of the plan from our peacetime preparations through execution," said Maj. Gen. Paul J. Lebras, chief of the Joint Information Operations Center, a secretive military agency based in Texas that has sent a team of experts to join the Central Command info-warfare team for the Iraq campaign.
As modern combat relies increasingly on precision strikes at targets carried out over long distances, the military is likewise increasingly aware that there are many ways to disable the operations at those targets.
An adversary's antiaircraft radar site, for example, can be destroyed by a bomb or missile launched by a warplane; it can be captured or blown up by ground forces; or the enemy soldiers running the radar can be persuaded to shut down the system and just go home.
"We are trying very hard to be empathetic with the Iraqi military," said a senior American information warfare official. "We understand their situation. The same for the Iraqi population. We wish them no harm. We will take great pains to make those people understand that they should stay away from military equipment."
Even so, the military's most ardent advocates of information warfare acknowledge that American pilots ordered into enemy airspace would rather be told that antiaircraft sites were struck first by ordnance, rather than by leaflets.
Aerial pictures help the military assess bomb damage to a target. The softer kind of strike is harder to assess.
Information warfare experts look for what they call "the voila moment."
"In Afghanistan, the biggest lesson we learned in our tactical information operations -- the radio and TV broadcasts -- was the importance in explaining, 'Why are we here?' " a senior American military officer said. "The majority of Afghanis did not know that Sept. 11 occurred. They didn't even know of our great tragedy."
During the war in Afghanistan, this officer said, "The voila moment came when we saw that the population understood why coalition forces were fighting the Taliban and Al Qaeda."
In Iraq, he said, "it will be when we see a break with the leadership."
Delivering radios to the people of Afghanistan presented a particular problem. About 500 were air-dropped over the country, and all of them were destroyed on impact. The military and aid groups passed out more than 6,500, and millions of leaflets were dropped telling the Afghan people of frequencies used for the American broadcasts.
The American military also took over one important frequency, 8.7 megahertz, used by the Taliban for its official radio broadcasts. That became possible once the towers used by the Taliban for relaying their military commands were blown up as part of the war effort. As in most totalitarian governments, the military and government used the same system for their radio broadcasts. The American military continues to broadcast to the Afghan people over that channel.
Improvisation remains a hallmark of the emerging information war, said Brig. Gen. Thomas P. Maney, of the Army's Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command.
In Afghanistan, General Maney said, the American military found it hard to get its radio and television messages out to many villages that had access to neither. So Special Forces troops made contact with local coffee-house managers, and offered them the same radio programs being broadcast from Commando Solo planes, but on compact discs to be played over a boom box for the patrons.
The program gave birth to a new icon on the military's maps of Afghanistan: a tiny picture of a coffee mug to indicate the location of village businesses that agreed to play CD copies of the American radio programming.
If Mr. Bush orders an attack against Iraq, the information offensive will expand to a fierce but invisible war of electrons. Air commanders will rely on a small but essential fleet of surveillance and reconnaissance aircraft, including the radar-jamming EC-130H Compass Call and electronic-eavesdropping RC-135 Rivet Joint. There are just over a dozen of each aircraft in the American arsenal.
Flying from Prince Sultan Air Base, outside Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the Rivet Joint is already playing an important role in collecting Iraqi radio and radar emissions, which are jammed when American and British planes in the no-flight zones periodically attack targets on the ground. The RC-135, a military version of a Boeing 707 jet with a bulbous nose filled with sensors, is essentially a flying listening post, orbiting at the edge of the battlefield above 30,000 feet.
In the rear of the planes, filled with high-powered computers and other sensors, intelligence specialists, many of whom speak Arabic or Farsi, monitor the airwaves, intercepting conversations from military communications links or other networks. Much of this information is passed to the National Security Agency for analysis.
At the front of the plane, which has a 32-member crew, electronic warfare specialists sit at a separate bank of computers, gathering up radar signals of all kinds, including Iraqi air defenses. Rivet Joints have the ability to scan automatically across an array of communications frequencies, allowing an operator to home in on individual frequencies and pass that information on to the Awacs radar or J-Stars ground-surveillance planes, which have better ability to pinpoint the locations of the transmissions.
The Compass Call is a modified C-130 cargo plane, also filled with high-powered computers and sensors. Usually flying at above 20,000 feet and, ideally, about 80 to 100 miles from the target to be jammed, the Compass Calls are directed to their targets by the Rivet Joints, other aircraft or targets identified in their pre-mission planning. The 13-member crews include linguists, cryptologists, other analysts and the flight personnel.
Metal antenna cables hang down from the plane's tail in a distinctive pattern that looks like a metal trapeze or cheese-cutter. Electronic signals are collected from sensors in the blunt nose of the airplane; antennae in the rear of the aircraft blast electrons that jam enemy radar and other communications.
Flying perpendicular to the target to maximize the jamming, on-board specialists lock on to the frequencies to be disrupted. The plane can jam multiple targets at once. When it comes time to carry out a mission, a flight officer pushes a little red button on a computer keyboard, "JAM," and up to 800 watts of power is zapped at the target. If the target switches frequency, the Compass Call operators are ready to jam that ina constant cat-and-mouse game.
In a war against Iraq, military commanders say, new technology will probably allow those electronic combat planes to plant false targets in Iraqi radars and spoof the air defense systems.
In an interview, Gen. John P. Jumper, the Air Force chief of staff, declined to discuss the highly classified technical advances, except to say, "We're approaching the point where we can tell the SA-10 radar it is a Maytag washer and not a radar, and put it in the rinse cycle instead of the firing cycle."

Wounded Democrats Check Out an Ever-Growing, Ever-Hungry Crowd

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It may not be the biggest confidence builder for the tattered Democrats that they are pinning their early hope for resurrection on Demzilla as much as on a Kerry, an Edwards or a Gephardt. 
 Demzilla is the nom de guerre of the party's huge new computerized roll of potential voters and donors. This is the database that party leaders hope will make up for their flaws last November when the Republicans stunned them in Congressional upsets that were a true tour de force by President Bush. 
 Demzilla's potential remained to be seen last weekend as the party's national committee met and resorted to the human element in its gropings for a deus ex machina. The party listened and puzzled as six presidential aspirants grew to eight, with two in post-op recuperation, one or two more in the wings and the early field approaching Wagnerian dimensions. A lone Democrat held up a "Draft Gore" plea in the hotel lobby. The party's professionals brushed past her as the ghost of debacles past. 
Duct tape jokes signaled the Democrats' craving for combat, the companion emotion to desperation in the partisan life cycle. The parade of aspirants -- a spectacle of fresh, outsized human ambition -- felt comforting amid the capital's relentless talk of war. In the opening rhetoric, the candidates showed their ever-evolving stuff: a re-energized Representative Richard Gephardt, defending his undeniable hawkishness, gave way to a boldly confident outsider, Gov. Howard Dean, a wryly disarming Rev. Al Sharpton and the gleaming, hungrily determined Senator John Edwards booming "Bring it on!" to Republicans at the White House. 
They all stirred the hall with a mix of old themes and fresh outrage. But most seemed circuitous and wary on the season's inescapable issue, President Bush's daily threat of war with Iraq. Pure, outright opposition to war was hard to hear from the better-known contenders who had already endorsed the war possibility in the long-ago of last year. Now they criticize President Bush as far too "unilateralist" in his approach. 
The war issue remained the 800-pound gorilla lounging about the hall in full combat gear as the Democrats sought to cobble a multi-issue agenda. They honed attacks on the president's deficit growth and tax shrinkage policies ("The surplus is harder to find than Osama bin Laden") and on the anxious-to-parlous state of homeland security ("the nation's color-coded nightmare"). 
More than the candidates, however, it was members of the audience, in their gradations of cheers and applause, who provided the clearest measure of where the Democrats are right now. What they showed they want above all is electability, someone with Bill Clinton's genius for adapting to the middle ground, wherever it proves to be by Election Day. For all the spirited riffs of old party principle that sporadically stirred the crowd, the craving for someone more palatable in the long run than bold in the short run seemed palpable. The impassioned antiwar speech of Representative Dennis Kucinich, the out-and-out dove, proved no stemwinder. And the measured assault on the last great glass ceiling by former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun was received as a nostalgic touch of party inclusiveness more than as a cutting-edge possibility.
Only one voice cried "Shame!" when Mr. Gephardt, clearly yearning to stress his populist health care proposal, had to defend his writing the Congressional resolution against Iraq last year. The crowd's preferred definition of a "peace candidate" was Dr. Dean, who seemed the most skillful in making the "unilateralist" attack sound like some larger campaign cry about the war. Senator Joseph Lieberman was an unstirring standout as the unapologetic hawk, a candidate clearly marching to some centrist drumbeat he hears beyond the pacifist winds of the Iowa winter.
If nothing else, hilariously forgivable assertions certified the survival of America's realpolitik: "My political career has never been about getting elected," said Dr. Dean. And Ms. Moseley-Braun insisted she was only here in the free-media limelight because "citizens from across the country challenged her to run." 
Mr. Sharpton, demonstrating how he manages to stay in a game the party professionals wish he'd never play, succeeded as the crowd-stirrer with the snappiest lines. Democrats delighted as he defined the new "who-do voodoo economics": "We never got the trickle; we got the down." And President Bush's personal debt to affirmative action: "He's the ultimate recipient of a set-aside program. The Supreme Court set aside the whole election for him."
But laughter vaporized as the Democrats left for their home precincts, knowing bemusement is no substitute for a victory strategy. Their search is officially on for someone to repair the party psyche and give President Bush a believable run for his already considerable re-election money. They face a war-haunted future where the only certainty is the primary calendar's call to intraparty combat. The appropriate exit line seemed Mr. Edwards's parting caution: "What we stand for can't be cliches and criticism."

HEADLINE: Bush Proposes Major Changes In Health Plans 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER and ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 23 

 BODY:
President Bush has begun one of the most ambitious efforts to reinvent Medicare and Medicaid since the programs were created 38 years ago. Combined with his earlier plan for Social Security, the proposals offer a fundamentally different vision of social welfare policy, many experts say.
 Mr. Bush's proposals for Medicare and Medicaid, taking shape in recent weeks, would transform these pillars of the GreatSociety and their guarantee of health benefits to the elderly, disabled and poor. 
 States would have far more power to determine who receives what benefits in the Medicaid program, which covers 45 million low-income Americans. The elderly would rely more on private health plans, and less on the government, for their health benefits under Medicare, which covers 40 million elderly and disabled people. 
The administration's vision for Medicare and Social Security moves away from the notion that everyone should be in the same government-managed system with the same benefits. It promises individuals more choices, including the option of picking a private health plan or investing some of their Social Security taxes in the stock market.
But critics say these proposals would also mean less security, fewer guaranteed benefits and more financial risk for beneficiaries.
The magnitude of the Bush proposals is only gradually dawning on members of Congress. Unlike President Bill Clinton and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, Mr. Bush has not boasted about the boldness of his vision for these programs, perhaps because he is mindful of the voters' anxiety about major changes in health care. 
Indeed, a senior administration official dismissed the idea that Mr. Bush was attempting fundamental change in Medicare and Medicaid.
"We're looking at two programs that have worked, that have provided health coverage to people who need it, and we want to help them work better," the official said. "The idea is to strengthen and improve the programs."
A test for the administration will come in the next few days, as officials seek an endorsement of the Medicaid plan from the nation's governors, meeting here. The initial reaction at the governors' meeting today was mixed.
Administration officials and their allies in Congress, including some centrist Democrats, said such changes were essential to modernize creaky government programs and to stem the growth in entitlement spending.
"I think the administration, like all of us, is looking for an answer to the question of how we can afford all of this," said Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana and an influential member of the Ways and Means Committee. "How can we structure the system of health care for the elderly, in the case of Medicare, so that our society can afford the cost?"
Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security accounted for 42 percent of all federal spending last year, and that share is expected to grow.
But several architects of those programs argue that the Bush administration is retreating from the goals of the Great Society and the New Deal, and the promises the government made across the generations. The Bush plans, they say, are essentially an effort to limit the federal government's financial responsibilities and to cap what is now an open-ended guarantee of specific benefits -- an effort to move from a defined benefit to a defined contribution.
Robert M. Ball, who worked at the Social Security Administration for three decades and was commissioner from 1962 to 1973, said, "These proposals are a major departure from the principles that have governed the social insurance programs from the beginning."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and one of three remaining senators who were in Congress when it created Medicare, said, "Medicare and Medicaid are two of the most successful social programs ever enacted."
Mr. Kennedy added, "Medicare is a firm commitment to every elderly American, not a profit center for H.M.O.'s and other private insurance plans."
Mr. Bush's Medicare proposal, being revised after an earlier draft drew fire on Capitol Hill, would encourage many beneficiaries to leave traditional Medicare and get their benefits through private health plans associated with the program.
Administration officials assert such plans can manage care, tailor benefits and control costs better than traditional Medicare, one of the last bastions of fee-for-service medicine. The officials also argue that Medicare must be overhauled before Congress adds prescription drug benefits, a priority for each party.
"When it comes to cars, and when it comes to health care, 1965 is not the state of the art," Mr. Bush has said.
Democrats, as expected, are fiercely resisting the administration's plans, although there is widespread agreement on Capitol Hill that the program needs to be updated with a prescription drug benefit.
More troubling for the administration is the criticism that has come from influential Congressional Republicans, alarmed at the possibility that the administration might be overreaching. They have been particularly scathing about the possibility that the Bush plan would require the elderly to leave traditional Medicare and join a private plan to get drug benefits, discussed in the earlier draft.
Both sides in this debate have a strong sense that the nation is at a crossroads -- politically, philosophically and demographically -- as the entitlement programs are strained by an aging society.
The architects of Medicare said the program was created with some fundamental precepts that the Bush proposal would undermine: that all working Americans pay into the same Medicare system; that the healthy and the sick, the rich and the poor, end up in the same program; and that all have the same core benefits when they retire.
The idea that the elderly would be better served by a private, for-profit insurance market is anathema to these veterans of the Great Society. Before Medicare, they say, the private health insurance market was a failure for the elderly, nearly half of whom had no hospital coverage. They fear that private health plans would be tempted to recruit the healthiest of the elderly, leaving sicker, more costly patients to the original fee-for-service Medicare program.
Critics also argue that "choice," a favorite theme of the Bush administration, is not necessarily what the elderly want or need.
Dr. Philip R. Lee, recruited by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1965, said of the Bush administration: "They talk about giving people choice; Medicare gives people the choice of their individual practitioner. That's what most people think about when they think about choice."
The issues raised in the Medicaid debate revolve largely around the role of the federal government. Citing the model of the 1996 welfare law, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson says states can be trusted with far more authority to decide who receives what benefits.
The administration's proposal would offer states vast new power to reduce, eliminate or expand health benefits for low-income people, including many who are elderly or disabled. In return for the flexibility, and a temporary increase in federal assistance, states would eventually have to accept a limit on the federal contribution to the program's cost. The choice would be up to the states; they could stay with the existing program.
Administration officials say the plan would allow states to stretch scarce resources during fiscal crises. Critics assert it would replace the poor's entitlement to health care with a block grant to the states, just when the number of uninsured is rising.
Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democrat, said the new Medicaid proposal was "extremely risky in an uncertain economy."
There were other critics today among the governors. Janet Napolitano, the new governor of Arizona, a Democrat, expressed deep concern about the Bush administration's Medicaid proposal because, she said, the federal money would not keep pace with the rapid growth of the state's Medicaid program.
Noting that Arizona's population grew 40 percent from 1990 to 2000, a surge reflected in the state's Medicaid rolls, Ms. Napolitano added, "Fast-growing states in the West should be very, very concerned about this."
But Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, a Republican, was enthusiastic about the plan. "It's a great deal," Mr. Rowland said. "I'm very pleased with the prospect of greater state flexibility."
Mr. Thompson argued that the administration proposal would preserve comprehensive insurance for most of the poorest beneficiaries. But states would have "carte blanche," he said, to alter Medicaid coverage for about 15 million recipients."
States are not required to cover these people, but once they are on the Medicaid rolls, they have legally enforceable rights to benefits.
Mr. Bush's proposal for Social Security, first offered in the 2000 campaign, would also break sharply with the past by allowing workers to divert some of their payroll taxes to individual accounts that would be invested in stocks. While its political prospects have been dampened by the declining stock market, Mr. Bush reiterated his support for the idea last month in his State of the Union address.
Both sides agree that the coming debate over these proposals will be a fundamental clash of political philosophies -- over the obligations of government, the rights of the individual and the role of the private sector.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: REBUILDING IRAQ; 
U.S. Suggests Iraqi-Americans Will Help in Recovery Process

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Feb. 23 

 BODY:
To help rebuild Iraq when Saddam Hussein is ousted, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz said today, the Pentagon will begin recruiting Iraqi-Americans to serve in the military reserves and hiring them as translators and other temporary civilian employees.
 Mr. Wolfowitz announced the initiatives at an afternoon town hall meeting here in suburban Detroit, where thousands of Iraqi-Americans live, the largest such concentration in the United States. 
 Warning that there is now only a "small chance" to avoid war with Iraq, with more than 180,000 American forces massed in the Persian Gulf region, Mr. Wolfowitz appealed to an invitation-only audience of about 250 Iraqi immigrants and naturalized American citizens for their support in reshaping a post-Hussein Iraq. 
"We need to work together," Mr. Wolfowitz told an often boisterous anti-Hussein crowd at a Ford Motor Company training center turned civic forum here. "We're on the same team. We have the same goal."
For the most part, Mr. Wolfowitz was preaching to the choir. Horrific tales of relatives massacred or driven into exile by Mr. Hussein's security forces spilled from one speaker after another when Mr. Wolfowitz took questions after his speech. At onepoint, a young boy, whose father said he had suffered brain damage from a beating by Iraqi forces, was brought to the front of the room to meet Mr. Wolfowitz. 
"Saddam must go! Saddam must go!" the crowd chanted at the end of the session, with many pushing forward to get a word with Mr. Wolfowitz, the administration's toughest hawk on Iraq. Mr. Wolfowitz had been invited to attend by the Iraqi Forum for Democracy, a political action group based in Ann Arbor, Mich., that supports Mr. Hussein's ouster.
But some Iraqis voiced suspicions about whether they could trust the United States to finish the job in Iraq. Some voiced bitterness over President George Bush's failure to back a Shiite uprising in southern Iraq immediately after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Others expressed alarm at press reports that the administration might support a Baathist party general as Mr. Hussein's successor, or leave an American officer in charge of Iraq indefinitely.
"They won't be willing to see another dictator after Saddam," said Imam Hassan Qazwini, a prominent religious leader at the Islamic Center of America in Detroit.
Mr. Wolfowitz vowed that the administration would never back a "junior Saddam Hussein." And he repeatedly stated that American forces would be "liberators," not an occupying force.
But he cautioned that only the American military could handle some tasks, like destroying hidden weapons of mass destruction, putting out oil field fires and dealing with humanitarian crises.
Citing his boss, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Mr. Wolfowitz said the United States would be guided by the principle "Stay as long as necessary, and leave as soon as possible." Mr. Wolfowitz added, "The key for us in getting out quickly is for Iraqis to come together quickly."
By enlisting the aid of Iraqi-Americans and recent Iraqi immigrants, Mr. Wolfowitz also seemed to be trying to counter criticism from American lawmakers and relief organizations that the administration has failed to adequately plan for the aftermath of any conflict.
"We're establishing a program through which Iraqi-Americans could be hired as temporary civilian employees or, in some cases, independent contractors of the U.S. government," Mr. Wolfowitz said. Other defense officials said that could include translators, engineers, scientists, economists and others who could help a fledgling Iraqi administration in Baghdad.
That offer won an enthusiastic reply from many Iraqis afterward.
"I'd go back on the first plane," said Safaa Almayahi, 59, an economist here who now works in financial services. "I'd want to help rebuild the Iraqi economy."
Mr. Wolfowitz also outlined an initiative to allow Iraqi-Americans to join the military's Individual Ready Reserve, putting their linguistic, cultural and professional skills to work. Defense officials said that once volunteers were vetted for terrorist connections, they could be quickly dispatched to front-line units in a conflict or in a reconstruction effort.
Officials also said that Iraqi-Americans who joined the reserves could be eligible for accelerated United States citizenship, and that their full-time civilian job in the United States would be protected while they were mobilized.
Mr. Wolfowitz also promoted a continuing program coordinated with Iraqi opposition groups to train Iraqi expatriates from around the world to support American military operations in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center Rethinks 65th Street 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts plans to start work next year on the transformation of West 65th Street into a bright, open boulevard of marquees, even though it has yet to raise any money for that project or any other part of its planned $1.2 billion redevelopment.
 The renovation of West 65th Street will turn the block into a central artery of Lincoln Center and include new entrances for the Juilliard School; Lincoln Center Theater; Alice Tully Hall, where the Chamber Music Society and other Lincoln Center groups perform; and the Walter Reade Theater, home to the Film Society. 
 The 65th Street work will also be affected by what happens to Avery Fisher Hall, home to the New York Philharmonic, which has yet to decide how to address its poor acoustics. Center officials initially seemed to be leaning toward razing the building and starting from scratch, but now they appear to be pulling back to save money, favoring an interior overhaul that would leave the building intact. A renovation is estimated to cost half as much as a projected $325 million reconstruction. 
Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center, said the center had asked two design firms -- Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and Norman Foster -- to submit proposals by May for a total renovation of Avery Fisher. "There had been the assumption that we could not make the aesthetic and acoustical changes we wanted other than by building a new hall," Mr. Levy said. "We have re-examined the program and are coming up with alternatives that we hope will be very exciting and will capture a great deal of what we wanted to achieve."
At the same time, Mr. Levy emphasized, "these are not minor fixes." The decision is complicated by concerns on the part of the Fisher family about keeping its name on the concert hall. Mr. Levy said Lincoln Center had been meeting regularly with the family.
The center announced a design team yesterday for its public spaces, to be led by Diller & Scofidio, in association with Fox & Fowle Architects, Cooper Robertson & Partners as planners, L'Observatoire as lighting designers, Olin Partnership as landscape architects, and 2 X 4 as graphic designers. "We're thrilled by having this combination of edgy new thinking about Lincoln Center," Mr. Levy said.
The design team's first project will be West 65th Street, the largest aspect of the $150 million redesign of the public areas and the first step in its effort to upgrade its buildings and grounds. Although the redevelopment has been estimated to cost $1.2 billion, Bruce Crawford, Lincoln Center chairman, has said that the figure could be revised downward, and that the institution was taking the project one step at a time.
Given the difficult fund-raising climate and city budget cuts, many arts executives are skeptical that Lincoln Center will be able to proceed with its redevelopment without scaling it back considerably.
The design team for the public spaces was selected after a five-month competition by a panel of board members drawn from the 11 Lincoln Center institutions that are participating in the redevelopment.
Diller & Scofidio, led by Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio, who are married, is about to have a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, opening March 1. The team, artists as well as architects, has recently begun to receive major commissions, like the $37 million Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston and the Eyebeam Museum of Art and Technology in Manhattan. 
Mr. Crawford said he was excited by the design choice. "They are really artist architects," he said. "The areas surrounding our buildings -- I think you could call them outdoor stages. And we're going to design them to bring those stages to life."
Lincoln Center has long been criticized for being structurally closed off to the surrounding community, particularly the housing developments on Amsterdam Avenue. The 65th Street plan calls for opening the block between Broadway and Amsterdam, making it into a more pedestrian-friendly stretch that invites the neighborhood in with lively entrances for the seven Lincoln Center constituents and 12 performance spaces on the street.
The project will eliminate the large bridge over the street, substituting a new, narrower footbridge. The project will also feature technologically sophisticated signs with information about Lincoln Center events; the buildings will be clearly identified and transparent, allowing passers-by to look in at classes and other activities; and there will be a sweeping staircase into the plaza.
Construction is expected to start next year. Mr. Levy said that fund-raising had yet to begin and that he would be looking for large lead gifts. Also under the 65th Street plan, the Film Society would get two additional theaters, one, with 150 seats, where successful films could be extended, the other with 75 seats.
Lincoln Center also has yet to resolve the future of New York City Opera. The troupe is expected to leave the New York State Theater, which it shares with the New York City Ballet, and to be part of a new cultural center at the former World Trade Center site. "We're still very anxious and excited about the prospect," said Irwin Schneiderman, chairman of City Opera.
But given the slow progress of decisions about downtown and the difficulty of raising money for a new building in this economy, City Opera will probably stay put for some time. "I think things are headed nowhere," said Robert Wilson, who has pledged $50 million toward a new home for the opera outside Lincoln Center.

THE PASSIONS OF ANDREW JACKSON
By Andrew Burstein
Illustrated. 292 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.
 Andrew Jackson narrowly lost his first race for the White House in 1824. Then in 1828 and 1832 he won back-to-back landslides and a place in the pantheon of great or near-great presidents. In the eyes of history, however, the returns are never finally in. "The Passions of Andrew Jackson" by Andrew Burstein, a history professor at the University of Tulsa, is the book that the opponents of Andrew Jackson, so unlucky in life, have been waiting for. Professor Burstein finds some qualities to praise in Old Hickory but much more to shake his head over. Along the way he raises questions about democracy itself. 
 Jackson was born in 1767 on the South Carolina frontier. His early life was turbulent: during the Revolutionary War, a British officer slashed him with a sword; by the war's end all his immediate family had died. By the time he was 20, however, Jackson had picked up enough law to serve as a federal prosecutor and had moved to Tennessee, where he began to rise in the world. What were his passions?
Jackson craved success. This meant wealth, and by what Professor Burstein calls "constant activity" he acquired land, slaves and a racetrack. Even more important to Jackson were honor and military glory. Honor on the Southern frontier was maintained by a system of insults, quarrels and fights. (Think of the stylized posturing and occasional violence of rap stars.) Jackson was shot on two separate occasions, and in one formal duel, arising from a disputed horse race, he shot and killed his opponent. Late in life he put his strategy for dueling in a letter to a friend: keep one's teeth "firmly clenched" and do not fire first; then, even if hit shoot the antagonist "through the brain." 
Jackson's passion for military glory was gratified in the War of 1812. He destroyed the military power of the Creek Indians, who were tacit allies of the British, at the Battleof Horseshoe Bend in Alabama, then repelled the British themselves at the Battle of New Orleans. The latter victory, writes Professor Burstein, "bequeathed to future Americans the lone reason to retain nostalgia for a war that was decidedly unpopular." He sealed his reputation in 1818 by pursuing Seminole Indians into Spanish Florida and summarily executing two British citizens he accused of stirring them up. "I hope the execution of these two unprincipled villains," he wrote, "will prove an awfull example to the world." 
As Professor Burstein moves briskly through the stages of Jackson's life, he seeks to show that the man's passion to succeed was related to another: the passion to prevail. It was not enough for Jackson to win; others must fail. His opponents deserved their defeat because in his mind he alone incarnated virtue. "He did not accept the rule of law," declares Professor Burstein, "unless he made it." Compromise, even discussion, were foreign to his nature. Jackson carried this style from the battlefield into the Oval Office.
At times President Jackson harnessed his single-mindedness to causes we now approve. At the end of his first term the state of South Carolina and his South Carolinian Vice President, John C. Calhoun, were asserting that states had the right to nullify federal laws and, in the last extremity, secede. He roundly dismissed the argument. "Can any one of common sense believe the absurdity, that a faction of any state, or a state, has a right to secede and destroy this union, and the liberty of our country with it?" 
But in his second term Jackson brought the same bluff confidence to his dispute with the Bank of the United States (analogous to today's Federal Reserve). Jackson saw the bank as a den of East Coast elitists and vowed to break their power. In contrast to liberal historians like Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Professor Burstein finds Jackson's war on the bank to be utterly misguided, the result of "ignorance and excitement." The manipulations of the money supply that Jackson undertook to destroy the bank pushed the economy into a severe depression, which, happily for him, yawned only after he left office.
Professor Burstein occasionally gives Jackson points for self-control or self-knowledge. The geopolitical question of his early life was who would acquire Florida, Louisiana and Texas, the North American pieces of the Spanish empire. A series of American adventurers (including Aaron Burr) saw themselves as solving this problem. Jackson succeeded where the others failed because only he made sure always to act with official sanction from Washington; "he was probably the least greedy," Professor Burstein concludes.
Jackson knew that his intellectual and expressive skills were limited. So, like George Washington, the first general-president, he turned to advisers and wordsmiths. But where Washington tapped men like Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson -- who were not only the best brains the nation could offer but who also embodied a range of views -- Jackson relied on like-minded yes men. 
Professor Burstein's book is an argument rather than a traditional biography, and its most powerful section, its conclusion, is its most argumentative. There he sums up Jackson as a variant of Coriolanus, Shakespeare's tragic hero. Like Coriolanus, he was a "proud, anguished absolutist," but unlike Coriolanus he identified with common people instead of scorning them, for he saw the people at large as "meaner versions of himself." The people repaid the compliment by seeing themselves glorified in their hero.
But in Professor Burstein's view this mutual admiration does not speak well for the American people. Jackson was in the grip of "a dangerous kind of self-love," mistaking "his own ceremonial pronouncements of his love of virtue for genuine self-worth." 
Was the Age of Jackson similarly afflicted? Many observers, from hostile foreigners like Charles Dickens to proud natives like Walt Whitman, saw self-love writ large in early 19th-century America. (Whitman thought there was a lot worth loving.) The proud, pleased country, however, was headed for the comeuppance of civil war. Aristocracy breeds pride in its ruling class; does democracy breed it wholesale? "The Passions of Andrew Jackson" offers a challenging, disturbing portrait of a democratic hero, and an equally challenging case study of the democratic system.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 12, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The Books of The Times review on Feb. 25, about "The Passions of Andrew Jackson" by Andrew Burstein, included an anachronistic reference to the Oval Office. It was built in 1909; Jackson, president from 1829 to 1837, did not work there.

HEADLINE: Signs of Life in Argentina 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
Graffiti denouncing bankers as thieves and scoundrels still stains walls here, and small groups of angry depositors continue to pound on the front doors of many banks. But more than a year after Argentina froze most bank accounts in a failed attempt to stave off economic collapse, the financial sector is finally showing tentative signs of recovery. 
 Restrictions on cash withdrawals from some accounts were relaxed late in 2002; now President Eduardo Duhalde's caretaker government is allowing selected banks to give savers access to all the money in their time-deposit accounts. About four-fifths of depositors are choosing to leave their newly liberated savings in the banks. 
 Interest rates that had soared to unsupportable levels are beginning to fall, and partly as a result, some banks are venturing hesitantly back into the business of offering loans. 
Since December 2001, the banking system has been the focal point of the worst economic crisis in Argentina's history. The government then in power was forced out by public protests against the bank freeze, and the new governments that followed in quick succession defaulted on most of Argentina's $141 billion in public debt, scrapped a decade-long policy of fixing the Argentine peso's value at one American dollar, and allowed the peso to float. The currency lost nearly 75 percent of its value. 
Banks were especially big losers in the national debacle, suffering substantial financial pain on the one hand while being tarred as villains by the protesters on the other. The government ordered the banks to use a higher exchange rate when converting customers' deposits from dollars to pesos than when converting outstanding loans from dollars to pesos, inflicting losses on the banks estimated at more than $15 billion; the government has reimbursed the banks for only about two-thirds of the losses. 
"We still have to absorb some of the impact of those initial months, and some recapitalization has to be done," Roberto Lavagna, the economy minister, acknowledged in an interview here. "After that, the new rules of the game have to be defined clearly so that the sector knows how to act." 
At the moment, banks are still in the dark, awaiting Supreme Court rulings on a series of lawsuits by customers who had deposited dollars before the crisis, demanding repayment in dollars rather than in pesos, as the government has decreed. Because no one can be sure what peso-dollar exchange rate would be used if the suits succeed, most banks remain hesitant to offer new credits. 
"We can't do a balance sheet, because we don't have the numbers, and we won't have the numbers until all of the options are spelled out," said a senior executive at a leading private bank. "With a presidential election scheduled for April 27 and a new government supposed to be sworn in a month later, that's not going to happen until the middle of the year, at the earliest." 
But the crisis has also revealed an unexpected resilience in the Argentine banking sector. A handful of foreign banks threw up their hands and walked away from the country soon after the crisis began, including the Bank of Nova Scotia and Credit Agricole. But despite dire predictions in early 2002, no domestic bank has closed. 
Deposits poured out of the banks before the crisis and, to the extent the freeze allowed, in the first few months after as well. But after touching bottom in the middle of 2002, deposits have been rebounding -- over all, they grew 38 percent from July 1 to Jan. 31, and some Argentine-owned banks have reported growth of more than 50 percent. 
"That was a gratifying surprise," said Fabio Rodriguez, who tracks the banking sector for Fundacion Capital, a leading economic policy analysis group here. But Mr. Rodriguez warned: "The road ahead is enormous. The financial sector today is one-quarter the size it was in 2000, and it is going to take years to recover, so serious was the damage to public confidence." 
One looming issue is the fate of the country's network of government-owned banks. As part of a debt rollover agreement reached with the Argentine government in January, the International Monetary Fund insisted that an international accounting firm scrutinize these banks, including Banco de la Nacion and banks owned by provincial and municipal governments. 
The stated purpose of the plan is to find ways to make these banks, which have been burdened by bad loans and a long history of political interference, sounder and more efficient. But skeptics say the move is really preparation for privatizing the banks wholly or in part -- a politically sensitive step, because the government banks are often the only ones serving remote or backward parts of the country and the only sources of credit for small business. 
"All of us are aware of the vocation that international organizations have shown for privatizing everything in sight, and the interests that stand behind them," said Carlos Heller, president of the Argentine Association of Private and Public Banks. "As an association, we are totally against that. We believe that publicly owned banks have a formative role to play and that a government has to be able to count on its own financial system." 
Mr. Rodriguez said that to privatize the government banks so soon after the crisis would probably be to hand them to foreign investors at bargain prices. "After the trauma of devaluation, this is not the best moment to get the best value," he said. 
But Mr. Lavagna, the economy minister, has made it clear that at the very least the government will demand changes. "If the public bank network does not improve its management and carry out the role it should have, it runs the risk of entering a process of self-destruction," he said. 
The long-term challenge facing banks of all types here is to regain the confidence of Argentine savers, who still feel that they have been defrauded by bankers and politicians. Even with the recent surge in deposits,economists estimate that Argentines have $110 billion in savings stashed under mattresses or in accounts abroad, double the amount in the banking system. 
The foreign banks that flocked here in the 1990's now have the most public suspicion to overcome, Mr. Heller said. "There is a greater degree of disenchantment with the foreign banks," he said. "They had always stressed their international support, and people got the idea that the home offices would respond if a crisis like that of Mexico occurred. But when the moment came, the foreign banks acted just like the local banks and wrote down their assets."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Zurich; 
A Banking Center Is Trying to Overcome Its Staid Company-Town Image

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

 BODY:
Banking is what Zurich is famous for, and it overshadows just about everything else in what is Switzerland's biggest city. Tight-lipped bankers still abound, even though their industry is undergoing turmoil and retrenchment. With one eye on the future, the city is courting visitors by overhauling its staid company-town image. Even though its sidewalks, on centuries-old cobbled streets, still roll up too early for some, Zurich is decidedly more hip these days with new ethnic restaurants, innovative performing arts and diverse night life.

AIRPORT
 Zurich's airport has all those quintessential Swiss qualities: cleanliness, order and clockwork precision, at least most of the time. Like other airports, this one has been feeling the pinch of the global economic downturn, chalking up only 18 million visitors last year, a 15 percent decrease from 2001. 
 "Sometimes I do miss a little bit the feeling of a really great airport, which is crowded 24 hours a day," said Josef Zellweger, a marketing manager at the Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group. But that is offset by the personal service he receives. He has been traveling through the airport for 15 years, often to Asia, and "when I'm late, they help me through the security check," he said.
Trains shuttle passengers the eight miles to downtown every 15 minutes for $5.70. Airport buses also deposit guests at most hotels. A taxi to downtown Zurich ranges from $44 to $51, depending on the hour. A new ZurichCARD will be available starting April 1 for public transportation in the area at a price of $10.95 for 24 hours and $22 for 72 hours. Switzerland's rail network is first rate; you can go almost anywhere by train, with the ride to Geneva taking three and a half hours.

HOTELS
Many of Zurich's bankers and their guests gravitate to the BAUR AU LAC (011-41-1-220-5020, $496), a luxurious refuge for 150 years. It is in its own private park on the shore of Lake Zurich, near the city's most fashionable streets. (To call a number in Zurich from the United States, you must first dial 011-41-1.)
Not surprisingly, Mr. Zellweger puts in a plug for the Credit Suisse-owned SAVOY BAUR EN VILLE (215-2525, $345 to 530), saying the couple who run it "give you the feeling of coming home every time you go there." Its rival, the HOTEL WIDDER (224-2526, $470 to $570), which is owned by the other Swiss banking giant, UBS, has combined eight historic town houses into one five-star establishment. Each room is different, but most have brick walls and a great work space with a modem adapter and fax. 
Despite all its pinstripe-suited bankers, Zurich has one of the few hotels catering solely to women travelers, LADY'S FIRST (380-8010, $103 to $135). It has a fitness room and a sauna.

RESTAURANTS
Zurich has branched out from traditional hearty Swiss fare -- like rosti potatoes, a European version of hash browns -- to cuisine from all parts of the world. For those who want the true Swiss experience, Daniel Thelesklaf, who runs a Zurich firm that helps combat money laundering, said the ALPENROSE (271-3919, $70 for dinner for two, including wine and tip) offered "all the dishes you loved your mother to cook, and you get them nowhere better."
Another favorite is the spacious LA SALLE RESTAURANT (258-7071, $175), where Mr. Thelesklaf last tried, to his "great satisfaction, the risotto al funghi and scaloppini a limone, with an excellent Brunello di Montalcino" wine. The only drawback, he said, is a glass wall that separates the restaurant from an adjacent theater; he walked right into the wall. "Everybody was very amused," he said.
One of the hottest eating spots -- and a sure conversation opener -- is the BLINDEKUH (421-5050, $60), which means Blind Cow in English; dining is in total darkness to heighten taste, smell and touch. Blindekuh takes only 60 guests a seating, so you need to reserve far in advance. The servers are blind or visually impaired employees, who recite the menu.
To celebrity-watch, nothing beats the elegant KRONENHALLE (251-6669, $175), according to Mr. Zellweger. "There you sit at a table under a Picasso or a Chagall, and you can eat great meat carpaccio, veal and a superb mousse au chocolat," he said.

ENTERTAINMENT
HOTEL WIDDER revived a decades-old tradition of live jazz in 1995, and its cozy red-leather banquettes are full for the weekly show every Tuesday night. Overlooking the lake is TERRASSE (251-1974), which has live piano music until 2 a.m.
Mr. Zellweger also recommends ADAGIO (206-3666) because the music is varied, but not too loud. "The lovely Jose, a waiter, sometimes sings," he said, and for a special dinner, Adagio has a tiny restaurant that seats only six on a balcony.

BUSINESS LORE
When Switzerland's best-known entrepreneur, Martin Ebner, left Zurich for his nearby hometown, Wilen, five years ago, it set off a public furor over what many saw as a blatant attempt to cut his tax bill by moving to a lower-tax area. So there has been much chortling lately over the financial difficulties of the former billionaire, who had been hailed as an investment genius.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Alumni Pressure Harvard To Put Reins on Spending 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER with SARA RIMER 

 BODY:
With its vast, unmatched wealth, Harvard is the envy of universities around the world. Yet it is wasting tens of millions of dollars each year because, unlike most corporations, it rarely makes the effort to look for the best deals on the $1 billion in goods and services it buys annually.
 Even by its own reckoning, the university could save more than $100 million a year -- or more than half of what undergraduates pay in tuition and fees -- simply by soliciting bids on items as diverse as plumbing and brochures, much as businesses and government agencies do. 
 In the past couple of years, Harvard has begun to rein in some of its everyday expenses. But efforts to go further pose a challenge because of the university's long tradition of autonomy for its many schools and departments. 
"This is the lowest-hanging fruit for helping keep costs down for students and making it possible to expand academic programs," said Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard's president, adding that the university brought in consultants from McKinsey & Company to identify categories in which money could be saved. "This is an area with a lot of potential that is crucial at a time when university budgets are going to be a lot tighter."
The initiative comes amid mounting impatience in recent months from a small but influential group of Harvard alumni, including former Senator Timothy E. Wirth and C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel for former President George Bush. While the alumni are heartened by Mr. Summers's commitment, calling it a noticeable departure from that of earlier presidents, they argue that Harvard's lack of fiscal restraint has squandered millions of dollars in donations, year after year.
The alumni also point out that if the university widely embraced basic business concepts, it might not have to ask alumni for so much money.
"Who suffers from all this?" said Mr. Wirth, the former Democratic senator from Colorado who also sat on the Harvard Board of Overseers. "The alumni, who don't know this is going on and are asked to give more money, and the students, who pay every time the price goes up."
By many accounts, Harvard has fallen behind other universities in exploiting its heft to get discounts on the myriad purchases it makes. In almost every state, colleges and universities, public and private, pool their money and shop for the best buys on lab supplies, lawn mowers, snowblowers, fire extinguishers, mattresses, uniforms or almost anything else a small city might need. 
In Massachusetts, the practice has been going on for decades. It cuts almost 30 percent off sticker prices on many commodities and involves most of the state's universities, including big campuses like Boston College, Boston University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Massachusetts. 
But not Harvard. Its problem, some university officials point out, is that Harvard is less a single university than a federation of no fewer than 10 schools, from business to divinity, that control their own budgets and cherish their independence. So while buying light fixtures separately may not seem like much of a statement of self-determination, it reflects a decentralized campus on which the notion of an all-powerful administration is often seen as the enemy of academic freedom. 
For the past decade or so, there has been little pressure to confront that culture to save money because, as at many universities, endowments have been flush and alumni have been more than generous -- perhaps too generous, some say.
"As alumni, we tend to think that we are solving all of Harvard's problems by lining up to throw money its way," said John B. Henry, a Harvard alumnus who supports Mr. Summers's efforts. "But the more money we give, the less pressure we put on Harvard to be fiscally responsible." 
Now that the university and many of its alumni donors are faring worse economically, Harvard officials see a greater urgency to adopt the kind of mundane cost savings that can add up to what Mr. Summers called "very large amounts, very quickly." 
As for persuading Harvard's schools to surrender some autonomy, Mr. Summers believes the monetary benefits will provide all the justification he needs.
"Schools at Harvard are always going to decide what books they're going to purchase," Mr. Summers said. "But academic freedom for choosing vendors of cement is probably a lot less crucial." 
Already, university officials say they have been able to save about $26 million a year on travel, office supplies, furniture, express mail, floor coverings, even temporary help. In past years, for example, Harvard faculty and staff used to get their tickets from as many as 300 travel agencies. Now they are supposed to use one.
As it is now, getting the entire university to do anything as a whole will remain wishful thinking, the alumni argue, until Mr. Summers can marshal the political wherewithal to require it. "The time for voluntary programs has passed," Mr. Wirth and Mr. Henry said in a letter to Mr. Summers earlier this month. "What Harvard needs is a mandate."
In the meantime, Harvard officials say they are proceeding with a plan to save an additional $45 million or so a year on construction, building maintenance and printing, all by putting contracts out to bid. 
The savings in these and other areas could be significantly higher if the entire university were required to participate, university officials acknowledge, but some privately doubt that Mr. Summers will risk alienating Harvard's powerful deans by forcing their hand. 
Even if he did, there are no guarantees that students would notice much of a change. Relieving tuition pressures could be one way of using the savings, but it is certainly not the only one. That would be up to the schools themselves, and some university administrators question whether trimming costs could ever solve the problem of escalating tuitions because, among other reasons, the savings would not affect labor costs. 
"Most institutions could definitely save money on purchasing," said Judith B. Greiman, president of the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, which runs a collective purchasing program that includes Yale. "But it's not a panacea."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Skipping a Night Out on the Town

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
Like many traveling executives, Peter Salmon, a senior sales manager for Sharp Electronics in Los Angeles, has taken to holing up in his hotel room at night.
 If he's not entertaining clients at dinner, Mr. Salmon said he would "have room service, sit there, open and answer the day's e-mails and check our system for sales updates." 
 "I've been doing this more and more," said Mr. Salmon, who favors Hilton hotels for their concierge floors, guest-room desks and high-speed Internet access. "There are some nights I spend three or four hours on a computer. I used to go out to eat more, but now I don't have as much time." 
Travel industry executives say Mr. Salmon is one of a growing number of business travelers who are skipping a night out on the town, once an inviolable perk, in favor of spending their evenings alone in their hotel room to work or relax. Many of them are also converting the room into an office where they work during the day.
Although this trend began before the World Trade Center attacks, they say, it has accelerated, spurred by the declining economy, cutbacks in travel budgets, increased pressure on time and productivity, and travelers' desire to use what free time they have to unwind and stay in touch with their families.
Of course, business travelers still head to night spots in large numbers and meet clients and colleagues outside their hotels, but enough of them are changing their habits to catch the attention of a broad cross section of chains -- including Marriott International; Wyndham International; Hilton Hotels; W, owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide; Ian Schrager Hotels; Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts; and the Peninsula Group. These companies are responding to the shift with new services that cater to it and even encourage it.
Hotel companies like Hilton, Wyndham and Marriott have upgraded their bedding and desk arrangements and installed high-speed Internet access to accommodate the ever-rising number of executives with laptops. According to Bjorn Hanson, head of the hospitality practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers, four-fifths of all business travelers now carry laptops.
In recent months, Wyndham and W have also introduced packages that bundle high-speed Internet access and local and long-distance phone service, and Marriott is experimenting with a comparable arrangement. The Four Seasons Hotel Berlin has created a mobile computer station that rents by the hour and contains a desktop computer, scanner, printer, copier, fax and software in three languages.
Such innovations have made life a lot easier for Chris Paladino, an executive with the American Red Cross in Montgomery County, Md.. "As the technology advances, I can connect my laptop to high-speed Internet access in my room," said Mr. Paladino, who is a member of Marriott's loyalty program. "In the past, I'd have to go to Kinko's to get high-speed Internet access and to another location for other services. Now they're all brought together in my room. I can get room service, copying, faxing, directions, you name it." He even praises Marriott's new desks, which he says are much easier to use than its old ones.
Difficulties with flying have also stimulated business travelers' desire to retreat to their hotel rooms for a little peace and quiet, Mr. Hanson said. "After spending an extra hour at the airport, much of it waiting in lines, and not getting in-flight meals, arriving at the hotel is now a time to decompress," he said. "There's also the CNN effect; with so much going on in Iraq, the Columbia space shuttle, fluctuations in the stock market, people feel the need to catch up on news. And there's a more somber national attitude, a more conservative definition of having a good time. People want to relax, read, be in contact with their family."
Just ask Thomas Scott, a government-affairs consultant in Folsom, Calif., and a frequent flier to Los Angeles and San Diego, about these trends.
"By the time I finally get to my hotel, it's usually later in the day," said Mr. Scott, a member of Hilton's loyalty program. "I want to check my e-mail, return any calls before 5 or 6. You're then looking at 6:30 or 7. If I've got a 7:30 meeting the next morning, just relaxing is what I prefer to do."
An increasing number of travelers are also using their hotel rooms to conduct business meetings. Gwen Davis, a New York novelist and playwright, has been ensconced in a room at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles since January, finishing a play and meeting with potential producers and actors. "It's just so grisly out there right now, I literally have to build a cocoon around myself, because that's the only way I can really be inspired," Ms. Davis said.
To accommodate such guests, Ian Schrager recently began reconfiguring certain rooms and suites in his Manhattan and Los Angeles hotels, curtaining off sleeping areas and installing large, fully equipped desks and even computers.
Room service is another amenity that has flourished in the aftermath of Sept. 11. "Fewer people are traveling together, so there's less socializing and goingout to dinner," Mr. Hanson of PricewaterhouseCoopers said. "Employers also are looking to reduce travel expenses, and room service can sometimes be cheaper."
Hotel chains are expanding their services to meet the increased demand. Marriott, for example, has introduced new coffee pots and other gadgets to keep food warm; it also serves Haagen-Dazs ice cream by the pint, protecting it with a special thermal cover. Many Four Seasons hotels let guests order a room service meal on the way from the airport that is served once they check in.
In-room exercise classes, massages and spa treatments are also gaining in popularity. Guests at the Regent Bangkok can order in-room massages en route from the airport, while One Aldwych in London opened two suites last fall with their own private gyms.
One Aldwych has also seen an increase in requests for in-room massages. "Business travelers are often tired after a long flight," said Alasdair Lane, manager of the hotel's health club. "They just call down to the health club from their room and book a massage immediately. They don't need to leave their room again, or worry about the right things to wear."
Several New York hotels are broadening their in-room spa and exercise programs. The Four Seasons offers guests private yoga classes, for example, while, next month, the Peninsula will introduce new in-room spa products and treatments, as well as bath amenities like cranberry and citrus sea salts.
Such creature comforts hold special appeal to Charles Bachrach, an executive vice president of Rubin Postaer & Associates, a Santa Monica ad agency, and a Four Seasons fan. He loves nothing more than to tuck into a bowl of Four Seasons' home-style chicken noodle soup, with a salad on the side, he said, "then have a massage and go to bed."

HEADLINE: Lowe's Earnings Climb 46% In Strong Market for Housing 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 24 

 BODY:
The Lowe's Companies, a leading home improvement chain, capitalizing on a strong housing market, reported a 46 percent increase in its fourth-quarter earnings today, easily surpassing Wall Street's expectations. 
 Lowe's also offered an upbeat profit outlook today, projecting that earnings for the year would beat current forecasts. 
 Lowe's earned $319.4 million, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ended Jan. 31, up from $218.4 million, or 28 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call anticipated earnings of 33 cents a share. 
Revenue increased 16.5 percent, to $6.12 billion, from $5.25 billion in the quarter a year ago. Sales at stores opened at least a year, which are considered a strong gauge of a retailer's health, increased 4.1 percent. 
Shares of Lowe's rose $2.08, to $38.10. 
"The year ahead holds challenges, but many signs point to a strong home improvement market," the chief executive, Robert L. Tillman, said. "Despite the uncertainties that remain in the broader economic and geopolitical environment, I'm optimistic that the home improvement consumer will remain resilient." 
For 2002, net earnings grew 43.8 percent, to $1.47 billion, or $1.85 a share, from $1.02 billion, or $1.30 a share, in 2001. Sales increased 19.8 percent, to $26.5 billion, from $22.1 billion a year ago. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 5.6 percent for the year. 
Mr. Tillman called the home improvement market the "sweet spot" in the economy, helped by low mortgage rates and strong demand for refinancing. And he expects the current trends to continue well into 2003. 
For the current fiscal year, Lowe's forecast earnings of $2.16 to $2.20, above analyst projections of $2.11. The company projects that first-quarter earnings will be 51 cents to 53 cents a share. Analysts expect 51 cents a share.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup; 
Supreme Court Is to Review Rehiring of Drug Abusers

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court, accepting a new case today on the legal obligations of employers toward people with disabilities, agreed to decide whether companies can refuse to rehire rehabilitated drug users whose substance abuse had brought about their dismissals.
 Under the Americans With Disabilities Act, current addiction is excluded from the definition of disability, leaving employers free to fire those who violate workplace rules against using illegal drugs. The question in the case today, an appeal by Raytheon, is how the 1990 disabilities law applies to the common employers' policy of refusing to rehire anyone dismissed for workplace misconduct. 
 The federal appeals court in San Francisco reinstated a disability discrimination suit brought against Raytheon by a former service technician who maintained that he had conquered the alcoholism and drug problems that had led to his forced resignation after 25 years at the Hughes Missile Systems Company, which Raytheon later acquired. The company, invoking its policy against rehiring, had deemed him ineligible to return. 
"We hold that a policy that serves to bar the re-employment of a drug addict despite his successful rehabilitation violates the A.D.A.," or the disabilities act, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said in ruling in June that the worker, Joel Hernandez, was entitled to take his case to trial. The Federal District Court in Tucson, had earlier dismissed his suit.
In its Supreme Court appeal, Raytheon Company v. Hernandez, No. 02-749, the company is arguing that although the disability law "took pains not to give special rights to drug users," the appeals court did just that by finding one-time drug abusers entitled to a second chance at employment. 
"The A.D.A. promises nondiscrimination," Raytheon said. "It does not promise to insulate drug abusers from the consequences of their misconduct." 
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission supported Mr. Hernandez when he took his complaint to the commission in 1997. The Bush administration has not taken a position on the issue before the Supreme Court, but will presumably make its views known before the case is argued in October. 
Returning from a midwinter recess, the court also granted review in another disability-related case, an appeal by the Social Security Administration on the definition of disability that determines eligibility for Supplemental Security Income benefits.
The Social Security Act limits eligibility to people whose impairments are so severe that not only are they unable to engage in their "previous work," but are also unable to perform "any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy." The statute defines the last phrase as "work which exists in significant numbers" in the local region or elsewhere in the country.
Invoking the statute, the agency denied benefits to a woman who said cardiac and back problems prevented her from continuing to work as a housekeeper. An administrative judge at the agency found that the woman, Pauline Thomas, could work at "a light level of exertion" and retained "the functional capacity to return to past work as an elevator operator."
But Ms. Thomas argued, and the federal appeals court in Philadelphia agreed, that the job of elevator operator no longer existed in sufficient numbers to qualify as available work under the statute. There was "no plausible reason" why Congress would have wanted to deny benefits to a person who "could perform a previous job that no longer exists," the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said in its opinion in June.
The government's Supreme Court appeal, Barhnart v. Thomas, No. 02-763, asserts that the decision "will impose additional administrative burdens and costs" on the Social Security disability program. 
"Given today's dynamic and technological economy," the appeal said, "job types are becoming obsolete with increasing frequency." 
The government said that in creating the disability program, Congress had never assumed that people were suited for just one narrow type of employment.
These were among the other developments at the court today.

Strictly Kosher
Without comment, the court turned down appeals from a ruling by the federal appeals court in New York that invalidated a state law intended to protect consumers of kosher food products from fraud in the sale of items labeled kosher. The appeals were filed by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer of New York and by a group of Orthodox Jewish organizations and consumers.
Originally passed in 1915, the law made it a misdemeanor for a merchant to claim falsely that food was kosher or prepared according to "the Orthodox Hebrew religious requirements." The law was challenged in 1996 by the owners of a kosher market on Long Island, Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats Inc., which the State Division of Kosher Law Enforcement had fined four times. The New Jersey Supreme Court struck down a similar law in 1992, and others have been challenged around the country.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in May that the law created an excessive entanglement between the state and religion, amounting to a "fusion of governmental and religious authority."
Gov. George E. Pataki and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver expressed disappointment with the Supreme Court's failure to take the cases and pledged to find new ways to protect consumers. New Jersey's solution was to require merchants to specify their kosher standards -- not necessarily Orthodox -- and to abide by them. The cases were Silver v. Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats, No. 02-675, and Weiss v. Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats, No. 02-672.

Knock and Enter
Accepting a government appeal, the court agreed to review a decision that invalidated a search of an apartment in Las Vegas on the ground that the police had failed to wait a sufficient time between announcing their presence and breaking down the door. The interval was 15 to 20 seconds. Executing a search warrant as the apartment owner, Lashawn Banks, emerged from the shower, the police found weapons and narcotics. The Ninth Circuit ordered the evidence suppressed because it found that the rapid and forcible entry had rendered the search unconstitutional.
In its appeal, United States v. Banks, No. 02-473, the government argues that the appeals court failed to give the police adequate guidance, and that would lead to "needless and potentially dangerous delays" in conducting valid searches.

Abortion Wait
Without comment, the court turned down a challenge to an Indiana abortion law that requires a woman who has scheduled an abortion to receive counseling in person at the doctor's office, rather than by telephone, 18 hours in advance. 
A group of Indiana abortion clinics challenged the 1995 law on the ground that requiring women to make two trips imposed the kind of undue burden that the Supreme Court has found unconstitutional with respect to other state-imposed obstacles to obtaining abortions. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, upheld the law in a 2-to-1 ruling in September. The appeal was A Woman's Choice-East Side Women's Clinic v. Brizzi, No. 02-935.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE PAYMENTS; 
Reliance on Promotional Allowances Can Result in Shortfalls

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The payments that caused problems at the U.S. Foodservice division of Royal Ahold are among the most common, and the most perilous, in an industry known for a variety of cash transactions.
 Known as promotional allowances, the payments are made by manufacturers of brand-name products to retailers so that they will encourage their customers to buy those products. The payments usually translate to discounts for the customers. 
 A typical manufacturer spends 20 percent of its sales with a particular retailer on promotional allowances, said Burt Flickinger III, managing partner for Strategic Resource Group, a consulting firm in New York. A $50 million contract for cookies or tomato sauce would include a $10 million promotional allowance, he said. Food service customers buy on a huge scale for institutions like hotel chains, hospitals and prisons, and decisions can be affected by the size of the discounts they are offered. 
The payments are usually made upfront but can also take the form of volume-based bonuses. If a retailer fails to deliver the volume, the bonus is not paid or may have to be renegotiated. 
Because of the slowing economy, last year was not the time to count on strong volume growth. For a large company like Ahold, which had about $68 billion in sales in its last fiscal year, a slight drop in anticipated volume can mean a significant shortfall in profits if bonuses are part of the plan. At the U.S. Foodservice division, earnings were expected to be about $750 million on sales of $17 billion, said Mia Kirchgaessner, a senior analyst for global food retail at Sanford C. Bernstein. That was before Ahold revealed that accounting irregularities meant the company's earnings had been overstated by at least $500 million over the last two years, primarily at U.S. Foodservice.
"The way they did the accounting is not wrong," Mrs. Kirchgaessner said. "It's the assumption they made on how much sales they would get" that was wrong. 
Another analyst, Mitchell J. Speiser of Lehman Brothers, wrote in a note to investors yesterday that the president of U.S. Foodservice, James Miller, "indicated that the situation will have no effect on customers or employees, although this seems wishful." 
U.S. Foodservice, the No. 2 food-service company behind the Sysco Corporation, ran into difficulties last year after buying Alliant, one of its main competitors. Combining the new company with existing operations turned out to be complicated, and as U.S. Foodservice trimmed accounts and closed warehouses, some of its customers did not obtain the service they needed, Mrs. Kirchgaessner said. Sales fell by $1.3 billion, and she estimated that about $700 million of that could be attributed to problems with integrating the businesses.
She now expects the business to generate only about $400 million in earnings. She downgraded the stock last year, worried about issues ranging from profit difficulties at some divisions to senior management's ability to deal with them effectively. 
After yesterday's announcement, she is advising clients case by case as to whether they should own the stock, which closed yesterday at $4.16, down $6.53, or 61 percent. "I'm giving investor scenarios based on what they believe about the honesty of management and what else could come out," she said. 
A related payment issue emerged at Kmart, which filed for bankruptcy 13 months ago. An internal investigation has found, among other things, that executives improperly recorded payments from suppliers ahead of schedule. The discovery forced Kmart to restate earnings over the last three and a half years. 
The investigation, which was conducted by lawyers for Kmart management, also found that suppliers were squeezed for additional payments and not paid on time or in full for goods they delivered to stores. The investigation is continuing, along with similar investigations by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Ahold executives said yesterday that they had secured 3.1 billion euros ($3.35 billion) in financing commitments to help it through the next several months. But several people said they expected the company to be sold and broken up before long, which is likely to produce deep change in the retail landscape in several parts of the world. 
"If you look at who the competition is on the East Coast, it's Wal-Mart and Ahold," said Deborah Weinswig, a senior retail analyst for the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup. "So Wal-Mart should find some market-share opportunities in the U.S." Additionally, Wal-Mart, which has said it wants to expand its international business, may want to buy supermarket chains owned by Ahold in Spain, Portugal or other areas, she said. 
It is not clear whether Wal-Mart would be interested in acquiring U.S. Foodservice. At the moment, "it's one area of the food business that is growing, and you can win without competing with Wal-Mart," Mr. Flickinger said. 
A spokesman for Wal-Mart declined to comment on its possible interest in U.S. Foodservice or other Ahold businesses. Wal-Mart owns a small distributor called the McLane Company that delivers groceries and other items to supermarkets and convenience stores. The company brought in 6.3 percent of Wal-Mart's $218 billion in sales last year, the spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Japan, Its Finances in Disarray, Picks Old-School Central Banker 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Backing away from his own calls for an independent, reform-minded policy maker to lead the Japanese central bank, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has selected a career bureaucrat backed by the country's establishment to be the bank's next governor.
 The choice of Toshihiko Fukui to succeed Masaru Hayami, whose term ends next month, has not yet been formally approved by the cabinet, but it is now considered all but certain. It ends months of speculation here about how Mr. Koizumi would make what will probably be his most important economic policy decision this year. 
 By choosing a defender of the status quo rather than a "deflation fighter," Mr. Koizumi disappointed many economists in Japan and critics abroad, who had hoped for a break in the logjam that has kept the country from taming its economic problems. But two big constituencies -- Japan's main business groups and the staff of the central bank itself -- supported Mr. Fukui, a former deputy governor of the bank. 
Like Mr. Hayami, Mr. Fukui has rejected politicians' demands that the central bank establish an inflation target and take other steps considered radical here meant to pump up the sagging economy and halt the four-year slide in prices. Bond prices and the yen rose today on market expectations that Mr. Fukui would oppose taking major steps to spur inflation, the yen settling in New York at 117.92 to the dollar. 
Significantly, Mr. Fukui will be joined on the bank's governing board by two new deputies -- Toshiro Muto, a former vice finance minister, and Kazumasa Iwata, who worked at the Economic Planning Agency and is now a cabinet adviser and a professor at the University of Tokyo. 
By choosing a career bureaucrat from each of Japan's main financial policy-making centers, Mr. Koizumi has opted to create a balance of power among the agencies, which have feuded during Mr. Hayami's five-year tenure. The infighting, much of it rude and in public, has gotten in the way of taking important steps to fight deflation or to deal with the immense pile of bad loans plaguing the nation's banks. 
Skeptics said today that the appointments would just prolong gridlock. But other analysts said the new lineup might produce more coordinated solutions to Japan's seemingly intractable problems.
Mr. Muto and Mr. Iwata are expected to push for the central bank to buy many more government bonds, as a way of capping a recent rise in long-term interest rates, if the government agrees to take stronger steps to clean up the banks.
"What's very important for Japan's economy is to have a comprehensive review of the problems and a full-fledged set of policies," said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a member of Parliament from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party with financial experience. "Fukui, as a mainstream team player, could do this." 
Formal nomination hearings must still be held and a vote taken in Parliament before March 19, when Mr. Hayami will retire. Senior members of the ruling party, eager to avoid a time-consuming battle with the opposition, met with Mr. Koizumi tonight to discuss the nominations. 
Mr. Fukui, 67, a native of Osaka, has worked at the central bank for 40 years, including stints at local branches and as the bank's representative in Paris. After heading the research and credit management bureaus, he rose to executive director and then deputy governor.
But his rise hit a snag in 1998, when he and the bank's governor at the time, Yasuo Matsushita, were forced to resign to take responsibility for a bribery scandal involving leaks of financially sensitive information, an episode that will probably be raised at his confirmation hearing.
Exiled from the central bank, Mr. Fukui became chairman of the Fujitsu Research Institute, a private policy group, and deputy chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, two posts that won him strong backing in the business circles that support the ruling party.
As governor of the bank, Mr. Fukui will face banking and financial problems like few seen elsewhere in modern times. The nonperforming loans on Japanese banks' books now amount to at least 15 percent of the country's gross domestic product -- five times the scale of the 1980's savings and loan crisis in the United States. New bank lending has been declining for five years, starving even healthy companies of credit. 
Under Mr. Hayami's leadership, the central bank lowered short-term rates to near zero beginning in 1999, and has been flooding the money markets with cash. But the policy had the unintended effect of making it easier for lenders to keep failing borrowers on indefinite life support and avoid the harsh medicine of foreclosures and write-offs.
For the fiscal year that ends on March 31, the Japanese economy is expected to record growth of just 1 percent, and next year promises to be no better. The banks are accelerating write-offs somewhat and posting huge losses, but bad loans are still piling up faster than they are written off. The government may yet have to intervene on a large scale no matter what the central bank does. 
"The huge amount of assets the central bank has already bought has failed to stop deflation or get banks lending again," said Akio Mikuni, who runs an independent credit agency. "The problems are much bigger than the Bank of Japan." 
In recent interviews, Mr. Fukui has said much the same thing. He told Bloomberg News, "Deflation is something like being trapped in a pit, and we can't get out of it unless everyone plays his or her own role." He also rejected calls for the central bank to switch its price policy goal from stability to inflation.
Backers of inflation targeting, as such a switch is known, say that consumers and businesses will only begin to spend again if they think that the central bank and the government are both in earnest about forcing prices upward. Measures like a huge new expansion of the money supply have been suggested.
But Mr. Fukui, like Mr. Hayami, has resisted such ideas, saying that once it started, inflation would be too hard to stop.
Critics say that kind of thinking is a throwback to the immediate postwar period, when Japan's economy was in ruins and prices were soaring. Mr. Hayami joined the central bank toward the end of that period, and like many at the bank today, he is a staunch defender of a strong yen, which keeps prices down. 
"Bank of Japan bureaucrats remember hyperinflation the way Texans remember the Alamo," said Chris Walker, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. 
But Japan's problems have become far more complex. Deflation is making it harder for debtors to repay their obligations, while negligible interest rates have made it impossible for pensioners to live off the income on their savings. For companies, continual downward pressure on prices erodes profits.
The government, though, has run up more than 600 trillion yen ($5 trillion) in debt over 10 years, trying to kick-start the economy with deficit spending on public works projects and with tax cuts. Any increase in interest rates now would risk sending debt service payments spiraling out of control.
To alleviate those fears, the central bank has been buying more and more government debt -- it is up to 1.2 trillion yen ($10 billion) in long-term bonds a month. Many investors expect Mr. Muto and Mr. Iwata to press for yet more purchases.
Those purchases may help keep a lid on long-term rates, but they will do little or nothing to spur growth or break deflationary expectations, analysts said. 
Naming two deputies who favor more bond purchases "looks analogous to having the accelerator pressed to the floor while the gears are in neutral and the hand brake is on," said Richard Jerram, an economist at ING Baring Securities.

HEADLINE: Labor, Under the Gun, Meets to Plot Strategy 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Fla., Feb 24 

 BODY:
As the nation's union leaders gather at a luxury resort here for their annual winter meeting, there is no denying they are in a funk. 
 For many unions -- especially the steelworkers, machinists and airlines -- the weak economy has meant devastating layoffs as well as pressure for deep concessions. The Bush administration has thrown labor on the defensive time and again, from proposing to privatize hundreds of thousands of federal jobs to obtaining the power to exempt employees from union contracts in the new Department of Homeland Security. 
 There is also trouble within the house of labor. Union leaders are bickering over political strategy and whether to support a war in Iraq. The movement has been embarrassed by a federal investigation into the way several union presidents who sat on the board of Ullico, a union-owned insurance company, made hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits from trading the insurer's stock. 
Adding to the discomfort, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is holding the meeting at a hotel that is the focus of a Department of Labor investigation and lawsuit. The department has sued several officials from the plumbers union for using $800 million from its pension fund to build the 39-story seafront hotel, the Westin Diplomat Resort and Spa, which has a spa, 10 clay tennis courts and an 18-hole golf course.
"Unions are clearly in a defensive mode," said Richard W. Hurd, a labor relations professor at Cornell University. "Unionized operations have been hit disproportionately by layoffs. It's a tough period right now for labor."
Some labor leaders expect more bad news on Tuesday, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics is to release its annual report on union membership. Despite the efforts by John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, to persuade unions to organize more workers, many union officials expect the bureau to report that union membership dropped last year nationwide, largely because of layoffs at heavily unionized companies, like Boeing, United Airlines and Bethlehem Steel.
Alarmed by the loss of membership, some labor leaders are saying the A.F.L.-C.I.O. meeting needs to focus on a single objective: figuring out ways to sign up more workers.
"We have not solved the organizing challenge that we have," said John Wilhelm, president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, which has lost 20,000 members since the Sept. 11 attacks. "We have to devote far more resources to that task and have to be far more aggressive about it."
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials are set to announce this week that the federation's 65 labor unions organized 520,000 workers last year; privately, though, some labor leaders said they thought some of those unions had exaggerated their numbers. 
For labor to rebound, many labor experts say that more unions need to imitate the vigorous organizing efforts and heavy spending of the Service Employees International Union, which said it organized 135,000 workers last year, far more than any other union.
In a novel step, Mr. Wilhelm; James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters; and several other union leaders agreed today to set up a nonprofit foundation to help promote the right to organize. The new group, the National Rights at Work Committee, will make the case that aggressive anti-union tactics by employers have unfairly undercut workers' ability to join unions and unions' ability to organize. 
This week, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. also plans to release a poll of 1,602 adults that found that 66 percent of respondents approved of unions, and 22 percent disapproved, an approval rating that would be the highest in 35 years. 
Labor leaders want President Bush and Congress to support legislation making it easier for unions to organize, but that is unlikely considering the political climate. Indeed, a big debate within labor's ranks is whether the overall movement has been hurt or helped by the efforts of individual unions to cooperate with President Bush and to work out deals with the administration and Congressional Republicans.
Some labor leaders are questioning the wisdom of working with Mr. Bush since he pushed to weaken union protections for employees in the Homeland Security Department; to privatize the hundreds of thousands of federal jobs; and to enact new tax cuts that help the rich disproportionately.
"There was some belief on the part of unions that this administration was reaching out and was going to listen, but I'd say the doors are slamming pretty fast," said Andrew Stern, president of the service employees' union. 
Even the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the union that President Bush has courted most vigorously, expressed dismay with recent administration moves. Bret Caldwell, the union's spokesman said, "The Teamsters union is certainly disappointed with some of the decisions that the Bush administration has made in recent months."
Noting the splits in the movement, Martin J. Maddaloni, president of the plumbers and pipefitters' union, faulted many unions that disagreed with President Bush's plans on issues like energy exploration in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
"The president's energy policy is a good one, and we should support it," he said. "It can create jobs."
As head of the union whose pension fund owns and built the Diplomat, Mr. Maddaloni will serve as the meeting's unofficial host. Many plumbers have criticized him for steering so much pension money into the hotel, arguing that the fund will never earn a good return on that investment. Indeed, in its suit, the Department of Labor says that the fund's trustees breached their fiduciary duties by investing so much.
But Mr. Maddaloni said: "It's a great investment. You remove money from the stock market, which hasn't done well, and you put it into real estate. The timing was perfect."
Some labor leaders have questioned the wisdom of holding the meeting at a hotel that is a target ofthe lawsuit. Officials noted that they reserved the Diplomat long before the lawsuit was brought.

HEADLINE: Daley Walks, Not Runs, Toward Chicago Election 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Tuesday is Election Day here in the nation's third-largest city. The ballots are printed. The polling machines are in place. Mayor Richard M. Daley has booked a ballroom at the Hilton for his victory party.
 The only thing missing is the campaign. 
 Mr. Daley, a 14-year incumbent inching toward his legendary father's 21-year tenure at Chicago's helm, has refused to debate his three opponents. After his 95-year-old mother died last Sunday, the mayor erased his entire schedule; he has made only two brief public appearances in the past 10 days. He declined to be interviewed as well.
The only glimpse of Mr. Daley is in television advertisements that seem more like a valentine to the city than an appeal for another term. The only reminders of the election are the banners throughout town on which aldermen pair their names with his, counting on coattails.
"It's a travesty -- it's totally disheartening," said Steve Edwards, host of "Eight-Forty-Eight," a public affairs program on radio station WBEZ. "If nothing else, campaigns, I would think, are supposed to be moments in which everyone can reflect on the state of the city today. When you don't have a robust campaign, you don't have a public conversation about the priorities."
The extraordinary lack of campaign activity in the mayor's race -- in which all the candidates are Democrats -- reflects the vacuum of political debate and dissent in recent years at City Hall. Votes on even controversial items are routinely 50 to 0 in line with the mayor's position. While his father, Richard J. Daley, ruled a political machine that traded patronage jobs for precinct turnout, this Mayor Daley has dangled local development and other neighborhood improvements as incentives. 
Helped by the economic boom of the 1990's, Mr. Daley is widely praised for improving Chicago's schools, beautifying its streetscape and bringing many large development projects to the city. But he has recently laid off 625 municipal workers and had to defend huge cost overruns at Millennium Park, a signature project downtown.
"I think he's infinitely more powerful than his father," said John Callaway, the longtime host of "Chicago Tonight," a public affairs television program. "The lack of opposition is probably the biggest impediment to his having an even better run. He needs to have his political and municipal judgmental muscles tested."
Vacancies have allowed Mr. Daley to appoint 19 of the current 50 aldermen; the others have him largely to thank for raising their salaries from $40,000 in 1989 to $98,000 by 2006. He has paired the loyalty of the dwindling white ethnic communities with support from lakefront liberals, middle-class blacks and the growing Hispanic neighborhoods to block any potential rainbow coalition from opposing him.
"Machiavelli said there's two ways to get devotion, fear and love -- some of them love him and some of them fear him," said Paul Green, a political scientist at Roosevelt University, noting the trend of City Council candidates' twinning their names with the mayor's on political paraphernalia. "It's sort of like putting lamb's blood over your door; you have to have Daley's support."
Some call it leadership by consensus; others, co-opting. In any case, the mayor has traded endorsements this year even with Helen Schiller, previously his most vocal critic on the City Council. With the results hardly in doubt, Tuesday is more a coronation than an election.
"This is a dictatorship, it's not a democracy," said Robert T. Starks, a political scientist at Northeastern Illinois University. 
Today, as the mayor huddled with far-flung relatives who had come to town for his mother's funeral, his main opponent, the Rev. Paul Jakes, shook hands amid the snow flurries at subway stops, then visited a high school, a college campus and a church. In the smelly basement of East-West University downtown, Mr. Jakes told a political science class how the Rev. Jesse Jackson, his son, Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., and former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, among others, had all declined to challenge the mayor.
"Not one elected official, not one businessperson, would step up to the plate," Mr. Jakes said, turning the dingy podium into a pulpit. "I said, 'Well, if you need someone and you want me to go, here I am.' "
Mr. Jakes criticized Mr. Daley's policies on subsidized housing and appointment of a man without a doctorate to run the school system. He denounced Chicago as a crime capital and questioned the accountability system in a city where 21 people were trampled to death last week in a nightclub that was supposed to have been closed by a court order. But his booming preacher's voice seemed to echo in the emptiness, with no television camera rolling. 
A few blocks away at Mr. Daley's re-election headquarters, six volunteers were scattered among 20 computer stations using software to dial phones and remind people that the polls would open in less than 18 hours. "It's the real McCoy," Deanna Shoss told one dubious voter. "It's the actual election for mayor. Glad we could call and remind you."
Greg Goldner, Mr. Daley's campaign manager, said volunteers had made 40,000 phone calls over the weekend and would call 35,000 numbers on Tuesday to get out the vote. And while Mr. Daley himself is on hiatus, his 24-member campaign staff has been dispatched to neighborhood coffees, Mr. Goldner said.
"We don't take it for granted," he added.
If gaining a majority is a foregone conclusion, Tuesday still brings important hurdles for Mr. Daley. His advisers hope he will top the 72 percent he received in the 1999 election. Perhaps even more important, they want a majority of African-American votes; the mayor won about 43 percent of the black vote last time, up from just 7 percent in 1989. 
But Jane M. Byrne, Chicago's mayor from 1979 to 1983, sees a more depressing trend in the numbers: turnout dropped from 48 percent in 1991 to 42 percent in 1995 and 1999, with 35 percent predicted for Tuesday. 
"The machine always likes it when there's not controversy; then they just sneak through," Ms. Byrne said. "We're probably one of the only places in the country that wants to hold an election in February, on purpose because of the weather."

HEADLINE: Graft Aggravates Woes Plaguing Central America 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: GUATEMALA CITY 

 BODY:
Long a mainstay of politics and business in Central America, corruption has taken on new life under the region's fledgling democracies and is more pervasive and corrosive than at any time in recent memory, analysts and diplomats say.
 For the most vulnerable countries, like Guatemala, barely six years from civil war, the problem is making it more difficult to consolidate law and order and gain popular trust in government. 
 For the United States it is undermining the fight against drugs, contraband and illegal immigrants as politicians and former military officers who had been built up as cold war allies now trade on their influence to enrich themselves. 
In January, Washington "decertified" Guatemala as a cooperative partner in the antidrug effort, a step that jeopardized millions of dollars in foreign aid and further tarnished Guatemala's image with investors. 
"I think it the most corrupt country right now," said Manuel Orozco, Central America project director at the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington.
The Guatemalan government, angered by the American decision, insists that the problem goes beyond drug trafficking -- and beyond Guatemala -- and that American officials have been inattentive to an issue that is nibbling away at efforts to generate trade and lift large swaths of the region out of poverty.
Indeed, Guatemala is hardly alone. Half of Central America's countries dwell in the bottom 20 percent of Transparency International's annual rankings of the most corrupt countries in which to conduct business.
In Honduras, millions of aid dollars sent for rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Mitch struck in 1998 have gone unaccounted for, while rural poverty and despair have increased.
Last year prosecutors in Nicaragua, one of the hemisphere's poorest countries, accused former President Arnoldo Aleman of stealing $100 million from the government. The shock felt by many Nicaraguans was compounded by the Nicaraguan Congress's slowness to lift the immunity that Mr. Aleman enjoyed as a legislator. He is now under house arrest awaiting trial.
In Panama, a country whose freewheeling economy has long been favored by those seeking to hide or channel illicit funds, corruption is nearly taken for granted.
Last year an opposition legislator, Carlos Afu, was accused by his own party of accepting $1.5 million for his vote to confirm two Supreme Court justices. He defended himself by appearing on television waving $6,000 in $100 bills that he said promoters had just paid him to approve their development project. The message: everyone here sells his vote.
Instead of being prosecuted as a confessed bribe taker, Mr. Afu, who now votes with the government, has been rewarded with a committee chairmanship. 
The Bush administration announced last year that it would make anticorruption efforts a condition for foreign aid increases. But the difficulty of withholding aid from governments in a poor region that has become a popular smuggling route was demonstrated when Washington waived penalties on national security grounds after it decertified Guatemala.
Guatemala presents a special challenge. By most measures it has not only the region's widest gap between rich and poor, but an everyday tolerance for corruption at almost all levels of government and business.
Carlos Gonzalez, a law student here, learned just how ingrained it had become when a police officer stopped him one night for no apparent reason, frisked him and asked about the cellphone he was carrying.
"He asked where the receipt was," Mr. Gonzalez recalled. "Of course, I didn't have it. So he told me the phone was stolen and was staying with him. Where can you go to complain about something like this -- to the police?"
Not exactly. Byron Barrientos, the former minister of governance who oversaw the police, is himself facing allegations of having embezzled as much as $13 million. Though no longer in office, he remains in government, as a member of Congress, joining some 20 other lawmakers embroiled in scandals.
"Corruption is a matter of double standard," Foreign Minister Edgar Gutierrez said in response to written questions. "Everyone points fingers, but few are willing to point fingers, combat and do away with corruption in their own profession or sector."
The big money, diplomats and human rights advocates say, is being made by a shadowy smuggling network of former military officers.
The group is a holdover from Guatemala's 36-year civil war with leftist guerrillas, when regional military commanders controlled lucrative businesses in illegal logging or amassed sprawling properties.
Now, as they adjust to the peace brought about by accords signed in December 1996, they are seeking other ways to secure their futures in retirement.
In addition, prosecutors say that about $100 million has been stolen by various high-ranking officials, some of whom have fled the country. Last year, in their frustration, American officials resorted to revoking numerous visas to block suspected criminals from doing business in or fleeing to the United States.
Among those whose visas were blocked was Francisco Ortega Menaldo, a former general whom American officials suspect of ties to drug trafficking and human rights abuses.
American officials increasingly suspect that security breaches are tipping off drug gangs to raids by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration. One of the biggest scandals last year involved the disappearance of 1.6 tons of cocaine from police custody and the subsequent disbanding of the country's antinarcotics squad.
Even in cases in which arrests have been made, suspects often go free. "Basically, all the sectors of law enforcement, the judiciary, the Public Ministry and the police have all been either bought off, penetrated or intimidated," said one diplomat.
Prosecutors are investigating five men who were once among the country's highest-ranking army officers in connection with smuggling of drugs and people.
But prosecutors complain that they are fearful, intimidated and underbudgeted as they have been inundated by more than 2,400 corruption cases since 2000. Distrustful of even the police, they find themselves staking out suspects on their own.
Karen Fischer, the special prosecutor for corruption, suspects compliant judges of putting up judicial roadblocks to delay or derail some cases. Even at the bottom of the bureaucratic chain, prosecutors and others find that clerks demand bribes simply to move paperwork.
"You have to fight with the court to not release people," Ms. Fischer said. "You have to fight with the police to bring them in. The problem of corruption in Guatemala is so spread out."
Under growing pressure, the government has set up an anticorruption commission to look at issues of inefficiency and official impunity, which are of special interest to international donors and lenders who will be meeting in May to review Guatemala's progress.
"Corruption in Guatemala is a type of social pathology that should be analyzed by a sociologist or psychiatrist," said Elfidio Cano, a member of the panel. "It has become a culture that legitimizes itself."

HEADLINE: City-Sold Lots Stay Vacant, Report Says 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Hundreds of vacant lots that the city has sold at auction since 1996 remain empty trash-strewn lots that blight neighborhoods in desperate need of more housing, according to a report released yesterday by a housing advocacy group.
 The report, by New York Acorn, found that in 10 neighborhoods with a great deal of vacant land, 66 percent of the vacant lots that the city has sold at public auction since 1996 remain vacant. The report, which was released at a City Hall news conference, called for a moratorium on future city land auctions. 
 Councilman James Sanders Jr., the chairman of the Council's Economic Development Committee, said that he supported the group's call to end the auctions.
"This highest-bidder system has led to speculation -- to land speculators, to people who are flipping land and just sitting on this land as we have a homeless problem that seems to skyrocket," he said.
The neighborhoods that the report studied because of their large number of vacant lots were Mott Haven, Hunts Point, Morrisania and Highbridge in the Bronx, Far Rockaway in Queens and Bedford-Stuyvesant, Bushwick, Crown Heights, Brownsville and East New York in Brooklyn. Councilman Charles Barron, who represents East New York, said, "Affordable housing has become an oxymoron in New York City."
City sales of vacant lots -- which accelerated in the 1990's in an effort to get more land on the tax rolls -- have declined in recent years, the report found. In 1999, the peak year, the city took in $100 million by selling vacant lots. Last year the city took in just $4.9 million. 
The Bloomberg administration, which outlined a plan in December to build thousands of new housing units for the city, is convening a task force to look at the sale of city-owned land, said Jennifer Falk, a mayoral spokeswoman. But the administration has no plans to stop the auctions, she said.

HEADLINE: Safe Therapy Is Found for High Blood-Clot Risk 

BYLINE:  By DENISE GRADY 

 BODY:
Low doses of a cheap blood-thinning drug can safely prevent dangerous blood clots in the veins of people who are prone to them, doctors reported yesterday, saying the findings should prompt an immediate change in treatment for high-risk patients.
 The drug, warfarin, also sold as Coumadin, has been in use since the 1950's and is available in generic form. 
 Until now, there has been no proven long-term therapy that is safe for high-risk patients. When a clot develops, people are usually given warfarin for three to six months, but then the drug is stopped, because it increases the risk of severe bleeding. Without warfarin, however, almost a third of the patients will form another clot within eight years. 
The new study has found that after a few months of standard treatment with full doses of warfarin, clots can be prevented with lower doses, about half of what is normally used to treat someone with a clot. The lower doses provide a safe middle ground, reducing the risk of more clots without increasing the risk of hemorrhage.
The study supporting the long-term use of small doses of warfarin is to be published April 10 in The New England Journal of Medicine but was released yesterday and posted on the journal's Web site (www.nejm.com ) because the findings have immediate implications for patients.
The study itself was halted ahead of schedule by its sponsor, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, because a safety board found such a benefit to treatment that it would have been unethical to keep giving placebos to people in the control group.
"This really ought to change the standard of care overnight," said Dr. Paul Ridker, the first author of the study and director of the center for cardiovascular disease prevention at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
"For the first time we have a study demonstrating a safe and effective treatment to prevent the recurrence of this condition," said Dr. Yves Rosenberg, a medical officer at the national institute. He said doctors should offer the treatment to all patients at risk for clots.
Blood clots, known as deep vein thrombosis, are considered a major public health problem in the United States. Estimates of the incidence vary, doctors say, because blood clots often go undiagnosed, including many fatal ones. 
Dr. Rosenberg, a medical officer at the institute, said 250,000 to 500,000 Americans a year suffered from clots. Others suggest there are two million cases a year in the nation.
Half occur in surgical patients or people with cancer, other illnesses or trauma, and half occur for no known reason. 
People at highest risk for developing blood clots are those who have had them in the past. The clots form most commonly in the legs, but about half break loose and reach the lungs, a condition called pulmonary embolism, which can be fatal. Blood clots in the lungs kill at least 10,000 Americans a year, and perhaps as many as 40,000, Dr. Rosenberg said.
Some people can develop clots from sitting or lying still for too long, even from sitting in cramped airplane seats on long flights -- hence the name "economy class syndrome."
In recent years, the tendency to develop clots has been recognized as a chronic disease, sometimes due to hereditary blood disorders. 
The study included 508 patients at 52 hospitals in the United States, Canada and Switzerland who were at high risk because they had already had blood clots, for no known reason. They were followed for an average of 2.1 years, some as long as 4.3 years. Half got low doses of warfarin, and half got placebos. Of the 253 on placebos, 37 developed blood clots, as compared with only 14 of 255 on the drug. The risk reduction was 64 percent. 
The treatment was safe, the researchers said. Although more patients on warfarin had hemorrhages (five versus only two in the placebo group), the difference was not statistically significant. One patient had a stroke caused by a brain hemorrhage, but that person was in the placebo group, not on warfarin.
Dr. Ridker said he and his colleagues began the study in hope of finding a way to help patients who were living with the constant threat of forming dangerous blood clots.
"It's frightening," Dr. Ridker said. "We take care of a lot of these patients, they have these risk factors and don't know what to do. Patients are frustrated."
Dr. Ridker said he asked the National Institutes of Health to pay for the study because he assumed that drug companies, which underwrite many studies, would not be interested, since warfarin is generic and companies would not make money promoting it.
Dr. Ridker said: "I said to N.I.H., 'Look, what do we do with these patients? Maybe a low dose will make just enough change in the coagulation system to prevent these blood clots from coming back, and maybe it will be safe."'
In an editorial accompanying the study in the journal, Dr. Andrew I. Schafer of the University of Pennsylvania said the study findings meant it would be reasonable for doctors to give low-dose warfarin to patients at risk for clots. But he also noted that the advice might change in the future, as more studies were done and as new drugs became available.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
North Korea Tests a Missile as South Korea Prepares for a New President

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Tuesday, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
North Korea, in a provocative reminder of the tense security situation on the Korean Peninsula, on Monday conducted its first missile launching test in three years, South Korea's Yonyap news agency said today.
 The move by North Korea appeared to be an attention-getting measure as a new South Korean president, who has vowed to be aggressive in reshaping his country's relationship with the United States, prepares to take office today. 
 The unidentified North Korean rocket was fired into the sea between Korea and Japan, but it landed in North Korean waters. North Korean missiles are considered to be highly accurate, and the move seemed carefully calibrated to draw attention without being highly provocative -- a flashing signal rather than a red light. In its last missile test, in 1998, North Korea launched a missile that flew over Japanese territory, setting off a crisis between the countries. 
Officials in Washington with access to American intelligence said they were not alarmed by the launching today, which they described as a test of a "short range tactical missile." It appeared to be an antiship missile, which would make the test far less threatening than the 1998 launching of the Taepodong long-range missile over Japan.
The missile in this test, American officials said, fell harmlessly into the Sea of Japan. "This is something that they test periodically," one official said, though it is not clear that North Korea has conducted such a launching for the past few years.
The Japanese foreign minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, said today that Japan was examining the reports about the missile, Agence France-Presse reported. Japanese news reports said the missile was a surface-to-vessel short-range Silkworm, which has a maximum range of 60 miles.
North Korea's move came as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrived here on an East Asia tour dedicated in part to drum up support for Washington's call for multilateral talks with North Korea. 
The departing president, Kim Dae Jung, gave a farewell speech on Monday in which he issued an indirect but unmistakable rebuff to the United States. "More than anything, dialogue between North Korea and the United States is the important key to a solution," he said.
Mr. Kim's comments are a mere foretaste of the difficulties in store for American policy makers on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korea is proceeding to restart its nuclear energy program, in defiance of international arms control agreements, while South Korea, under its incoming leader, Roh Moo Hyun, vows to oppose either economic penalties or a military strike.
Mr. Powell will take more comfort from Mr. Kim's comments about the presence of 37,000 American troops in this country, under a bilateral alliance forged in 1953 at the end of the three-year Korean War. "Realistically, for the maintenance of peace on the Korean Peninsula, North-South reconciliation and the solid South Korea-U.S. security alliance must be continued," Mr. Kim said.
Anti-American sentiment has grown in South Korea over the last year, including large street protests this winter against the American troop presence here. Although he has distanced himself from those demonstrations, Mr. Roh has spoken frequently and with apparent conviction about the need to "rebalance" the alliance with the United States, an ally that he has complained has become inattentive and overbearing.
Although he has often contradicted himself on the issue, Mr. Roh has also made statements suggesting that South Korea must begin preparing to assume responsibility for its own defense. The statements come against a backdrop of policy statements about North Korea, including the formation of an economic community with North Korea, which American and Korean regional analysts say would create tremendous strains with a Bush administration that is intent on isolating North Korea.
"If the American policy is simply to wait for North Korea to make a huge mistake, there is no future for the alliance, and no future for the American position in East Asia," said a close foreign policy adviser to Mr. Roh.
Mr. Kim's farewell comments sounded almost like a corrective, both to this kind of thinking and to foreign critics who have blamed his strategy of rapprochement with North Korea, known as the sunshine policy, for deteriorating relations with Washington.
The sunshine policy seemed to receive a fatal blow nearly two years ago, when the newly inaugurated President Bush received Mr. Kim at the White House and expressed open skepticism about efforts to reach out to the North. Later, Mr. Bush included North Korea in his so-called axis of evil.
In the last year of Mr. Kim's presidency, his standing with the South Korean public has plummeted. Snowballing scandals involving his cabinet and entourage wiped out a hard-won reputation for probity.
Mr. Kim can take some consolation in the election of Mr. Roh, who has not only taken inspiration from sunshine policy in forming his own approach to North Korea, but also seems inclined toward clemency toward Mr. Kim.

Two Agencies Shut Their Doors

BYLINE:  By Sean Mehegan 

 BODY:
Two agencies have closed because of the struggling economy, consolidation among clients and the losses of large accounts.
 One agency is Hampel/Stefanides in New York, which was shut by its parent, the Envoy Communications Group in Toronto, after 10 years in business. 
At one point recently, Hampel/Stefanides had 60 employees and billings estimated at $100 million, but it lost accounts like CDnow.com, Castrol Worldwide and National Discount Brokers. 
 Geoffrey Genovese, president at Envoy, which is trying to cut costs as revenue declines, confirmed a report of the closing this week in Adweek.
Larry Hampel and Dean Stefanides, founders and creative directors of Hampel/Stefanides, are joining the Tucker Partnership in New York, which is being renamed Tucker, Hampel, Stefanides & Partners. Mr. Hampel, Mr. Stefanides and William Tucker, managing director at Tucker, said they expected to attract former clients of Hampel/Stefanides like Aer Lingus, BASF and Steve Madden. The three men all worked together at a former agency, Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York.
Another agency that closed is HDC in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., formerly Harris Drury Cohen, which had been in business since 1980. As recently as 1999, the agency had billings estimated at $100 million and was trying to become a powerful force in South Florida advertising. But it lost several senior executives, as well as accounts like the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau and Sea-Doo.
Some remaining accounts and employees of HDC are being absorbed by Zimmerman & Partners Advertising in Fort Lauderdale, part of the Omnicom Group. Michael Goldberg, the chief executive at HDC, was named to the new post of chief marketing officer at Zimmerman.

Analyst Reduces Advertising Forecast

BYLINE:  By Sean Mehegan 

 BODY:
The analyst who follows Madison Avenue for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York, Lauren Rich Fine, has cut her estimates for advertising spending in 2003.
 In a report, Ms. 
Fine lowered her estimate of growth in American ad spending compared with 2002 to 3.7 percent from 4 percent. She also lowered her estimate of global growth to 2.7 percent from 3 percent. Ms. Fine attributed the revisions to a weak start for ad spending as the new year began, a decline in the European economy and unexpectedly strong ad spending in late 2002 that would make comparisons with 2003 more difficult. 
 Ms. Fine also offered her initial forecasts for ad spending in 2004, predicting an increase from 2003 of 6 percent in the United States and 5 percent worldwide.

STEWART, A CEMETERY OPERATOR, CUTS 2003 FORECAST

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Stewart Enterprises Inc., a leading operator of cemeteries and funeral homes, cut its 2003 forecast after fiscal first-quarter net income fell. The recession has made it harder for Stewart to sell prepaid funeral products and services, and yields from the company's trust funds are leaner amid slumping financial markets. 
First-quarter profit was also hurt by an increase in cremations, which are less profitable than traditional burials. The company, which is based in Metairie, La., lowered its 2003 earnings forecast to 30 cents to 35 cents a share, from 40 cents to 43 cents. Net income in the first quarter ended Jan. 31 fell to 9 cents a share, based on a preliminary review, the company said. Stewart's stock fell $1.19, or 25 percent, to $3.60 a share.

HEADLINE: 3 Large Retail Chains Report Snow Significantly Hurt Sales 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Three major retailers -- Federated Department Stores, J. C. Penney and Wal-Mart Stores -- said yesterday that February sales at stores open at least a year slowed after a snowstorm kept many people at home on Washington's Birthday. 
 Federated, the parent of Macy's, said sales at stores open at least a year would decline as much as 8.5 percent in February, more than its previous forecast for a drop of up to 5 percent. 
 J. C. Penney said February sales at its department stores fell as much as 3 percent, and Wal-Mart said sales were near the low end of its estimate for a gain of 2 to 4 percent. 
Stores from Virginia to New Hampshire closed after as much as 30 inches of snow fell over the Washington's Birthday weekend, with sales on the Monday dropping more than half from year-earlier levels. 
Shares in Federated dropped 76 cents, to $24.82; Wal-Mart declined $1.26, to $47.64; J. C. Penney fell 95 cents, to $19.39.
Sales on Washington's Birthday fell 55 percent from a year earlier in the Northeast, according to ShopperTrak RCT, which tracks data from more than 30,000 retailers. Sales had been within expectations before the snowstorm, the retailers said. 
 February sales at stores open at least a year are expected to rise 0.5 percent, said Mark Niemira, an economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. He reduced his estimate last week after forecasting an increase of as much as 2 percent at the beginning of the month. 
A spokesman for Wal-Mart, Tom Williams, said sales returned to normal levels by last Wednesday. Results were helped by sales of coats, shovels and food, he said. Wal-Mart closed stores in Washington and at least eight states last Monday. 
Macy's East, Federated's largest division, extended its holiday discounts through Sunday to pick up some lost sales after closing about 30 of about 110 stores last Monday, a spokeswoman for Macy's East, Elina Kazan, said. The east division accounts for about a third of sales at Federated, which also operates Bloomingdale's and Lazarus stores. 
J. C. Penney also closed stores in the Northeast last Monday. Sales at stores in the western United States rose for the week, J. C. Penney said. 
Sales at Penney's Eckerd drugstore division were unchanged, compared with expectations for a slight gain. Catalog and Internet sales declined about 12 percent, less than a forecast for a 20 percent drop.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo; 
The President's Tax Cut and Its Unspoken Numbers

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
The statistics that President Bush and his allies use to promote his tax-cut plan are accurate, but many of them present only part of the picture.
 For instance, in a speech in Georgia last week, the president asserted that under his proposal, 92 million Americans would receive an average tax reduction of $1,083 and that the economy would improve so much that 1.4 million new jobs would be created by the end of 2004. 
 No one disputes the size of the average tax reduction, and the jobs figure is based on the estimate of a prominent private economic forecasting firm. 
But this is what the president did not say: Half of all income-tax payers would have their taxes cut by less than $100; 78 percent would get reductions of less than $1,000. And the firm that the White House relied on to predict the initial job growth also forecast that the plan could hurt the economy over the long run. 
The average tax cut (the total amount of revenue lost divided by the total number of tax returns) is over $1,000 because a few rich taxpayers would get such large reductions. For households with incomes over $200,000, the average cut would be $12,496, and the average for those with incomes over $1 million would be $90,222.
But the cut for those with incomes of $40,000 to $50,000, according to calculations by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, would typically be $380. For those with incomes of $50,000 to $75,000, it would be $553.
The president's jobs figure was based on a preliminary analysis by Macroeconomic Advisers, of St. Louis. The firm, to whose services the White House subscribes, issued projections in January concluding that by raising disposable income, bolstering stock values and reducing the cost of capital, the president's program would lead to 1.365 million new jobs by the end of next year.
But the White House has never mentioned the caution in the second paragraph of the firm's report. The forecasters predicted that if the tax cuts were not offset within a few years by reductions in government spending, interest rates would rise, private investment would be crowded out, and the economy would actually be worse than if there had been no tax changes.
The president has not proposed spending reductions that would offset the tax cuts. To the contrary, the administration has argued that the budget deficits resulting from the cuts would be too small to harm the economy.
Another argument that administration officials make regularly is that under the president's plan, the wealthy would bear a larger share of the nation's tax burden than they do now. A table released last month by the Treasury's office of tax analysis showed that people with incomes over $100,000 would see their share of all income taxes rise to 73.3 percent from the current 72.4 percent.
At the same time, the table showed, taxpayers with incomes of $30,000 to $40,000 would get a 20.1 percent reduction in income taxes, and those earning $40,000 to $50,000 would get a 14.1 percent cut. 
The problem with figures like those is that a large percentage of a small amount of money may be less important to a low- or middle-income family's lifestyle than a small percentage of a large amount of money would be to a rich family. For example, a $50 tax cut would be a 50 percent reduction for a household that owed only $100 in taxes to start with, but that small amount of money would not significantly improve the family's well-being.
A better measure may be the increase in after-tax income, or take-home pay, that would result from tax cuts. According to data from the Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation, the tax reduction of $380 for a family with an income of $45,000 would amount to less than 1 percent of the household's after-tax income. But the $12,496 tax cut received by a family with an income of $525,000 would mean a 3 percent increase in money left after taxes.
The president and his advisers also offer a variety of incomplete statistics to bolster their proposal to eliminate the taxes on most stock dividends.
Among the points they make are that more than half of all taxable dividends are paid to people 65 and older, that their average saving from eliminating the tax on dividends would be $936, that 60 percent of people receiving dividends have incomes of $75,000 or less and that up to 60 percent of corporate profits are lost to income taxes paid by either the companies or the stockholders. 
All that is true, but here is a more complete picture:
Only slightly more than one-quarter of Americans 65 and older receive dividends. Two-thirds of the dividends the elderly receive are paid to the 9 percent of all elderly who have incomes over $100,000.
The Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute calculated that the average tax cut from the dividend exclusion would be $29 for those with incomes of $30,000 to $40,000 and $51 for taxpayers with incomes of $40,000 to $50,000.
On the other hand, the two-tenths of 1 percent of tax filers with incomes over $1 million (who have 13 percent of all income) receive 21 percent of all dividends, and the Tax Policy Center figured that their average tax reduction from the dividend exclusion would be $27,701. For taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 to $500,000, the typical tax cut from the exclusion was calculated at $1,766.
In instances where both the corporation and the shareholder are paying taxes at the maximum rate, it is possible, as the administration maintains, for 60 percent of the profits to be taxed away. But calculations based on I.R.S. data and performed by Robert S. McIntyre of the nonpartisan Citizens for Tax Justice show that on average, only 19 percent of corporate profits are paid in taxes by companies and shareholders combined. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 1, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A Washington Memo article on Tuesday about the Bush administration's use of statistics to promote its tax-cut plans referred imprecisely to the source it used to project that the cuts would create 1.4 million jobs by the end of next year. While the administration did take into account a preliminary analysis by the St. Louis forecasting firm of Macroeconomic Advisers, the White House officially cited the work of its own Council of Economic Advisers.

HEADLINE: Blair Outlines Plans to Slash Emissions Over 50 Years 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Tony Blair laid out ambitious plans today to fight global warming by cutting carbon dioxide emissions in Britain by 60 percent in the next five decades and gently criticized President Bush for failing to do more to combat the damaging effects of greenhouse gases.
 Framing the issue of global warming as one of national security, Mr. Blair said the United States was wrong to back out of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which sought to minimize noxious carbon dioxide fumes. The Bush administration drew the ire of a number of industrialized nations when it backed out of the treaty, arguing that compliance would cost American businesses too much money. 
 But today, in clear disagreement with Britain's foreign policy ally, Mr. Blair said economic growth and environmental awareness can coexist.
"Even the Kyoto targets have proved controversial with some countries, notably America," Mr. Blair said at a conference on sustainable development here. "Many see it as a threat to the pursuit of economic growth. I believe this needn't be the case. If we harness new technology, the evidence is mounting that we can achieve a target of 60 percent, and at reasonable cost."
The prime minister added, "There will be no genuine security if the planet is ravaged by climate change."
Mr. Blair's proposals on global warming would far exceed the standards of the Kyoto treaty, which would require countries to slash greenhouse gas emissions to below 1990 levels by 2012. That would amount to a 2 percent cut, Mr. Blair said. In his plan, Britain would cut the carbon dioxide it releases into the atmosphere by 60 percent by 2050.
Carbon emissions, the noxious fumes produced by cars and factories, have been cited as causes for global warming. The gradual warming of the earth's temperatures has unleashed catastrophic floods and storms around the world, causing enormous, irreparable damage, Mr. Blair said.
He said he and the Swedish prime minister, Goeran Persson, had written to Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece, whose country holds the rotating European Union presidency, calling on other European countries to adopt the 60 percent goal.
"Whilst Kyoto was an enormous achievement, it is simply not enough," Mr. Blair told the audience.
The government also promised hundreds of millions of dollars to make Britain more energy efficient and to spur the use of renewable power sources like wind and waves. It also plans to create an exchange system by 2005, similar to one in the United States, that will allow companies that produce too much carbon dioxide to buy credits from companies that fall below the threshold.
The plan, laid out in a white paper, steps away from any increase in the use of nuclear power to offset Britain's oil consumption -- a contentious issue -- but it does not rule out the construction of more nuclear plants.
Environmentalists praised Mr. Blair's plans today and said they hoped he would not stray from his goals of conserving energy and reducing greenhouse gases.
Britain, which produces oil and natural gas from fields in the North and Irish seas, will become a net importer of gas by about 2006 and oil by 2010 as its supplies dwindle, the white paper stated.
Mr. Blair said he would continue to press the United States and other industrialized countries to intensify their efforts to fight global warming.
President Bush sparked a furor among the signers of the Kyoto Protocol when his administration announced that it would not ratify the agreement, which it saw as unworkable for American companies. Instead, the administration sought voluntary commitments from companies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
"We will continue to make the case to the U.S. and to others that climate change is a serious threat that we must address together as an international community," he said. "We in Britain have shown that it is possible to break the relationship between economic growth and ever rising pollution."

An article on Feb. 25 about Britain's plans to fight global warming by reducing carbon dioxide emissions characterized the gas incorrectly. It is not noxious except in extremely high concentrations.

HEADLINE: Governors Get Sympathy From Bush but No More Money 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
President Bush told governors today that he would not support proposals to provide new fiscal assistance to states struggling with what governors say is the worst financial problems since World War II.
 The governors heard the grim message in a visit to the White House on the third day of the annual winter meeting of the National Governors Association. 
 Governors of both parties said that while Mr. Bush understood their problems, he offered no money. 
"The president did not offer additional fiscal assistance," said Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado, chairman of the Republican Governors Association.
Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, said: "President Bush was honest and frank. He told us there's no more money for anything. He said essentially, 'You're on your own.' "
The meeting has exposed a partisan rift within the governors association, which normally operates by consensus. Democratic governors said Mr. Bush had ignored the states' fiscal problems, and they asserted that his tax proposals could exacerbate those problems. Republicans defended Mr. Bush and said governors should not always be begging for more federal aid.
In an effort to patch up their differences, the governors agreed on a statement urging the federal government to pay more of the cost of federal mandates in education, Medicaid and domestic security. They did not request a specific amount of money, though the proposal could mean a significant increase.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush told the governors that he wanted to work with them to improve education, health care and domestic security. He deflected calls for more money by restating his support for tax cuts as a way to stimulate the economy, create jobs and increase revenue for the federal government and the states.
"Since the economy is not as good as we would like it to be, we ought to accelerate the tax relief" adopted in 2001, Mr. Bush said. Eliminating the taxation of most stock dividends "will be stimulative in the sense that it gets $20 billion into our economy this year," Mr. Bush said, adding that "it helps capital formation," which in turn enables entrepreneurs to hire more people.
Mr. Bush, a former governor of Texas, said the federal government had fiscal problems of its own and could not bail out the states.
"We've got an issue with our own budget, and you've got issues with your budgets," Mr. Bush said. "We can talk about that. Our budget is in a deficit. It's because we went through a recession and we're at war."
Gov. James E. Doyle of Wisconsin, a Democrat, gave this account of the White House meeting: "There was a lot of talk about giving states more flexibility, but I did not hear anybody say there was more money coming."
Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican, said, "You can't just keep printing money."
White House budget documents, issued three weeks ago, show that federal grants to state and local governments are expected to rise 9 percent this year, to $384 billion.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, received a mixed reaction today when he asked the governors to support sweeping changes in Medicaid, the federal-state program for 45 million low-income people.
Under the administration's proposal, states would still have to cover most welfare recipients and poor children, but would receive vast new power to alter or eliminate benefits and eligibility for about 15 million other Medicaid recipients, including many who are elderly or disabled.
"You have complete discretion" over those optional beneficiaries, Mr. Thompson told the governors. 
Referring to the Bush proposal, Mr. Thompson said, "It's a program set up for governors." Moreover, he said: "You would not have to match dollar for dollar the federal government's share. This is a net saving to every state."
Governors of both parties like the prospect of having more control over Medicaid costs, one of the fastest-growing items in state budgets. But they said they were worried that the Bush proposal could eventually cap the federal contribution to state Medicaid programs.
The National Governors Association decided today to establish a bipartisan committee of eight governors to negotiate with the administration and Congress on changes that could be made in Medicaid this year.
"It's vitally important to move very quickly," Mr. Thompson said.
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, expressed reservations about the Bush proposal. "The federal government would give you more money in the first seven years, but take it back in the next three years," Mr. Breaux told the governors.
Mr. Breaux urged the governors to think carefully about the hardship that could result in the final three years. "You will have drastic slashing of optional programs," Mr. Breaux said, noting that prescription drugs were an optional benefit that could be cut under the president's proposal. 
Mr. Thompson said the federal government would still provide "an open checkbook" to the states for people whom the states are required to cover. But he made no guarantees for the other recipients. 
Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican, said the president's Medicaid proposal was "very attractive because it enables us to get a handle on Medicaid growth and costs."
But Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, said that under the Bush proposal "much of the financial risk could be transferred from the federal government to the states," and he said that states would face "some great big cuts at the tail end" of the 10-year period.
Mr. Dingell said he favored a temporary increase in the federal share of Medicaid, as proposed by Senators Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia.
Mr. Thompson has rejected that proposal, saying it would give states a license to reduce their own Medicaid spending.

HEADLINE: Threats, Promises And Lies 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
So it seems that Turkey wasn't really haggling about the price, it just wouldn't accept payment by check or credit card. In return for support of an Iraq invasion, Turkey wanted -- and got -- immediate aid, cash on the barrelhead, rather than mere assurances about future help. You'd almost think President Bush had a credibility problem.
 And he does. 
 The funny thing is that this administration sets great store by credibility. As the justifications for invading Iraq come and go -- Saddam is developing nuclear weapons; no, but he's in league with Osama; no, but he's really evil -- the case for war has come increasingly to rest on credibility. You see, say the hawks, we've already put our soldiers in position, so we must attack or the world won't take us seriously. 
But credibility isn't just about punishing people who cross you. It's also about honoring promises, and telling the truth. And those are areas where the Bush administration has problems.
Consider the astonishing fact that Vicente Fox, president of Mexico, appears unwilling to cast his U.N. Security Council vote in America's favor. Given Mexico's close economic ties to the United States, and Mr. Fox's onetime personal relationship with Mr. Bush, Mexico should have been more or less automatically in America's column. But the Mexican president feels betrayed. He took the politically risky step of aligning himself closely with Mr. Bush -- a boost to Republican efforts to woo Hispanic voters -- in return for promised reforms that would legalize the status of undocumented immigrants. The administration never acted on those reforms, and Mr. Fox is in no mood to do Mr. Bush any more favors. 
Mr. Fox is not alone. In fact, I can't think of anyone other than the hard right and corporate lobbyists who has done a deal with Mr. Bush and not come away feeling betrayed. New York's elected representatives stood side by side with him a few days after Sept. 11 in return for a promise of generous aid. A few months later, as they started to question the administration's commitment, the budget director, Mitch Daniels, accused them of "money-grubbing games." Firefighters and policemen applauded Mr. Bush's promise, more than a year ago, of $3.5 billion for "first responders"; so far, not a penny has been delivered.
These days, whenever Mr. Bush makes a promise -- like his new program to fight AIDS in Africa -- experienced Bushologists ask, "O.K., that's the bait, where's the switch?" (Answer: Much of the money will be diverted from other aid programs, such as malaria control.)
Then there's the honesty thing.
Mr. Bush's mendacity on economic matters was obvious even during the 2000 election. But lately it has reached almost pathological levels. Last week Mr. Bush -- who has been having a hard time getting reputable economists to endorse his economic plan -- claimed an endorsement from the latest Blue Chip survey of business economists. "I don't know what he was citing," declared the puzzled author of that report, which said no such thing.
What Americans may not fully appreciate is the extent to which similarly unfounded claims have, in the eyes of much of the world, discredited the administration's foreign policy. Whatever the real merits of the case against Iraq, again and again the administration has cited evidence that turns out to be misleading or worthless -- "garbage after garbage after garbage," according to one U.N. official.
Despite his decline in the polls, Mr. Bush hasn't fully exhausted his reservoir of trust in this country. People still remember the stirring image of the president standing amid the rubble of the World Trade Center, his arm around a fireman's shoulders -- and our ever-deferential, protective media haven't said much about the broken promises that followed. But the rest of the world simply doesn't trust Mr. Bush either to honor his promises or to tell the truth.
Can we run a foreign policy in the absence of trust? The administration apparently thinks it can use threats as a substitute. Officials have said that they expect undecided Security Council members to come around out of fear of being on the "wrong" side. And Mr. Bush may yet get the U.N. to acquiesce, grudgingly, in his war. 
But even if he does, we shouldn't delude ourselves: whatever credibility we may gain by invading Iraq is small recompense for the trust we have lost around the world.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
Provincial Upstarts Who Changed the World

BYLINE:  By BENSON BOBRICK; Benson Bobrick is the author of "Angel in the Whirlwind: The Triumph of the American Revolution," among other books.

 BODY:
TO BEGIN THE WORLD ANEW
The Genius and Ambiguities of the American Founders
By Bernard Bailyn
Illustrated.
185 pages. Knopf. $26.
 Every once in a while a book of history comes along that seems to perfectly inhabit its own sphere. This is such a book. It is small, made up of five topical essays of modest length; but within its brief compass it delineates the world of the founding fathers with equatorial poise, clarity and grace. 
 Early American history is Bernard Bailyn's choice domain, and for the past 40 years or so no one has been a better guide to the riches it can yield. His previous work has earned him two Pulitzer Prizes and a National Book Award, among other honors. In this new book, "To Begin the World Anew," he seems to have distilled the thought of a lifetime into a group of unimpeachable assessments that take the measure of each subject with a just and proportionate eye. 
Each subject is one that counts. He looks at the relatively "provincial" world of the founders, which allowed the freshness of their ideas to flourish unchoked by the assumptions of Old World salons; at the inner coherence of Thomas Jefferson's mercurial career; at Benjamin Franklin's succes d'estime in Paris as part of the American delegation; the nature and lasting force of the Federalist Papers; and the immediate impact of the new American constitutional ideas on political thought throughout Europe and the Western Hemisphere.
"The founders of the American nation," Mr. Bailyn writes, "were one of the most creative groups in modern history. . . . Again and again they were warned of the folly of defying the received traditions, the sheer unlikelihood that they, obscure people on the outer borderlands of European civilization, knew better than the established authorities that ruled them; that they could successfully create something freer, ultimately more enduring than what was then known in the centers of metropolitan life." 
The assessment of Jefferson is particularly fine, if only because he has suffered of late by comparison with John Adams, whom Mr. Bailyn also esteems. Jefferson (like Adams) had notable faults, and these are not denied. But the positive impact of his gigantic presence is also well affirmed: Beyond his contribution to the Declaration of Independence (a committee effort, true, but closely based on his draft), we are reminded of his great state paper, the Act for Establishing Religious Freedom, from which our traditions of free worship in some measure flow; of his foremost role in proposing the Bill of Rights ("what the people are entitled to against every government on earth"); of his Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge, in support of public education ("Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day"), and other fundamental contributions to American life. The sweeping achievements of his two terms as president hardly bear dispute.
Jefferson's early anti-Federalist stance, moreover (for which he has often been scourged), was rooted in a principled fear of abuses by centralized power, while his opposition to Alexander Hamilton's scheme for economic development (as tied to the Bank of the United States) was fairly based on a conviction that monied interests might ultimately corrupt the American political system, as they had that of England under George II.
Though by turns a principled moralist, crafty opportunist, apostle of the Enlightenment, and firebrand of revolutionary zeal, Jefferson re-emerges here in sum as a truly great man; as one, in truth, who tried to keep the promise of the Revolution going and whose apparent gyrations revolved around his core "romantic vision" of a life that only free institutions could secure.
"More than any other of the Revolution's original leaders," Mr. Bailyn writes, "Jefferson explored the ambiguities of freedom." For that he paid a heavy price. Obliged to assume a hundred roles, in the end "he left a legacy of compromise and incompleteness which his critics would forever assail." 
Jefferson was one kind of "tempered idealist." Franklin another. In Franklin, Mr. Bailyn finds the realism and idealism of American diplomacy deftly blended and personified. No one was more competent at holding the two together, or more curious in projecting the changing public image of himself as that of the new American man. Mr. Bailyn looks at his protean incarnations -- as a businessman, scientist, rustic diplomat and thinker -- each memorably rendered in a series of timely portraits, some painted, some carved or in sculptured form.
Ultimately, his cumulative persona in the portraiture becomes endowed with a mythological largeness that seems to fuse his American image with that of the enlightened hopes of "humanity itself." This is the famous portrait by Joseph Duplessis, which "radiates experience, wisdom, patience,tolerance and a world-weariness beyond all cleverness and guile. One sees, and feels, a dignified presence, a calm, dispassionate, rich personality unconstrained by nationality, occupation or rank." Franklin favored it above all others, and declined to sit for other portraits after it was done.
As the type and epitome of the shrewd but visionary sage, Franklin helped craft the Franco-American alliance that made British defeat in the war all but certain. A decade later, on the home front, the founders, in a similar spirit, forged the Constitution into a document that gave their ideals a practicable form. Rejecting the popular theory (as advanced by Thomas Paine in "Common Sense") "that simplicity in government was a virtue, complexity an unmitigated evil," they wrestled over the matter like Jacob with the angel until at last they were able to persuade one another and themselves that the rights and freedoms of the individual could be secured only by an intricate balance of powers within a constitutional frame. Even Jefferson came to accept the notion (then novel) that sovereignty could be divided, and power "created and constrained at the same time." In this way, by subtle reformation and amendment, the great document became a "bill of powers and a bill of rights combined." 
Some of the arguments involved in its creation are preserved in the Federalist Papers, a series of polemical essays written in a white heat during the ratification process. Though plainly partisan, flung out like ephemeral flares, these papers have since acquired their monumental status as a gloss on the intentions of the founders, with an authority just below that of the Constitution itself. Mr. Bailyn's discussion of their dialectic is intellectually thrilling as he shows how some of the more difficult issues were resolved. 
After the Constitution was approved, the new ideas it contained caught fire and spread. Within a generation or two, they had "inspired the march toward radical social goals" in England, helped frame the constitutional debate in revolutionary France, influenced the form of government other European countries would adopt, and encouraged the development of democracy in Latin America, though the story there remains one of shattered hopes.
This is a gem of a book, rich in understanding, well wrought within its scale. Though Mr. Bailyn is fond of opposing the "metropolitan" to the "provincial" as perennial opposites in thought and style, such pairings, of course, borrow truth from each other's strength. That might be said of Mr. Bailyn's own pages, which offer a thoroughly urbane account of the provincial wellsprings of our nation's life.

HEADLINE: Winter Has a Dark Side: What Luck 

BYLINE:  By ED LEVINE

 BODY:
IF ever there was a season for hot chocolate, it has been this one. At its best, a cup of hot chocolate is the ultimate deep-winter pick-me-up, an almost mystical blend of bittersweet chocolate intensity and creaminess. And at its worst . . . well, it's still a cup of hot chocolate.
 This queen of cold-weather comfort elixirs seems to be everywhere these days. At Craftbar on East 19th Street, the hot chocolate comes infused with cardamom. At Otto in Greenwich Village, it's cut with hazelnut, a ruff of whipped cream peeking from the top of the mug. At the Gramercy Tavern on East 20th Street, it's an R-rated affair, spiked with peppermint liqueur. And at Beppe in the Flatiron district, Cesare Casella, the chef, sends his lunch patrons back to their offices after a little glass of hot chocolate flavored with cinnamon, black pepper and a pinch of salt. 
 There's hot chocolate at Blue Fin in Times Square, and at Nougatine off Central Park. That fellow at Rockefeller Center, sipping from a paper cup? He's drinking Swiss Miss from the deli down the street, and enjoying every sip. 
Given the seasonal ubiquity of hot chocolate, it's surprising that so many unanswered questions surround it. For instance, what's the difference between hot chocolate and hot cocoa? And who invented hot chocolate? Should it be made with milk and cream, or just water? And what's with all the spices people add to it?
First, a little hot chocolate history. The cocoa tree -- from whose seeds, called beans, chocolate is made -- is native to the tropical Americas. Ground cocoa beans, which were mixed with cold water and spices, arrived in Europe in 1528, when Hernando Cortes took them back to Spain from Mexico; he had seen the Aztecs drinking chocolate, as they had for centuries. Flavored with vanilla and hot peppers, this drink forms the basis for the Mexican hot chocolate available today in Mexican restaurants all over the city (generally sweetened with sugar and cinnamon).
In the aftermath of Cortes's discovery, sweetened chocolate boiled in mulled wine became the favored court drink of Charles V, king of Spain, and since Charles was also the Duke of Burgundy and the Holy Roman Emperor, it spread throughout the Western world. The British added milk to the mixture in the early 18th century.
Cocoa powder is different from chocolate, though they come from the same source: ground cocoa beans. For chocolate, the beans are roasted, softened into a paste and mixed with cane sugar. For cocoa, using a process developed in 1828 by a Dutchman named Conrad Van Houten, the beans are pulverized and the cocoa butter is extracted, leaving the powder, which contains much less fat and much less acidity than chocolate itself. Cocoa powder mixes easily with milk and sugar and is as easily digested; hot cocoa mixed with milk, or sometimes with water, was a favorite children's drink as early as the mid-19th century.
Shaved chocolate mixed with heavy cream, however, was a decidedly adult confection, one that reached its premodern apogee at the beginning of the last century, in Paris. It was there, in 1903, near the Tuileries outdoor skating rink on the Rue de Rivoli, that Antoine Rumpelmayer opened Rumpelmayer, later to become the legendary Cafe Angelina, named after his daughter-in-law. Rumpelmayer's chocolat l'africain, which took its name from the origin of the beans, was an intense chocolaty brew, rich and only barely sweet. It was served in a steaming pot with a bowl of whipped cream on the side. Marcel Proust and Coco Chanel were dedicated fans.
The Rumpelmayer name became synonymous with hot chocolate in New York when a Rumpelmayer's opened in the St. Moritz hotel on Central Park South around 1930, serving melted Swiss chocolate bars cut with hot milk in metal pitchers with a ramekin of whipped cream on the side.
Rumpelmayer's enjoyed a long run at the center of New York's hot-chocolate universe, but it closed several years ago -- more a victim of age and exhaustion than of a nation's changing tastes. Serendipity 3, on East 60th Street, with its vaunted frozen hot chocolate desserts, sought to fill the void.
But it was an unemployed television producer named Maury Rubin who would really save the day, by opening City Bakery in 1990, in a storefront opposite Union Square Park. Mr. Rubin, who had left a job with the sportscaster Howard Cosell to learn the sweet-tooth trade, developed a hot chocolate of such incredibly creamy richness and flavor as to challenge anything the Holy Roman Emperor could have loved. The menu listed 14 other items; the hot chocolate was the draw.
Mr. Rubin's hot chocolate, then as now, is an arteriosclerotically thick, delightfully rich concoction that is far more complex and yet homier and more American than anything served at Cafe Angelina or Rumpelmayer's (restaurants Mr. Rubin claims never even to have visited.) Mr. Rubin has never divulged the recipe, but when pressed he will admit to using three kinds of chocolate, milk, cream and one other, unnamed, ingredient.
Not helpful.
But what is no mystery is the effect Mr. Rubin's hot chocolate had on the city's hot chocolate landscape. He opened the floodgates for the sea of serious hot chocolate contenders that exist in New York today.
Some stalwarts, of course, still maintain the old Cafe Angelina tradition. Indeed, when Maribel Lieberman opened Mariebelle in SoHo in 2000, she was planning to serve Angelina chocolate, still made in France. But when a problem arose in importing it, she decided to create her own hot chocolate recipe, inspired, of course, by the original. Ms. Lieberman uses Callebaut chocolate, whole dry milk and a tad of cornstarch. Her confection comes in regular, dark, mocha and spicy flavors, the last flavored with ancho and chipotle peppers, cinnamon and nutmeg. And unless otherwise requested, she makes it with water.
"When you make it with water you really taste the chocolate," she said. "When I make it with milk, I find the fat in the milk actually cuts the intense chocolate flavor."
After tasting both versions, I am surprised to say that I agree with her, though the water doesn't give you the same velvety consistency of Mr. Rubin's hot chocolate.
But beyond the European tradition, there are many others.
At Kitchen, a Mexican food shop and takeout place in Chelsea, the owner, Dona Abramson, makes satisfying, child-friendly hot chocolate from Ibarra chocolate, which has cinnamon in it, and steamed milk. She leaves the chili peppers out. It's much sweeter than any of the serious Mexican-inspired hot chocolates around town. In fact, without the cinnamon, it would taste very American.
In Brooklyn, the famed chocolatier Jacques Torres combines European richness with Mexican verve. "When I decided to get into hot chocolate I went to Oaxaca and watched all this chocolate being made," he said. "They were using dark chocolate and cinnamon and ancho chilies." Mr. Torres now makes two kinds of hot chocolate -- one inspired by Mexico, with cinnamon, chipotle and ancho chilies, and one decidedly French, with no spices at all.
Still, the best hot chocolate is often the one you have when you need it most. I drank my most satisfying cup in a hut 30 miles outside Quebec. I had just driven a dog sled for two hours through snowy woods in temperatures well below zero. I'm sure the mixture had come out of a packet; it was made from cheap cocoa powder and lots of sugar. But it went down as satisfyingly as any of the fancy-pants hot chocolates mentioned above and in the accompanying listing. Chocolate is like that. It's never a fair-weather friend.

Cup a Day Keeps Cold Away
SINCE the onset of winter I have kept warm with at least one cup of hot chocolate a day. Here's a list of my current favorites.
The hot chocolate that Maribel Lieberman serves for $3 to $6.75 at MARIEBELLE is so intensely flavored that most customers take it only in demitasse cups. Ms. Lieberman makes her brew with hot water instead of milk, a practice that proved to be right on the money even when I made it at home using the mix she sells in gorgeous tins. 484 Broome Street (West Broadway); (212) 925-6999.
Jacques Torres of JACQUES TORRES CHOCOLATE in Brooklyn also sells tins of hot chocolate mix, in which he uses a slightly less full-flavored chocolate than Ms. Lieberman. He makes up for it by brewing the chocolate he sells in his shop with milk instead of water and serving it in full-size cups ($2.50). A delightfully spicy quasi-Mexican version is also available. 66 Water Street, Brooklyn; (718) 875-9772.
At the LUNCHBOX FOOD COMPANY , Shawn Glenn, the chef, makes a lovely Mexican-influenced cup with Guittard chocolate shavings, cinnamon, milk and cream ($2.75). Mr. Glenn says it's the same hot chocolate he makes for his children at home. (Nice to have a chef for a dad.) 357 West Street (Clarkson Street); (646) 230-9466.
Thirteen years after he introduced the city's first designer hot chocolate at CITY BAKERY , Maury Rubin continues to make a sublime cup of molten chocolate lava ($3), at 10 ounces one of the city's most difficult to finish. Savvy City Bakery customers know he also sells a demitasse portion for $1, the best serious hot chocolate buy in the city. (It's best to tell the person at the counter to skip the shake of cocoa powder used as garnish. The chocolate doesn't need it.) 3 West 18th Street; (212) 366-1414.
The Italians are generally not known for their hot chocolate prowess, but OTTO'S pastry chef, Meredith Kurtzman, makes a wondrous mug, with infused hazelnut and a dollop of whipped cream on top ($5). It's the ultimate Baci kiss. 1 Fifth Avenue (Eighth Street); (212) 995-9559.
Scott Campbell, the chef and owner of @SQC , says he dares customers to finish the 14 ounces of insanely rich melted Valrhona chocolate he serves under the hot chocolate label ($4). The dollop of whipped cream he places on top is not nearly big enough to leaven the intensity. 270 Columbus Avenue (72nd Street); (212) 579-0100.
I've come to realize that the hot chocolate served at FIVE POINTS in NoHo is not a beverage or even a dessert. It's a meal. Marc Meyer, the chef, starts with a standard Ibarra brand Mexican hot chocolate mix and adds to it a ganache made from Belgian dark chocolate. This yields a perfect cross-cultural hot chocolate -- cinnamony and rich and just chocolaty enough ($8). Dip in one of the freshly fried churros, or Mexican crullers, that accompany the mug, and forget about eating again that day. 31 Great Jones Street (Bowery); (212) 253-5700.
Finally, sitting in the elegant bar under the red and yellow circus tarps and trapeze ladders that dot the ceiling at OSTERIA DEL CIRCO , I had an over-the-top hot chocolate ($6.50) created by the pastry chef, David Gomez, with bittersweet chocolate, cream, sugar and egg yolk, served with a glass ramekin of whipped cream on the side. 120 West 55th Street; (212) 265-3636.

HEADLINE: Broadway Impasse On Music: Computers Tune Up 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
Broadway shows started rehearsing this week with computer-generated music as they prepared for a possible strike by union musicians, whose contract expires on Sunday.
 As contract talks between producers and musicians grew increasingly tense, the Broadway producers said the synthesized digital music, for which the show's conductor sets the tempo, was a last resort they had been forced to consider. The two sides are at an impasse over the minimum number of musicians that shows are required to carry under their union agreement. The contract dictates how many players must be employed in each Broadway theater; the minimums are from 3 to 26, depending on the size of the house. Since 1993, the union has allowed some exceptions to the rules. 
 "There is no intent to end live music on Broadway," Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, which represents Broadway producers, said at a news conference yesterday. 
Mr. Bernstein said the producers had "to be prepared for our shows to play." He added, "And they will in fact play if there is a work stoppage."
It is unclear whether audiences would be able to obtain refunds for performances without live orchestras. "We will announce refund policies if and when a strike should happen," Mr. Bernstein said.
The union insists that doing away with minimums will eventually mean doing away with live music. "I cannot agree to get rid of them," said Bill Moriarity, president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians. "Little by little, they'd get rid of all of us. We don't believe their real commitment to live music."
The two sides have been negotiating regularly since the beginning of the month. Mr. Moriarity said a strike authorization vote was scheduled for Saturday, but he was still hopeful about a settlement. A strike would affect 325 working musicians and another 1,000 union members, he said. The last work stoppage was in 1975. "We have not been talking about a strike," he said. "We intend to negotiate."
Mr. Bernstein of the league said a work stoppage "would be particularly devastating at this time," given the economy.
If the musicians strike one production, the Broadway producers said they would lock them out entirely from the 21 shows running or about to open on Broadway, including smash hits like "The Producers," "Hairspray" and "La Boheme." "The show must go on, with or without union musicians," said Tom Viertel, who produced "The Producers." In the event of a lockout, Mr. Moriarity said the union would picket the theaters.
The current contract has run for five years. Talks over a new contract have involved issues like salary increases and safety questions. Both sides agree that minimums are the make-or-break issue. 
To fulfill the minimums, the producers use a variety of strategies: having actors play instruments onstage for no additional pay, adding paid musicians to the orchestra and hiring so-called walkers, musicians who do not play. (There is currently one in "Hairspray.") "This is a method that must come to an end," Barry Weissler, who produced "Chicago," said of the walkers. "It is just a way to circumvent the rules."
Mr. Moriarity said he was willing to negotiate the minimums downward, without eliminating them entirely. The league has refused to respond to that suggestion.
The league argues that London and other American cities do not have minimums and still have live music. "It is impossible in this economic environment to propagate something no other union has -- guaranteed minimum employment, regardless of the artistic needs of a production," Mr. Bernstein said.
Although Disney, which produced "The Lion King," "Aida" and "Beauty and the Beast," and Dodger Theatricals, which produced "42nd Street," are not members of the league, they are participating in the contract negotiations as coordinated partners. The negotiations affect all Broadway musicals except "Cabaret," which is under a separate contract because it plays at Studio 54. 
Mr. Moriarity said the musicians had received "expressions of solidarity" (but nothing formal) from other unions, namely those representing stagehands and actors. Under their Actors' Equity Association contract, actors are required to report for this week's rehearsals, which feature the digital music.
Mr. Moriarity said the actors were rehearsing only under threat of an injunction, an assertion that Actors' Equity confirmed.
Mr. Bernstein said this was untrue. "Complete lie," he said. "That's outrageous." 
In separate statements, both Actors' Equity and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, which represents stagehands, said they were reserving comment on the negotiations. 
A petition supporting the musicians was signed by more than 40 composers, music directors, orchestrators and arrangers, including John Kander, composer of "Chicago"; Cy Coleman, composer of "Sweet Charity"; Jonathan Tunick, who orchestrated most of Stephen Sondheim's shows; and Paul Gemignani, a musical director of shows like the recent revival of "Kiss Me, Kate."
The petition said the league's demands would "take away our means of expression (live musicians) in exchange for increased profits."
"Our own jobs are not at stake: what we stand to lose is artistic in nature," the petition continued. "And our loss is also the public's loss."
Kevin McCollum, one of the producers of "La Boheme," pointed out that his show opted to employ three musicians more than the minimum -- 29 instead of the 26 required at the Broadway Theater -- suggesting that producers would not always opt for fewer. The number, though, is still lower than what is typical for an opera performance of "La Boheme."
The union held its own news conference outside the league offices yesterday. A five-piece brass band played "The Lullaby of Broadway," and the union played a radio commercial recorded by the Broadway actress Audra McDonald that concluded, "Keep Broadway live."

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Designers' Dreams, Tempered By Reality

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
The decision on who will redesign the World Trade Center site is expected to be announced later this week. Both finalists, Studio Daniel Libeskind and Think, a team led by Rafael Vinoly, Frederic Schwartz, Shigeru Ban and Ken Smith, have extensively revised their plans at the request of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. 
 The Libeskind plan originally specified that most of the so-called bathtub, the sunken area enclosed within the concrete retaining walls of the World Trade Center, be used for a mix of cultural purposes. Much of that area, however, has since been claimed by the Port Authority's decision to build a major transportation hub within the retaining walls. This would leave only a marginal portion of the site to be used as the Libeskind team had planned. It would also substantially diminish that plan's architectural strength. 
 The most significant change required of the Think team was the reduction of the elevated platforms originally intended for cultural uses. As now envisioned, a museum would be between the 30th- and 35th-floor levels of the two 110-story towers of steel lattice. Observation platforms would be at the summits of the towers. The platforms originally designed for other cultural uses have been eliminated, diminishing the plan's vitality as a cultural center. Officials of the development corporation said it would be impossible to ensure construction on higher platforms after the museum was built. 
Yet even the revised designs cannot be considered final. As is the case with many competitions for major building projects, the steering committee will be choosing a team of architects, not a completed design. Further design development is contingent on the framing of an architectural program: the precise mix of uses that the buildings will contain. An outline for a proposed program could be released as early as tomorrow.
The plans of both finalists call for incremental development, with new office buildings, designed by different architects, that would be constructed as market demand dictates. Thus we may not get a complete picture of what ground zero will look like until a decade from now.
For now, development corporation officials remain committed to realizing the core concepts of whichever plan is chosen. The composition of the corporation's board will undoubtedly change with time, however, as will the agency's mission. City officials are likely to assume more substantial representation. The position of Larry Silverstein, leaseholder of the World Trade Center site, will remain unclear pending the outcome of his legal battle with the property's insurers.
For now, though, the program for ground zero should become the major focus of public scrutiny. Whichever team is selected, the program will ultimately become the true source of meaning at ground zero. What cultural value, apart from design, will the architecture serve? What sort of message will this city send to the future about the historical trauma it has been living through?
One of the most heartening developments to come out of the debate over the future of ground zero has been the public's greater awareness of what an architectural program is. When people have spoken of a memorial, of office space, of parks and museums, they have been educating themselves about a pivotal fact that architects and planners reckon with constantly: whoever controls the program controls the architecture. Throughout the debate, the public has been saying that it wants to control the program.
That is the lesson to be drawn from the public's rejection of the original six plans presented by the development corporation at the Javits Center last July. As corporation officials themselves insisted, the plans were not architecture. They were formulas for the program. It was as such that the public rejected them. Give us a vision of something more, the people said.
The development corporation responded beautifully, up to a point. It established an independent jury to recommend a list of architects, a roster that included some of the world's most imaginative practitioners. Six of these teams in turn produced designs that people will be arguing about for years. Over all, the debate has done as much to lift the level of architectural discussion as any of the individual designs.
Still, as many have observed, the process has proceeded backward. Typically, designers work from programmatic requirements toward their architectural expression. That has not been possible in this case. Though the architects were given guidelines, they were also given wide latitude to frame their designs in broad cultural terms.
Of necessity, all of the teams were compelled to imagine some ideal cultural program capable of lifting the project above the mundane. The teams took advantage of this freedom in different ways, however, and it was on the basis of those differences that the public could begin to discriminate among the plans.
Nowhere were the differences more pronounced than in the plans prepared by the two finalists. The Libeskind design is a dramatic piece of expressionist architecture that in its original form went far toward supplanting the need for an additional memorial to the victims of 9/11. The reduction of usable space in the "bathtub" to a fraction of its original size must inevitably compromise the aesthetic strength for which this plan was chosen. That design's explicit equation of aesthetic with moral and indeed spiritual value is now open to serious question. Whatever one makes of the original design's heavily loaded symbolism -- to my mind the meanings became more disturbing with each viewing -- the design's symbolic heart no longer exists.
The Think's team's design has also been compromised. The plan's potential to develop a platformed urbanism was immensely compelling. If that potential is not developed on this site, the design nonetheless represents an important new way to imagine the public realm. Before long, it will be taken into fully realized urban space. 
Even with the elimination of the upper decks, however, the conceptual heart of this design remains intact. This is an architecture of service to something other than architecture. It is essentially a piece of urban infrastructure, a transportation system turned skyward. Aspiration is the plan's symbolic content, in the time-honored tradition of New York skyscraper design.
In more concrete terms, the Think design serves the program. The two lattice towers are symbolic containers in which our hopes for the future can be crystalized by the uses that will be clustered within.
There has been much discussion in recent months about what those uses should be. A new home for the New York City Opera. A Museum of Freedom. An art museum. Most promising of all, an educational center on the impact of globalization.
The public has already taken the lead in shaping the program for ground zero. With little guidance from public officials or the media, the public has been educating itself about the meaning of 9/11 and its place in the broader context of world affairs. In a phenomenon that is itself worthy of serious analysis, people have been reading up on issues ranging from terrorism, the medieval crusades, nationalism, the environment and the global economy to the corporate monoculture, Islamic tribalism and the changing role of urban centers in the emerging global culture.
I base my strong preference for the Think team's proposal on its capacity to give this process of public education both a symbolic and a practical form. No other design elicited by the official planning process has risen to the cultural occasion that the public itself has defined.
Sept. 11 never was primarily about architecture. If the future of ground zero was defined in architectural terms, that was to prevent it from being defined purely by the terms of real estate development, terms in which cultural values do not begin to figure. Attention must now turn to the fullest assertion of those values.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET-- MANHATTAN; 
Nonprofits Increasingly Find Space Affordable

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP

 BODY:
Executives at a number of nonprofit groups say that the weak Manhattan office-leasing market is allowing them to upgrade their office spaces significantly and negotiate rents that would have been almost unthinkable a year ago. 
 "We've seen a definite loosening of the market in the last three months," said Jon Small, president of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York, a service organization with more than 1,100 members. 
 Mr. Small said that his organization had noticed that landlords now seem to be more flexible in negotiating rents, as well as offering improvement allowances and periods of free rent, especially for spaces measuring more than 10,000 square feet and especially in downtown Manhattan. "We think that Manhattan has seen the biggest drop in rents because that's where rents had spiked the most," he said. 
One of the jubilant executives is Maureen Rover, founder of the Reading Team, a Harlem-based nonprofit group that provides programs for children with reading problems. 
When Ms. Rover went looking for new office space for her group in November 2001, she was appalled at what she found. Because of her landlord's growing space needs, Ms. Rover and her group had been asked to leave the high-quality, 3,000-square-foot quarters they had been occupying, rent free, on West 125th Street near Amsterdam Avenue.
She found that landlords in the area were asking $35 to $40 a square foot annually for fairly dilapidated space along the West 125th Street corridor. Ms. Rover gave up her commercial search in April and instead began trying to find space at local churches. 
In July, she began looking for commercial space again, after the church deals fell through. This time, however, she was pleasantly surprised. In just a few days, her broker, Suzanne Sunshine of Time Equities, was able to find high-quality renovated space nearby, at 2090 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, where the rent was $28 a square foot.
According to David N. Lebenstein, director of commercial sales and leasing at Time Equities, negotiated rents for nonprofits seeking space in Manhattan have probably dropped 25 to 35 percent in the last six months. Ms. Sunshine said many landlords now take far less time to clinch deals with nonprofit groups. 
Steven Zwerling, a senior program officer for education at the Ford Foundation, said he had noticed real estate costs for nonprofit groups easing considerably, in Manhattan and elsewhere. "When it comes to deal making, a lot of the groups that we fund are in a stronger position than they can ever remember being in," he said. 
Mr. Zwerling said one organization partly financed by the Ford Foundation was using the current downturn as an opportunity to set up its national headquarters in Manhattan. The group is Project Grad U.S.A., a school reform group now based in Houston that serves about 130,000 students in 10 inner-city school districts around the country. 
Mr. Zwerling said he began helping the group look for space downtown three months ago. "I was very surprised at what I found," he said. "This is a group that could not have afforded to move to Manhattan before, but we found about 20 possible deals, all of them affordable." 
In mid-February, Project Grad signed a lease for 2,300 square feet at 560 Broadway in SoHo. Shortly before the lease was signed, the owner of the 120,000-square-foot building, Jeffrey R. Gural, chairman of Newmark & Company, said that 560 Broadway used to be occupied by art galleries but that only about eight galleries remained. He said he was prepared to offer the vacant space to Project Grad in the high-20's range.
That does not surprise Ms. Sunshine, the Time Equities broker. "All the nonprofit deals that I'm now doing in SoHo are in the low-to-high 20's," she said. "A year ago, they would have been in the high 20's to low 40's." 
And better deals may be on the horizon, said Theodore S. Berger, executive director of the New York Foundation for the Arts, which supports artists and arts organizations.
Mr. Berger said that in June his foundation renewed its lease on 11,250 square feet of space at 155 Avenue of the Americas, near Spring Street for five years at the existing rental. 
Despite this favorable rent, Mr. Berger said that his foundation, like a number of nonprofit groups, eventually hopes to move to a collaborative-use building that would accommodate its office needs as well as offer work space to artists, space for community groups, and incubator space for small arts organizations.
While the foundation has not yet begun to look for space, Mr. Berger said that in the last two weeks two real estate brokers had told him to expect rents to go down in the near future as Manhattan landlords begin trying to fill space that has yet to come to market. "Nonprofits are getting deals," he said, "but we think that there will be even better deals in the next 6 to 12 months."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Miami and Bermuda polish their images to try to beckon Northeast residents.

BYLINE:  By Patricia Winters Lauro

 BODY:
SANDY white beaches and warm tropical breezes would seem to be enough of an attraction to lure tourists during this year's cold and snowy winter. But a stagnating economy, a jittery public and plenty of competition has prompted big tourist destinations like Miami and Bermuda to distinguish their respective brands beyond being just places for sun and fun.
 Miami's campaign, created by Turkel Advertising in Coconut Grove, uses imagery often found in sex-drenched fashion ads, aiming to reinforce the city's hip reputation among the young and fashionable. Bermuda's effort, from the New York office of Arnold Worldwide, takes another tack, playing up its British heritage with a tongue-in-cheek style that positions the country as a playpen for the affluent. 
 The campaigns focus on the Northeast market, where a significant portion of tourists for both destinations are from, and the New York area in particular, which is the biggest source of visitors for both. 
The campaigns are timely as Americans look to stay closer to home, said Peter Bates, president of the New York-based Strategic Vision, a marketing firm for the travel and tourism industry. "People are concerned about what might happen next," he said. "There's a greater opportunity for many destinations to capture the home market, and it's appropriate for places like Bermuda and Miami."
Miami's campaign, which has a budget of $6 million, could easily be confused with promotions for jeans or perfumes. In one ad, a sexy model climbs across the hood of a white convertible; in another, a model stands provocatively on a rocky beach. The name, Miami, is splashed across the advertisement, but the ads carry no copy. 
"The key is not to show pretty pictures of destinations, but connect to consumers emotionally, to connect with their desires in a very targeted way," said David Whitaker, the senior vice president for marketing and tourism at the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau.
The idea for the campaign originated with Bruce Turkel, president of the agency, who said his hometown had a distinctive identity around the world.
"There are very few places in the world like that," said Mr. Turkel, whose agency was formerly known as Turkel Schwartz & Partners. "Paris, London, Rome, New York, perhaps San Francisco. The name conjures up magical images. The idea is what you bring to it."
Miami's tourism agency has retained IMG, known for representing models like Tyra Banks and Heidi Klum, to market Miami as if it were a consumer brand. Plans call for trying to have Miami mentioned in gossip columns, as if it were a celebrity, and for sponsorships with consumer products. Miami is also building its festival and events roster, which already includes a long list of cultural, art and film festivals, Mr. Whitaker said.
"It's a way of bringing more marketing muscle to the table and a way of defining your brand," Mr. Whitaker said. "You have to become much more aggressive and unique in connecting to customers, and that's what it's all about."
Bermuda's efforts use humor to make that connection and turn around a decade of declining tourism. Bermuda had 500,000 visitors last year, down from 600,000 a decade ago, and awareness among East Coast consumers has dropped, said Michael DeCouto, assistant director for tourism marketing at the Bermuda Department of Tourism. He declined to provide an ad budget.
"Our objective was to create a campaign that would change perceptions and educate consumers that Bermuda is fashionable, charming and is just two hours away from the East Coast," Mr. DeCouto said.
The campaign features tropical Bermuda juxtaposed with its manicured lawns and British style, which are the things that make the destination different, said Rochelle Klein, chief creative officer at Arnold, which is part of Havas. At the same time, the campaign makes light of Bermuda's somewhat stuffy heritage of men in white shoes and prim ladies in bright pink. Some examples: "For the anglophile hedonist in all of us"; "High tea in a bikini"; and "The charm and manners of the British, with a propensity to get down."
The ads always note that Bermuda is "just two hours from New York" and show its redesigned logo -- a pair of Bermuda shorts. 
"Maybe what we need is more civilization," Ms. Klein said. "Maybe the world should be filled with people with manners where everything is beautiful."
Bermuda's campaign is aimed at travelers 35 to 65, with annual income of at least $125,000 (and usually much more).
"We're not looking for numbers," Mr. DeCouto said, "we're looking for quality."

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Drops to a 9-Year Low 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Consumer confidence plunged in February to its lowest level in more than nine years, the Conference Board, a private research group, reported yesterday, as concerns about a possible war with Iraq, rising energy prices and jobs took a toll on attitudes.
 The consumer confidence index, a monthly measure, fell to 64 in February, from 78.8 in January. 
 The drop is the second-biggest ever. After the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the index fell 17 points. February's reading was the third consecutive month in which consumers expressed waning optimism about their immediate and medium-term prospects. 
Economists had expected the index to decline, but the magnitude of the decrease shown in the survey was much greater than forecasts. The consensus estimate was a drop to 77. 
The Conference Board surveys 5,000 households about general economic conditions, their employment prospects and their spending plans. 
Analysts said uncertainty, coupled with the income-crimping reality of dealing with high energy prices, has put the economy in jeopardy. 
"The uncertainty factor is obviously bad news for confidence," said Richard Berner, the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. "And the energy shock we are experiencing is also bad news for the economy and spendable income."
Mr. Berner said he had recently revised downward his growth forecast for the first half of the year to a level he called "stall speed."
"The economy is very vulnerable," he said. 
"The odds of the economy rolling over are less than 50-50, and probably one in four," Mr. Berner said. "But none of us anticipated the perfect storm we have had in energy prices, with the price of crude oil, natural gas and heating oil all shooting up like this." 
The Conference Board's readings on what consumers expect in the near-term future were also not reassuring: the percentage of those surveyed who expect their incomes to increase six months from now fell to their lowest level since the board began collecting data in 1967. 
And the component of the confidence index that tracks the present situation of consumers fell to 61.6 in February, its lowest level since November 1993.

PERSON: Tom Glazer 

HEADLINE: Tom Glazer, Folk Singer, Is Dead at 88 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Tom Glazer, a folk singer and songwriter best known for his whimsical children's songs -- particularly one about a mountain of spaghetti -- died on Friday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 88.
 Along with Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie, Josh White and Burl Ives, Mr. Glazer was a Big City folk singer, one of a loose coalition of performers who made folk music a national phenomenon in the 1940's, presaging its commercial popularity in the 1960's. 
 Pete Seeger, a member of the group, remembered Mr. Glazer yesterday as a solid performer who worked well with entertainers of different styles and political beliefs 
"He wasn't fancy," Mr. Seeger said in an interview. "He was just straightforward. He had a good sense of humor."
Oscar Brand, who also sang with Mr. Glazer and who is curator of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, said Mr. Glazer was such a fine guitarist that he played chords other folk musicians hardly knew existed. Mr. Brand said Mr. Glazer, who was formally educated in music, had "a soft, easy voice that did not sound trained."
As well as performing and recording, Mr. Glazer wrote books, most about music; composed songs recorded by Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and the Kingston Trio; and was the host of music programs on New York radio stations.
But his best-remembered achievement -- though not Mr. Glazer's favorite -- was writing "On Top of Spaghetti," a hit novelty song in 1963. Sung to the tune of "On Top of Old Smoky," it featured a chorus of children singing lines like "On top of spaghetti all covered with cheese." A wayward meatball is the star.
Thomas Zachariah Glazer was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 2, 1914, his son Peter said. His father, Jacob, left Russia for the United States to avoid the draft, but returned to find a wife, Sophie. They settled in Philadelphia, where Jacob worked as a carpenter in a shipyard.
Jacob died in the influenza pandemic of 1918. Thomas and his two brothers lived with their mother and other relatives, as well as in an orphanage. Thomas hitchhiked to New York when he was 17 and got a job at Macy's. He finished high school at nights and then attended City College for three years.
He went to Washington, where he worked at the Library of Congress and befriended Alan Lomax, who established the library's Archive of American Folk Song. 
Mr. Glazer bought a cheap guitar, learned some strums from Lomax and began to perform. Eleanor Roosevelt invited him to play at a White House concert for soldiers working there as guards. 
Mr. Glazer's formal debut came on Jan. 8, 1943, at Town Hall in Manhattan. In 1945 he started a show on ABC Radio, "Tom Glazer's Ballad Box," and in the 1960's he was host of a weekly concert show for children on WQXR radio in New York.
In 1957 he composed songs and background music for "A Face in the Crowd," a film directed by Elia Kazan. His song "Talking Inflation Blues" was recorded by Bob Dylan on his "Minnesota Party Tape" in 1960.
Mr. Glazer is survived by his sons Peter, of Berkeley, Calif., and John, of Rochester; his sister, Victoria G. Tovim of Philadelphia; and two granddaughters. His marriage to the former Miriam Reed Eisenberg ended in divorce in 1974. 
His brother, who spelled his name Sidney Glazier, died in December. He produced the 1968 movie version of "The Producers."
Tom Glazer occasionally speculated about meeting St. Peter at the Pearly Gates and being asked what he accomplished in music. Mr. Glazer mumbles that he wrote "On Top of Spaghetti."
"Sorry, buster, you can't enter," the imagined St. Peter replies.

HEADLINE: Home Depot's 4th-Quarter Profit Decreased 3% 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Home Depot Inc., the home improvement retailer, reported a 3 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit today as competition from Lowe's hurt sales. 
 Home Depot said it still expected higher results for the year but warned that its outlook was cautious because of "the current geopolitical environment and the domestic economy." 
 Sales declined 2 percent, to $13.2 billion, in the fourth quarter. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 6 percent. The retailer warned last month that sales at stores open at least a year could fall as much as 10 percent. 
Home Depot said it earned $686 million in the fourth quarter, ended Feb. 2, down from $710 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings were unchanged at 30 cents, above analysts' forecast of 27 cents as compiled by Thomson First Call. 
"They have lost their sales momentum," said Phil Larkins, a market strategist at Legacy South. 
Home Depot, based in Atlanta, is trying to reverse weakening sales and fend off Lowe's, which is ringing up strong sales as it moves into large markets like Los Angeles and the New York area. 
Mr. Larkins said newer Lowe's stores provided sharp contrasts to Home Depot's aging, warehouselike outlets. On Monday, Lowe's posted a 46 percent rise in quarterly profit on a 17 percent rise in sales, including a 4 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. 
The chief executive of Home Depot, Robert L. Nardelli, said the company failed to achieve its initial sales growth estimate of 15 percent to 18 percent for 2002. Customer service "was not at the level of expectation," he said. "For 2003, our focus is very simple: it's on sales, service and execution." 
Home Depot said fourth-quarter sales were hurt by cannibalization as newer Home Depot stores took sales from older ones, by weak sales in the holiday shopping season and by disruption to customer traffic from merchandise changes.
The company forecast flat to slightly positive sales this year, per-share earnings growth of 9 percent to 14 percent, and sales growth of 9 percent to 12 percent. 
It also said it would start providing sales and earnings forecasts on an annual basis, rather than quarterly. 
Analysts expect Home Depot to earn 36 cents a share for the first quarter, unchanged from a year earlier, according to First Call.

HEADLINE: U.S. Approves Type of Corn That May Cut Pesticide Use 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
The government announced yesterday that it had approved a type of genetically modified corn that it says could lead to a significant reduction in the use of toxic insecticides.
 The approval was granted by the Environmental Protection Agency to a corn developed by Monsanto that is resistant to the corn rootworm. This soil-dwelling pest accounted for one out of seven applications of insecticide to all agricultural crops, according to the E.P.A. The resistant corn would require little or no chemicals. 
 "Corn rootworm is the pest that requires the single largest use of conventional pesticides in the United States," said Stephen L. Johnson, the E.P.A.'s assistant administrator for prevention, pesticides and toxic substances. "From an environmental and human health perspective, this product replaces some very significant problematic, or potentially problematic, chemicals." 
The approval is a boost for Monsanto, which has been struggling with falling earnings, and for biotechnology crops, because it is the first truly new product in some years. Until now the industry has subsisted on variations of two main products: soybeans and other crops resistant to Monsanto's Roundup herbicide, and BT corn and cotton, which are resistant to the corn borer and the cotton bollworm, respectively. 
The new product is also a form of BT corn, meaning it contains a gene from a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis that causes the plant to produce a toxin that kills the rootworm. But the type of BT toxin is different from the ones used to kill the corn borer and the bollworm. 
Advocates of crop biotechnology have long said that one of its benefits would be to cut the use of more toxic insecticides that are sprayed on fields, often killing not only the target pests but other insects and wildlife and endangering the health of farmers. With the existing BT corn, some experts say, there has been little if any reduction in pesticide use because farmers do not always spray for the corn borer.
Monsanto said it expected the genetically engineered corn, which is called YieldGard Rootworm, would eventually be used on 12 million to 15 million of the nation's 80 million acres of corn, generating $150 million to $200 million in revenue. But this year there will be less than a million acres grown because many farmers had already bought their seed before the approval came and because Monsanto needs to manufacture more seed. 
Monsanto is banking on genetically modified crops to reduce its dependence on its mainstay Roundup herbicide, which is now facing generic competition. The company's profits have been weak because of the competition for Roundup, economic problems in Latin America and resistance to genetically modified crops in some areas of the world, particularly Europe. The company's stock fell 7 cents, to $16.75.
Fred Yoder, president of the National Corn Growers Association, predicted farmers would eagerly adopt the new corn. "We've been waiting a long time for this," he said. "Rootworm is the No. 1 pest and the No. 1 yield robber we have in growing corn." 
But Charles Benbrook, a consultant and former agricultural specialist for the National Research Council who has been critical of genetically modified crops, said that data provided by Monsanto showed the corn would not kill all the rootworms. "If it doesn't perform any better than soil insecticides I think a lot of farmers will stick with the insecticides," he said. 
The E.P.A. regulates the plant because it is considered to contain a built-in pesticide. 
To prevent rootworms from becoming resistant to the BT corn, the E.P.A. is requiring that farmers plant 20 percent of their corn fields with different corn, as a refuge. That is the figure proposed by Monsanto. 
But the majority of members of a scientific advisory panel convened by the E.P.A. last August recommended that the refuge be 50 percent of each farm's corn acreage. This larger refuge requirement might have discouraged some farmers from growing the new corn. 
Mr. Johnson of the E.P.A. said that after the advisory panel meeting, Monsanto submitted more information that led the agency to conclude that 20 percent would be enough. That requirement is the same as for existing BT corn varieties, and that would make it easier for farmers to comply.
The approval of the new corn is only for about one year, though it is expected to be extended to three years, he said. In that time, he said, scientists could gather more data on what size of a refuge is needed. 
Dow Chemical and the Pioneer Hi-Bred unit of DuPont are working together on their own version of BT rootworm resistant corn, which they hope to market in 2005.

Shares Close Higher as Investors Shrug Off Report of Big Drop in Consumer Confidence

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street shrugged off a discouraging consumer confidence report yesterday and sent shares modestly higher.
 But trading was choppy as fears about war and the economy still dominated trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 138 points to a new four-month low before staging a late-day rally. 
 Analysts played down the comeback. 
"I'd be hard pressed to say we're in a brave new world," said Bryan Piskorowski, a market commentator at Prudential Securities. 
The Dow rose 51.26 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 7,909.50, having declined 159 points on Monday. Earlier in the day, blue-chip stocks dropped to 7,719.64, the lowest level since Oct. 10, when they finished at 7,533.95. 
The broader market also finished higher. The Nasdaq index gained 6.60 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,328.98. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 5.99 points, or 0.7 percent, to 838.57. 
The Conference Board, a private research group, said its consumer confidence index dropped to 64.0 in February from a revised 78.8 in January. The reading fell far below analysts' estimate of 77.0, and is the lowest since the index hit 60.5 in October 1993. 
An encouraging housing report, meanwhile, helped lift the market. 
The National Association of Realtors reported existing-home sales reached a record monthly high in January, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.09 million. That represented a strong 3 percentgain from December's level and defied analysts' expectations of a decrease. 
Analysts say they expect trading to be uneven in the coming weeks as investors worry about threats of war and terrorism. While stocks have fallen recently to four-month lows, Wall Street has also experienced gains on bargain hunting. 
Yesterday, the deputy prime minister of Iraq, Tariq Aziz, said no decision had been made on a United Nations order to destroy banned weapons; on Monday, Saddam Hussein indicated that he would refuse to obey the order. 
The United States, Britain and Spain are pushing for a Security Council vote against Iraq shortly after a March 7 report from the chief inspectors Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei; France, Germany and Russia have circulated a counterproposal for disarmament. 
H&R Block climbed $1.31, to $38.51, after it reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations. 
Home Depot, the home improvement retailer, rose 66 cents, to $22.84, after reporting fourth-quarter profits that beat Wall Street's estimates by 3 cents a share. 
Losers included DuPont, which declined 57 cents, to $36.30, and Honeywell International, which lost 39 cents, to $23. 
American Eagle Outfitters, the clothing retailer, dropped 40 cents, to $14.86, after it reported fourth-quarter profits that beat estimates by a penny. It cautioned, however, that February sales at stores open at least a year might be lower than expected because of the severe winter weather.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was light at 1.83 billion shares, compared with 1.53 billion traded on Monday.
In the bond market, the 10-year note increased 7/32, to a price of 100 14/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.82 percent from 3.85 percent. 
The 30-year bond increased 15/32, to 109 3/32. Its yield fell to 4.78 percent from 4.81 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

HEADLINE: Gates Foundation Providing $31 Million for Small Schools 

BYLINE:  By GREG WINTER

 BODY:
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is providing $31 million to nonprofit groups to start small, alternative high schools for 36,000 students, calling the gift a mere taste of what it would take to reach the millions of children who are "failed and forgotten" by the nation's public schools. 
 Thousands of alternative schools already serve as academies of last resort for children who are on the verge of dropping out. But for all their importance as refuges, the foundation said, they are rarely sites of academic rigor, creating a need for alternative schools intent on preparing dropouts not only for jobs, but for college as well. 
 "When millions of children are not graduating, we have a civic, economic and social disaster on our hands," said Tom Vander Ark, the foundation's education director, adding that the gift is part of a campaign to create no fewer than 1,000 new schools in the next 18 months. "We think this is the most important problem in America, but what's so frustrating is that it's invisible. Very little attention is paid to the horrendous human toll that's going on."
After climbing in most of the 20th century and peaking in the late 1960's, the national graduation rate steadily declined, settling around 70 percent in the last few years, the Department of Education says. 
For black and Latino students, the numbers are worse. Only about 55 percent of African-American students and 53 percent of Latinos graduate, a study last November by the Manhattan Institute shows, though there are many competing theories to explain such disparities.
The Gates foundation blames the prevalence of huge, impersonal, underfinanced high schools -- particularly common in poor, minority neighborhoods -- for the paltry graduation rates. Crowded to the point of anonymity, educators argue, these schools are ill-equipped to reach struggling students before they give up.
"If you ask the students why they dropped out, the most common answer you'll hear is, 'nobody at school cared about me, nobody worried whether I stayed or left,' " said Dorothy Stoneman, president of YouthBuild USA, one of the nine educational nonprofits chosen by the Gates foundation to create 168 alternative schools. 
While the foundation, started by the founder of the Microsoft Corporation and his wife, admits that small schools can fail children, too, it contends that only in an intensely personalized and tightly knit environment can troubled students be brought back on track. 
But even assuming this premise is true, can enough small schools of no more than a couple of hundred students ever be built to significantly affect national graduation rates? 
The Gates foundation estimates that with 10,000 new schools, about 10 times what it plans on creating itself, the nation will only be able to keep pace with the growth in the school-aged population over the next decade. And while some educators say that small, alternative programs cost more than large ones, others argue that they can be just as cost-effective as traditional schools.
"We know our job is not to be a boutique school," said DennisLittky, co-director of the Big Picture Company, one of the grantees. It has about 18 schools across the country, and always spends the same amount per student as the cities in which it operates, whether in Providence, R.I., or Oakland, Calif. 
"If we're going to make a change in this world," Mr. Littky added, "we have to do it at the same cost as everyone else."

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
At Indian Pt., Watchdogs Sit on Fence

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TALK about uncontrolled chain reactions. Nuclear fission has nothing on the serial finger-pointing under way in the debate over the Indian Point power plant.
 Whether or not you view Indian Point as the region's most terrifying terror target, you can rest assured that some of the best minds in government are engaged in avoiding the appearance of making a decision. 
 At a Congressional hearing held on Indian Point yesterday, Steven C. LaTourette, chairman of a House economic development subcommittee, diagnosed the problem between officials in New York and Washington as "bureaucratic, jurisdictional mumbo-jumbo." The gentleman from Ohio was being kind. 
The question is whether evacuation plans would protect the public if an accident or attack released radiation from the plant 35 miles north of New York City. The situation has gotten hopelessly tangled.
The plant needs an evacuation plan to operate, but it is the responsibility of local governments to devise those plans. Local officials now insist that their own plans will not protect the public. But the plant owners beg to differ, and federal officials seem headed in that direction.
If that seems complicated, the subtext isn't. Many local officials -- and residents -- want the plant shut since terrorism only made the decision to build it amid suburban sprawl more dubious. Federal officials say they would close the plant if they thought it was a threat, but a midsummer blizzard seems more likely. Gov. George E. Pataki is straddling the divide, cards pressed to vest.
Federal officials decide whether nuclear power plants can operate, but a pronouncement one way or the other from the governor would likely have an effect. Not that it's easy. If you ever tried leaving an A.& P. parking lot with flurries in the forecast, you know that evacuating Westchester County is a fantasy. On the other hand, Indian Point provides 20 percent of the power to New York and its northern suburbs. 
The post-9/11 Indian Point tumult was almost dismissed as undue anxiety when Governor Pataki, partly to assuage voters in the northern suburbs last fall, hired James Lee Witt, the former chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to review the evacuation plans. The governor said he would let the chips fall where they may. The chips hit the fan in January. Mr. Witt said the plans were not adequate, especially if terrorists struck.
Executives of the four affected counties declined to certify their own plans.
The governor, without opining on the evacuation plans, informed federal emergency officials that he therefore could not certify them. Last week, federal emergency officials said they could not certify the plans without, among other things, certification from the state. 
Imagine five officials in a tailoring mirror all pointing fingers. FEMA officials said that generally, the evacuation "plans and procedures have been found to be adequate." But they will not sign off on them without getting certain documents from local officials -- like copies of emergency plans for schools and day care centers.
Westchester County officials say they will not hand over any information that will allow the federal government to approve the evacuation plans. 
"We're not making life easy for them," said Susan Tolchin, an aide to Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive.
YESTERDAY, Mr. Spano, who was once in the "everything's fine" camp, declared the plant a matter of "national security" and said it was the federal government's job to protect people from the plant. Fat chance.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has never closed a plant for emergency management problems and the commission has already said radiation releases from an accident or a terrorism attack can be handled with the same evacuation plan.
Besides, even if everyone else says evacuation is impossible, the commission can order changes to the emergency plan and keep the plant open. But before the commission acts, it is waiting for FEMA to rule on the plan and FEMA is waiting for information from the state, which, in turn, has yet to get information from the counties.
Everyone views himself as caught in the middle. The governor says he is caught between the counties and the federal emergency officials. FEMA says it is caught between the governor and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And the plant's operators? "We're caught in the middle," said James Steets, a spokesman for Entergy. Sooner or later, someone is likely to be caught making a decision. But probably later, rather than sooner.

HEADLINE: A Day of Urgent Talk Yields No Fix for Deficit in Albany 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki sought today to shift some of the burden of New York's budget crisis onto the new state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, urging him to act quickly to delay sharply rising pension costs.
 The governor unveiled his menu of pension proposals during a day of intricate political maneuvers between himself and his counterparts in the State Legislature -- the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a fellow Republican. 
 At lunchtime, the three men got together in a room to discuss the budget. Such sit-downs have usually come later in the budget season, but this year the state faces its worst fiscal plight since the Great Depression. Despite the urgency of the situation, the lawmakers emerged with no agreement on how to close a cumulative $11.5 billion budget gap for this fiscal year and next. 
Mr. Pataki later called on Mr. Hevesi to make changes in the pension system that could delay payments by the state and localities, give the pension fund time to recover from the anemic economy and free up money for other needs. 
A short while later, Mr. Silver aimed the spotlight back at the governor by vowing to reject the heart of Mr. Pataki's plan to fill the gap: securing part of the $12 billion that the state is owed after a court settlement with tobacco companies.
"No tobacco borrowing at all," Mr. Silver said gravely. "Not now. Not later. Not necessary." 
Instead, he proposed issuing 10-year bonds, backed by the state's income tax, to raise the roughly $4 billion that Mr. Pataki said the state treasury would receive by borrowing against tobacco revenues.
Mr. Silver said drawing down the tobacco revenues all at once would cost the state $1.1 billion more than his own plan, money that could be used for education and health care. The Republicans in the State Senate, who support the governor's tobacco borrowing plan, put off a vote on the issue today.
"The speaker said he would propose an alternative, so partly out of deference to him and to take a look at it, we decided to wait and not act today," said John McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno. 
But, he added, "The bill is live, and it is something we may do next week, when we return."
The day was filled with rhetoric and moves by the various budget forces, with each trying to shape the events that are likely to play out deep into summer.
In a news conference, the governor was adamant that the state's fiscal health hinged on securing the tobacco revenues. He rejected another of Mr. Silver's ideas, to use $710 million in Tax Stabilization Reserve funds, a so-called rainy-day fund, to help solve this year's $2.2 billion gap.
Aides to the governor said Mr. Silver's borrowing proposal would violate the state's debt reform act of 2000, which barred the issuance of state debt to pay operating costs. That law would need to be changed for the proposal to become a reality, several state officials said.
"It has been clear from the beginning that the Assembly has wanted to undo our historic debt reform legislation, and their proposal would immediately jeopardize our credit rating and result in higher debt costs for New Yorkers," said Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget.
Regarding rising pension costs, Mr. Pataki implored Mr. Hevesi, the sole trustee of the state's pension fund, to implement some or all of the governor's half-dozen ideas to cap the costs or spread them out over time.
This year, the state is on track to pay $138 million in pension costs and has budgeted for $388 million in the next fiscal year, which begins on April 1. But because of prolonged sluggishness on Wall Street, the fund, known as the New York State and Local Retirement Systems, has lost about $30 billion in three years.
Earlier this month, Mr. Hevesi alerted the state about the rising pension costs. Officials said the state would now have to pay $659 million more in unbudgeted pension costs next year; localities would pay about $1.1 billion more than budgeted.
Mr. Pataki's principal pension proposal would cap the costs at $388 million for next year, one of the estimates provided by the former state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, last August. Another proposal would phase in the increased costs over five years,allowing the pension fund more time to recover and giving the state and localities more time to pay off the increased pension costs. If the economy rebounds, those costs could evaporate, the governor said.
State and local municipal employees are covered by the plan. Mr. Pataki said that the benefits received by about 945,000 participants (including 300,000 retired workers) would not be affected by his payment-plan alternatives.
A spokesman for Mr. Hevesi, David Neustadt, said, "It would be inappropriate to comment on the many ideas being proposed by different parties until we have completed our discussions and review, especially with the representatives of the retirees and members of the State Common Retirement Fund."

HEADLINE: Planners Say Tolls Will Ease Jams in 8 Cities 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Traffic planners released a plan today that they say will guarantee commuters in eight large cities speedy drives or bus rides to work. Their vision of congestion-free lanes is familiar, but this time, the experts have an ambitious national plan and at least some influential allies.
 The planners propose to keep traffic flowing by charging tolls, an idea that has traditionally been as unpopular with drivers and politicians as it is beloved by economists and engineers. This proposal, which would use part of the toll revenue to pay for bus service on the lanes, is supported by some moderate Democrats, as well as by free-market Republicans, by some environmentalists and, perhaps most significantly, by some officials of the AAA, a powerful enemy of tolls in the past. 
 The proposal would convert car pool lanes and build new lanes so that most freeways in each city had at least one H.O.T. lane, as engineers call it, a high-occupancy toll lane open free to buses and commuter vans and, at a price, to individual drivers. 
In H.O.T. lanes, which operate successfully in Southern California, tolls are collected electronically at freeway speeds, and they increase at peak times so that the lanes do not become congested.
The co-authors of the proposal, Robert W. Poole Jr. and C. Kenneth Orski, estimate that the new lanes and interchanges would cost $44 billion, with tolls covering two-thirds of the costs and the remainder coming from local governments and federal highway and mass-transit programs. 
The regions would be Atlanta, Dallas-Forth Worth, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington.
"We see this as a realistic legislative proposal for Congress," said Mr. Orski, a former associate administrator of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration. He noted that a change in federal policy allowed mass-transit money once reserved for rail projects to be given to bus projects. But any suggestion to impose tolls on voters makes politicians uneasy.
"It's too early to weigh the prospects for this proposal," said Steve Hansen, a spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. "Toll lanes tend to draw a lot of red flags. But with today's congestion problems and the lack of adequate funds for highway and transit projects, perhaps this could be a potential part of the solution."
The idea is gaining bipartisan support among policy experts. The proposal, published by the Reason Public Policy Institute, a libertarian group, has also been endorsed by the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic group, as well as by Environmental Defense. 
Michael Repogle, transportation director for the environmental group, said H.O.T. lanes would cut urban air pollution by reducing emissions from cars stuck in traffic jams and by encouraging drivers to switch to high-speed buses.
In the past, politicians have called high-speed toll lanes "Lexus lanes" that unfairly benefit the affluent, and AAA officials have fiercely opposed the lanes.
Former critics, including Lon Anderson, a spokesman for AAA Mid-Atlantic, are offering favorable reviews. Mr. Anderson said tolls might be the only way to pay for the one or two new lanes needed on thecongested Beltway around Washington.
"I've criticized Lexus lanes in the past," he said. "But we have to consider tolls because the federal and state coffers can't pay for the new highway lanes and subway lines we'd like. We're not going to relax our opposition to tolling existing highways. But using tolls to pay for new lanes seems reasonable, especially since the tolls would also pay for new buses in these lanes."
Shane Ham, an expert with the Progressive Policy Institute, also pointed to the buses as a selling point. 
"This proposal has great political potential," Mr. Ham said, "because you're not just building new lanes for drivers. You'd also get a high-speed transit system that covers an entire metropolitan region, and that could be built quickly and affordably."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 6, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 26 about a plan to set up high-speed toll lanes for cars and buses in eight cities misstated the position of the advocacy group Environmental Defense. While it praised the use of toll revenues to subsidize the high-speed bus service, it did not endorse the overall plan. The article also misspelled the surname of the group's transportation director. He is Michael Replogle, not Repogle.

Hewlett Profit Beats Estimate, but Sales Fall Short

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Hewlett-Packard reported quarterly results yesterday that suggested that the company's merger with Compaq Computer last year was producing the cost savings promised by management. 
 But while profits slightly exceeded the estimates of financial analysts, revenue fell well below expectations, adding a bit of uncertainty to the outlook for the company, analysts said. 
 Executives of Hewlett-Packard said that despite the clouded economic outlook and continued weakness in technology spending, they expected that results in the current quarter would match the consensus estimate on Wall Street of 27 cents a share. Still, the company's shares dropped slightly in after-hours trading. 
Hewlett-Packard executives pointed to the quarterly report -- the third since the Compaq purchase was completed last May -- as evidence that the merger was progressing as planned. The company reported that cost savings from payroll cuts and improved efficiency after the merger totaled $734 million during its fiscal 2003 first quarter, ended Jan. 31. The savings are accelerating, up from $482 million in the previous quarter and 14 percent ahead of the corporate plan.
"H.P. is making good headway and continues to execute well," said Carleton S. Fiorina, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.
In a conference call with analysts, Ms. Fiorina also cited a series of statistics showing that Hewlett-Packard is holding its own or gaining market share in its major businesses, including printing, personal computers, corporate server computers and technology services. These figures, she said, were a "particularly important" gauge of Hewlett-Packard's improving competitiveness.
The company's large personal computer business made an encouraging transition from a loss to a profit in the quarter. The PC business earned an operating profit of $33 million, in contrast to a loss of $68 million in the three months ended last October.
Nearly all the statistical comparisons Hewlett-Packard provided were with the preceding quarter; it explained that year-earlier figures, before the merger with Compaq Computer, would not be useful.
"The cost savings are ahead of plan, and the company did make money on personal computers," said Steven Milunovich, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company. "But it's a mixed picture because the revenues were light."
Revenue in the first quarter was $17.88 billion, well beneath the consensus estimate of analysts of $18.48 billion, according to Thomson First Call. 
Most of the shortfall came in the United States market and in Hewlett-Packard's computer businesses, where it faces severe competitive pressure from Dell Computer and others. 
The slight profit Hewlett-Packard eked out on its PC business came on revenue of $5.14 billion.
The unit selling large server computers to corporate customers, called the enterprise systems group, lost $83 million on revenue of $3.74 billion.
The engine of Hewlett-Packard's profits continues to be its lucrative printer business -- particularly the steady revenue that comes from selling replacement ink cartridges. The imaging and printing group earned $907 million, or 75 percent of the company's operating profit, on revenue of $5.61 billion. 
"If you exclude that printer business, the fundamentals look pretty weak," said Charles R. Wolf, an analyst at Needham & Company.
Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of $877 million on a pro forma basis, which excludes some charges the company considers to be nonrecurring items. The earnings were 29 cents a share, which was slightly above the Wall Street consensus estimate of 28 cents a share.
Applying generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the company earned $721 million, or 24 cents a share.
The soft revenue, company executives said, was attributable to the general weakness in technology spending. When the market turns, they suggested, a leaner, more efficient Hewlett-Packard, which produced solid profits in a weak market, should thrive.
"We are executing effectively on those things that we can control," said Robert Wayman, Hewlett-Packard's chief financial officer. "Although the market is tough, our position is strong."
Still, some analysts are skeptical. Along with the larger-than-expected shortfall in revenue, they pointed to a change in the company's accounting practices, which shifts some costs from the business groups to an "eliminations/other" category.
The accounting change, they note, had no effect on reported earnings. But it could make it more difficult to determine the profit performance of the individual business units.
"It raises a question about the visibility and quality of earnings," said Joel Wagonfeld, an analyst at Banc of America Securities. "It's hard to know how sustainable any apparent improvements will be."
Shares of Hewlett-Packard ended regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $18.18, up 43 cents. The earnings were announced after the market closed; shares declined about 69 cents in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: FEMA Given Deadline on Indian Pt. Report 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
A House panel today gave the Federal Emergency Management Agency 30 days to disclose how it intends to respond to a state report concluding that emergency plans are inadequate to protect the public in the event of a disastrous radiation leak at the Indian Point nuclear power plant in Westchester County.
 The deadline comes at a time when state and federal officials are sniping at one another about who is required to come forward and make a firm recommendation on whether emergency plans required to keep the plant operating are sufficient to protect the public. 
 In January, an independent report commissioned by Gov. George E. Pataki concluded that current evacuation plans cannot protect residents in the densely populated, four-county area around Indian Point. The report was compiled by James Lee Witt, a former director of FEMA. 
But state officials provided no further guidance to FEMA on whether the evacuation plans could work. 
Late last week, FEMA announced that it intended to withhold its endorsement of emergency plans at the nuclear plant, saying it needed more documentation from local officials to determine whether the emergency plans would work. The agency also disputed some claims in the report commissioned by the state, drawing criticism from opponents of the plant. 
Today, members of the House subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management told Joseph J. Picciano, the acting regional director of FEMA, that the agency had 30 days to provide a detailed response to the findings in the report commissioned by Mr. Pataki. 
Representative Sue Kelly, a Westchester Republican who as a member of the panel called for the hearing, warned that if FEMA did not comply, she would introduce legislation requiring it to do so. 
"This isn't a game," she said. "This is about the safety of 20 million residents in the New York City metropolitan area, and FEMA needs to step up to the plate and begin taking immediate steps to help local officials deal with the issues raised in the Witt report." 
But Mr. Picciano, the only FEMA official to testify at the hearing, said that the agency had taken the report's findings into account. He also said the agency had made no decision on whether the emergency evacuation plans were adequate. 
In a 500-page preliminary report issued on Friday, FEMA said that its uncertainty over emergency plans for communities surrounding the plant, which is on the Hudson River in Buchanan, N.Y., about 35 miles north of Manhattan, stemmed from the state's failure to provide detailed information about what specific steps those communities would take if a catastrophe occurred. 
Last month, leaders of the four counties around the plant said they could not endorse evacuation plans drawn up for their communities. Without endorsements from the county level, state officials said that they could not offer what are considered routine certifications of such plans. 
Lacking the state's own certification, FEMA said it could not endorse the emergency plans in its report to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which requires FEMA approval as a condition for granting operating licenses for nuclear plants. FEMA officials have asked the state to submit certification plans for the communities around the plant by May 2, just before the agency sends its final report to the N.R.C. 
Representative Kelly chastised FEMA for failing to act on the findings of the Witt report. "I say with no uncertainty that I am appalled by the conduct of FEMA as it relates to Indian Point," she said. "The agency's inaction and bureaucratic finger pointing has been a disservice to our community." 
The current disaster plan focuses on the 300,000 people who live within 10 miles of the plant and would be most affected by a disaster. Although the report by Mr. Witt said the state should take into account people evacuating on their own outside that 10-mile radius, it did not suggest that wholesale evacuation plans be developed for more distant places like New York City.

PERSON: Jeff Koyen; Alex Zaitchik 

HEADLINE: A Prague Perspective for a New York Newsroom 

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN

DATELINE: PRAGUE 

 BODY:
IT'S a late Saturday morning in the Tulip cafe, one of Prague's American-owned, American-favored brunch spots, and Jeff Koyen and Alex Zaitchik are eating vegetarian omelettes, sipping cappuccinos and smiling.
 In 24 hours, Mr. Koyen, 34, will fly to New York to become the new editor of The New York Press, the combative downtown weekly newspaper, and Mr. Zaitchik, 28, will join him two weeks later as his deputy. 
 Just as Paris in the 1920's was the place to write the great American novel or paint a great Parisian nude, Prague, after the 1989 Velvet Revolution that overthrew Communism, became a magnet for Generation X'ers.
"I was the cliche," said Mr. Koyen. "I came to Prague to travel and finish a novel."
His plans changed after Russ Smith, founder and owner of The New York Press, the main competitor to The Village Voice, abruptly sold the paper three days before last Christmas.
The new owners, including Douglas Meadow, chief operating officer, promptly fired the longtime editor, John Strausbaugh, and reached out for new talent. Mr. Koyen, who had been production editor of The Press before he was laid off in a round of cost-cutting in 2001, stuck his hand up.
"He called me, and I said, 'I can't hire someone over the phone,' " said Mr. Meadow. "He said, 'I could be there in 24 hours,' and he was so full of energy and ideas, and I said, 'This guy was perfect.' "
Mr. Koyen was raised in suburban New Jersey and graduated from Rutgers University. He spent most of the past decade living in the boroughs outside Manhattan, and, on the salary he expects to receive at The Press, that is where he is likely to stay. In fact, Mr. Koyen wants to expand The Press beyond its downtown Manhattan niche and into the other boroughs, where more of his readers actually live.
When his Prague idyll began last spring, Mr. Koyen had no clear plans. Unemployed and broke, he left New York for something cheaper.
He was tapping away at his book, which, he says firmly is "not an expat novel," when he saw The Prague Pill: a new English-language alternative newspaper. The Pill -- earnest, intelligent, slightly long-winded -- was founded and edited by Mr. Zaitchik. 
"It was kind of where I came from," Mr. Koyen said. "It was my speed."
Mr. Zaitchik, a Boston native, went to Trinity College in Hartford, where he started his first "zine," The Other Voice. The Pill, his twice-monthly Prague paper, distributes about 20,000 copies every two weeks and is a regular read for expats, with its events listings, political rants (by Mr. Zaitchik) and opinionated film reviews (by Mr. Koyen). It has taken on the sedate Prague Post, the city's oldest surviving English-language weekly, which has a circulation around 14,000 copies.
"A million writers want to show there is good writing coming out of Prague," said Mr. Zaitchik, "and a million writers come to Prague, drink beer and do nothing."
With The Pill, he said, he wanted to offer these people a forum: "Pitch up good material and we'll put it out there for you."
With his production background, Mr. Koyen got The Pill out on time, while Mr. Zaitchik filled it with eclectic pieces that ranged from leftist to Libertarian.
In November, when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held a summit meeting in Prague, hypernervous Czech officials closed schools here for a week and sent one-third of the nation's police into the streets.
The cover of The Pill featured a photograph of a refrigerator with a yellow sticker that said: "Welcome NATO -- the food's in the refrigerator, we're out of town. Don't forget to feed the cat."
THE Pill has also tackled serious subjects. It investigated the government seizure of land for a Mexican-owned car parts factory and debunked reports that Semtex, the Czech-manufactured plastic explosive, was being made easier for law enforcement officials to detect.
Expatriates have noticed.
"They might not always be right, they might not always be intelligent," said Jonathan Ledgard, Central Europe correspondent for The Economist, "but it's fun to read and it gives you a fresh angle on a lot of what happens here."
Alan Levy, founding editor of The Prague Post, said of his rival: "There are stories where I've said, 'We're behind The Pill on that.' Some of the thinking and digging just doesn't look like an alternative newspaper."
But not every English speaker is a Pill fan.
"It's very American," said Maia Horniak, a Czech-Australian film student, "and it's too much about getting drunk and how to cure your hangover."
In New York, Mr. Koyen will run the show and Mr. Zaitchik will be No. 2. One goal, Mr. Koyen said, will be to make The Press a bit meatier.
"The New York Press has a reputation for personal writing," Mr. Koyen said. "I want to add to that and get a little serious journalism. Alex has learned how to dig here, and I want him to get his claws into the city."
For his part, Mr. Zaitchik says he is not overly awed by his new job.
"It's not like we're failed novelists," he said. "We've been running a serious newspaper in a capital city, and now we're going to New York."

HEADLINE: Deutsche Bank Chiefs Face Legal Battles 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
As Deutsche Bank struggles to climb out of the deepest banking downturn in postwar German history, its two most visible executives are fighting their own personal legal battles, which some investors fear could soil the reputation of the company, Germany's leading bank.
 German prosecutors confirmed today that they had charged the bank's chief executive, Josef Ackermann, with breach of trust, stemming from his approval of more than $100 million in payments to executives of Mannesmann in the final days of its takeover battle with the Vodafone Group of Britain. 
 Mr. Ackermann is one of six people -- former officials and board members of Mannesmann -- who are accused of improperly using the conglomerate's funds to pay severance and bonuses to top managers, according to the state prosecutor in Dusseldorf, Hans-Reinhard Henke. 
If the defendants are found guilty, they could face up to 10 years in prison. "We assume that the accused knew the payments were illegal at the time," Mr. Henke said at a news conference in Dusseldorf.
Last week, the chairman of Deutsche Bank's supervisory board, Rolf E. Breuer, lost another legal battle when a court in Munich ruled that he had breached client confidentiality rules by commenting publicly about the financial travails of Kirch, the German media empire that later collapsed.
If that ruling is upheld, it could expose Mr. Breuer and Deutsche Bank to tens of millions of dollars in fines. Insisting its chairman had done nothing wrong, the bank said it would appeal the decision.
Investors have generally shrugged their shoulders as the cases have been studied by German courts. Both cases have been viewed, particularly outside Germany, as parochial legal disputes, which probably will be settled without lasting damage to the bank or the two men.
Today, though, some investors said the cases were starting to take a toll on the image of Deutsche Bank, the flagship of the German banking industry with operations from Tokyo to New York.
"A lot of good names are being damaged," said Boris Boehm, a money manager at Nordinvest in Hamburg. "Deutsche Bank can always make back the money it loses, but you can't get back your good name."
Shares of Deutsche Bank tumbled 4 percent in Frankfurt today, pulling the stock exchange to its lowest level since 1996.
A spokesman for the bank said its lawyers were studying the charges against Mr. Ackermann, which are laid out in a 460-page document. The court will allow the defendants to respond before deciding whether to convene a trial; that process could take two months.
Mark Hoge, a banking analyst with Banc of America Securities in London, said that most investors still believed that the legal cases against Mr. Ackermann and Mr. Breuer stood little chance of ultimate success.
Three weeks ago, Mr. Ackermann delivered an impassioned defense of his actions at a news conference held in Frankfurt. He said that the severance pay awarded to Mannesmann's departing executives, including the chief executive, Klaus Esser, was a fair reflection of their performance.
Mr. Ackermann said the case was less about ethics than about a "destructive" bias against corporate executives in Germany. Unchecked, he said, this bias could jeopardize the country's place in the global economy.
"The best Germans don't want to work here," he said. "They want to work in London or New York."
Such arguments have little popular appeal to Germans, who are less tolerant than Americans of large pay packages for chief executives. Indeed, some legal experts predict this case will spur a debate here about forcing German companies to say more about how they compensate senior executives.
"Traditionally, payments to German executives do not diverge as much from the average worker as in the United States," said Theodor Baums, an expert on banking and law. "But if you compare rules on management pay, the U.S. regulations are much tighter than in this country."
Companies here disclose only an aggregate sum paid to the management board, which consists of the chief executive and the top operating executives. The sum is not broken down into salary and bonus, nor do companies compare their performance with that of their peers, as in the United States.
Mr. Esser's individual severance payment of roughly $30 million became public only in news media reports, after Vodafone completed its $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann in 2000. Mr. Esser initially resisted the takeover, the largest in history, but later acquiesced.
"The argument of the prosecutor is that this gang really ripped off a lot of money, and left nothing for the new owner," said Mr. Baums, who has written two legal briefs on the matter for Vodafone.
The case comes at a time of renewed concern here about corporate legerdemain. The disclosure this week that Royal Ahold of the Netherlands, the global supermarket and food distribution giant, had overstated its accounts by more than $500 million has reminded people that Europe is not immune to the scandals that shook the United States.
As if to underline that point, the German government said today that it would push new measures to strengthen the role of auditors. The laws would also make it easier for shareholders to sue executives and board members for damages if they are found guilty of spreading false information.
Germany has not yet considered requiring companies to disclose the pay of their top executives. But 6 of the 30 companies listed on the benchmark DAX stock index in Frankfurt have said they would do it voluntarily.
"There is no enthusiasm on the part of management," said Rudiger von Rosen, the managing director of the Deutsche Aktieninstitut, a shareholder research group. "But they are being pressured by the market."

HEADLINE: Brazilian Government's Mixed Signals 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
With Brazil's energy market in a shambles and several utilities -- including some belonging to the AES Corporation of the United States -- facing possible insolvency, Brazil's new left-leaning government is facing perhaps its most serious test yet.
 Will the government halt or even reverse the privatizations that have partly liberalized power generation and distribution, as some socialist supporters of the government would like? Or will the government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva try to overhaul the industry with a mix of public and private investments? 
 So far, Mr. da Silva has sent out mixed signals, saying that all contracts will be respected, but also criticizing the regulatory agencies. 
And the national development bank, BNDES, is taking a hard line in negotiations with AES over its heavily indebted utility, Eletropaulo. The bank could wrest control from AES since an $85 million payment was not made last month on an outstanding $1.2 billion loan.
"If the government doesn't sit down and negotiate with utilities, the trend will be for them to default," said Adriano Pires, director of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, a Rio de Janeiro consulting firm. "There is a huge temptation within the government to renationalize the sector, but that would do untold damage."
The problem for many utilities in Brazil is that their revenues, which are collected in the Brazilian currency, are shrinking, causing them to struggle to cover heavy debts contracted in United States dollars.
"Today, there is basically no regulation of the market; it's total chaos," said Armando Franco, energy analyst at the Sao Paulo-based consultants Tendencias. "Service to consumers is worsening, which reinforces the arguments of those who say privatization hasn't worked."
Although AES officials say they have no plans to leave Brazil, people close to the negotiations with the development bank say the company is prepared to give up about half its Brazilian assets to settle its debts.
Even Sao Paulo's center-right governor, Geraldo Alckmin, says the state may have to take over Eletropaulo temporarily.
At the core of the problem is how Brazil privatized its electricity sector in the first place.
In the mid-1990's, inflation had been tamed, and Brazil looked set for years of stable economic growth. Major foreign energy companies like AES, El Paso, Enron, Tractebel of Belgium, Electricite de France and EDP of Portugal rushed in. 
But Mr. da Silva's predecessor, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, sold distributors rather than generators, in the process failing to make pricing fully competitive.
Unclear regulations also effectively scared off private sector investors and eventually led to blackouts and rationing in 2001 and 2002.
Nonetheless, Brazilian power looked like an opportunity. 
AES bought Eletropaulo for $1.8 billion, built a thermal generator in the southern city of Uruguaiana and acquired two other local distributors to create AES Sul and AES Tiete.
Since then, the slide of the Brazilian currency, the real, against the dollar, and tumbling consumption, thanks to economic stagnation and the year of rationing, have wrought havoc.
Cemar, a northeastern utility owned by the PPL Corporation filed for bankruptcy last year, while debt burdens are climbing to levels that the president of AES, Paul Hanrahan, has called "unimaginable."
AES's local units must meet debt payments of more than $1 billion this year.
Another Sao Paulo utility, Cesp, must pay $775 million.
Eletrobras, the sector's state-owned mainstay, owes a total of $3.5 billion.
In recent weeks, the government first agreed to, then rejected a 30 percent electricity price increase that would help offset some of the utilities' losses.

HEADLINE: Even a Superpower Needs Help 

BYLINE:  By Chas W. Freeman Jr.; Chas W. Freeman Jr., United States ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 1989 to 1992 and assistant secretary of defense from 1993 to 1994, is president of the Middle East Policy Council.

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 

 BODY:
Twelve years ago, this city shook under Scud missile bombardments and the roar of American and Saudi bombers on their way to pound Iraqi forces. It was the command center of two great coalitions: one was Western, led by the United States; another was Arab and Islamic, led by Saudi Arabia. Soldiers from 33 other countries fought alongside America's, risking their lives to reverse Iraqi aggression. Japan and Germany, unable then to send troops, joined Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states in reimbursing America's military expenses.
 Now the Saudi capital is quiet, a reminder of how little the coming war against Iraq will resemble the last one. 
 The Persian Gulf war is remembered by most people here as America's finest hour. The United States led a broad international coalition to enforce the writ of the United Nations to liberate an Arab country. The coming war -- which is intended to conquer an Arab country and to occupy it for as long as it takes to reshape it to American satisfaction -- is viewed here as a potential catastrophe, not just for America's friends but for America itself. 
There are lots of theories here about what the Bush administration really seeks in attacking Iraq. But few believe that this war and the resolution Washington presented at the United Nations this week are motivated by a burning desire to restore respect for the Security Council. And the support for the war from Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and from the leaders of some former Communist European countries strikes Saudis as being more about currying favor with Washington than about fear of Iraq.
With Iraq's armed forces just one-third the size they were in the last war and demonstrably unable or unwilling to resist or retaliate against daily American and British bombing attacks, the Saudis remain unconvinced that Saddam Hussein, detestable as he is, poses an imminent threat. An attack on Iraq that threatens his regime, however, would cause Iraq to lash out at Israel and the American homeland. Why, people here wonder, is Washington so intent on leaving Saddam Hussein with no choice but to try his hand as a suicide bomber with a global reach?
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's brilliant presentation to the Security Council this month exposed Iraq's shell games with the inspectors. Butto many here, his evidence showed a regime scrambling to retain the pathetic remnants of its former arsenal of terrifying weapons, not one pressing forward with new research, development and production.
Paradoxically, many Saudis feel that their main gain from a second American war with Iraq would not be the elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, but the long-delayed departure from American troops from Saudi soil. The United Nations-related missions justifying the American soldiers' presence would disappear along with the Saddam Hussein regime. The kingdom will heave a sigh of relief when American forces withdraw after Baghdad is taken.
For now, however, Saudi Arabia's rulers, despite grave misgivings about the wisdom of American bellicosity, will never give Osama bin Laden what he wants: forcing American troops out or otherwise backing away from Washington. They do not want to throw away the possibility that past closeness might somehow, someday, be restored. So they will allow the United States Air Force to continue its current operations, to run the air war from Prince Sultan Air Base, and to have its planes fly over Saudi territory while attacking Iraq from elsewhere. 
Saudi Arabia is, of course, only one of many allies caught between strategic reliance on America and strongly felt objections to its policies. Some have found it easier than others to finesse this dilemma. France and Germany have impaled themselves on it. Turkey pragmatically bargained for financial aid and a hand in shaping the future of northern Iraq to offset its political pain. Others are going along only to the extent that they must to avoid alienating the United States. There isn't much enthusiasm in the ranks, and there may not be much staying power either.
In Europe and Asia even more than in the Middle East, the Bush administration's stated determination to act regardless of the views of allies risks destabilizing longstanding alliances and partnerships. Whatever this war's effects on the region, globally it may be an even bigger roll of the dice for the United States than either its proponents or critics have argued.
For more than half a century, our foreign military bases, and our ability to move forces from Europe and Japan, have enabled the United States to project power to the Middle East and around the globe. It was through European bases that we carried out the emergency resupply of Israel in October 1973; marshalled troops, weapons and supplies for Desert Shield and Desert Storm; dropped food in Bosnia; and refueled the United States-based bombers that struck Baghdad in 1991, Belgrade in 1999 and Afghanistan in 2001. 
Likewise, without fuel from the airborne tankers stationed in Persian Gulf Arab air fields, our attack planes aboard carriers in the Indian Ocean could not have reached targets in Afghanistan, or have returned safely. Without similar replenishment from bases in Japan, we could not sustain air operations over Korea and the Taiwan Strait, or reinforce and resupply our land and naval forces in Asia, or care for American wounded outside a future battle zone.
America has never before had the global reach it now enjoys. Foreign allies have made this possible. But Washington's contemptuous dismissal of European objections to war with Iraq, even as our forces use bases on their soil to prepare for it, is causing our friends to begin a potentially disastrous debate.
They are questioning more seriously whether American bases still serve their interests as well as those of a United States that is indifferent and unwilling to consider their views. They are asking themselves why they are still reimbursing America for much of the costs of these bases and troops, which are then used to do things to which they strongly object. They are questioning whether the political and economic burdens may not now outweigh the benefits.
Differences over Iraq have already led to speculation about an end to United States bases in Germany. Large antiwar majorities in Britain, Greece, Italy and Spain seem likely in time to make them an active political issue there as well. Especially if America stumbles into a war that is longer than expected, or if the occupation of Iraq turns ugly. 
Similar uncertainties about bases -- and particularly the social complications that inevitably arise from having a foreign military presence on one's territory -- now strain our relationship with South Korea, and repeatedly erupt in Japan. Changes in one country will affect others. Our allies take their cues from each other's analyses as well as from our demeanor.
The last war with Iraq greatly enhanced American prestige and influence. The irony is that this war with Iraq, intended by its proponents to consolidate United States hegemony, may erode and undermine it. Even if things go well, it could yield weakened American alliances and influence, a more anemic presence overseas, a diminished capacity to project power, fewer options and allies in the Middle East, and an increased threat of terrorism. From here, it looks like a bad bet against long odds. 
A committed Coalition of the Willing, drawn from allies and friends on six continents, won the last war in the gulf. This war will be fought by the United States, backed by a deeply divided Britain and a Coalition of the Sullenly Acquiescent.

HEADLINE: Statehouse Pain and the President 

 BODY:
President Bush did not just stiff the nation's governors this week when they came seeking help in handling their ever-growing state deficits. He added insult to injury by lobbying the governors to support his latest wave of upper-bracket tax-cut proposals. These would cost the states an estimated $64 billion over the next decade beyond what they are suffering right now: total deficits of up to $50 billion this year and $80 billion next. As they plead for help, the president could only prescribe more of the same economic "cure" that helped to create the problem. 
 Even some of Mr. Bush's supporters must have seethed when he tried to present himself as just another executive battling red ink. "It's because we went through a recession and we're at war," he told the National Governors Association. But this is a group of working politicians wise enough to know that they are not "through" the recession at all, and that while Mr. Bush has avoided factoring the cost of a possible Iraq war into his own budget, they have no choice but to pay as they go. 
 "You can't just keep printing money," Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida chimed in, as if he did not know that is pretty much what his brother the president can do as he rolls his deficit spending and tax-cutting plans over the grim fiscal horizon. Mr. Bush's policies only deepen the governors' dilemma: Do they cut programs or raise taxes? Many are resorting to both, even some Republicans elected as vaunted detaxifiers in the high-flying 90's. Party loyalty compels them to refrain from pointing out that by stinting on state aid, Mr. Bush is pushing up taxes on the local level even as he is trying to slice them further in Washington.
The governors will have to try to make their point with Congress instead. They have singled out homeland security and education as areas where they've been particularly shortchanged despite fresh federal mandates. Congress needs to produce funding that matches its rhetoric on these priorities. On the budget-busting issue of Medicaid, the governors have appointed a bipartisan group to negotiate some better solution than the president's offer of modest short-term help in return for an end to long-term commitments on matching funds. Republican House leaders seem hopeless on this. The thin G.O.P. Senate majority must heed the governors' plea for emergency help. Aid to the states will do far more to control the tax bite on middle-income Americans than the president's preference for bigger tax cuts and deeper red ink.

HEADLINE: Bush's Plan For Pensions Is Now Given Low Priority 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Less than a month after President Bush proposed a radical overhaul and expansion of individual retirement and savings accounts, the White House has abandoned the idea as a legislative priority.
 Administration officials say they still support the idea, which would allow nearly all Americans to avoid taxes on virtually their entire income from investments, but the officials no longer even mention it unless asked about it first. 
 In a spate of recent speeches and private meetings to promote Mr. Bush's $674 billion "economic growth package," which is focused on eliminating taxes on most dividends and accelerating the tax cuts Congress approved in 2001, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has studiously avoided the pension and savings proposals. 
"For us, the jobs and growth package is the No. 1 priority," said Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Mr. Snow. "Everything else is secondary."
Today, for example, Mr. Snow spent much of the day in closed-door meetings on Capitol Hill with top Republican lawmakers. But administration officials say he did not discuss the proposals for a new class of retirement plans.
It was clear from the beginning that the savings proposals were not likely to make much headway in Congress quickly. In large part, the backpedaling reflects hostile reactions from Republicans who were not consulted in advance and were taken aback by the sweep of the Bush administration's proposals.
Administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say they will not even begin to push for their pension proposals until this fall, and some say the plan could easily be dropped in the heat of negotiations about other issues.
That is a significant retreat. When the administration announced the proposals on Jan. 31, officials called them a daring way to increase savings and expand retirement opportunities.
President Bush created something of a storm when he included the retirement proposals in his budget plan early this month.
Pam Olson, assistant secretary of the Treasury in charge of tax policy, said on the day the plan was announced, "These bold new accounts will give more hard-working Americans the chance to save so they can enrich their lives and strengthen their retirement security."
The proposals call for replacing today's individual retirement accounts with a new class of tax-advantaged savings accounts. One proposal, for so-called Lifetime Savings Accounts, would allow a married couple to set aside up to $15,000 a year and permanently shield from taxes all investment income produced by that money.
In contrast to today's retirement accounts, people would be able to withdraw money any time they liked and use it for anything they wanted. On top of the lifetime accounts, taxpayers, regardless of income and any other pensions they might have, would also be able to deposit $7,500 each in new Retirement Savings Accounts that would also shield all investment gains from taxation.
House Republican leaders have been working on a much more modest plan to expand individual retirement accounts and have been laboring mightily to build bipartisan support. 
Democratic opponents argue that the proposals would lead to an enormous drain on future tax revenue, because almost all investment income to individuals would eventually be shielded from taxes. 
They have also been taken aback by parts of the plan that would essentially eliminate ordinary retirement accounts, which allow people to receive a tax deduction of up to $3,000 a year upfront, when putting money into the accounts. These remain popular with many middle-income taxpayers.
Democratic lawmakers also object to provisions relaxing rules aimed at preventing companies from offering their top executives far more generous retirement benefits than ordinary workers.
Administration officials say their proposals still make sense. While suggesting that they could emerge in the future as part of a broad tax overhaul, they now stress that the proposals are not an immediate priority. They point out that Mr. Bush did not even mention them in his State of the Union address on Jan. 28.
R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said today that he was spending nearly all his time promoting the president's tax plan and that a second priority was working on proposals to overhaul Medicare.
"The important thing from the administration's perspective is to get the jobs and growth bill passed," Mr. Hubbard said today. "The savings incentives are really about long-term policy."
Republican leaders in Congress, meanwhile, want little to do with the proposals. Representative Rob Portman of Ohio, the House Republicans' liaison with the White House, is planning to introduce a much more modest plan to expand tax-advantaged retirement accounts.
Mr. Portman's plan, which is being drafted in collaboration with Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, is expected to have bipartisan support but be far less sweeping than the administration had suggested.
Among other things the plan would increase the amount of money people can contribute to individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans.
"I think that's going to be the top priority as far as we are concerned," a senior Republican official in the House said. If White House officials do not push hard, he added, the Bush retirement proposal will have no chance whatsoever.
If Mr. Bush decides not to push his idea this year, that does not mean it is dead. Many analysts say the retirement proposals mesh with what appears to be Mr. Bush's long-term goal of removing most taxes on investment income and toward a system that essentially taxes only consumption.
Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota and a staunch opponent of the Bush retirement proposals, said the battles were far from over.
"They don't even want this under debate right now," Mr. Pomeroy said. "But they're signaling where they want to go."

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Lifeblood Ebbs Even as It Flows 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
Once more, tankers are setting sail loaded with crude bound for the United States, while government planners busily rebuild and reorganize the state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, pondering how to function with 40 percent fewer workers.
 Oil, the lifeblood of Venezuela, is running again after a paralyzing national strike, with production now topping two million barrels a day, say officials of the $46-billion-a-year company. They predict that Venezuela's oil industry, with a leaner government-run company leading the way, will soon churn out 3.1 million barrels daily, matching the pre-strike level. 
 "We are getting close to normal," said Enrique Salazar, a loading master on the Caribbean coast, peering from a control room as a tanker, the Morichal, took on 25,000 barrels an hour. 
But oil analysts and economists say the government's rosy picture hides a painful truth about a 27-year-old company that was born when Venezuela nationalized oil production and quickly became one of Latin America's more highly regarded multinationals. 
Petroleos de Venezuela has lost $4 billion in exports and nearly 16,000 workers, fired by the government for taking part in a walkout aimed at debilitating President Hugo Chavez's left-leaning government. That financial blow and the loss of workers with, on average, 17 years of experience could permanently hobble the company, keeping it from assuming its role as a leading world oil provider, analysts here and abroad say.
"It will not be the company it once was," said Mazhar al-Shereidah, an oil economist in Caracas who helped write oil regulations for the Chavez government. "For a country that depends on petroleum, now more than ever, the challenges are too great. You have to pray for Venezuela."
The dire predictions, if true, would indeed be disastrous for this country of 24 million, which depends on oil for half of government revenues and 80 percent of exports. It would also leave the United States -- which has counted on Venezuelan oil for decades -- without one of its most reliable suppliers as a possible war with oil-rich Iraq promises to batter energy markets.
The obstacles are daunting after the strike, which started to fizzle in February after two months. A lack of maintenance has caused sand to build up in the gelatinous deposits and the pressure to drop, making some fields worthless and threatening to cut production capacity by 300,000 or more barrels a day. And perhaps most troubling is that no one knows what Mr. Chavez's government has in store, though it has promised a wholesale revamping of what was once the world's second-largest oil company.
Reports from international analysts are blistering. UBS Warburg predicts that oil's contribution to gross domestic product will fall 22 percent in 2003, with Venezuela facing "a fiscal crisis of major proportions." Fitch Ratings says Venezuela's "image as a reliable crude oil supplier has been undermined" and will he hard to recover.
Analysts say the lack of technical expertise, combined with the financial straits, means that Petroleos de Venezuela will be unable, in the short term, to reach production levels of the prestrike days, when Venezuela was the world's fifth-largest oil exporter. Most recent production has been in fields that were easiest to restart, leading independent analysts to predict that Venezuela will, at best, produce 2.3 million barrels daily by year-end.
"We believe the company's role in Venezuela society has been permanently altered," a recent Deutsche Bank report said. Assuming average daily production of 1.7 million barrels for 2003, the bank estimated that oil revenue would reach only $14.1 billion, down nearly 50 percent from 2001.
The government is already preparing for the worst. The 2003 budget for the oil company was cut by $2.7 billion, to about $6 billion, while the income the government draws from oil is forecast by UBS Warburg to fall from $11.5 billion in 2002 to as little as $5 billion in 2003. The drop will make it especially difficult to raise the $5 billion the company would have spent to keep production steady.
Ali Rodriguez, the former leftist guerrilla turned president of Petroleos de Venezuela, does not gloss over the obstacles. But in an interview, Mr. Rodriguez said the doomsday predictions originated with dissident executives who hoped to undermine international confidence in the oil company to weaken Mr. Chavez.
He predicted that through sharp budget and personnel cuts, the company would reach 3.1 million barrels a day. And "with its resources," he said, "it is perfectly possible that it will even surpass that level."
To be sure, the Petroleos de Venezuela now emerging will be a far different company, in both its management and philosophy.
Gone will be the highly autonomous octopus that Mr. Rodriguez said functioned with great independence from the state, controlling revenues and influencing oil policies. The new company, taking advantage of some of the world's largest oil deposits outside the Middle East, "must give maximum contribution to the nonpetroleum sector, which is the majority of the people," Mr. Rodriguez said.
Still, even inside the gleaming office tower in Caracas where the company is based, the short-term outlook seems dismal as managers pore over financial statements. 
"There is no investment, so there is no doubt that the company at this moment is very debilitated," Bernard Mommer, a close adviser to Mr. Rodriguez who is helping guide the restructuring, said in an interview. "Up ahead, we are going to have problems like how to recover the quality of the company."
Venezuela will benefit little from the higher world oil prices projected in coming months, since production capacity remains limited. By the time Petroleos de Venezuela is producing close to three million barrels daily -- if it ever does -- prices are likely to have stabilized, analysts say.
In the meantime, Mr. Rodriguez and his managers are busy splitting the company into three divisions: a natural gas branch to develop the largest deposits in Latin America, and companies in the east and west intended to make obsolete the executive offices in Caracas, where antigovernment activities percolated.
Venezuela may also unload foreign assets, like refineries in the United States that operate under the Citgo chain, which is wholly owned by Petroleos de Venezuela, and other installations in Europe and the Caribbean. 
Publicly, officials deny the companies are for sale. But Mr. Mommer said Citgo remained overly expensive while providing scant returns.
"The sophisticated part of our business, refining, that's not our business," Mr. Mommer said. "Exploration and production, that is where the big money is."
Such a sale would "dismember" the company, warned Jose Toro Hardy, an influential former board member, because Citgo refineries are specially outfitted to process Venezuela's particularly gummy brand of heavy crude.
"There are few refineries in the world that can refine" this crude, Mr. Toro Hardy explained. "Without Citgo, Venezuela's heavy oil would lose value."
Oil analysts also warn that the company will be debilitated for years from the loss of experienced workers. Executives, office workers, engineers and highly trained technicians joined the walkout and, in some cases, damaged computers and software and stole files to hinder reactivation efforts.
Mr. Chavez, who has referred to the employees as traitors and fascists, has promised that they will not be rehired.
But already, oil analysts say, the shortage of experienced workersis being felt in every corner of the company. In the patents and technology department, which develops technology for exploration and refining, 800 were fired. The department that trains executives has lost hundreds, as has the crucial commercialization department, which contracts with oil purchasers. 
"Even if you replace the bodies, you don't replace institutional memories," said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, an industry-supported analysis group in New York. "It's a hidden loss. You can't touch it or taste it, but it's there."

HEADLINE: Governors Seek Aid From Congress and Decline to Back Medicaid Plan 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Rebuffed by President Bush, the National Governors Association decided today to seek fiscal assistance from Congress, and some lawmakers said they would be willing to help states with the growing costs of Medicaid, education and domestic security.
 After earlier partisan disagreements, the governors came together in support of a policy that says the federal government should provide more money for states to deal with requirements imposed by federal law. The governors did not request a specific amount, but the cost of their recommendations for education and domestic security could easily exceed $15 billion a year. 
 The governors did not endorse Mr. Bush's proposal for sweeping changes in Medicaid, the health program for 45 million low-income people. Instead, they decided to negotiate with the administration to see if they could agree on legislation to slow the growth of Medicaid spending, which is financed jointly by the federal government and the states. 
The outcome was a setback for Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, who said last week that he wanted and expected the governors to endorse the president's Medicaid proposal.
The governors did agree to recommend one major change in health policy. They said the federal government, through Medicare, should assume the entire cost of health care for low-income elderly people eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.
This group of six million people accounts for about 15 percent of Medicaid recipients, but 35 percent of the program's costs.
A parade of prominent lawmakers spoke to the governors at their annual meeting today. Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee and the Senate majority leader, offered hope but no promises. Dr. Frist said he would prefer to link assistance for elderly Medicaid recipients to comprehensive changes in Medicare, including the addition of prescription drug benefits for all the elderly. But in the absence of such big changes, Dr. Frist said, Congress may accommodate some of the governors' request for short-term assistance.
He also said Congress might increase education spending under the new law that requires states to test students regularly in reading and mathematics. 
Representative Michael N. Castle, Republican of Delaware, told the governors that Congress would gradually increase federal aid to the states for the cost of educating children with disabilities. Mr. Castle said the federal government now paid 18 percent of special education costs, and he predicted the federal share would reach 40 percent in 10 years.
Democrats have been sharply criticizing the Bush administration, saying it has not done enough to help the states. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House Democratic whip, said to the governors today, "We are committed to helping states weather the current budget storm." Mr. Hoyer said that the president's tax cut plan would increase the deficit and restrict the money available for education, health care and domestic security.
On Monday, Mr. Bush told the governors that they were receiving enough federal money and that they should not expect more from Washington, beyond what was in his budget proposal. Mr. Bush said his tax cut proposals would help states by stimulating the economy.
The governors association rejected Mr. Bush's proposal to provide health insurance to small businesses through a new type of health plan that would be exempt from state insurance regulations.
The Bush proposal would allow small businesses to band together and buy health insurance through a trade association or professional society. Under such an arrangeement, Mr. Bush says, small businesses could pool their purchasing power and negotiate lower premiums.
But governors said the new entities, known as "association health plans," would destabilize the insurance market and would be risky for consumers because they could charge higher premiums to older, sicker workers and could sell bare-bones insurance policies without the benefits now required by state laws.
In a letter to Congress, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon of Indiana, a Democrat, and Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota, a Republican, said they feared that healthy people would buy minimal coverage from an association plan, then "jump back to state-regulated insurance when they need more comprehensive coverage."
The National Governors Association tries to operate by consensus. But after it adjourned today, four Democratic governors joined Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and the Senate minority leader, in denouncing President Bush's domestic policies.
Gov. Gary Locke of Washington said the governors, struggling with the worst fiscal problems since World War II, "received nothing but great smiles and rhetoric" from the administration.

HEADLINE: Federated Names Chief Executive and Posts Quarterly Profit 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
Terry J. Lundgren, the chief operating officer at Federated Department Stores -- which owns 460 stores, including the Bloomingdale's and Macy's chains -- was named the company's chief executive, effective today. 
 The appointment stemmed from a longtime succession plan at the company -- and was not part of the end-of-year bloodletting that affected so many retail executives. 
 Mr. Lundgren, 50, vowed yesterday to raise the company's declining same-store sales by broadening its "Re-Invent" strategy, which aims to make the department stores less confusing while bolstering more cutting-edge fashion departments. 
The company's annual same-store sales -- the comparison between 2002 and the previous year for stores open at least a year -- have been dismal, along with most other department stores, including the May Department Stores, Federated biggest competitor. Department stores in general have been losing business to discounters like Wal-Mart and Target, and Mr. Lundgren's appointment comes at a crucial time.
"I clearly understand we have to do things differently to attract customers back," Mr. Lundgren said yesterday. Yet he argued that changes had already started; yesterday, the company raised its earnings forecast for 2003, and predicted that same-store sales would improve by next fall. Federated is gambling that its Bloomingdale's chain will lead the way, with a 140,000-square-foot home furnishing store that just opened in Chicago, and an equally large Bloomingdale's coming in a historic cast-iron building in the SoHo district of Manhattan.
Mr. Lundgren, who is the architect of the "Re-Invent" strategy for the other Federated stores ("Not in Bloomingdale's," he said. "That's a separate bucket"), said he would expand the concept from 40 stores. The strategy includes placing large, easy-to-read signs -- like street signs -- within the stores, pointing customers to men's clothes and housewares, among other goods.
The company also put 30 to 35 computers in each of the first 40 stores, he said, where customers can check prices and sales by putting the price tag under a scanner. Mr. Lundgren, like most retail executives, said he did not expect business to pick up until war worries end and the economy improved. Yet Federated is taking some initiative: it just mailed out a million catalogs, advertising its I.N.C. brand, which he said was cutting-edge fashion -- at a Macy's price.
He wants to bring back bored shoppers, who tell pollsters their closets are already full of jeans and sweaters bought a few years ago -- and they are bored by the merchandise in stores now. That does not mean that shoppers are "ready to buy right now," he said, adding, "but we're guessing things will improve by next fourth quarter, and we want to be in position."
Mr. Lundgren succeeds James M. Zimmerman, who will remain as chairman. Mr. Lundgren will retain the title of president.
Also yesterday, Federated reported earnings of $341 million, or $1.78 a share, for the fourth quarter, which ended Feb. 1, in contrast to a loss of $447 million, or $2.23 a share, in the period a year earlier, which included costs associated with the sale of the company's Fingerhut catalog business. Fourth-quarter sales were $5.02 billion, a 2 percent drop from $5.13 billion.

HEADLINE: Labor Gathers Resources to Unseat President in 2004 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Fla., Feb. 25 

 BODY:
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. promised today to do its utmost to unseat President Bush in the election next year, saying he is vulnerable because of growing dismay with his economic policies. 
 Using unusually harsh language, leaders of the labor federation said Mr. Bush favored the rich, hurt working families and had the worst record in creating jobs of any president since the 1930's. 
 The federation, which represents 13 million workers, promised to mobilize more members than ever before and create a tax-exempt political group to get out the vote and spread labor's message. 
 "There's an economic code red for America's working families who are in the worst economic crisis in two decades," the president of the federation, John J. Sweeney, said at a news conference here at its winter meeting. "Layoffs are at record highs. The number of people who can afford health care coverage is plummeting, and working people's paychecks are stretched paper thin."
 To rally support against Mr. Bush, the federation released a six-page report that detailed 24 actions that the federation said were antilabor or antiworker. They included the administration's success in repealing ergonomics rules and stripping 60,000 airport screeners of the right to unionize.
 Mr. Sweeney and other leaders made clear that they believed that Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress were taking steps to weaken labor because they saw how crucial unions were to Democratic campaigns. 
In another acknowledgement of the power of labor, five Democratic presidential candidates -- former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut -- traveled to the luxury oceanfront resort where the union leaders are meeting.
 "This administration has actively sought every opportunity to pull the rug out from under working Americans," Mr. Sweeney said. "This nation is being led backward by President Bush and the Republicans in Congress. It is the top priority of the labor political program in 2003 and 2004 to take the country forward again by removing out-of-touch political leaders."
 Convinced that labor faces a constant fight in Washington, Mr. Sweeney said, the union movement would create a permanent year-round network of hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of volunteers, not just for campaigns, but also to mobilize members, as needed, to contact lawmakers on many issues. In the past, unions mobilized their members just two or three months before the November elections.
 Union leaders said they feared that the administration and Republican Congress would seek to weaken Medicare protections, overtime laws and the Family and Medical Leave Act.
 "Right now, it's not business as usual," said Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and chairman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. political committee. "Our people feel they're under attack as never before."
 A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Jim Dyke, said the labor leaders did not appreciate all that Mr. Bush was doing to bolster the economy.
 "John Sweeney, based on what he said, may be out of touch with the very people he represents," Mr. Dyke said. "President Bush actively pressed for terrorism insurance, which would have created jobs. President Bush actively pursued exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which would have created jobs. President Bush has put forward a bold plan that will create jobs."
 A spokesman for the White House, Scott McClellan, said: "I think workers are more concerned about action on the economy in 2003 than attacks for campaigns in 2004. John Sweeney's time would be better spent urging Congressional action this year on the president's plan to create jobs and economic growth for America's workers and America's families." 
 The executive council of the federation approved a new policy on presidential endorsements, calling on the 65 affiliate unions not to make endorsements until the parent federation had mustered or at had least tried to muster the two-thirds majority of its board needed for an endorsement. Several leaders said they hoped to see whether they could put together a two-thirds majority for a candidate at the executive council meeting in August. 
Mr. Sweeney said he believed that virtually all the affiliates would back a Democrat instead of Mr. Bush, despite his efforts to woo the Teamsters and construction unions.
"The president can definitely be defeated," the new political director of the federation, Karen Ackerman, said. "The state of the economy, that's the place where you have to start. There are nearly two million private-sector jobs lost since Bush's inauguration. When you ask people whether the country is going in the right direction on the economy, his numbers are plummeting."
 Ms. Ackerman said the labor movement would mobilize more than 250,000 union members to campaign next year. The federation has budgeted $33 million for campaign activities and lobbying this year and next.
 The labor movement received a setback today when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of union members fell 280,000, to 16.1 million last year, largely a result of layoffs in heavily unionized industries.

HEADLINE: Transplant Mix-Up Enters Debate on Malpractice Bills 

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
The death of Jesica Santillan, the 17-year-old given a heart and lung transplant from a donor with an incompatible blood type, is influencing the Congressional debate on President Bush's proposal to limit damages in medical malpractice cases and may prevent the plan from passing intact, lawmakers say.
 Senator Bill Frist, the heart-lung transplant surgeon who is now the Senate majority leader, said in an interview today that he did not think Ms. Santillan's death should affect the proposal's chances. But another senior Republican, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, said any legislation to cap malpractice awards would have to have an exception for egregious cases. 
 "I question whether anything would pass that did not have some way of solving the hard cases," said Mr. Hatch, who is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and is working on a draft of a Senate bill.
Aides to a senior Republican senator said privately that the case of Ms. Santillan, who died on Saturday after doctors at Duke University Hospital performed a second heart-and-lungs transplant in an attempt to save her, will almost certainly drive the malpractice debate. One Republican health care lobbyist, who is pushing hard for malpractice changes, went even further, saying the legislation was in grave danger. 
"The entire effort hit a brick wall this weekend," the lobbyist said. "This was a very heavy lift under the absolute positive best of circumstances, and the circumstances just took a turn for the worse."
With doctors around the country complaining about rising malpractice premiums, and some shutting their practices as a result, President Bush is seeking to overhaul the nation's medical liability system, including legislation that would impose, among other things, a $250,000 cap on jury awards for noneconomic or "pain and suffering" damages. The parents of Ms. Santillan are precisely the kind of people who would be affected by such a cap, opponents of the legislation say, because their daughter did not work and thus her death caused them no economic loss. 
Already, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which is lobbying heavily against the Bush plan, is working with Democrats in Washington to arrange for the Santillan family's lawyer to testify in Congress, where a hearing on medical malpractice is scheduled on Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The lawyer, Kurt Dixon, sent a letter to the committee chairman today, asking to appear.
"I urge you to save a seat for Jesica," Mr. Dixon wrote. "America deserves to understand how people like Jesica and her family would be affected by the legislation your committee is considering."
In recent months, with Republicans in control of the White House and both houses of Congress, proponents of malpractice change thought their time had come. The issue has become a top legislative priority for Senate Republicans. Coverage in the news media has highlighted incidents like a walkout by surgeons in West Virginia, who stopped seeing patients in January to protest the cost of medical malpractice insurance in their state.
But Ms. Santillan's story, followed by millions of people around the nation, has changed the picture. Opponents of an awards cap predict her case will become a touchstone in the debate over what the president and Dr. Frist call frivolous lawsuits, much like, they say, that of a woman who was scalded by hot coffee at a McDonald's restaurant. Her $2.7 million jury award, later reduced to $640,000, became a rallying point for those seeking to limit punitive damages. 
"How many times did we hear about the person with the McDonald's coffee having been burned?" said Senator Richard J. Durbin, a former medical malpractice lawyer who is a leading spokesman for Democrats on malpractice matters. "We were beaten over the head with it. Well, it's sad to say, but this tragedy at Duke is going to be front and center in the evidence of why we have to take medical malpractice reform very seriously."
The teenager's death also has potential implications for presidential politics. When Mr. Bush unveiled his plan last July, he chose as his setting a college gymnasium in North Carolina -- a pointed barb, some said, at Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, a Democratic presidential hopeful who became rich as a plaintiffs' lawyer. Now, Ms. Santillan's death, at Duke in Durham, N.C., gives Mr. Edwards a means of rebutting the president's implied criticism.
Though he has spoken out strongly against Mr. Bush's plan, Mr. Edwards shied away from the issue today, saying only that the death "has been a terrible tragedy for Jesica's family."
Mr. Bush's plans for medical malpractice are modeled on a 1975 California law, which backers say has kept that state's premiums below the national average. In the House, legislation mirroring the White House proposal has been introduced by Representative James C. Greenwood, Republican of Pennsylvania, who said in an interview today that he believed the Santillan family "could recover reasonable damages under my legislation."
The Greenwood bill has been widely expected to sail through the House. Today, Representative Tom DeLay, the House Republican leader, told reporters he did not expect that to change. 
"Obviously, the tragedy in North Carolina was just horrific and unfortunate," Mr. DeLay said. "It doesn't change anything."
In the Senate, where Republicans hold a razor-thin majority, Dr. Frist will need to marshal 60 votes to end a filibuster. 
Dr. Frist said he was working on a medical malpractice package that he expected to unveil in the next few weeks. 
Mr. Hatch, the judiciary committee chairman, said he was pressing for a provision that would allow jury awards to exceed the proposed $250,000 cap in cases where there was "proof of gross negligence." 
Whether that kind of provision would be acceptable to the White House is unclear. Mr. Bush's plan has the support of a powerful and well-financed array of lobbyists, including those for the insurance industry and the American Medical Association, whose incoming president, Dr. Donald Palmisano, strongly defended the plan today. Without reform, he said, patients' access to medical care is in jeopardy.
"Legislators have to strike a balance," Dr. Palmisano said. "A balance between unlimited recoveries for some individuals, against the possibility that there may not be doctors available to treat the rest of the American public."
Opponents of the bill, including the trial lawyers association, are also well financed. They say Ms. Santillan's death demonstrates that juries, not politicians, should decide what a life is worth. 
Mary Alexander, the association's president, said it would be extremely difficult for the Santillans to sue under a $250,000 cap, because it costs nearly that much to bring a case.
"Her tragedy shows what this arbitrary, one-size-fits-all cap means," Ms. Alexander said.

HEADLINE: Panel Supports 2 Tall Towers At Disaster Site 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
A key committee recommended yesterday that Lower Manhattan be rebuilt along the lines of a plan that had seemed out of favor, a proposal by the Think architectural team for two soaring latticework towers as the centerpiece of a memorial area. The unexpected decision appeared to set the stage for a showdown today among city and state officials.
 In the last two weeks, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had expressed support for the other finalist plan, by Studio Daniel Libeskind, which features an excavated pit on the site of the former World Trade Center towers. 
 But The Associated Press reported that Mr. Pataki, when asked yesterday if he had a favorite, said that he did, but then refused to say what it was. "The mayor and I are going to be talking about that this week," Mr. Pataki said. The final choice is to be announced tomorrow.
The group that made the recommendation yesterday, the site planning committee of the board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, acted after a four-hour meeting at which the seven committee members reviewed the architects' revisions to their plans for the trade center site, according to people involved in discussions about the designs.
The committee's preference is not binding on a broader group of rebuilding officials who will meet today to decide whether to select the Think plan or the Libeskind plan. But the committee's move represents a direct challenge to Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg, who now face a choice of following or rejecting the recommendation of the people they appointed to the rebuilding effort.
That broader group includes officials from the development corporation, the governor's office, the mayor's office and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site.
The committee's action yesterday reflects a vigorous lobbying effort by Roland W. Betts, a director of the development corporation, who has been leading both the site-planning committee and the broader rebuilding steering committee.
"It's going to be a close one," a director of the development corporation said yesterday following the meeting. "It could simply come down to how the governor and the mayor feel."
Mr. Pataki and Mr. Bloomberg are scheduled to be briefed on the final plans of the two architecture teams this afternoon. After those briefings, the eight-member steering committee will meet to agree on a winning design, and its decision will be announced tomorrow morning at a press conference at the World Financial Center's Winter Garden, which overlooks ground zero.
Several people involved in the rebuilding process said they remained uncertain about which way the decision would go. But one member of the committee that recommended the Think plan yesterday, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said several committee members believe that the mayor and the governor should pay heed to their preference.
"We don't expect anyone to overrule us," the committee member said. 
The members of the steering committee are Mr. Betts; John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the development corporation; Louis R. Tomson, the corporation's president; Charles Kushnerand Anthony J. Sartor, directors of the Port Authority; Joseph J. Seymour, executive director of the Port Authority; Diana Taylor, deputy secretary to Mr. Pataki; and Daniel E. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding.
People involved in yesterday's meetings said much of the discussion focused on the revisions proposed by the two teams. The Think team, which originally planned to make its latticework towers of forged steel, now plans to build the towers of stainless steel, making them far lighter, according to people who have been briefed on the plan.
That change could address a primary concern of Port Authority engineers, who previously said the towers would be too heavy to be supported in their proposed location -- directly above the rebuilt PATH station at the trade center site. 
It also reduces the expected cost of the design, which according to estimates released by the development corporation was at least $800 million, far more than the $330 million estimate for the Libeskind plan. One official said that the revisions make the plans approximately equal in cost. 
The Think team, led by Rafael Vinoly, Frederic Schwartz, Ken Smith and Shigeru Ban, also agreed to alter the cultural components of their design, lowering a proposed museum from the 85th floor to about the 30th floor of the towers.
The museum would be built within the latticework so that it appeared to be suspended within the towers. But many rebuilding officials objected to the original proposal, saying that placing the tower so high would present engineering problems and discourage visitors who might fear another attack on an occupied portion of the buildings.
The Libeskind team also made changes to its plan, agreeing to raise the level of the pit that would serve as the site of the memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attack. It was originally designed to be 70 feet below ground, at the level of bedrock. Mr. Libeskind's revised design has the pit about 30 feet below ground level. Below it would be mechanical and electrical systems for the PATH station and, perhaps, a bus parking area to serve visitors to the memorial.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: INTELLIGENCE; 
U.S. Lists Iraqis to Punish, or to Work With

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER and DAVID JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
United States intelligence officials have specifically identified more than 2,000 members of the Iraqi elite, including some to be captured as possible war criminals and many more the American military will try to turn against Saddam Hussein during any invasion, senior government officials said today.
 The officials said the computer database, whose existence was previously undisclosed, divided the Iraqi leadership into three categories: hard-core allies of Mr. Hussein; senior Iraqis whose allegiances are uncertain but who may be willing to cooperate with United States forces; and another group of people who are believed either to secretly oppose the government or whose technical expertise is deemed crucial to running a post-Hussein government. 
 President Bush seemed to have some of these officials in mind when when he told reporters that Iraq's generals should "clearly understand that if they take innocent life, if they destroy infrastructure, they will be held to account as war criminals."
But not all of Mr. Hussein's commanders face the possibility of harsh treatment. 
"If they prevent use of weapons of mass destruction or if they surrender their troops without fighting, that would mitigate whatever punishment is coming to them," a senior Bush administration official said today.
The list was assembled by a number of government agencies and departments, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon and the Justice Department. Senior officials acknowledged that the idea of identifying the leadership of a potentially hostile country was not a new one. But they described it as the largest effort of its kind, one that dwarfs work by American intelligence to identify Taliban leaders during the war in Afghanistan or to analyze the military and political leadership in Belgrade during the war in Kosovo.
Mr. Bush's warning, along with the comments of senior officials throughout the government, is part of a coordinated American effort to encourage acts that undermine Mr. Hussein's authority, unsettle his leadership circle and perhaps persuade him to leave the country, the officials said. Exile for the Iraqi leader is an option that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld raised anew today in a speech in Washington and that Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, spoke of on Monday at the White House.
To that end, public discussion of the new intelligence database could prompt those members of the Iraqi leadership who are not in Mr. Hussein's immediate inner circle to contemplate cooperation with the American military.
"Clearly, our desire is to have as small a number as possible with any stake in the survival of the regime," said one senior administration official.
After initially refusing to discuss the database, a number of senior administration officials confirmed its existence after reports began circulating within intelligence agencies that Mr. Hussein is himself aware of the list, or at least has guessed at its existence. Mr. Hussein is said to have told large numbers of subordinates that they are viewed as war criminals by the United States, and therefore could survive only by continued loyalty to him. But one senior administration official said today that the first category was "a relatively small number."
As administration officials confirmed both the listing of Iraqi officials and their division into three categories, the White House appeared to place Mr. Hussein in a category all his own.
Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, Republican of Illinois, was quoted by The Daily Herald of suburban Chicago as saying that Mr. Bush told him he would revoke the executive order banning the assassination of foreign leaders if the United States had a clear shot at Mr. Hussein.
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said today that Mr. Bush had "no memory" of the conversation, but he stopped short of denying it. Mr. Fleischer made clear today that he knew of no plans to lift the ban on assassinations, but that the prohibition would not apply if military action began in Iraq.
"If we go to war in Iraq and hostilities result, command and control and top generals, people who are in charge of fighting the war to kill the United States' troops, cannot assume that they will be safe," he said. "If you go to war, command and control are legitimate targets under international law." 
Iraqi leaders in the first category include top military, security, intelligence and political leaders, as well as members of Mr. Hussein's family or others "inextricably linked to Saddam, particularly those who ordered and/or implemented the regime's brutal policies," officials said.
"Many of these individuals would be considered indictable for possible war crimes or crimes against humanity," one official said, and they may "have links to terrorist acts or groups, as well as those positioned to operationally obstruct a U.S. military campaign."
Officials refused to say precisely how many people they had put in each category. According to one senior administration official, those placed in the first category are relatively few, and "have already lost their last chance to get any credit for surrendering. There will be no last-minute reprieve."
The second category, of Iraqi military, security, intelligence and government officials who have ties to Mr. Hussein's sensitive programs but whose attitudes about a postwar government are unknown, will be judged by their actions during any war that may be ordered by Mr. Bush, officials said.
The judgments of this larger group will be based on "how they conduct themselves if war becomes necessary," a senior official said."
The third category of the roster is also large, and includes those who secretly oppose the government or those economic and financial officers needed to run a postwar government.
Bush administration officials have long said that Mr. Hussein and his ruling circle would be held accountable for crimes against the Iraqi people, from killings by security forces to attacks with weapons of mass destruction. But the compilation of a list of people potentially eligible to be charged with war crimes suggests that the planning for such tribunals -- which could be conducted by the United States, turned over to an international court or carried out by a new Iraqi legal system after the conflict -- is far more advanced than has been known.
A senior Bush administration official said it was unlikely that the government, either on its own or with allies, would engage in extensive war crimes prosecutions. "Don't think Nuremburg," one senior official said. "Think about the Tokyo war crimes trials," in which Gen. Hideki Tojo and a few dozen of his lieutenants were tried after Japan's surrender. The Iraqi people may also be encouraged to develop so-called truth commissions similar to those in postapartheid South Africa or post-Communist Eastern Europe.
A senior Defense Department official said today that the list was available only to the most senior people in the administration -- as well as C.I.A. officers and Special Operations forces who already had been working inside Iraq and were expected to spearhead the hunt for Mr. Hussein and his inner circle.

LEADERSHIP
Baghdad Bosses

American intelligence officials have compiled a database of more than 2,000 top Iraqi government, military, security and weapons development officials and other members of Saddam Hussein's inner circle and put them in three categories:

CATEGORY ONE: THE INNER CIRCLE
Those linked closely to Saddam Hussein's leadership group, or those who are known to support or are suspected of supporting terrorist acts or groups who would be likely to obstruct any American-backed successor government. Many in this group could be tried for war crimes or crimes against humanity.

CATEGORY TWO:
UNCERTAIN LOYALTIES
Those who may have had ties to Mr. Hussein's government or who may have opposed it, and whose willingness to work with a U.S.-installed successor government is not known.

CATEGORY THREE:
POSSIBLE COOPERATION
Those who oppose the government and who are believed to support the United States, or those who may not be known to oppose the government but whose expertise would be crucial to a postwar government.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ISTANBUL; 
Turkish Parliament Is Asked to Approve U.S. Troops

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Turkey's government asked Parliament today to allow as many as 62,000 American troops into the country for up to six months for an attack on Iraq, Turkish officials said.
 The resolution, approved by the Turkish cabinet on Monday, would also grant the Americans permission to base up to 255 airplanes and 65 helicopters in the country for use against Iraq, according to Anatolia, the state-run news agency. 
 The measure also authorizes the dispatchof Turkish troops into northern Iraq, although it specifies no numbers. The move is being bitterly resisted by leaders of Iraq's Kurds, who fear Turkish designs to dominate the region in a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. 
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Ali Sahin, who confirmed the American troop numbers, did not say when the Parliament would vote on the resolution.
But there were growing signs of a revolt today within the majority Justice and Development Party over allowing Turkey to be used as a base for an American invasion. And several opposition deputies with the Turkish Republican People's Party attended a Parliament session wearing white ribbons on their lapels as a sign of opposition to war.
The figures in the resolution are the most specific yet released detailing the size of the force envisioned by the Americans for a northern front. Some 80 American ships carrying equipment for the Fourth Infantry Division are floating off the Turkish coast, idling in the water until a deal is done.
Turkish officials have already allowed some ships to begin unloading heavy equipment. In recent discussions, American officials have spoken of a force of around 40,000 troops and support personnel. 
Asked about the Turkish figures, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld declined today to say whether they reflected the size of the force envisioned by the Americans. 
In the event of war, American officials want to use Turkey as a staging ground for an attack across Iraq's northern frontier, hoping it would comprise the northern end of a two-pronged assault on Baghdad. 
Turkish officials said they would wait until a final agreement was reached with the Americans on all aspects of the operation before putting the resolution to a vote. Some senior officials predicted a vote could come Thursday.
In exchange for granting access, Turkey's leaders have been seeking billions of dollars in economic aid to cushion against the likely economic shocks of war. In addition, the Turks seek American approval for a plan to send thousands of Turkish troops into northern Iraq to prevent the establishment of a Kurdish state. 
The negotiations between the Turks and the Americans continued, with one senior American official, Marisa Lino, negotiating with Turkish officials until 7 a.m. today. Robert Pearson, the American ambassador, left the Turkish Ministry at 2 a.m., officials said. Both resumed negotiations in the afternoon.
Ertugrul Yalcinbayir, one of three deputy prime ministers, indicated today that he would oppose granting access to the American troops. "If it is not approved, democracy would be strengthened," Mr. Yalcinbayir said.
He did not state explicitly how he intended to vote. 
Mr. Yalcinbayir's remarks followed the meeting of the Turkish cabinet Monday, when Prime Minister Abdullah Gul ran into vigorous opposition from his closest supporters over the proposed agreement with the Americans.
The opposition within the cabinet was one reason why the parliamentary vote was not scheduled today, officials said. 
Polls here show that Turkish public opinion is running strongly against a war, but Turkish officials say the pressure from the Americans has been unrelenting.
One senior member of the Turkish government said today that members of the Justice and Development Party were excoriated by their local constituents when they returned home for the recent Muslim holiday of Kurban Bayram.
The members of Parliament were reminded, this government official said, of how staunchly the Turks opposed their country's involvement in a war with Iraq. 
"They had a very tough time, I can tell you," said the Turkish official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "All the people attacked them. The feeling is very negative."
However, another senior Turkish official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the members of the Justice and Development Party would almost certainly do as they were told to do by the party leaders. He cautioned, however, that it was still unclear if the leadership and, particularly, the party leader, Tayyip Erdogan, were ready to endorse an agreement with Americans.
"One thing Tayyip Erdogan cannot do very well is say he believes in something he doesn't believe in," the Turkish official said. "If he goes on television when this is over and tells the Turkish people that he was unwilling to sell their dignity and independence, they'll back him."

A War of Succession With 70's Soul

BYLINE:  By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
SOUL CIRCUS
By George P. Pelecanos
341 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $24.95.
 It's no great feat to begin a new mystery right where the last one in the series left off. What is harder -- and what George P. Pelecanos does so easily in his latest, "Soul Circus" -- is to bring established characters back to such a warm welcome. 
 The central figure in this author's most recent books is Derek Strange, a Washington private detective in his 50's whose taste for smooth, tender, optimistic soul records of the 1970's is as emphatic as his moral code. Derek on the job embodies the spirit of the music he loves. To the sounds of the O'Jays and the Chi-Lites and Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, he keeps his considerable cool and sustains faith in the kind of Love Train that could make this a better world.
But the world of "Soul Circus" needs a lot more than music to improve it. Once again Mr. Pelecanos zeroes in on reckless gangsters in Washington's predominantly black districts, like Anacostia, which "was the most beautiful section of town and also the ugliest, often at the same time." And with the same kind of narrative advocacy that John Grisham brings to tort reform in his latest hit, Mr. Pelecanos looks across the state line into "Mer-land" and sees where trigger-happy Washington toughs are getting their guns.
"Soul Circus," which thanks three Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms employees and a clergyman in its acknowledgments, describes the gangland power vacuum created by the arrest of Granville Oliver at the end of its predecessor, "Hell to Pay." Oliver's incarceration has left all manner of drug dealers and hangers-on jockeying for position and aligning themselves with new power brokers. And when the players in this story choose to stake out turf and assert their manhood, guns are an essential part of their transactions.
One of the new book's principals is Ulysses Foreman, a former cop with a lucrative new gun-dealing business. He now lives within a mile of Anacostia in a fairly rural setting. "You could even hear crickets chirping on summer nights," the book reports, "though those sounds were sometimes mixed with the occasional crack of gunshots riding up from Southeast, if the wind was right." It is to this book's credit that Ulysses is a vital, entertaining figure as well as a symptom of social ills.
For all the weapons floating through "Soul Circus" -- in onescene, Mr. Pelecanos simply describes how a criminal drives a young woman with no prior convictions to Maryland and has her buy him a gun, because she can pass the legally required background check -- this is not a book built on violence. Instead, Mr. Pelecanos once again looks for the roots of angry, bullying behavior and examines them through the knowing eyes of Derek Strange.
Like the novels of Richard Price, whose influence is evident here, "Soul Circus" is both tragedy and thriller, especially as it describes the all but accidental casualties of urban warfare. Much of the trouble in this book is kicked off by the insecurities of a little guy ("Boy looked like a water rat ain't had nothin' to eat for, like, forever") filled with pent-up resentment and trampled pride.
Meanwhile, Mr. Pelecanos continues to display a sharp eye for detail and a terrific ear for street dialogue. ("Two of my boys just got deaded by one of your guns; you know this.") He further culminates an Elmore Leonardesque wry economy and a lilting way with back-and-forth banter, never more so than when Strange hits the streets with his younger white partner, Terry Quinn. (Terry is so white, at least by Derek's standards, that he has sex to the music of Neil Young.)
"Careful, man," Quinn says, as Derek goes into musical raptures while driving. "You keep shutting your eyes when you're gettin' all soulful like that, you're gonna get us killed." Derek replies that he doesn't need to look because he can drive from memory.
Derek turns even more reckless late in the novel, when it becomes payback time for some of the story's most heinous characters. And Mr. Pelecanos, in letting Derek gruesomely humiliate a man who has disrespected a woman, risks letting his hero's avenging virtuousness go too far. Mr. Pelecanos also treads a thin line between cogent argument and oversimplification when he ascribes the woes of young men in "Soul Circus" to the lack of worthwhile father figures -- and lets Derek try to pick up that slack. But in the end, Derek proves as soul-stirring and eminently likable as his favorite songs.
"Soul Circus" provides some wrenching turns of plot, even as it assures the reader that this series is alive and well. Once again, Mr. Pelecanos ends a book with a clear, promising notion of where a subsequent one will start. And once again, he will leave readers eagerly awaiting his next move.

HEADLINE: Riding a Bear Market in Oriental Carpets 

BYLINE:  By MARIANNE ROHRLICH 

 BODY:
FOR anyone who has ever wanted an old Persian rug to warm up a favorite room, now may be the time to snag one. Thousands of old Oriental carpets will be on sale at reduced prices this month, many in the softer palette favored by designers this year.
 Sales will take place both downtown and uptown in Manhattan, with antique carpets that used to sell for $20,000 going for $10,000 or less. 
 Rosalind Candlin Benedict, a rug appraiser and consultant, advises patience, saying that finding the right one may mean plowing through stacks. Out of 100 old rugs, she said, "there are always only three or four lovely ones." 
Prices, she added, are returning to "normal" after years of inflation. "In the 90's, nothing was real," she said. 
Graham Head, president of the rug division at ABC Carpet & Home, concurs. "The days of Mrs. So-and-So coming into ABC and impulsively buying a $20,000 rug are over," he said. "The economy has finally forced prices to become realistic." Furthermore, he declared, rug prices are often determined by decorative value, except at the high end, where factors like age and quality come into play. 
Mr. Head will run a "liquidation" sale for some of his suppliers from March 6 to 23 featuring more than 2,000 rugs consigned to the store by a dozen longtime wholesalers. Prices will run from $499 for an old 3-by-5-foot Turkish carpet to $59,000 for a 14-by-20-foot Ferahan Sarouk. (The store is at 888 Broadway, at 19th Street; 212-473-3000.)
Many of the ABC suppliers, clustered in the area between Union Square and 34th Street, came to New York from Iran in the 1970's, bringing out their fortunes in rugs. They say that after a 25-year boom they are being squeezed by the shrinking market for old rugs, a victim of the recession not only in the United States but also in Europe, where many old rugs are bought from sources in the United States. 
The old-rug business has also been hurt by a trend toward modernist interiors and by the advent of high-quality new rugs produced using traditional weaving techniques, handspun wools and vegetable dyes.
Habib Soumekh, a fourth-generation dealer from Iran and the owner of Sohrab Oriental Rug on West 30th Street, said, "I'm in business 42 years, but I never had a year like this." 
Mr. Soumekh, who is supplying rugs to the ABC sale, will offer an early-20th-century Serapi, 10 by 15 feet, for $12,500; previously, he said, it was $25,000. His inventory also includes Kerman, Mahal, Tabriz and Heriz styles from the first half of the 20th century. 
ABC's staff will assist customers, and the store will earn a commission on each sale. 
On the Upper East Side, where high-end decorators and their clients tend to gravitate, two other Iranian dealers are pooling hundreds of rugs at a five-day sale that begins tomorrow. The dealers, Nader Bolour, the owner of Doris Leslie Blau, and David Amini, owner of Beauvais Carpets, will offer 1,000 new and antique rugs, starting at $700. A new Chinese-made Aubusson, 10 by 14 feet, formerly $6,600, is now $2,800. A 9-by-12-foot Heriz, woven in 1910 and formerly $16,000, will be $6,000. (The sale, at 969 Third Avenue, near 57th Street, will be held tomorrow and Sunday through Thursday; (212) 688-2229.)
The two dealers maintain that there is still a strong market for high-end rugs (over $50,000) but that they have a glut in the "midrange" (up to $30,000). 
Periodic "tent sales" at Bloomingdale's are also contributing to the downward pressure on prices. The store is advertising "thousands of handmade rugs" this month at discounts of 50 to 70 percent. 
"New rugs are our biggest competition," said Ellie Naja, a wholesaler who is consigning 300 old rugs to the ABC sale. "The new ones are unbelievable; sometimes we're confused ourselves." 
Many rug wholesalers operate in the style of an old-fashioned Mideastern carpet business, where prices are flexible. "Stack your rugs to the roof and let the customer choose," said Leslie Stroh, the editor of Rug News. At one showroom last week, a wholesaler sat alone amid carpets piled to the ceiling, with a humming tea kettle waiting to be pressed into service.
Dealers speak longingly of the 90's, when decorators and their clients shopped for patterns, not prices. During that era, a huge selection and a pot of tea were often enough to close a deal. But now, Mr. Stroh said, "the more rugs you have, the more dead inventory you have."
The desire to clean house reflects cultural changes as well. Owners of family businesses founded generations ago say their children, raised in the United States, are interested in other things. "I'm not a business-oriented person," said Mr. Soumekh's son Amir, 21. A senior at Columbia, Amir plans to attend the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in the fall. 
The Internet has modernized some aspects of the carpet business, especially among customers who like to use it for research. But selling expensive rugs is still largely an in-store experience. 
"We make very few sales over $2,000 on the Web," said Mr. Head of ABC, which sends digital images of rugs by e-mail to customers who like to get an idea of the selection. 
Internet aside, for many people, buying an antique Oriental carpet remains daunting, partly because it is difficult to judge claims, whether they involve the rug's quality, value or history.
Dealers clearly hope that by slashing prices they can stimulate a gambling spirit among those who have longed for a handwoven rug from another time and place and have simply been waiting for the right price.
It may be a great time to look, but in the words of Mr. Head, "bring your healthy dose of skepticism."

HEADLINE: Europeans Propose to End 'Open Skies' Deals 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The European Union moved today to strip its members of power to negotiate their own bilateral aviation agreements with outside nations and to replace those agreements with unionwide deals negotiated in Brussels.
 At the same time, the union's executive body, the European Commission, laid out a plan to reshape the airline industry on the Continent to make it easier for carriers to ally, merge or acquire one another and, the commission hopes, become more efficient and competitive. 
 The bilateral deals, known as "open skies" agreements, were thrown into doubt in November when the European Court of Justice ruled that eight of the agreements between member nations and the United States breached European Union law, because they gave national "flag" carriers an unfair advantage over rivals.
The commission said today that the court's ruling gave it the right to step in and formulate a unionwide policy, and it announced plans to negotiate a new unionwide agreement directly with the United States, the most important nonmember. 
"We will be able to ensure that the E.U. can finally pull together in this field and work to develop international air transport to the benefit of the industry and consumers," said Loyola de Palacio, the commissioner responsible for transportation.
The commission's plan would leave existing bilateral deals in place until they are replaced by unionwide agreements. Ms. de Palacio said that by clearing away the legal uncertainty surrounding the existing agreements, she hoped the commission would win rapid approval from member nations to begin talks with the United States, "our uppermost priority."
The national governments are expected to decide on the commission's plan by the end of June.
European airlines broadly welcomed the new proposals. "It's a step back from the more confrontational approach the commission took before," said David Henderson, spokesman for the Association of European Airlines. "The commission seems to accept the bilateral nature of many of these agreements, and the need to keep them in place for the time being." 
Even so, he said, the commission's proposals will have major ramifications for the industry, Mr. Henderson said.
One element in the proposal became inevitable after last November's court ruling: the scrapping of clauses in any bilateral agreements that grant automatic rights to fly certain routes to airlines designated as national flag carriers.
Analysts do not expect a sudden rush by the big national carriers to open routes on one anothers' traditional turfs -- say, Lufthansa flying trans-Atlantic routes out of Paris. That would probably be uneconomic in any case, said Nicholas van den Brul of BNP Paribas in London.
"Maybe the large European airlines could have one or two extra hubs for their long-haul flights," Mr. van den Brul said. "But a multihub arrangement doesn't really make sense." 
More likely, he said, would be mergers and combinations that would reshape the industry into a handful of large companies offering long-haul flights, and a second tier of short- and medium-haul carriers whose flights would feed passengers into the long-haul carriers' hubs. "If these proposals are adopted, it would make it easier for KLM to operate as a merger partner with British Airways or Air France," Mr. van den Brul said.
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is an example of a national carrier from a smaller nation with little domestic traffic. Such carriers have struggled in recent years, and a few, notably Sabena in Belgium, have collapsed. But efforts by KLM to team up with airlines from bigger nations have been hampered by the bilateral agreements, which restrict direct flights between the two nations to those nations' airlines. 
"This was one of the main reasons B.A. couldn't merge with KLM," Mr. van den Brul said -- the resulting airline would not qualify as Dutch-owned under the agreements.
The high costs and restricted routes of the traditional carriers have made it hard for them to compete with low-cost short-haul and medium-haul competitors like EasyJet and Ryanair, whose routes generally stay within the European Union, and several more of the old flag carriers are likely to shut down or be swallowed up, analysts said. But "not having so many flag carriers around doesn't automatically mean less choice," Mr. van den Brul said.

HEADLINE: MAKING AN ENTRANCE; 
High, Wide And Transomed

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
AVERAGE American house size: down four square feet. Average American front door size: up seven square feet.
 The new American home, which has billowed by 50 percent since 1970 to 2,320 square feet, deflated gently in 2002, for the first time in seven years, according to a Department of Commerce report released last week. 
 Contributing to the cool-down in big houses, builders say, was a wave of first-time owners, spurred by low interest rates, buying small starter homes, and high-end homeowners staying put and not trading up because of economic and homeland security issues .
But one feature of new houses stands tall, and taller -- wider, too. 
It's the front door. That's "entryway" to you. A kind of one-trick pony that even the family forgets to use (the bell rings, you open it) the front door is currently the ambitious focus of dimension, design and dollars in the construction industry.
Once the point of heartfelt and humble, hand-grasping welcome, where the doormat greeted you, too, the new "decorative entry system" says "Welcome" from about 500 yards, with what looks like a portal into another dimension, not the foyer.
In strong evidence at the International Builders Show in Las Vegas last month, the package includes doors at least 8 feet tall and 3 1/2 feet wide, in pairs, with sidelights or windows, and a transom window above that can be taller than the doors. St. Peter's gates would be a side entrance in this world.
"It's the 'wow' appeal," said Joe Pompei, the owner of Pompei & Company, an entryway retailer in Medford, Mass. "In the past you would have picked up a typical Home Depot-type catalog door. Now, people are going way beyond that. It's a style statement." 
Mr. Pompei has executed entryways that cost as much as $40,000, including a stained-glass job that replicated a client's favorite Paul Klee painting. Builders report that an entryway can now be 10 percent of a construction budget. "The house started with the doors," said Lynn Bachman of her new home in Eden Prairie, Minn. Ms. Bachman, a food stylist whose clients include Pillsbury and Land O' Lakes, chose a pair of 12-foot-tall mahogany doors from a catalog, and customized them with four different types of glass. "An entry is a statement of the person who lives there," she said. "You need to come to a point in your life when you're self-actualized, and can exemplify that in design." Ms. Bachman went through a bad divorce; the house was built with stock earnings from an investment in Pfizer, the drug maker.
"I have no experience with Viagra," she said. "But when it went up, the house went up."
Mike Threlkeld, the president of Volunteer Lumber Sales, a door vendor in Knoxville, Tenn., summarized the appeal of the new entryways his way.
"You can see them from the road," he said.
Gopal Ahluwalia, a spokesman for the National Association of Home Builders, explained that though only 9 percent of Americans have double-door front entries, the price of the project had risen, to within a range of $2,500 to $25,000.
"You can't show off the inside of the house," Mr. Ahluwalia said. "What is visible is more critical to the homeowner than anything else. You could put gold bars between the walls and it wouldn't matter." The momentary stalemate in the size of the average house reflects, in part, a changing homeowner "who is interested in other things -- more quality and amenity -- a switch from 'bigger is better,' " he added.
Custom entryway companies like Pinecrest in Minneapolis, which has built doors for Tom Cruise, Prince Charles, George Clooney and Ms. Bachman, are being joined in the market by major wood-door manufacturers like Stanley, Morgan and Therma-Tru of Maumee, Ohio. Therma-Tru, the country's largest producer and seller of residential doors (three million a year), is introducing premium fiberglass front door combinations in exotic wood patterns through vendors like the Home Depot and Lowe's to capitalize on the increasing interest in a showcase entrance.
In a home valuation study commissioned by Therma-Tru in 2002, respondents added an average of 6 percent to the asking price of a home with an "enhanced entryway." The company's new Classic Craft entries, priced at $1,200 to $3,500, are up to 40 percent more expensive than its medium-range models.
"We're seeing customer willingness to spend more," said Dan Templeton, a vice president of Therma-Tru. "The perceived percentage of return on the investment beats out kitchen and bath improvements."
The industry standard for a front door, which is 3 feet by 6 feet 8 inches, has been steadily eclipsed in the last five years by examples that are in many cases keeping up with the scale of houses, entry halls in particular.
"You go into large homes, open the door, and you might be looking at a 32-foot ceiling; it used to be rare that it was 10," said Russell H. Underdahl, chairman of Pinecrest, which is at work on 400 doors for a royal family that he would not name.
"We've done a lot of work for a lot of kings," said Lorie Ingram, a president at Pinecrest and Mr. Underdahl's daughter. (A man's house is his castle: standing record, Johnny Cash's door, carved with a banjo and guitar and glazed with jade, not glass.)
Cantera Doors, a wrought-metal entryway specialist in Austin, Tex., sells the Infinity, a popular double door that is 6 feet by 10 feet of laser-cut steel with an optional stained-glass detail. It looks like Jimmy Stewart's fever dream in "Vertigo," costs $12,000 and weighs roughly 1,000 pounds.
New bride advisory: if he's carrying you, you're going to have to help push, if not pay.
"We can go 13 feet tall and 18 feet wide, but not in a hurricane area," said Mauricio Trevino, Cantera's founder and president. The nine-year-old company, which manufactures its doors in Mexico, as many of the big-door makers do, has annual residential sales of $8 million.
Mr. Trevino also voiced the "wow" factor, separating the "wow" into two syllables, like reverb. 
Cantera sold a $6,600, 800-pound wrought-iron entry, the Theater, with sidelights and a transom, to Dr. Zack Hillel, a cardiac anesthesiologist, and his wife, Dr. Anna Hillel, for their new colonial-style house in the Bronx. The doors have a vine motif and together weigh roughly 300 pounds -- sturdy enough for Tarzan to commute on.
"The builder was pretty impressed," said Dr. Hillel, who worries that the doors, without a hydraulic brake, could be capable of on-the-spot amputations. "You don't want to throw it against anyone's hand -- there would be no fingers." But, he explained, "it has the visual impact we wanted it to have."
In the lower registers of new housing, distinctive entryways are popular with developers eager to ring quick changes on tract housing. "Builders differentiate box architecture with different doors," Mr. Threlkeld said. "The doors set each home apart." He added that entryways can live a life of their own, without regard to the rest of the house, like family prodigies. Say, Tuscany opening onto Craftsman.
"Let's just put it this way," he said. "We've sold doors where my personal taste didn't think the styleof the door suited the style of the house."
Entryways have also proved popular with remodelers, as front doors provide a double-edge face-off with neighbors, a jambing up with the Joneses. "Welcome to our (more impressive) home -- and how do you get into yours?"
"A lot of the entries I'm selling right now are people ripping out the junk and upgrading," said Mr. Pompei, who gets multiple assignments on single streets.
Robin Kopit, the founder of Extraordinary Doors in Santa Cruz, Calif., thinks the custom entry is an ambassador of goodwill. Mr. Kopit's average job is $8,000 to $10,000. He recently installed two 1,500-pound mahogany front doors with bronze grills, measuring 10 feet by 4 feet and 7 inches thick, for a couple in Los Altos, Calif. He executed something similar at the back of the house. The woodwork alone cost $80,000.
"My dad said, 'Did they really pay you that?' " Mr. Kopit said. "It's a little bit of showoff, but you walk through your door every day," he said. "It creates a positive wave in your day."
Make that a tsunami.

HEADLINE: A Japanese Theme Park Company Fails 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The Huis Ten Bosch Company, one of Japan's largest theme park operators, has declared bankruptcy, highlighting the mounting troubles in the country's vast government-financed recreation industry.
 The collapse of the company, with debt of 220 billion yen ($1.8 billion), is the latest evidence of the breakdown between local governments and Japan's commercial banks, which together helped build many parks in the 1980's and 1990's. 
 For years, local governments have pressed banks not to exit the projects, so lenders continued to funnel money into unprofitable businesses. The long decline in real estate prices and mounting nonperforming loans, however, have left many banks little choice but to exit these projects. 
Huis Ten Bosch, which means house in the forest in Dutch, was one of the largest such ventures. Opened in 1992, the park is modeled on the 17th-century Dutch enclave in Nagasaki and was financed largely by Mizuho Holdings Inc., Nagasaki Prefecture and a consortium of three dozen companies. Mizuho Holdings, Japan's largest bank by assets, may not recover the 102.3 billion yen it lent to Huis Ten Bosch, though it added that the potential loss should not affect its earnings.
The park's failure is the legacy of a government-led expansion into local areas. In the 1980's, lawmakers in Tokyo, eager to send money back to their home prefectures, urged banks and local governments to build resorts, golf courses and other recreational developments. Tokyo gave local governments extra handouts, and banks, assuming the projects had government guarantees, made additional loans.
Many projects, though, turned out to be white elephants based on optimistic assumptions about the economy, tourism and what Japanese consumers would pay for a vacation. When the asset-inflated economy of the 1980's ended, Japanese started cutting back on spending on nonessentials and seeking bargains rather than luxury. Attendance has fallen 7 percent since 1996, when the park attracted 3.8 million visitors.
At the same time, more Japanese were traveling overseas, particularly to the United States and other parts of Asia, as the cost of international air fares fell. A round-trip ticket from Tokyo to Los Angeles costs about as much as two nights at a Japanese hot spring. The long slide in land prices has also saddled many of the so-called third-sector companies, which are jointly held by local governments and private companies, with an estimated 10 trillion yen ($83 billion) in nonperforming assets.
With the economy showing few signs of life, more of these resorts are likely to fail under the weight of their debts in the coming years.
"In a deflationary environment, these parks can't survive," said Kunji Okue, an economist with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. "It's only a matter of time before more fail."
The collapse of Huis Ten Bosch comes two years after the Phoenix Resort Company went bankrupt, with 326 billion yen in debt. That company ran the Seagaia resort in Miyazaki Prefecture, also on the southern island of Kyushu. Both projects were extravagant. Seagaia, on the Pacific Coast, has golf courses and an indoor beach. Huis Ten Bosch has 4 hotels, 40 restaurants and 65 shops.
Both resorts were financed in part by large commercial banks. Most other projects, however, involve smaller regional banks that have closer ties to local governments. These banks are less able to handle losses stemming from a big bankruptcy and are being compelled not to abandon the resorts.
"Local governments are pressuring small banks to stay in the business even though they are not doing well," said Satoru Shinozuka, an analyst with Teikoku Databank, a private research company that tracks bankruptcies.
The failure of these theme parks represents an opportunity for some investors who want to overhaul the businesses. Seagaia was purchased by the American investment fund Ripplewood Holdings. Goldman, Sachs and others have bought up golf courses and hotels.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
First, a Moderate Advance; Then, Another Big Sell-Off

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors held to their pattern of retreating after even a moderate advance, sending shares sharply lower yesterday amid continuing concerns about Iraq. Hewlett-Packard's report of weaker-than-expected revenue contributed to the decline, which more than wiped out the previous session's gain. 
 The downturn was not surprising as sell-offs have been the norm for weeks. Analysts say stocks cannot be expected to move upward until it is clear whether there will be a war with Iraq. 
 "We are just sort of battening down the hatches and trying to figure out what is going to go on in the Middle East," said John C. Forelli, portfolio manager for Independence Investment in Boston. "The hope in the back of everyone's minds is there is a quick resolution and that businesses and consumers start spending again and give investors some faith in the market." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 102.52 points, or 1.3 percent, at 7,806.98, erasing Tuesday's gain of 51.26 points. It was the Dow's second triple-digit loss in three days, after Monday's decline of 159.87. 
The broader market also retreated. The Nasdaq index fell 25.30 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,303.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 11.02 points, or 1.3 percent, to 827.55. 
Selling has dominated Wall Street in 2003, with the only exception being a short-lived New Year's rally. Many analysts do not expect investors' mood to improve until there is a resolution regarding Iraq. 
"I have rarely seen this much pessimism not turn into a rally," said Mike Weiner, managing director of equities at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. "But it is just hard to be positive." 
Analysts said investors were still smarting from the bigger-than-expected drop in consumer confidence reported on Tuesday. Consumer confidence in February fell to its lowest level since October 1983. 
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that the plunge in confidence was "a very significant decline" but not a surprise. 
Disappointing earnings reports contributed to yesterday's slippage. Hewlett-Packard dropped $2.81, to $15.37, having reported quarterly earnings late Tuesday that met analysts' expectations but revenue that missed forecasts. 
Shares in Eaton Vance, the mutual fund and investment management company, declined 87 cents, to $25.23, after the company reported quarterly per share earnings that were 3 cents short of analysts' expectations. 
Gainers included the retailer Urban Outfitters, which rose $1.60, to $18.60, after its stock was upgraded to buy from neutral.

Treasury Prices Rise
(By Reuters) -- Treasury prices rose yesterday, as an auction of new short-term notes drew surprisingly strong demand. 
The $27 billion auction of two-year notes drew bids for two times the amount on offer. That demand came despite the notes going at 1.575 percent, the lowest yield ever in a two-year auction, beating the previous 1.71 percent.
The 10-year note increased 14/32, to a price of 100 28/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.77 percent from 3.82 percent. 
The 30-year bond increased 23/32, to 109 26/32. Its yield fell to 4.74 percent from 4.78 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
High Price: 99.853
High Yield: 1.575%
Low Yield: 1.500%
Median Yield: 1.540%
Accepted at low price: 90%
Total applied for: $62,214,019
Accepted: $35,332,941
Noncompetitive: $819,852
Interest set at: 1 1/2

The 2-year notes mature Feb. 28, 2005.

Perky, Blond and as Inescapable as Paying the Fare

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES 

 BODY:
TRUST someone to find a way to intrude on one of the few places left in New York where you can have an intellectual discussion with a stranger behind the wheel, and you get the idea behind putting televisions in taxis.
 Or, to steal the language from one company, TaxiVu, now shooting 28-minute segments for their taxi televisions, advertisers can deliver a "30-second commercial to a captive audience." 
 So now those heated discussions about a Sikh homeland, the perfidy of the Nigerian government, the best place to buy Egyptian falafel or tirades about the collapse of the Russian economy are being replaced with promos for restaurants, insurance firms, television shows and movies, and cheesy music. And, in a formula as old as television itself, a perky blond hostess with a thousand-watt grin and the enthusiasm of a Midwestern cheerleader will gush to us about the various ways we can spend our money. 
Berly Ellis, 27, whose glossy photo and resume assures her prospective employers that she is "a natural blonde," is the hostess for TaxiVu, a company that now has screens in 350 cabs, or perhaps 349, given that a cab flagged down on Sunday that carried the program did not have a working television screen. She is slowly working her way through the city's affluent neighborhoods, visiting this store and that shop, all the while insisting, although she is waiflike, how much she likes to eat. Indeed, the fact that she likes to eat has become something of the motif of the segments, all filmed in a day in places like Chelsea or the Upper West Side.
"By now you know how much I love to eat," she said in one segment, assuming that viewers have followed the previous segments.
Ms. Ellis is not a New Yorker. She grew up in Hershey, Pa. Her father, a jeweler, provides the jewelry she wears on the videos. Her name, Berly, is short for Kimberly. She majored at Pennsylvania State University in business and theater, with a minor in kinesiology, the branch of science that deals with the mechanics of human bodily movement, but which she said was the closest dance majors at her school could come to having a dance concentration.
"It was a mix of pre-med and dance," she said of her minor, seated in a restaurant in the Upper East Side sipping a glass of tap water.
She moved to Spanish Harlem, where she still lives with her roommate, also an aspiring actress, and has had a series of very minor roles. Her biggest moments of fame came as a student tutor, a nonspeaking part, in "A Beautiful Mind" and a role in a crowd scene in the movie "Liberty Heights."
"Ifyou squint your eyes really hard I think you can see my yellow beret in the ice skating scene," she said.
And then came TaxiVu -- not Hollywood, but for her a huge step up. She started to keep a file of all her friends who had seen her in a cab, "but then it got to be too many." She said some cabdrivers had waved to her and frequent cab riders had recognized her and called her the taxi girl.
She looks at the taped segments, which she calls episodes, as a public service.
"We promote businesses, restaurants, designers and musicians," she said, "all the things that make New York great."
She rarely gets more than two minutes on screen before being interrupted by a commercial, although it is hard to tell where the commercial ends and the show begins.
FOR example, on a backstage tour of the Loew's 34th Street Showplace she praises the marvels of the theater, assuring viewers that "with 18,000 watts of pure six-channel Surroundsound, the only thing that might compare to watching the film here is actually living the experience, but just barely."
The television screen starts as soon as the meter comes on. There is a mute button, but the picture cannot be turned off. When the 28-minute segment is finished the screen goes dead.
"You don't have to watch it again," she said.
The videos, which at times look a bit like home movies, do not pay the bills. She works as an events coordinator for a marketing firm. She works out in her home gym, and lists as her hobbies a variety of activities from figure skating and swing dance to studying "royal etiquette," helpful to an actress "for period pieces." She said she speaks some French, but added "now is not the best time in the world to practice French because people might throw things at you."
She objects to reality television, she said, "because it is not really good for families to watch."
She is as perky in person as she is in a cab. Her thin shoulders bob up and down. She pushes her blond hair behind her right ear. She frequently flashes her flawless smile. And she folds and unfolds her fingers, several covered with rings including a color-changing garnet. 
She reads fantasy books by Terry Goodkind, whom she calls "a phenomenal writer," although she also recently read a book on Islam by "two brothers from the Middle East."
"I chose to read it because it was authentic," she said.
But mostly life is about her dream of acting. And each new segment for TaxiVu, she hopes, will propel her into the world of theater and film.
"I want to do two films a year and two or three Off Broadway or Broadway plays a year," she said "like most actors."

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Moves to Raise Birth Rate and Draw Richer Immigrants 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Local leaders announced today that they would begin accepting immigrants based partly on their wealth and talents and would adjust tax policies to encourage families to have more babies.
 "We want to upgrade the quality of the population," said Donald Tsang, the administration's chief secretary. 
 The immigration and tax policies, similar to Singapore's, are part of a flurry of changes here as Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's chief executive, has pursued closer integration with mainland China in response to economic weakness here. 
Mr. Tung's administration introduced tough internal security legislation to Hong Kong's Legislative Council today, as planned, and announced on Tuesday that it would cut welfare benefits and civil servants' pay in response to the declining cost of living. 
Mr. Tsang, the second-highest official after Mr. Tung, said at a news conference that the government would also impose a tax of about $50 a month on employers of foreign domestic helpers. The minimum wage for such helpers would be reduced by an equal amount, to $420 a month, although some already earn considerably more than that. 
Hong Kong's population of 7 million includes nearly 240,000 foreign maids, mainly from the Philippines, and they are encountering resentment because of high unemployment among native-born residents. 
The proceeds from the tax are to be used for further training of the native-born. The financial penalty for employing foreigners may prompt some employers to hire Hong Kong citizens who can no longer find work because many factories have moved to the mainland.
Immigration policies have long been controversial here, especially the rate at which this former British colony, now a fairly autonomous Chinese territory, allows mainland residents to settle here permanently -- 150 a day, almost all spouses or children of current Hong Kong residents.
Despite this emphasis on the reunification of families, mainland residents can wait up to a decade for permission to move here. There has been heavy intermarriage across the border since Britain handed over Hong Kong to China in 1997.
Businesses have been frustrated that this makes it hard for them to transfer experienced professionals here if they are mainland citizens . Under the new rules that Mr. Tsang announced tonight, a new category will be created for mainland managers and professionals to move here.
Immigrants will also be allowed to settle here if they invest at least $833,000. But mainland citizens will be excluded from the program because China's currency is not fully convertible and because Beijing has been wary of letting Hong Kong turn into a tax haven for the wealthy. 
Singapore, Australia, Canada, Britain and other countries also have special immigration rules for people who invest large sums, and there have been periodic discussions in Washington over whether the United States should adopt that approach.
Mr. Tsang recommended that the government offer the same tax deductions for all children and end the current policy of offering smaller deductions for third and subsequent children. While Hong Kong remains one of the most crowded cities on earth, it has become concerned with a steep decline in its birth rate. On average, 10 women here give birth to a total of just 9 babies in their lifetimes, compared with the 21 babies that would typically be needed for a self-sustaining population.

New, Improved Hall Panel Elects No One

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
A revolutionary change in the Baseball Hall of Fame's veterans committee produced no new members of the Hall yesterday. The new, expanded committee elected no former players and no former managers, umpires or executives, including Marvin Miller, who had headed the players union.
 If anyone had been given a chance with the 85-man committee, which included 58 members of the Hall of Fame, it was Miller, who led the players to unparalleled freedom and economic gain as the union's executive director from 1966 to 1981. 
 Neither Miller nor any of the 40 others on the two ballots really came close to the 75 percent needed for election. The closest was Gil Hodges, who led the 26-player ballot with 50 of 81 votes, or 62 percent. Miller had 35 votes and needed 60 of 79 votes on the ballot in the composite category of former managers, umpires and executives. 
Joe Morgan, vice chairman of the Hall and a Hall of Fame second baseman during Miller's tenure as labor chief, said he thought Miller was going to be elected.
"There were players voting and Marvin Miller changed the landscape for players," Morgan said in a conference call with Hall of Fame officials. "I figured a lot of players would vote for him. I'm shocked that his total wasn't higher than it was." 
When it was suggested to Miller on his own conference call that his chances of election would grow as recent players gain admission to the Hall and vote on the veterans committee, he said: "In a month I'll be 86. Under present rules there will not be another election for four years. Don't count on it."
Of the 15 candidates on the composite ballot, the longtime National League umpire Doug Harvey was the surprising leading vote-getter with 48 votes, or 61 percent, but he fell 12 votes short of the required 60. Walter O'Malley, who took the Dodgers out of Brooklyn to Los Angeles and opened the entire country to baseball, was next with 38 votes, or 48 percent. Miller was third with 35 votes, or 44 percent.
Hodges, the former Dodgers first baseman and Mets manager, was followed on the players' ballot by Tony Oliva with 48 votes (59 percent), Ron Santo with 46 votes (57 percent) and Joe Torre with 29 votes (36 percent).
Some people thought Torre's success in recent years as the Yankees' manager would enhance his chances of election, but he did not get even half of the 61 votes needed.
"It should be hard to make it to the Hall of Fame," Torre said at the Yankees' spring training camp in Tampa, Fla. "It's a special place for those reasons, and I think the committee, made up the way it is, they certainly are not going to be easy about letting people in because they know how hard it was to get there."
Morgan echoed that view. "I think a lot of players did look at it that way," he said. "Did this guy deserve to be in Cooperstown with the other immortals? That's the way to judge them."
Torre, an active union member when he played, also said he would like to have seen some candidates make it, Miller first and foremost.
Of the 53 Hall of Fame players on the committee, 41 played during Miller's tenure as the head of the union. But not all of those 41 players voted for Miller. In fact, at least 10 most likely did not.
The committee, which replaced the old 15-member veterans committee, was made up of 58 Hall of Famers, 25 writers and broadcasters who won awards linked to the Hall and two members of the old committee whose terms have not expired.
The Hall of Fame overhauled the veterans' voting because the old committee had encountered charges of cronyism. Much work went into the change, and Hall of Fame officials expected at least some candidates to be elected.
Miller had been ignored by the old committee and was given a strong chance for election once his name was placed on the ballot.
"It seems to me they may have to go back to the drawing board with their procedure," Miller said in a telephone interview immediately after the results were announced. "It's not just that they elected nobody; the old veterans committee did that once or twice. But if you make a big fanfare of having a new, better procedure and end up with zero people, I think you better go back to the drawing board. 
"If you're going to have zero people, you don't need the procedure," Miller added. "To me, that would mean the next time they have an election like this, it should only be among the people who didn't appear on this ballot. It's ridiculous to say let's do this again for the people who have been retired for many years and failed to get the necessary votes."
Hall of Fame officials rejected the idea that it makes no sense to repeat the procedure in two years for the players and four years for the managers, umpires and executives.
"I think we need at least one more election before we see where we go," said Jane Forbes Clark, the Hall's chairwoman.
Morgan likened this election to the experience some players have in the Baseball Writers Association balloting. Players are eligible for that ballot for 15 years, beginning five years after they retire.
"If a guy doesn't get voted in the first round, it doesn't mean he's not going to be voted in," Morgan said. "You have to give the process a chance.
"This was the committee's first time at bat," Morgan added. "We have to give them another at-bat, one more shot. If nothing happens two years from now, I think I'll have something to say."
But Morgan offered another thought. 
"Maybe not as many people fell through the cracks as people think," he said, alluding to the baseball writers' ballot. "We think there have been some, but maybe there haven't been any. Maybe the writers have done a pretty good job."
